    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eGreetings! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is \u003cstrong\u003eSally\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003eI spend most of my time finding the stories God tells in nature, and then writing them down for others to read. I am passionate about handmade life, environmental stewardship and ecology, history and its characters, folktales and whimsy, and being a student of both Creator and creation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of these passions shape the stories I tell.\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are here, it is likely that you have read either my short-form essays on nature and faith on my \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wildrootandparable/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e, or you are a reader of my weekly devotional blog, \u003ca href=\"https://wildrootandparable.wordpress.com/\"\u003eWildroot \u0026amp; Parable\u003c/a\u003e. Either way, if you have read my work, you are part of making this particular storyteller\u0027s dream come true, and for that I thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut why Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Fan-Based Community\u003c/strong\u003e: One thing I love about social media is getting instant feedback from readers about what they like and what they feel ambivalent about. I see Patreon as a way to get even more, and more practical, feedback. What people will contribute to says a lot about what they value. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Daily Support:\u003c/strong\u003e I work a fairly low-income day job as a special needs educator for two reasons. One, because I love it. And two, because the schedule allows me time to write. But my budget has very, very little wiggle room, and financial worries often get in the way of my creativity. I have always wanted to make a living as a writer, and Patreon is a way to do that without resorting to ads, which I believe hurt the integrity of my particular content. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. An Eventual Book:\u003c/strong\u003e The Big Goal, the endgame, the whatever-you-want-to-call-it, is to write and publish my first book. By contributing to my Patreon campaign, you not only make that possible, but you are able to have a say in what kind of book you are looking for from me! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, how will it work?\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s quite simple...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBy contributing as low as $2 per month or as high as whatever-you-like per month to my campaign, you become a Patron!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEvery Wednesday, I will update my Patreon page with Patron-only content that no one else gets to see, including short essays, poetry, behind-the-scenes tips and tricks, writing advice, unreleased nature-based photography, and more!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAs my goals are reached and the \u003cstrong\u003eBook\u003c/strong\u003e becomes a more realistic project, you will be able to read chapters and get behind-the-scenes sneakpeeks that no one else will see.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you can join me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThank you for taking the time to read my work. \u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t wait to share my stories with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlessings, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSally \u003cbr\u003e"
