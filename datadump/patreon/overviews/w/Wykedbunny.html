As a young girl, I\u0027ve always enjoyed drawing, and making up my own characters based on different cartoon shows. But it wasn\u0027t until I saw \u0027Clint Eastwood\u0027 by the Gorillaz for the first time ever, that I realized what my true purpose in life was: to be the most original, weird and amazing creator that I can be. On this very day, I had finally received my cutie mark! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is your goal on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo pretty much make a living creating art people love and enjoy the unusual and cutesy, while I focus on self-discovery without worrying about how rent will be paid. For now though, my current goal is to finish my forever standing graphic novel \u0027AwaBerry\u0027, and rewriting some very old stories and turning them into comics. If I had the time, and enough funds to take time off work - or even quit, I can focus my energy on much more significant purposes, and finish up the first volume of AwaBerry a lot quicker than I would in my current state of progress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also struggled with staying motivated due to my chronic worrying and energy being \u003cdel\u003estolen\u003c/del\u003e focused\u00a0on my day job, and have only managed to complete Chapter 2 of Volume One because it was a class project from a year ago. AwaBerry has been on hiatus ever since.\u00a0(yeah, yeah. I\u0027ll take my blankie and my nappy time now) I turned to Patreon as a source of motivation; if people could fund my comic, it would give me reason to prioritize it, push through it and finish it. It would also make for a new experience, since I\u0027ve never done this sort of thing before (the whole \u0027asking people to pay me to work on something\u0027 bizz). Of course, moral support (like, share, etc) is just as valuable!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you get in return for supporting the Bunny Queen?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from exclusive content from AwaBerry, there are other projects that I\u0027m dying to start working on. For example, I have a few more comic ideas in mind, and a bunch of projects that I\u0027m hoping could change lives. Hopefully with your support, I can begin to work on them in between AwaBerry, so that I can bring you original, quality pieces and stories. :) If things go well, you\u0027ll have the honor of owning some of my work, and maybe even a hardcopy of AwaBerry, once it\u0027s completed! Aside from that, you\u0027ll also have my rendition of popular fandoms, possibly some cute little charms handmade with love, and a clip of my journey as an artist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConclusion:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m no professional. However every time I draw, I strive to improve and make the next piece better than the last. I do hope that my work has some positive impact on your life, big or small, and that I have the opportunity to finally reach my ultimate goal - no matter how long it takes, while making you pleasantly content during the process. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
