    "summary": "Everyone\u0027s been telling me for years that I should write. I did for a bit, some people liked it, some didn\u0027t. I fell off for a while and haven\u0027t been working the muscles as I should. Either life got in the way, I got distracted, I just stopped caring, or even all of the above at times. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven just doing morning pages became a chore. A point came where I just didn\u0027t want it anymore, and that was stupid. I still had a lot of family, friends, friends of friends, and total strangers who liked what I did and were bummed to see me drop out of it. Instead, I kept all of the shit in my head and it started to drag me down even further.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo basically I\u0027m keeping this to get back up to speed, give myself some accountability, and maybe even pay a bill or two along the way. If you like it, good. If you don\u0027t, fine, whatever. I\u0027m not gonna Kevin Smith it and say that \"it\u0027s not for you\" when it comes to criticism, because I want criticism. That\u0027s sort of what I miss about my creative writing classes. I hate that I lost all the work I did for those because I got a lot of good feedback and my professors told me that I should try submitting some stuff for publication - never did it. My fear of failure kept me from even trying.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIdeally it\u0027ll be a range of content for right now. Mostly short stories, probably a few essays, some anecdotes, etc. Some humorous, some not. If you like something, share, donate, whatever. My ultimate goal is to either put together a collection of things or finally get started on writing an actual book, which is what people keep telling me to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that\u0027s that. Thanks for reading this, and hopefully you\u0027ll read more as it comes down the pipeline."
