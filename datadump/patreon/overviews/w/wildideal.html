    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy name is Holly, and I am a Seattle-based photographer creating fine art portraits on medium-format film. My\u00a0intention is to produce powerful images that positively impact the lives of my subjects as well as onlookers of my work.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work revolves around body positivity, sex positivity, self-love, and inclusiveness. Every body deserves to be photographed, and every person has a right to feel beautiful and visible in society. An important part of what I do is that when choosing a model/subject for my shoots, I actively seek out types of folks who are ignored by popular photography and the media. There is a huge lack of representation in those areas, and I am committed to changing that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/wildideal\"\u003eClick here to get a taste of my work.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy become a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been obsessed with photography since I was 8 years old, and once I grew up I worked as a professional photographer for a long time, freelancing to pay the bills. During that time, my creativity was at an all-time low, and for the first time in my life, photography wasn\u0027t an expression of joy and fulfillment for me. As a result, I now freelance less, and instead I\u0027m creating the work that really matters to me. My goal is to create for Patreon full-time, and every contribution brings me a little closer to that amazing dream. Because of your pledges, I feel like a real artist!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get in return?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a thank-you for your pledge, I am excited to share with you exclusive patron-only content and rewards. This is the only place you can see my whole body of work; I\u00a0post my full galleries here on Patreon exclusively, along with behind-the-scenes photos and experimental projects. I also offer a quarterly zine of my work, which is 100% handmade by me and features removable prints of my images. I am always coming up with new perks, so be sure to check back in regularly!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecause of your support, I am able to keep making art that celebrates the human experience in all its forms. Thank you!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith love,\u003cbr\u003eHolly\u003c/div\u003e"
