I love to draw using ink pens, pencils, and markers. Sometimes I draw cute \"poop\" characters with funny captions too. I also love to sew bags and crop tops. I create some digital images using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to check out some of my previous artwork and pictures on:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wenjuice/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/wenjuice\u003c/a\u003e and/or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wenjuiceee\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/wenjuiceee\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.wenjuice.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/helpers1-03.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born in Taiwan and moved to Miami, FL, when I was 10 years old. I have always doodled when I was a kid and loved creating all sorts of art. I was never really good at Science, Mathematics, History, and I was not talented at studying. I would always doze off or fall asleep in those classes no matter how hard I tried to stay up. But when it came to anything art related, I was ecstatic and eager to be creative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor high school, I attended MAST Academy in Key Biscayne, and then proceeded to study at Florida International University. I graduated with Bachelor of Fine Arts in Fall of 2011. I did not learn how to make money as an artist from school, so I tried to learn from selling my artwork at events in person and other jobs.\u00a0I worked at different jobs to make ends meet, mostly serving in restaurants such as Clevelander and Benihana. Finally, in 2015, I decided to try pursuing my art career full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.wenjuice.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_0577.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere has been a lot of ups and downs. Events, shows, and conventions are always hit or miss. I never really know if people would buy my artwork or not. I started off with drawing anything my heart desires to trying to create what I think people will buy most of the time. And sometimes what I think people will buy ends up not working out. But, I have made great connections and networked with people. It has also allowed me to gain more followers on social media, such as Instagram and Facebook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople say that some entrepreneurs are crazy, that they avoid 9-5 jobs but will work 60 hours or more per week getting paid less. It\u0027s true. I feel like my brain never turns off. I am always constantly thinking about art, ideas, inspirations, and more.\u00a0There\u0027s a saying that if you have a skill or talent, continue to nurture it and grow.\u00a0There was this article that I read a while ago that talked about talents meaning nothing as long as you do not cultivate the skill to back them up.\u00a0I am not making much (yet), but I am trying my best.\u00a0I could get a job again, serving--since it\u0027s one of the most flexible jobs out there and I\u0027ve applied already to a few places--but I love to create artwork and will do whatever it takes to make that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.wenjuice.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_0734.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided to give Patreon a try, see how this will work out. I don\u0027t want to give up. I want to show fellow artists, emerging artists, and art students, that it\u0027s possible to become an artist with an income instead of becoming a starving artist.\u00a0I want to create artwork because of what I\u0027d like to create instead of worrying about and making what I think will sell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you become a patron, not only will you be supporting my artwork, you will also be helping me mentally and physically. What I mean by that is, with your support,\u00a0I will not have to worry as much about not having food to eat, not having a place to live, and more. You will be helping me pursue my dream and allow me to create any artwork. I am open to your ideas of what to create, so feel free to post on the Feed or message me with your suggestions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.wenjuice.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Length-of-Time-2013.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a link to an article that was written about me from my university:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://cartanews.fiu.edu/alumni-spotlight-wen-ju-chien-bfa-11-goes-against-the-odds-to-fulfill-her-dream/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://cartanews.fiu.edu/alumni-spotlight-wen-ju-c...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much sincerely for coming to my Patreon page :3!"
