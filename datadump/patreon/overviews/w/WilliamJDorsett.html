     "description": "This is the goal I potentially need to create a video series / and companion book about fighting for your rights as an artist and a busker in the United States.\u00a0 I have been fighting for 1st amendment rights that are applied to artists and street performers, for over 13 years. By helping me reach this goal I will be able to create a documentary that explains the rights of artists and buskers as well as how to defend yourself against arbitrary laws concerning busking in the U.S.\u00a0 I want to not only create a video, but companion book as well. I want to show the federal and state laws, and how they protect busking. as well as show how to locate city municipal codes and find ways to apply the federal laws to protect against municipal codes. I also want to speak with civil rights lawyers, buskers who have won cases, and have a list of the various forms of busking that is protected, and express why each of these things are protected. I believe this would be something that would be a great help to buskers all over the US. In the mean time I will be uploading videos from my YouTube page, showing my multiple forms of busking as well as the many times I have dealt with police officers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
