    "summary": "After years of creating entertainment together, we were\nreborn in 2016 as Easy Allies. Thanks to the overwhelming generosity of our\npatrons, we\u2019ve been able to continue creating the kinds of videos we love to\nmake with more freedom than ever before. We produce a wide range of content.\nThere are lengthy podcasts, succinct reviews, and livestreams that go for hours\non end. We detail gaming history through retrospectives, examine gaming\nmysteries, get together for role-playing sessions, and do so much more. Most of\nwhat we produce is focused on video games, although at times other passions\nlike movies and anime rise to the surface as well. Patreon is the primary\nengine that keeps all this running, so if you enjoy our shows and want to see\nus make more, this is the place to support us.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIndividually, we are Brandon Jones, Daniel\nBloodworth, Kyle Bosman, Mike Huber, Ian Hinck, Ben Moore, Brad Ellis, Don\nCasanova, and Michael Damiani. As the name Easy Allies implies, we want to work\nwith others and interact with our community. Your donations will go directly\ninto making our stuff bigger and better, along with giving you early or\nexclusive access to shows. You might get a question answered, a comment\nhighlighted, or a starring role in one of our ongoing series.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur milestone goals represent our current production\ncapabilities, all thanks to the generosity of our patrons. As support\nincreases, we plan to attend more events, hold more meetups, and one day, we\nhope to get our own studio to really make everything shine.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHuber\nSyndrome -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e$4,000 per month\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTabletop\nEscapades -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e$6,000 per month\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eEasy\nUpdate -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e$8,000 per month\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFrame\nTrap -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e$10,000 per month\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eReviews -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e$15,000 per month\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eGame\nSleuth -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e$20,000 per month\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eRetrospectives\n-\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e$30,000 per month\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eReaction Shots AND Friend Code -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e$40,000 per month\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSpoiler Mode - \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e$42,000 per month\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrailer\nJones\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e$44,000 per month\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTop Tens - \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e$46,000 per month\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA New\nStudio -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e$50,000 per month\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEasy Allies does not employ most of us full time\nyet, but its size and reach is completely up to you.
