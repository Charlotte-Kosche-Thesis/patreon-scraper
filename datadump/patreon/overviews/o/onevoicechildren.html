We are the One Voice Children\u2019s Choir and we love to\nmake music. We have 150 super-talented children ages 5 to 18 who reside along\nthe Wasatch Front in northern Utah. As a non-profit organization we depend on\nyou to help us share our talents and uplifting messages with the world. We\nstarted as a children\u2019s choir for the 2002 Winter Olympics and loved our\ndirector Masa Fukuda so much we continued to sing together until we became the\nOne Voice Children\u2019s Choir in 2005. All of our music is either written or\narranged by the amazing Masa! In 2014 we wowed the YouTube world with a cover\nof \u201cLet It Go\u201d with Alex Boye; it is approaching 100 million views! That same\nyear we won a spot on the live quarter-final round of America\u2019s Got Talent. In\nJune 2017 we represented the U.S. at the 72nd D-Day Commemoration in Normandy,\nFrance. We love to inspire others through our performances. We also produce\nvideos to help our value-oriented music reach the world. We now have 30 you can\nenjoy.

With your support each\nchild can continue to participate in amazing videos where they can shine. Your\nmoney will go toward new arrangements, video production and editing, sound,\nlighting, costumes, and everything else that goes into the music videos you\nhave come to love and look forward to\u2026and we will be able to create more. \u00a0We release videos approximately every six to eight weeks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommon Questions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars?\u003c/strong\u003e NO - Pay in any currency!
