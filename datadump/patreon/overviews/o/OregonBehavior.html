As you know, our videos are currently available to the public, and are often most needed in situations where people cannot afford to pay. Making video takes a tremendous amount of time and money, and by signing up to support OBC through Patreon, you can help be a part of the effort to keep these resources coming to everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support may come with a few perks! Take a look at the description of each level of support to see what comes with it. I am extremely thankful and humbled by the support I have been given so far. Thank you so much for considering a monthly pledge to our efforts! We hope to continue to improve the videos and expand into other projects--as a patron, you\u0027ll be the first to know!"
