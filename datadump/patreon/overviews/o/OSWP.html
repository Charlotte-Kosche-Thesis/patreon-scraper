    "summary": "I\u0027ve joked several times on the show that we didn\u0027t have a Patreon because for whatever reason it seemed silly in the past but here I am writing the introduction to the Old School Wrestling Podcast Patreon page. In talking with an old friend, he convinced me that some people just like to contribute this way to things they enjoyed. It made sense, so I figured I\u0027d make this another option to the listeners of the Old School Wrestling Podcast who wanted to contribute to our show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Old School Wrestling Podcast is a project of myself and my old college buddy, Dre. We met in 1998, bonded over professional wrestling in the height of the Monday Night wrestling wars, watching numerous PPVs in our college apartments, switching back and forth between RAW and Nitro on Monday nights, and traveling to see some amazing wrestling shows like ECW Anarchy Rulz and the classic Brian Pillman Tribute Shows the year after he passed away. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs time went on, our love for wrestling never faded and then in the summer of 2009, Dre called me up and said \"Hey, what do you think of doing an old school WRESTLING PODCAST?\" After initially asking ourselves, \"would anyone actually listen?\" we gave it a shot when there really weren\u0027t a lot of podcasts out there. Honestly, I still ask myself, \"will anyone actually listen?,\" but as Dre and I have gotten together pretty much every two weeks since that day in 2009 to put together an episode of the OSWP, we have found there are so many other like-minded wrestling fans out there, that enjoy professional wrestling, love talking about it, and enjoy what we do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for checking out our Patreon page. If you listen and want to contribute financially - THANK YOU. It will help. It will pay for the basic things like our web hosting services, but it might also help us develop other great things that we\u0027ve put out over the years like the OSWP 500 book, t-shirts, calendars, and so on. And, hey, if no one contributes, chances are we\u0027ll just keep doing the show because really, we do the OSWP because we love doing it. Thanks for reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll see you...at the matches, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlack Cat \u003cbr\u003e"
