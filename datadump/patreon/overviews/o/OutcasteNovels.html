I have been working on the world of Outcaste for over a decade, and I am finally at the point where I wish to actually put it before people. I wish to tell them stories based in this world I have spent ten years perfecting, and Patreon seems to be the best way to achieve this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/dwQNNF/What_is_Outcaste.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOutcaste is a series of stories set in the same world across different ages, where we follow the rise and fall of great empires and small micro-nations. We traverse the eras of mythical monsters to all encompassing industry, watching the world through the eyes of those on the edge of society; freaks, mercenaries, rebels, vagabonds and the dispossessed. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first novel (Outcaste: Age of the Regent) is set in the nation of Trinima and follows a young woman called Lynda Marker; she has returned home after the assassination of the nation\u0027s Regent to find the world a much harder place for her and those like her; the unusual. As she is a snow coloured giant she faces various challenges that she must overcome as she tries to figure out if she should get involved, or stand back and let the world roll over her. We follow her and her adoptive brother, Alexander Clark, as they try to live and get by as the nation gears towards something sinister, and everywhere they turn there seems to be an enemy waiting to pounce and secrets just out of reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be other short stories, set in the decades and centuries before the Age of the Regent, as well as those after the Age of the Regent has passed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/hKZJUv/Anything_Else.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell I also intend to put up other short stories or novellas based on other ideas outside the Outcaste brand, as well as sketches, inked images and digital colouring (including but not limited to Desktop backgrounds, mock covers) and anything else I think would be a welcomed addition to the page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u0027re willing, please join myself and my characters in a broken world of desperation, rebellion, murder, adventure and more as I tell their stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank-you, and have a great day!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Andy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
