    "summary": "My journey in fragrance is an amazing one. It all began with a spell. I was mourning the end of my marriage, and bestie Flavia was feeling less than prosperous. It was last June, early evening when the air was still hot and sticky and both of us were moving slow because of the heat. Out of the blue she asked me, \u201cCan any of your tricks fix us?\u201d For a moment, I had to wonder, \u201cwhich of my old tricks could help us?\u201d When she saw my blank stare, she said, \u201cSpell, Stuart. Do you have a spell that could fix us?\u201d The look of relief on my face must have been obvious when I said, \u201cOh. Witch-trick. Not which \u2018trick\u2019!\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, it was that kind of day. As a practicing witch for four decades (my first spell being an attempt to raise the dead at age 11), I had more tricks in my spell-book than a prostitute; but as a former fetish worker (a career I ended in my 20s, thank you very much), I did have those kinds of tricks, too. I remember telling her, \u201cI can conjure up something!\u201d That night, I was hard at work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome spells are pure genius. Some are works of art. And sometimes, the genius that fuels magick is a piece of fucking art. That\u2019s exactly what I conjured that night, and life changed for both of us. Things moved so quickly that for a day, \u201cI\u201d thought I messed up the spell. But a few days later, things settled for us.  A $10,000, museum quality quartz cluster fell into my lap for a mere fraction of its worth. A weekend of exotic dancing netted her $8,000. Crazy coincidences kept coming from nowhere. Job losses, new boyfriends, some crazy brainstorming, and a plunge into the unknown soon followed. Neither of us knew what we wanted, but we both loved what we got. Somewhere in all of that, Lele\u2019s was born. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt had to be the witchcraft, because I had no money and no business knowledge (and I\u2019m a bit short on business sense as well). What I did have was a recipe book full of what I term \u201cheirloom magick\u201d and a lifetime spent working with magick and spells. I also had $1,250.00 in my pocket; and I threw that money and my caution to the wind, starting a magickal house of fragrance. Keep in mind that when I left a comfortable life in Orlando, Florida, to become a full-time RVr in California, my family, friends, and readers thought I\u2019d cracked my cauldron (and in hindsight, I had); but when I started my business venture out of that same RV, they knew my cauldron was cracked, crusted, and rusted. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho could blame them? In my defense \u2013 I had none. Insanity and genius are often mistaken for each other, as are the qualities of impulsiveness and determination. Was it insane of me to trust the universe and act impulsively? It was. But do I always land on my feet? I do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy small investment tripled itself my first month, and I\u2019ve been in the black since the beginning. Like I wrote earlier, it had to be the witchcraft, because except for the magick, I still have no idea what I\u2019m doing. Thankfully, Flavia is coming on board to manage Lele\u2019s financial side, so I can focus on what I do best: magick and making magickal compounds. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u2019m grateful for everyone\u2019s support on this crazy journey of mine. And I\u2019d like to thank you, all of you, for joining me. Most of you know little about witchcraft, and that\u2019s okay, because I know nothing about running a business. We are meant for each other! This is a very special project, and we are all very special people making a whole lot of magick. At Lele\u2019s, you\u2019ll soon discover that magick like this magick, our collective magick, it\u2019s normal. And our normal will never be boring. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to the magickal world. Welcome to Lele\u2019s, where magick is normal, and normal is never boring! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Her goal was to create an oil-based perfume that would help the client to rise in life. She wanted something whose purpose was grand, a magickal fragrance to facilitate evolution. By 1982, she found a nine-note combination that satisfied her; and, curiously, it held onto the sparkling citrus notes for almost six hours (unheard of in natural perfumery) The citrus did weaken as the aroma developed on one\u2019s skin, but it never died until the dry down into the base notes began. While most of her best work was done with a standard 30/50/20 blend and no less than 12 notes per fragrance, Ascension was different. There were nine notes in the bouquet, not 12, and only one essential oil built up the heart. The focus was on the top notes; and my research into the essential oils unveiled an interesting point: both the base and the heart of the fragrance contained oils that were fixatives, natural plant chemicals that held on tightly to the other fragrant notes. Her balance within the aroma scale was 35% base,10% heart, and 55% top.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to finish her work, and with her notes, took a cue from \u201cLaw of Attraction\u201d to add another element of magick to the perfume. I added lodestone, a mineral ally that draws pretty much whatever we need to get by in life. The intention behind it was to help the client attract the tools and people he needed to evolve and meet his life\u2019s goals. And then I read her note on the page: \u201cThis formula is like liquid gold, or sunshine made liquid.\u201d On a whim, I added gold to it. While 24K gold leaf has no scent, after the gold was mixed with the final product something happened to the fragrance. It mellowed in scent but strengthened in power. It was as if I\u2019d reworked her blend completely, but in truth all I did was add . . . gold. Before long I noticed that the formula had a life of its own, and I decided to draw on one other element of magick: actually awakening and baptizing the lodestones so that they became sort of a guiding \u201cmind\u201d behind the fragrance; and, indeed, Ascension has a life of its own, the fragrance \u201cworking\u201d for everyone who uses and wears it, but evolving with its owner to become something fragrantly unique, no two wearers smelling alike.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAscension is light, thick, overpowering, subtle, citrusy, sweet, spicy, dark, mysterious: all these contradicting words have been used to describe it, but no matter who uses it, all agree the magick was enough to help begin their evolution in life. It gave then the power, the confidence, and the push needed so they could move up an ahead fearlessly. It\u2019s yet another unique, magickal fragrance from Lele\u2019s.
