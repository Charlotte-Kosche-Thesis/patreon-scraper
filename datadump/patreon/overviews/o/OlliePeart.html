    "summary": "First of all, welcome to my Patreon and thanks for being here. My name is Ollie Peart, I am a writer, presenter and podcaster based in Dorset in the U.K. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is #InterTrash (and yes, the # is intentional). #InterTrash is a web series for people like me, 30 somethings who think they know what is happening on the Internet but literally have no fucking idea. For people who, despite that, still love to delve deep into everything it has to offer, marvel at it endlessly for hours and hours on end until they finally ask, \"Why?\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut this isn\u0027t about why, this is about what! The aim of #InterTrash is to bring you the very best stories, news, MEME\u0027s, posts, pictures, videos, GIFs, threads and other digital tripe straight to your face. We\u0027ll find interesting Internet people doing Internet things that may or may not have anything to do with the Internet. We will even try and talk to some of them, in actual real life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why Patreon? Simple really. The internet is about community and I want to build one around this idea. I want a group of people just like you to gather round me, support me, and help make this grow into something better than I alone could achieve. I welcome ideas, suggestions and creative input from all Patreons, so, what are waiting for. Fire up that modem and let\u0027s fucking do this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOllie"
