    "summary": "My name is Oz and I have lived in Japan on and off for 10 years. I have lived in a variety of places across Japan from Hokkaido to Nagoya and now in Chiba. \u003cbr\u003eI have also been teaching English and have taught students of all ages from infant to retired seniors in public and private school settings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last 8 years I have been making YouTube videos. It started out as a hobby to help me learn Japanese, share my experiences and encourage others to visit Japan. But after 8 years, 500+ videos, 4 million+ views and 17 thousand+ subscribers I have realized that more than a hobby this is what I like and want to do for life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy videos range from life stories of Japan, Japanese learning videos, restaurant and event reviews, food and culture as well as popular culture and entertainment news. Every video I make though has a common theme. It involves some kind of joke or gimmick to make people laugh. Whether introducing a part of Japan or talking about important cultural differences I always aim to use humor to help people understand this country and it\u0027s customs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, to improve my video quality, increase my availability for filming opportunities and to expand my editing and filming skills I need more time and better equipment and software.\u003cbr\u003eWhat you will be helping me achieve is to grow my channel, refine my video quality and in turn increase my viewership and audience so I can show people around the world things they never knew existed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to keep my videos positive but realistic and am always looking to meet new people and see new places! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help and support I hope I can accomplish these goals.\u003cbr\u003e"
