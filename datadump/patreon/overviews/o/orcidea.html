Whether you decide to support me or not, I\u0027m happy that you\u0027re visiting here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat \u0026amp; why:\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve been creating video game tutorials and guides in Youtube from late 2008. Main games on my channel in\u00a0chronological order are Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Fallout 4 and Assassin\u0027s Creed: Origins. I\u0027ve also uploaded many random gameplay videos and some other goofy gaming stuff along the years. Currently above 135,000 subs and over 57 million views in total gained during the years.\u003cbr\u003e\nCreating Youtube content has always been a passionate hobby of mine, something that I very much would like to continue to do \u0027till the end of times. However, Youtube as a platform is very unstable and unpredictable, where the recent \"adpocalypse\" stands as a perfect example of this. \u003cstrong\u003eFor me, about 50% of all revenue is missing now from Youtube, and the future of the channel is currently very uncertain.\u003c/strong\u003e Here comes the possibilities Patreon offers: direct support from my viewers, support that can make a huge difference! If you like my Youtube content, and would like to see my channel active in the future as well, please consider supporting the channel here. Any support will help a lot!\u003cbr\u003e\nMy channel link:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Orcidea/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e"

I love making straight-to-the-point tutorials without annoying voice-overs. I do not belive that a game tutorial requires any kind of voice commentary, since the video is supposed to be more about the game itself, not about the content creator per se. Therefore, I\u0027m not a Youtube personality, I\u0027m a Youtube gamer :)",
