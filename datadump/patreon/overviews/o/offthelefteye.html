     "about": "offTheLeftEye is a YouTube channel with a spiritual reality show at its core and a universal message of goodwill for all viewers. Creator, producer, and host Curtis Childs started the channel in 2010 to find out if the divinely inspired philosophies of eighteenth-century scientist and spiritual teacher Emanuel Swedenborg would resonate with a twenty-first-century audience. He first produced a series of short videos that laid the groundwork for the channel\u2019s extensive body of content. In 2012, he joined the Swedenborg Foundation, a non-profit educational organization, because of their mutual interest in sharing Swedenborg\u2019s altruistic views with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014, Childs and a team of writers, digital artists, and videographers on a quest to become \u201cspiritual physicists\u201d set off to create a video series that would become their flagship program\u2014\"Swedenborg and Life\". The weekly webcast seeks to explore and unite what is often separated in fields of study and in humanity: mind and soul, love and wisdom, thoughts and actions. They accomplish this multi-part endeavor by balancing faith-based concepts with evidence-based research with the help of subject experts such as best-selling author of Life After Life, Dr. Raymond Moody, as well as accomplished scientists, psychologists, and theological scholars. This diverse group of contributors lends a depth of perspective when the show tackles intense questions about God and life that organized religions often ignore or struggle to explain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the show\u0027s inception, hundreds of episodes have been broadcast every Monday at 8:00 p.m. ET from a production studio in Montgomery County, PA--and is now co-hosted by Swedenborg scholar Dr. Jonathan Rose. Today, the channel has 60,000+ subscribers comprised of people from various religious and non-religious backgrounds in countries throughout the world who want to find common ground and meaning in complex social settings. The team was fortunate to have one of their first and most popular videos, \"You Are the Lungs,\" aired during a segment of The Dr. Oz Show in February 2017. The video effectively depicts how the rational and emotional properties of the physical and spiritual realms can converge inside of each person. It encapsulates the driving force behind the team\u2019s mission: To be of service to the world by uniting knowledge and love with action.\u003cbr\u003e",
