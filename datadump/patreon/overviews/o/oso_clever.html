I am a father of two boys, 2 and 3 years old (that drive me nuts!). The love I have for them is unmeasurable. \u003cbr\u003eI attended the Illinois Institute of Art in Chicago and graduated with a Bachelor\u0027s in Fine Arts, Media Arts and Animation. I hit whats called a writers block, for us it\u0027s called Artist Block and for the life of me I couldn\u0027t shake it. I stopped drawing, creating, or using my imagination for a solid 8 years. It was awful and I really had to find myself and figure out what really inspired me when it came to my creativity and abilities as an artist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ultimately want to create my own graphic novel/story/art book. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to learning new things while part of this community and meet new awesome people!
