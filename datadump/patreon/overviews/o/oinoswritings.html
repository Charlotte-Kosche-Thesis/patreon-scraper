Oh well, then I guess I\u0027ll have to actually talk about myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Oinos, which, if you are Greek, probably sounds weird to you, or maybe not... Anyway, I am an Italian university student who decided on a whim to start writing and ended up liking it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main story is \"I\u0027ve Been Summoned as a Hero ..I\u0027m a God Though\" which is a long-ass title but that\u0027s what happens when you decide to get over a breakup by spending a summer reading Japanese novels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is my main fiction about? \u003cdel\u003eCrazy people, crazy gods, random shit, gore and lesbian porn\u003c/del\u003e. It\u0027s a story which focuses on the interactions between the characters, the differences between cultures, the difficulties encountered by homesexual couples, what means taking a person life, how a being who saw the many faces of humanity could interact with people and many, many other difficult themes often avoided by- pfff, no, I can\u0027t do it, it\u0027s a wish-fulfillment fiction with LitRPG elements and some random things thrown in it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther than \"I\u0027ve Been Summoned as a Hero ...I\u0027m a God Though\" I have also completed a short story titled \"A Glass Window\", which, while it doesn\u0027t seem so by the title, actually tries to depict some of the darkest sides of our society from the eyes of a na\u00efve character that knows nothing about the world, like, for example, a sentient glass window. \u003cbr\u003e...I wasn\u0027t joking this time, it\u0027s actually about that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have two other projects still in a baby stage, one of which doesn\u0027t even have a definitive title.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find all of my projects on RoyalRoadl at this page: \u003ca href=\"https://royalroadl.com/user/profile/50196/fictions\"\u003eOinos\u0027s Fictions\u003c/a\u003e"
