As activists we decided to do\nsomething about it, so we opted out of our former lives to begin\nanew. We are currently transforming pristine alpine wilderness into a\nself-sustaining homestead and organic farm in preparation for the\nupcoming collapse. We plan on developing and executing every single\nstep of the process in open source format for the benefit of all\nhumanity. With our backgrounds in academia and the sciences\n(climatology, geology, physics, biology, chemistry, and more) we hope\nto uncover the lies perpetrated by the mass media. It will be\npresented here and on our website in a systematic and thorough\nprocess. As you can imagine, this is a multifaceted, lifelong\nproject, and we are so passionately excited to take the next steps\ntowards self sufficiency and our dream! Won\u0027t you join us?\u003cbr\u003e"
