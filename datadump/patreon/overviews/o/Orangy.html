    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent Pack: All The Single Ladies!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFemales only, will feature females with sex toys or engaged in f/f material.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDisclaimer: This blog features mature artwork(18+) and is NSFW!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a furry artist for several years and as my work grows, the more I want to continue doing this for several more years. It\u0027s my passion, through college, the Navy, and college again! Nothing has made me as happy as this and I hope you feel like my work is good enough for your support.\u003cbr\u003eI love doing artwork for a living and through patreon you can help me bring more content to the world and get my art packs for over half the cost AND before anyone else! One day, you\u0027ll even get to vote on the theme!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis Patreon is on a trial period from June 2016 to September 2016! Depending on support levels, it may go on long breaks(2-3 months) while I\u0027m in school or doing commission work to stabilize my income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt Pack- a group of images in a similar theme(female, male, herm, straight, gay, etc). Will comprise of at least 5 full color images.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I doing this patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I really love setting a goal to do image packs, confining myself to a theme and it helps my income! I do these in my free time, which is fine but slow. I rely a LOT on commissions as packs never have sold to cover the time I put into them. I do them straight up out of love and commitment. This patreon, as it grows, will give everyone more art!\u003cbr\u003eNote- These art packs will never be full scale comics! Comics are an incredibly time investment and I don\u0027t feel I have the skills to deliver a product worth the cost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does \"per art pack\" mean?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt means that no matter how long it takes me, you will only be charged when I deliver the final and completed art pack. This could be monthly(no more often then that) or it could take 2 months for me finish a larger one. For the smaller packs (5-7 images), 1 pack per month would be the most common. Why so long? Well I will be in college for another year, so time to invest is low during certain times of the year, especially the final 2-3 weeks each quarter(Mid December, Late March, and Early June).\u003cbr\u003eAll packs will start at 5 images, normally sold for $6-$7. There are goals for high image counts! I price things $1 per image plus $1-$2. So a ten image pack would cost $11-$12 publicly when it goes live on InkedFur!\u003cbr\u003eThe images will be everything from nude pinups to full on sexy times, which I try to spread out evenly through each pack, unless it\u0027s theme denotes it\u0027s only one type or the other. Ex. Pinup packs will obviously only have pinups.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRemember- I am now posting finished artwork after the art pack goes on sale at low resolution! Everyone gets to enjoy it eventually and Patrons get it cheaper and sooner(with all the nonpublic content, like source files, WIPs and others as time goes on)!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will \u003cstrong\u003eNOT\u003c/strong\u003e sell commissions through patreon. If I need a character for an image, you will see it auctioned off on my Furaffinity [NSFW] \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/orangy/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/orangy/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goals are at specific points based on price point. Here on patreon, the goals represent less than the actual cost of the pack\u0027s time investment. So if these images were all $50 a piece, then 7 images(Goal 2 @ $200) would technically cost me $350 in time. Why the lower goal cost? Because of the intention to sell them for non-patreon users on InkedFur. You here on patreon do get them much cheaper as it grows, as the tiers won\u0027t cost anymore for you as we go up in pack size for your wonderful support! More goals will be offered as time goes on and support grows, so keep an eye out if we\u0027re hitting those goals!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere you can find me\u003cbr\u003eAll links are Not Safe For Work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/orangy/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/orangy/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://orangysart.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://orangysart.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://beta.furrynetwork.com/orangy/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://beta.furrynetwork.com/orangy/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/OrangyArtist\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/OrangyArtist\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
