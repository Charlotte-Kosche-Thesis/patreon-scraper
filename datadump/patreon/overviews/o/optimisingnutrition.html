    "summary": "For the past 2.5 years I\u2019ve been working hard to build a comprehensive\nresource that brings a new level of precision to the confusion, noise and conflicts\nof interest that often pollute the world of nutrition. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor too long we\u2019ve been focusing on \u003cem\u003eavoiding\u003c/em\u003e things like fat, saturated fat, cholesterol,\ncarbohydrates, protein and end up with a diet full of refined packaged products\nthat contain very few micronutrients.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIt should be self-evident, but I believe nutrients are central\nto good nutrition.  However, we can further\nrefine our nutritional approach using parameters such as macronutrients,\ninsulin load and energy density to identify optimal foods for different\ngoals.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI am passionate about building the resource that I wish had\nbeen available when my wife Monica was pregnant and the diabetes clinic at the hospital\nwould tell her that she needed to reduce her blood sugars but had no useful\nadvice on how to achieve this!  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThere are now over one hundred and fifty blog posts on Optimising\nNutrition, with a whole lot more in the pipeline.  I\u2019m also excited to realise the full\npotential of the Nutrient Optimiser as we work hard to develop it into a a\nuseful tool for more people to use.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo many ideas.  So\nlittle time! (Do I really have to sleep?)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI would love to do more podcasts and perhaps a range of\nYouTube videos to repurpose the most popular content on the blog for people who\ndon\u2019t like to read five thousand word articles that are aimed at nutritional thought\nleaders.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhile I do have a day job as an engineer, every hour I spend\ndeveloping the blog is an hour that I could be spending doing paid overtime, hanging\nout with my family, sleeping, going to the gym or getting outside and\npracticing what I preach.   \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSponsorship or advertising is not ideal as I want to provide\na clear message that is free from conflicts of interest from supplement or manufactured\nfoods which cut against the goals of optimising nutrition primarily through whole\nfoods.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOthers have suggested that I implement a paid subscription\nportion of the site.  However, I don\u2019t\nwant to keep my most useful material behind a paywall.  I want it to be available and shared freely because\nit works and can help the people who desperately need it.  The more I can interact with people who read\nthe material the more I am able to refine the information and the tools.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you have benefited from the material at Optimising\nNutrition and would like to see it continue to be developed and shared then I\ninvite you to become a patron so I can continue to follow my passion to provide\na clear and quantitative voice in the discussion on nutrition for you and\neveryone else out there who may potentially benefit from it.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMarty Kendall\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOptimising Nutrition\u003cbr\u003e"
