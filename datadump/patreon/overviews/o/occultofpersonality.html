     "about": "Greg Kaminsky is the host and producer of the Occult of\nPersonality podcast, a highly regarded and long-running podcast that explores the occult and esoteric with authors and experts in the field. His desire to create the Occult of Personality podcast in 2006 began with a life-long compulsion to learn more about ancient civilizations, world religions, symbolism, and the underlying hidden wisdom which they contain, but only convey to those with eyes to see and ears to hear. With well over 150 episodes completed and tens of thousands of listeners every month, the podcast continues to grow in popularity and prestige. You can find Occult of Personality podcast at \u003ca href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Foccultofpersonality.net%2F\u0026amp;h=sAQEUVTbT\u0026amp;enc=AZMmZNYvI0buOGQt3Nqna3GCUPJnmdKmuVcCP8DLMWV5i-s-LVSsWxqm66ZjKriqBxA\u0026amp;s=1\"\u003ehttp://occultofpersonality.net/\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0As part of the journey in learning about the occult and esoteric while doing the podcast, Greg became an initiate in several traditions including Illuminism and Freemasonry. In 2007, he was consecrated as a Bishop in the Gnostic and Apostolic lines of succession by T Allen Greenfield on Mt. Arabia. Additionally, Greg is a scholar of the Western esoteric\ntradition currently pursuing a graduate degree in Medieval Studies, focusing on Cabala.",
