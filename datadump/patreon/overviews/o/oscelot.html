I write, paint, do woodwork, leatherwork, sewing, chainmaille, and the list goes on...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 So, you may be wondering why I want a Patreon? A Patreon lets me get paid monthly for doing what I love, and spread the product out to several people! It also means that I get to focus on larger projects without worrying about my source of income, and allows me to do real world work that requires purchasing materials. Patreon will also give me a way to cultivate a community, and gain your direct input. It\u0027s a win for everyone!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ll be posting:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Art (both digital and real media)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 Writing (short stories and poetry)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 Videos (generally of my readings, but possibly also sketches, informative videos, etc)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022\u00a0Various craft work (everything from classic shop work to jewelry).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 Impressions from projects that may help YOU in the future on your own artistic endeavours!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 After this Patreon hits the 25$ mark, all new pieces will be published here FIRST! Patrons will have a full \u003cem\u003efive\u003c/em\u003e days to enjoy new works before anyone else sees them! I also fully intend to give options for interacting with my patrons to determine what you would like to see more of from me, so that you have the option to be involved in the creative process, rather than just be passive recipients.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for looking!
