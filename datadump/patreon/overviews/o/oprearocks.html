If you\u0027re not entirely convinced what I do and why I do it, check out the YouTube video.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 style=\"font-weight: bold; text-align: center; margin: 20px auto;\"\u003eso.\u003c/h1\u003e\n\nIn a nutshell, I would like to help software developers make their jobs easier and more enjoyable. I want to help them get over the frustration of having to go through a full tutorial on a specific technology, only to learn how to run it on a development environment. I want to save them the pain of saying and hearing \"it works on my machine\". I want to put my experience to good use and share practical solutions, cookbook-style, in a highly distilled, easy to digest fashion. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 style=\"font-weight: bold; text-align: center; margin: 20px auto;\"\u003eand.\u003c/h1\u003e\n\nI will use the money to get better at what I do, and put out more, high-quality content. I put a lot of hard work in everything I do and this is no exception.\nI wouldn\u0027t be able to put my signature on it unless it had something funny in it. Expect content with fun, sarcasm and irony so leave your political weapons at the door.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 style=\"font-weight: bold; text-align: center; margin: 20px auto;\"\u003eand.\u003c/h1\u003e\nIf things turn out unexpectedly well, and you give more that what I pledged, I will invest a lot more time and energy into this. I will try to make that dent in the Universe that everybody is trying to make. I have a list of people I would like to interview, a lot of projects I would like to start. I have a lot of ideas and I would love to involve the people of this community.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 style=\"font-weight: bold; text-align: center; margin: 20px auto;\"\u003ep.s.\u003c/h1\u003e\nI also love creating applications and working on new projects. If you enjoy using one of the projects I built and would like to support me, this is the place to do it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 style=\"font-weight: bold; text-align: center; margin: 20px auto;\"\u003ethanks.\u003c/h1\u003e"
