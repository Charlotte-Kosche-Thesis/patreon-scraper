    "summary": "Thank you for considering becoming an exclusive member of our\u00a0community. We are a 50 something couple that loves to travel and see new and exciting things. We have already been all over the country but have had limited time to explore the things we have wanted to such as spending a morning at The Grand Canyon, a day at Devils Tower, a couple hours at Mount Rushmore, a day in Yosemite and so on. We have been out of shape for almost a decade and have been progressively getting worse over time. I guess you could say \"Life got in the way of Life\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have fostered over 45 children from 7 days old to 16 and raised 4 kids (3 of which are out of the house) and have one remaining at home. He is adventurous as you can see in photos. He is 16 now and will be going off to College soon so we are trying to get in better shape to possibly hike the triple crown of thru-hikes; The PCT (Pacific Crest Trail), the CDT (Continental Divide Trail), and the AT (Appalachian Trail). There are other places we would like to travel and hike like Yellowstone, The GDT (Great Divide Trail) in the Canadian Rockies and a few others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight Now, our level is doing an hour or so at a time to build up our endurance. We have been sedentary for far too long and it shows in our videos. Between making sure we have enough calories to perform the short but meaningful hikes we do and making sure we don\u0027t overeat or eat garbage is a full-time job. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are looking forward to sharing our journey with you and hope we inspire you to do just a little more today than you did yesterday and more tomorrow than you did today. If you chose not to become a patron today, please feel free to head over to our Amazon Affiliates site and shop Amazon that way. Here\u0027s the link.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/?tag=opadventures-20\u0026amp;linkCode=ez\"\u003ehttps://www.amazon.com/?tag=opadventures-20\u0026amp;linkCode=ez\u003c/a\u003e. All you have to do is use the link and shop as normal. Nothing will be added to your total when you check out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough your patronage on Patreon, you will gain access to our exclusive community in which we make adventure videos chronicling our journey to health. We show real footage of real situations on the trail and how someone in our health condition\u00a0faces them. We are not doctors, guides, or experts in the field. We simply want to share our journey. With your exclusive access, you will not only gain access to members only content but, and\u00a0depending on the level of access you want, you will receive swag to show off to all your friends. See the levels of rewards to get more details.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, we want to thank you for taking the time to consider becoming a special member of our community. We look forward to seeing you on the trails. \u003cbr\u003e"
