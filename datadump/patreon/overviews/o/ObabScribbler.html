    "summary": "Howdy, hello and hey-hey folks! I\u0027m Scribbler, also known as ObabScribbler, also known as That English Chick Who Reads Stories and Does Silly Voices. Welcome to my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m best known as a voice actor, writer and director of fanmade audio productions on YouTube. On my channel I produce a weekly show that adapts MLP fanfictions from various genres into full-cast audio readings, plus weekly comic dubs (including my most famous dub of the \u0027Core of the Apple\u0027 series), a podcast discussing the brony fandom, forum fanfiction review show The Heroic Review, full cast creepypasta readings, plus three all-original radio plays: The Death of Sunset Shimmer, The Heroic Tale of Heroically Heroic Heroes and the upcoming No Place Like Home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have worked on 200+ other projects as a voice actor and audio editor, including CRISIS Equestria for Bogyle Bronies, Keyframe\u0027s production of Allegrezza, Nimbus Productions, SPICTRA, a number of animations with ilovekimpossibleolot, as well as one-off projects by other YouTubers such as DrWolf, Illya Leonov, TheLostNarrator, Goombasa, Emogak, IMShadow007, Ribon Chan, Thornquill Audiobooks and Reverb Brony. I have also appeared in Sherlock Hooves for Pony in a Box Productions, where I was recently taken on as a scriptwriter, and have been a member of the radio station Ponyville Live FM since 2013.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOutside YouTube I have been an author in various capacities since 2001. I currently have over 500 fics available online, including a 101-chapter Kingdom Hearts/Final Fantasy VII/Disney crossover story that reached\u00a0602670 words at completion, and several that won rosettes at the 2008 and 2009 Genesis Awards. In 2012 I joined Fimfiction.net where I now write an ongoing OctaScratch hospital drama called \u0027Playing With My Heart\u0027, plus other one-shots, including the darkfic Five Things That Never Happened to Twilight Sparkle and the month-long shipping event March-Makers. A number of my MLP fanfictions have been adapted for audio, including the five-part series \u0027Truth Be Told\u0027, which received a full-cast adaptation by TheLostNarrator in October 2014.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, as you can see, I\u0027m a pretty active member of the online community. I love producing content and helping out with others\u0027 projects. Making authors smile and interacting with other fans is the highlight of my days. Future plans for my channel include continuations of MLP projects plus audio adaptations of some comic book material, including Batman, Justice League, X-Men and Spider-Man. I also hope to up the quality of my productions by including some animations, all-original music, custom artwork and other more elaborate touches. I also hope, finances permitting, to be able to attend BronyScot 2016 and hope to meet fellow YouTubers and other MLP fans there in the flesh.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started this Patreon back in 2015 as a means of paying for my dog Suki\u0027s medical bills. Unfortunately in April 2016 my girl died in my arms of an unexpected heart attack a week after her seventh birthday. The run of bad luck continued when I suffered a nervous breakdown and resurgence of the depression I have been fighting for several years and in August 2016 I had to leave my job for the sake of my mental and physical health. As such while I am looking for new work, I am reliant on my Patreon income to do things like pay rent, buy food, meet bills and generally not become homeless. I have never been someone who likes to ask for handouts, so I have redesigned the rewards system on my page to offer a wide range of options in exchange for your patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWow, you got this far down the page? Well since you came this far and read this much, why not think about becoming a patron and earning a special place in my heart? ^_^\u003cbr\u003e"

For this topmost tier, you can choose a 1000-4000 word story of your choice for me to do a reading of (any fandom though nothing NSFW). If you would prefer a multi-part to a one-shot story, there is the option to renew each month and use your reward for each new chapter.\u00a0Your name will also be displayed at the end of my weekly fic readings. Alternatively, you may request a 4000 word fanfiction written by me on a theme/character of your choice (again, no NSFW please). \u00a0Your name and avatar will also feature in a special monthly patron video on my channel thanking you for your patronage.\u00a0Additionally you get access to come hang out with me in the Scribbler Patrons\u0027 Discord Server!\u00a0",
