The concept is now\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/rob-shirkey/canada-climate-change_b_8711712.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebeing passed into law\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s an idea I had a couple of years prior but didn\u0027t develop until my grandfather passed away during the summer of 2012. The last words he spoke to me prompted me to close down my legal practice and launch a non-profit to advocate for the idea. I\u0027ll be sharing more about this story in my first video update to monthly supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhy climate change labels on gas pumps?\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur greatest obstacle to transitioning to a more sustainable future is the systemic inertia of the status quo.\u00a0While we tend to focus our attention upstream (e.g., oil sands, fracking,\u00a0offshore drilling,\u00a0pipelines, shipping, etc.), we rarely question the simple act of pumping gas. There is a complete disconnect.\u00a0On the demand-side of the equation, we have\u00a0a habitual, automatic behaviour that has been normalized for several generations. Complacent, disconnected markets don\u0027t drive change; we have\u00a0the\u00a0perfect downstream environment to perpetuate the status quo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe warning labels take the unexamined act of gassing up and de-normalize it. By communicating the impacts of fossil fuels to end-users in this way, the labels disrupt the status quo solution and stimulate broader demand for alternatives. This drives change upstream as businesses and governments deliver solutions to meet this shift in demand. \u00a0Our simple, low-cost idea will be a critical intervention to help accelerate our transition to a more sustainable future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo learn more, please watch my 10-minute TEDx talk below.\u00a0If you want to dive deeper, you can read our reports and watch my longer video lectures at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ourhorizon.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOur Horizon\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SA4e7y-4Pak\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe exciting thing is that the concept has been formally endorsed by city and town councils across Canada. I\u0027ve been able to leverage these endorsements in conversations with provincial governments and I\u0027ve just reached out to the federal government (\u003ca href=\"http://ourhorizon.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Letter-from-Our-Horizon-to-PM-Trudeau-and-Minister-McKenna-re-Climate-Change-Labels-on-Gas-Pumps-30-11-2015.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u0027s my recent letter\u003c/a\u003e to Prime Minister Trudeau and Environment Minister McKenna). Several councils have now passed the idea into law and are implementing them in their own communities. These votes were called historic global firsts by media outlets across North America and beyond. The story was shared via social media all over the world.

It was the gift of time that allowed me to step away from my legal practice and explore an idea that I had a couple of years prior. A few months later, I found myself launching a non-profit organization that would become the vehicle through which I would advocate for climate change labels on gas pumps. Our other sources of funding include:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2013: \u00a0Crowdfund that raised $15,075 for a cross-Canada speaking tour.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2014: \u00a0Crowdfund that raised $6,496 to hire a student to seek academic endorsements.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2015: \u00a0A generous Canadian gave me $5,000 when I was no longer able to pay my bills.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOnline donations: \u00a0Close to $10,000 in donations through our website since we launched.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile I\u2019m grateful for all this support, it hasn\u2019t been enough to sustain the campaign and I\u2019ve had to fund the vast majority of the project myself.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy savings is spent, I\u2019ve maxed my line of credit, and I\u2019m now running the project on my personal credit card. I\u2019m able to partly make ends meet by renting out my home in uptown Toronto while living in a small room in downtown Toronto. The difference between rental payments in and rental payments out means that I\u2019ve been able to volunteer my time on this project for the past three years. I\u2019m not paid and I have no paid staff. The good news is that it\u2019s been worth it. We\u2019re now inspiring governments to create historic global precedents and we\u2019re about to spread the idea all over the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPeople sometimes ask, \u201cHave you applied to the XYZ foundation for a grant?\u201d I have. Unfortunately, given the political nature of our advocacy, we\u2019re unable to secure charitable status. This means that foundations are unable to support our work. I\u2019ve tried lots of other approaches and I\u2019ll dive into that in a video answer that I\u0027ll post one day. For now, I\u2019ll cut to the chase: I need a small budget and you can help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eTwo ways to help:\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I really need to make this thing take off is a budget. If I have enough funds to hire just one person, we\u2019ll double the organization\u2019s capacity.* A lot of big environmental organizations have budgets in the millions of dollars. Just think of the marginal impact your dollar makes in supporting a small non-profit.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003e1) Become a monthly supporter.\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePlease contribute $2, $5, $10, $15, $20, $25, or $50 a month. Apart from giving me a budget to work with, each donation is also a boost to my spirits and really keeps me going. No matter how big, they each seem to say, \u201cI believe in you, I think what you\u2019re doing is important, and I\u2019m sharing the fruits of my labours because I want to see you succeed.\u201d While this is a non-profit organization, I also love the idea of having \u201cshareholders\u201d in this venture and being accountable to you. All supporters will receive a private YouTube update once or twice a month where I share the highs and lows of running the campaign. So please become a monthly donor and join me on this journey to change the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003e2) Tell your rich friend about this project. Seriously.\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I really need is a high net worth individual that\u2019s serious about addressing climate change to cut us a cheque and say, \u201cNow you can afford a small team. Now you\u2019ve got a travel budget to spread the word. Now you can get paid. Go change the world and report back to me in three years when you have.\u201d\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis project would be so much further ahead right now if I had a small budget to work with. The biggest thing I\u2019ve learned over the past few years is that funding is often about who you know. You may not know Jeff Skoll, Tom Steyer, or Mark Zuckerberg, but maybe you\u2019re one or two degrees removed from them? Or maybe you know an influential, connected person who can put me in touch with someone that can help my efforts? If you know someone like this, please take a moment to reach out to them. Your email could lead to the one cheque that changes everything.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for your support,\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://ourhorizon.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Rob-Shirkey-Patreon-Profile.jpg\" style=\"width: 203px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://ourhorizon.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/signature.jpg\" style=\"width: 173px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tRob Shirkey\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tFounder \u0026amp; Executive Director\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://ourhorizon.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eOur Horizon\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Technically not true.
