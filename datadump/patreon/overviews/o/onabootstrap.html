    "summary": "Firstly a huge thankyou to all of you for supporting my work for the last few years - my blog and recipes are free and always will be, but for a long time now readers and supporters have urged me to set up some kind of patron system whereby those who can afford to chip in to keep everything ticking over (including me!) effectively subsidise those that need the resources of a budget cooking blog, most of all.\u003cbr\u003eI do a lot of charity work and events for free, give a lot of my work away at food banks and similar, have sent books to people in need, and spend almost every waking hour responding to cooking queries or desperate emails from people with just a few pounds scraped down the back of the sofa and a week of meals to create for it. It\u0027s got to the point, with my arthritis and other annoyances, where I can\u0027t do as much of the big paid demanding corporate jobs that usually keep the free stuff ticking over - and I\u0027m struggling to keep my head above water. Most of all I\u0027ve lost my time to actually do the things I - and you - love, which is cooking on a budget, writing costed recipes, answering your queries, and teaching the world to cook on a bootstrap. I want to be able to do this properly again, but I can\u0027t do it without your help and support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThankyou.\u003cbr\u003eJack."
