    "summary": "Citizens of the Empire! \u003cbr\u003eMy name is FarringtonEmpire, and I\u2019ve been creating content\non YouTube since late November of 2013 and I\u2019ve been streaming regularly on\nTwitch.tv since February of 2014! \u003cbr\u003e\nI provide interactive video game commentary, review, as well\nas Unboxings on YouTube and Twitch. And you have found my Patreon page you\nlucky so-and-so! \u003cbr\u003e\nYou probably have questions as to why i started this, and\nI\u0027ll attempt to take a crack at answering those! So please do read on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n  Streaming on Twitch.tv is an amazing\nexperience, and I don\u0027t plan on stopping any time soon. It has been a blast\ngetting to where I am; going from Streaming a few times per week to see what it\nwas like and have some fun with a few folks, to a highlight of my week and a\nbudding career. I love each and every one of you. That isn\u0027t lip service.\nI wouldn\u0027t be able to do what I do if you weren\u0027t here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo why did you\nstart a Patreon if you love this so much? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e-I need help. I love doing this; however, we live\nin a society where money is required in order to keep things such as your\nhouse, car, job, possessions, and sanity. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\nTo clear this up, If you would like to help, you are more\nthan welcome to, however, this is not a requirement! There are rewards, yes,\nbut that is simply to give something back to those who have the means to\nprovide aid. My streams are still free to watch (and will continue to be so),\nand my YouTube videos are free to watch (and will continue to be so) as well.\nI\u2019m not charging for a service, I\u2019m asking for support. So that I can continue\nto provide content that I love creating, and hopefully, you love to watch.\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve got levels of what I would like to reach, and what I can\nprovide as a thank you to you, the patrons!"
