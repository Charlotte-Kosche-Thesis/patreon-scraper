People generally get their music now by streaming and downloading the songs they like, a lot of the time one by one instead of the full album to which we go to such great lengths to curate. So every month I record and release an original single with a different studio and team. Expanding both my Rolodex and yours (since I blog about them on \u003ca href=\"https://oliviabrownlee.com/\"\u003eOliviaBrownlee.com\u003c/a\u003e), I employ a new producer, band, engineer, etc to record/mix/master and release by the last day of each month on just two platforms:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/obrownlee\"\u003ePatreon.com\u003c/a\u003e - You are on a website that connects art-makers with people who love and want to buy the art they make. Become a monthly pledger for any amount starting at $1, and you can own my entire Songography catalogue in your personal music library for your listening pleasure, read lyrics, and get tiered rewards from me the artist - anything from a simple compliment to a birthday serenade to a song composed for you. This is currently the only platform where the tracks can be downloaded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/olivia-brownlee\"\u003eSoundcloud.com\u003c/a\u003e - You can stream the catalogue here, like shopping for tea: the product is for sale, but the sensations are free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support! See you in the songage!\u003cbr\u003e"
