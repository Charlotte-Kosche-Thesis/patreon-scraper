Where did it all start?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eRemember reading all over the place about some insane guy from Serbia flaunting his bubble ass in full set of 3DMG harness from \"Attack on Titan\"? Hi, this is me, after you discovered me and made me go viral, prompting me to stop experimenting with cosplay and give myself a bit more credit, forcing the title of a \"cosplay professional\" on me. I took it gladly, and added only a couple of years of experience (and around 12 more cosplays) to the mix.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e2. So, what is this shindig, then?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEven though people do tend to get a bit carried away with their theories about my work, there\u0027s far more to it than I would ever admit publicly. I don\u0027t know why, it could be that I\u0027m a descendant of the pop culture of 80s and 90s, where all you get to see is a shiny, polished product without much (or any) insight into the trial and error process of creating the fantasy for you, both on web and live. And that process, sadly, demands money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e3. But you existed and worked even prior to this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThat is true. However, I did give a lot in order to get a head start, and yes, no one asked me to, but at the same time, Patrons are the ones responsible for the fact all of my works are far more into the polished area, ready to be presented to the world. I can safely say that what you get to see on photos I publish, you will get to see in real life, no alterations and no mighty Photoshop help. This, ultimately, took me down the route of getting more invitations for international conventions, and it\u0027s nowadays just a matter of time before I\u0027m invited to your own neighborhood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e4. If I get to see all your photos online, why would I want to pledge?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s just one more illusion, making sure no one feels pressured into pledging. Depending on the pledged amount, I decided to give something extra to you guys, something that no one outside this important bunch has. I daresay - something \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive\u003c/strong\u003e. Much higher quality photos than the ones I post on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.fb.com/AVATAR.designs\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://worldcosplay.net/member/bnaumovski\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWorldCosplay\u003c/a\u003e, before and after comparisons, alternative takes, never before seen shots, and commissions, on top of an exclusive VIP area that is being revamped right now, and publications, such as monthly Fanzine and yearly photobook. So, in a way, there\u0027s a lot to gain by support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5. Is there nudity?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eCan you remember a time with me where there wasn\u0027t? Me neither.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e6. What do you cover with Patreon money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eBasic costs of making a new cosplay can range from a very affordable one I could get myself up to a couple of hundreds of dollars, which would basically get me to the point of deciding if I\u0027m to eat or finish a cosplay this month. That\u0027s where you jump in, pretty much helping me deliver a new work while sill having a roof over my head and enough food in my refrigerator. Besides that, big, beautiful shots don\u0027t just spawn out of nowhere. I\u0027m in a process of leveling money towards a new camera and one more set of lights, so I can finally jump into the huge-ass photo game. Any and every cent I spent so far is pretty much shown in my development as a cosplayer and an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e7. Why should I choose you over any other cosplayer?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou are here. So I have your interest.\u00a0And this is not a competition, if you prefer another cosplayer and can pledge money to only one, I\u0027m all up for it. But if you want to be the one to suggest a new work I could totally pull off, make sure you help me do it too. Basically, if 50 people ask for a certain costume, and they follow up by pledging $20 each, I could finish it AND give those 50 people exclusive insights, prints, photos, and soon to follow, even videos. As easy as that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you\u0027re still here, it means I did something right with your attention. Your move, future Patron. :)\u003cbr\u003eLove \u0026amp; light,\u003cbr\u003eOri\u003cbr\u003e"
