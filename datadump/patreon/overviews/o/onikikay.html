This is a game modification which purpose is to add new kinky features to the game to spicy up the characters life. The mod features custom skills, traits, buffs, motives, interactions and objects. I plan to add challenges, quests and events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUnamed RPG Project\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve started this project in 2012. This realtime 3D RPG takes place in a fantasy world I\u0027ve created. The prototype was developped with Unity 3D using modified assets from other games and Unity standard assets. But, it was far too ambitious for one person and is currently on hold.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinky Tales\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is my second active project. This is an adventure game in a realtime 3D world. Based on my previous work on the Unamed RPG, the game will be splitted in several episodes that take place in a fictional town. In each episode, the player will control a different character and follow his/her adventures. The character will have to do simple quests, make choices, build relationships and earn money to live. The town is not big but the character will be able to freely explore it. And of course, during the adventure and explorations, kinky events will happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a fantastic way for me to share my work and for you to show me you like and appreciate my work.\u003cbr\u003eAs a game developper, I need to know that my work is appreciated. This is the main source of motivation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eObjectives\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorking on this kind of projects require lots of work and time. As a freelance programmer I\u0027m free to refuse paid (but not fun) contracts so that I can spend more time on my own projects. But, like everyone else, I have bills to pay. By raising money on Patreon I can continue to work on my projects and keep a roof over my head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll have access the activity feed, weekly builds (bugfix release) and bi-monthly builds (new content release), make suggestions, vote for the new features, npc and challenge design, and even influence the direction of the projects.\u003cbr\u003e"
