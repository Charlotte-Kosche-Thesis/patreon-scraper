I love traveling and taking pictures, with a my particular emphasis being black and white landscapes.

I favor landscape style, but choose to do this one portrait style, because I wanted to capture the feeling of following the path as it wound along to an unknown destination! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/2BiHH6e.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough I tend to shoot in black and white landscape, I do occasionally enjoy doing color portraits as well.
