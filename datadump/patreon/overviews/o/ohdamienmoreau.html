    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eDear Patron,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a full-time artist and creator can be difficult when you fund your own projects, as any creative person will testify. The work you see here has all been funded out of my own pocket and made possible through: trade, generous participation and donations from the actors and patrons, like you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Queer Cinema? Queer Cinema is  broad in it\u0027s definition and theory, no one definition is correct or incorrect - all points of view are valid - Basically it is cinema that challenges preconceived notions of identity in relation to gender, sexuality and belonging. My belief is that film (and the arts in general) have the power to create positive reactive change when the audience is challenged by the images and themes they are witness to so long as those themes empower the viewer to use their own senses and imagination to move from suffering into love. In my theory everybody is queer by nature only when social conditioning is imposed onto the queer psyche and body (during our formative years) do we fracture from the wholeness of queer being and attach stigma to our physical and emotional selves.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMy Queer Cinema is an attempt to bring us back into our queerness, asking us to dissolve the stigma and transmute our perception through spiritual solidarity made possible through love and compassion for one another. We perceive to be different from one another, on a basic level there is truth to that belief, however at the root we are more alike than we are different. My work emphasizes that kindred part in each of us that needs to connect on a social/spiritual/sexual/creative level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal in using Patreon is to create an outlet where my films are funded by the people who watch and believe in the emphasis previously mentioned. Through your generosity and support we have the opportunity to reach a broader audience with our message of queer inclusivity by keeping it free to all. Your contributions will allow for my content to stay independent, fresh, free and active while opposing capitalistic values by using them to subversively change a corrupt system collaboratively from within; The people expressing themselves by funding the work of eachother v. corporate meddling. I look forward to working with you and making films that honor your contribution and imagine a better world for all, a unified Queer utopia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDamien\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e_\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eD A M I E N / M O R E A U\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDirector [film \u0026amp; photography]\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://ohdamienmoreau.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://ohdamienmoreau.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e@ohdamienmoreau\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ohdamienmoreau/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e /\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ohdamienmoreau\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e /\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ohdamienmoreau.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e"

     "about": "Damien Moreau is a filmmaker and photographer whose work explores intimacy and queer bodies and identity. His focus on sex reflects his belief in the important emotional and spiritual expression sex enables and its liberatory potential through experiences of jouissance. Moreau began his career as a pornographic model and soon became interested in directing in order to create and explore his own ideas about fantasy and desire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015 Moreau debuted his cinematic mini-series OHBOY. The verbally sparse and visually lush masturbation vignettes of OHBOY invite a voyeuristic gaze into the private lives of its characters challenging assumptions about the transparent intelligibility of desire, sexuality and the self. Blurring distinctions between film and pornography OHBOY asks us to consider what sex on film looks like, invokes, complicates and how it positions its audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis recent work, including the upcoming film Lust for Life, examines themes of freedom, utopianism, queer community and asociality.  Turning to genres of science fiction and fantasy, Moreau continues to investigate how joy might be located and experienced in this world and one that pushes the limits of the imagination.\u003cbr\u003e",
