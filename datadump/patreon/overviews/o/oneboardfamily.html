We\u0027ve created so many relationships and shared in community through this great hobby.\u00a0Family and friends are regularly asking us \"What are you playing?\" or \"What games should our family check out?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve decided to keep this conversation going by creating\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.OneBoardFamily.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eOneBoardFamily.com\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s a simple site that will be dedicated to sharing tabletop games with the average family. There are tons of blogs about the most nerdy games available (we love these games too!). We are hoping to bring accessible and family friendly board games to all those that are wondering what they should play this weekend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur biggest hurdle as we start this journey is having access to the games that are hitting the market right now. We aren\u0027t in a position to purchase the latest and greatest games to feature on the site each month. This is where we need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what you see and want to see this site move forward, we would love your support! The money will be used specifically to purchase new games for review and write features about. We would also love to be able to post richer video content in the future. This content would take more resources than we currently have at our disposal. As we go into 2017, we\u0027re also looking at taking the family to a board gaming convention to bring you the latest games and news that focus on bringing the family around the table. Your support will make all this possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsider donating monthly to our Patreon. We are so grateful for your time and hope to make you a frequent reader at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.OneBoardFamily.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eOneBoardFamily.com\u003c/a\u003e."
