I\u0027m Blair Shedd. If you\u0027re a comic book fan and/or Whovian, you might know my work from Doctor Who from both IDW Publishing and Titan Publishing. I\u0027ve also worked on comics such as Legends of Oz, The Guild, Ghostbusters, Assassin\u0027s Creed, Torchwood, Robotech, and more.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow you might be stopping by because of my recent webcomic debut, The Worlds Between Us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027m freelance, which means, when I have a job, I get paid, and when I don\u0027t have a job, I don\u0027t (and in the case of my webcomic, I\u0027m doing it on spec - for no pay promised, guaranteed, or possibly ever). So, like the story of the shark, I gotta keep moving or die (I know this isn\u0027t true of all sharks, but let me have this, okay?). But often I get asked things I\u0027d like to help people with, from fans asking about how or why I drew a certain page or piece, aspiring artists asking about techniques or how to put together a portfolio, to people requesting video demonstrations. But these things stop me from working on jobs.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tSo howabout this; you help me while I help you. For your monthly pledges, I\u0027ll give you things like behind-the-scenes look at art I\u0027m working on now, peeks at secret things to come, hi-res looks at older pieces (and downloads), live shows with artwork you can have delivered to you in print, one-on-one art instruction, and more! I\u0027ll update once a week, so as not to flood your inbox, and catch you up on what\u0027s going on, what\u0027s new, and what\u0027s in it for you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tLet\u0027s go for true symbiosis on this; help me and I\u0027ll be happy to help (and hopefully entertain) you!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
