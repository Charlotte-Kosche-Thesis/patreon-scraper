    "summary": "UPDATE: The book is finished!! Thanks to the support of patrons over the past year and a half I was able to complete The Shock Doctrine of the Left, which is being published by Polity in July 2018 in the UK, rest of world following that. Details here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://politybooks.com/bookdetail/?isbn=9781509528547\"\u003ehttp://politybooks.com/bookdetail/?isbn=9781509528...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd read an excerpt of the introduction here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://politybooks.com/jones10052018/\"\u003ehttp://politybooks.com/jones10052018/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny continuing donations will go towards both supporting its promotion and also developing my next project, which is expanding on the \u0027Acid Communism\u0027 conversation with radical mindfulness workshops\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eG x\u003cbr\u003e-----\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi there Patrons! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name\u0027s Graham, I\u0027m a freelance educator, activist and self-employed hairdresser, doing absolutely everything he can\u00a0to help resist the failing capitalist system, the rise of fascism, and the intersecting systems of oppression they feed off. As well as on-the-ground organising,\u00a0I write and teach workshops and courses that blend revolutionary organising with ideas from academia, particularly complexity theory. \u003cstrong\u003eAnd now\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am writing a short book\u003c/strong\u003e! It is tentatively titled Shock Doctrine of the Left and is being published by Polity as part of their Radical Futures series. I try to present ideas in a way which is accessible to those outside academia, and which can provide useful practical tools for people to put into action. I\u0027m part of a group called Radical Think Tank, and we\u0027ve been involved in using similar ideas to support campaigns such as the UCL Rent Strike, the IWGB Deliveroo campaign and Kings College Climate Emergency.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI got into activism as a result of my own struggles around mental health and holding on to work, and seeing the effect that cuts to public services and the welfare state were having on my friends. I decided a few years ago to make the plunge into activism, and my life has since been transformed! I no longer feel powerless, even when struggling, and have found a wonderful network of supportive intersectional revolutionaries to work alongside and learn from. I\u0027m now powering ahead with training and sharing skills to the largest amount of people possible, to pass on what I\u0027ve learned as quickly and effectively as possible, and help spur on revolutionary movement.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe book is partly based on a 6-part course on \u0027Revolution and Complex Systems\u0027\u00a0I wrote and delivered last year, which you can listen to recordings of here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/RadicalThinkTank/playlists/revolution-and-complex-systems-6-part-course/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.mixcloud.com/RadicalThinkTank/playlist...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe book will look at how people have attempted to make change through:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003edirect action\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ebuilding alternative institutions\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ecreating transformative communities of care\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003estruggling within the state\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIt will analyse the dynamics of each strategy, uncover the positives and negatives, and blend them into a revolutionary strategy that makes sense for the 21st century. It will ask questions like: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow do we get ahead of the right wing during moments of chaos?\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow do we make sustainable organisations with unshakeable intersectional principles, and make them grow virally?\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow do we pull society away from the \u0027work ethic\u0027 and towards the \u0027care ethic\u0027?\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow do we use networks to make our ideas dominant?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow do we dismantle systems of oppression?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow do we ensure the capitalist state doesn\u0027t crush or co-opt our movements?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledges will help me to survive whilst I write the rest of the book over the next few months. It\u0027s taken a lot of time and effort to write and deliver the course and book so far (as well as the many years of personal study prior to this), and has used up quite a lot of my remaining financial resources! I also suffer from chronic mental health problems so any contributions would be AMAZING in simply helping me to survive day to day :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as all the above, I\u0027ve had pieces published by OpenDemocracy, New Left Project, Organise!, Freedom Press Newspaper and others, and I write occasional pieces for my blog at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://lifeglug.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://lifeglug.wordpress.com\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m active in numerous radical groups, and have been involved in community organising in London around the housing crisis. Pledges will also help toward this and much more besides\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGraham x"
