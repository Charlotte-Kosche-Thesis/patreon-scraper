I\u2019ve been working in the industry for a little under a decade and have been fortunate enough to work on some really amazing projects with wonderful people.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jpwSOl5.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout This Project\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOf the Fittest\u003c/strong\u003e is my first narrative\u003cstrong\u003e book project\u003c/strong\u003e. It\u0027s the culmination of years of designing creatures, studying animals and dreaming up worlds. I want to tell a story about survival and how creatures from all over our universe solve their daily problems with special adaptations, skill and sometimes, just pure luck. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BFjC66v.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://i.imgur.com/BFjC66v.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThe book follows approximately 30 different creatures, looking at specific moments of their individual lives. As we jump from world to world, all of these moments read to make up a full day and span from the mundane to the extraordinary. We\u0027ll follow creatures into conflicts and watch them eat. We\u0027ll see them care for young and stretch as they wake up. \n\u003cstrong\u003eThis book will be a nature documentary of the cosmos!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6EAhv6D.jpg\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s Next and What\u0027s the Goal?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe narrative is written and most of the thumbnails are drawn out. From here, I\u0027d like to utilize Patreon to complete my vision.\u00a0\n\u003cstrong\u003eThis where you come in!\u003c/strong\u003e Here on Patreon, you can support this project and help me fund the time needed to make it into a reality. \u003cstrong\u003eThe ultimate goal is to create a book and publish it!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eWith your help, I can make enough content to pitch to a publisher. If I\u0027m unable to secure a publisher, I will continue to make the book myself and publish the book independently. \u003cstrong\u003eI do plan to extend physical book rewards to my Patrons in the future! Those will be announced the further we get into this project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZSGUiHZ.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Can Expect\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI will be sharing exclusive process about how I go about designing creatures, how I compose an image and how I draw and paint illustrations. I\u0027ll talk about the tools I use and why I use them. You\u0027ll gain access to notes and designs about the creatures featured in the book as well as thumbnails, sketches and exclusive looks at finished artwork!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yqRmmaB.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to work from Of the Fittest, I\u0027ll be sharing unrelated creature work and animal studies as well as my research trips to the Natural History Museum and such.\u00a0Tiers include a range of different rewards including a Discord server where you can ask questions and talk about creature design and things related. I\u0027m also setting up goals that would enable me to share more with all of my Patrons, as well as put together a companion book containing all of my visual development work for this project!\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want this to be a fun place for all of us to geek out about creature design, nature, and story telling.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI expect to learn a ton along the way and I\u0027d love it it you\u0027d join me!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for your support. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
