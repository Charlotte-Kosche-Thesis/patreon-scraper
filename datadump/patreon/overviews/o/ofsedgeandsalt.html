    "summary": "\u003cblockquote\u003eHi ya\u0027ll, I\u0027m Kelly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an artist, writer, traveler, naturalist, farmer and herbalist. I have been studying and getting to know as many plants as possible while farming or traveling across the continental U.S.. In response to these experiences, I make integrative creative work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started an online blog called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ofsedgeandsalt.com\"\u003eOf Sedge and Salt\u003c/a\u003e last year that features essays, poems, journal entries and a travelogue when I am nomadic. It brings me joy that the blog has inspired others to study plants, hit the road, or think about new ideas. I have always written and made art. In the past few years I have felt compelled to share my work on the road, where I am living, or on my reflections of my hometown, which is in the south. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLast year I purchased a slide in truck camper as a space to do research, work and live in when I am on the road. Having this has increased my ability to make work anywhere and provides me a place of respite. The privilege of being semi-mobile has allowed me to study with many teachers, work from various land projects, public lands or artist residencies, do botanical research across the country, and meet amazing people doing meaningful projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough my overhead may be less than others, doing my work still costs money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started this Patreon with the hope that I can continue the work I have been doing, be able to give more, and receive from those who want to keep my work going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003eWhat I am doing :\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eI have several projects in the works with some others still in their seeded stage. I need help to make these things happen. Help in the way of feedback, financial support, sharing and collaboration. Patreon as a platform for sharing our resources with one another, can help facilitate all of those things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a part of this Patreon project, I committed myself to doing a year of monthly botanical profiles to share, based on plants I have been getting to know and studying for awhile now. Generally, these profiles cover many bases- ethnobotany, history, ecology, medicine, tradition of use, \u0026amp; socio-political issues that may surround the plant. Becoming a patron of mine will help fund me doing this research and writing as my job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI started a publication called\u003ca href=\"https://www.ofsedgeandsalt.com/groundshots/\"\u003e \u0027Ground Shots\u0027\u003c/a\u003e that is a culmination of years of work. It is a patchwork of stream of consciousness writing, part capsule of time, part ongoing plant study. Ground Shots is meant to be a recollection of and reflection on moments, reactions and engagements with people, place and the land.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u00a0I started this publication as a way to bring together the things I have been gathering over the last decade while engaging the land, which is deep in my blood: art, prints, photography, poetry, a travelogue, dialogues around social issues, work around environmental desecration and more. It will eventually take on a form greater than just the zine, but the way that will happen is still morphing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I want to print this zine in different ways. The time to gather the materials together, to do the potential digital work involved, the cost of printing, the time in residencies or a studio to focus on the work, doing book releases and distribution, all costs money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project is important because it is a physical publication that someone can hold in their hands. The work I weave therein invokes in the reader questions to ponder about how we see ourselves on the land and with each other, as well as challenges the reader to take in work that may visit ideas in odd or non-linear ways. I want it to be a work that can travel, be traded, and used for occasional reflection.\u00a0 My perspective is a unique one. I find myself acting as a bridge between vastly different worlds. This zine is an attempt to bring them together in a digestible way. With your support, I will be able to focus as much time as possible on this project, with the option for you to get the zines as they are published.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have another project I want to publish at some point that is still gestating called \u0027Oil \u0026amp; Rust\u0027 that I have been working on practically my whole life, as a way to process my experience growing up in an agricultural community in the south. It is an evolving photo and story centered art project that documents rural decay and social change in my home county in southern Virginia. You can find out more on this project under \"Oil and Rust\" on my website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.ofsedgeandsalt.com/oilandrust\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. I have a backlog of writing and photo editing to do with this project. I also need time to process the ways I want to present it to the world. Ground Shots includes some content from this project, but the main bulk of it is to be issued as a unit. I share work related to this project for patrons-only in the $3-$5 up tier as it evolves. Supporting will help me take the steps needed to put this project out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMonthly support gives me the financial space to focus time on my botanical research and publications that I want to offer the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I am offering for support:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eI write monthly botanical profiles that I offer to all patrons for early access. This is a way for me to give back what I\u0027ve learned in the form that I find helpful. See past public profiles\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.ofsedgeandsalt.com/blog/\"\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the lower tiers of support, I offer access to unreleased work like photographs, PDFs of zines, rough drafts from Ground Shots and Oil \u0026amp; Rust, as well as other tidbits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e As the tiers get higher, I offer more engaged content:\u00a0 DIY write-ups on the things I know best: paper making, natural dyes, plant ID, homesteading skills and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurther up in the tiers I offer more physical things like copies of my zines, creative mail and land capsule packages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created a Patreon as a platform for folks to be engaged in my work. In addition to rewards in higher tiers, I offer a lot of free content, as well as work in the $1-$5 tier range. If monthly patronage in the form of $ is not possible for you, sharing my public work or giving me feedback is helpful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I reach $100 per month of patronage, I will support 3-5 other folks on Patreon doing exceptional work in the world. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoal reached!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am donating 5% of my patronage after I reach $500 per month on a rotation between the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/\"\u003eSouthern Poverty Law Center\u003c/a\u003e, the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.unitedplantsavers.org/\"\u003eUnited Plant Savers\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.signalfirearts.org/\"\u003eSignal Fire\u003c/a\u003e.

The United Plant Savers is a non-profit I interned with back in 2011 that promotes the ethical use of medicinal plants.
