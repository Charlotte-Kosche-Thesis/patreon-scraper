Really, they want hope because somewhere behind all the pain they know one thing: marriage shouldn\u2019t be this hard.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThrough their weekly podcast, Caleb and Verlynda come alongside these couples around the world and empower them by giving them the research-based tools and skills they need to improve their marriage.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThey\u0027ve taken a unique approach to helping marriages over the Internet. Where others tell you \u201cwhat to do\u201d and make you pay for \u201chow to do it\u201d, they create and freely give actionable content along with worksheets that help couples implement what they learn right away. Where others sell anecdotes and opinions, they scour academic journals and deliver research based advice that is clinically effective and doable.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut, Caleb and Verlynda will also tell you it is listeners that are the heroes. They are just guides. The audience members are the ones in the trenches of their marriages, working to forgive a spouse who has betrayed them, trying to squelch their own bad habits and learn new, healthier ways of relating to each other.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen you come alongside by becoming a patron, together you, Caleb and Verlynda will:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStrengthen more marriages\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEmpower more people to have hope\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGive thousands of couples a new lease on love and life\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou\u0027ll also receive access to \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive bonus content\u003c/strong\u003e from their podcast.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nCaleb and Verlynda not into over-the-top selling or hype. They just want to help marriages, including yours. Will you join them in this great calling?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Caleb \u0026amp; Verlynda\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\nHi there! I\u2019m Caleb Simonyi-Gindele, and this is my delightful wife, Verlynda. You can tell which one of us married \u2018up\u2019, hey? ?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.onlyyouforever.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/caleb-verlynda-marriage-on-bench.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a Registered Clinical Counsellor (#4323) with the BC Association of Clinical Counsellors and I specialize in marriage counselling and pornography addiction recovery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe live in rural Saskatchewan, Canada. Just about 10 miles from US border and the state of North Dakota.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s very isolated here and very peaceful. There are upsides to that which we love (like the dog and our 3 daughters having acres and acres to explore! And our wonderful church family.) but the downside is that the population density is pretty much nil.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s part of the reason why we brought our message to the world through the Internet. Now our goal is to reach and influence as many marriages as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u2019t want to idealize our marriage. We\u2019ve been married since 1999, and still have our moments of frustration, anger and offence. You have no idea how frustrating it is to be a subject matter expert on marriage and still have those \u201cDuh!\u201d husband moments! But, somehow, I do manage!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you listen to our podcast you\u0027ll just hear us being real. (That\u0027s one of our core values: authenticity.) But, you\u0027ll hear us laugh a lot and you\u0027ll hear us squabble sometimes too! We don\u0027t always agree but we know how to respect the differences and enjoy each other.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, we hope to help many, many more marriages come to the same place of intimacy and joy.\u003cbr\u003e"
