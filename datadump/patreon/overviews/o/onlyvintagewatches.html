    "summary": "Hi, my name is George and I am passionate about vintage watches. So much so, that I usually buy scrap watches at the local flea market and then try to restore them, most of the time failing miserably, but sometimes being successful (I am getting everyday better...).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI got into watchmaking while restoring my late father\u0027s\u00a0Seiko 7A34-7010 Quartz Chronograph, which I managed to fix after 6 months of research and a lot of trial and error. I am not a professional watchmaker, nor did I attend any watchmaking school: all I know, I learned reading on the internet in forums, and buying books. And of course, buying and fixing old broken watches...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started\u00a0a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx6gG1mrYuyoEKC0miaqQew\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eyoutube channel\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, where I post the videos I make. The videos I make are not technical, and by no means professional: I video myself tearing down the watches and then trying to put them back together, in the hopes nothing goes wrong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started making videos of me restoring my watches since there is nothing more satisfying, for me, to see the final result, but also to visually document all the steps that bring me to a completely restored watch. The videos document my successes, as well as my failures, in making those old watches come to life again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to let the viewers see that this art of watchmakingg is sometimes not so complicated as it seems, founded basically on good eyes, lots of practice and an incredible amount of patience. Oh, and some good steady hands...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s see now why I created this Patreon page....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to dedicate more time to this passion of mine, to show this world of smartphones and smartwatches (URGH!) that there was a time when time was so important, only few selected and wealthy people could afford to have a watch on their wrist, and every single moment of everyone\u0027s life was regulated by the gentle yet constant turn of a balance wheel inside the watch movement. But most importantly, the reason I create the videos is that these mechanical watches, so often forgotten inside the drawers for years, can still be made to tick with a little love and some proper service.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to fund me, every cent counts. You will be contributing in making a man\u0027s dream come true and helping to restore those old wristwatches and pocket watches that once belonged to our fathers and our grandfathers, and that we would so much like to present our sons and grandsons as a testimony of our and their life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need your help to keep saving (buying) these long forgotten watches, and to fund the time I dedicate in restoring them, to source spare parts, buy the necessary tools, and so on. I restored my late father\u0027s watch without having any experience at all: I just wanted to see it run again and keep his memory alive. Help me do the same with somebody else father\u0027s watch."
