    "summary": "Chris Johnson of Out of the Dust Designs is a freelance artist in Placerville, California. He is self-taught and continues to push the boundaries of his art by mixing mediums and techniques to create unique pieces. Chris works in acrylic and watercolor paints, graphite, ink and even wood.\u00a0 Often focusing on his love of comics, anime, manga, sci-fi and fantasy, his goal is to create fantastical imagery and splendiferous nerdery for all to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChris\u0027 story has been published in several local newspapers including the Sparks Tribune and the Reno Gazette Journal and he has been recognized for bringing his Christian faith into his work and business model by donating 10% or more of all his art profits to local charities and donating pieces to local causes. Most notably, Awaken, Inc., which helps stem the tide of human trafficking in Northern Nevada and Doors to Recovery, a Nevada program aimed to help people recover from the struggles of addiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Super Saiya-Fans! I\u0027m excited to launch my Patreon and share this journey with all of you. It\u0027s been many years since I started Out of the Dust and it has evolved and changed much over that time, but my goal has remained the same: To create and share my art with the world, support myself through sales of my work and to give back to the world by donating at least 10% of what God blesses me with to charity. I\u0027m looking forward to making new content like videos, tutorials and contests and expanding my own knowledge and abilities by sharing that content with you guys. I\u0027m an equal opportunity nerd and most of work focuses on the things I love: anime, video games, movies and pop culture. So, as long you\u0027re into some of those things, too, you\u0027re in good company here! I hope you\u0027ll decide to partner with me in this adventure of creating art out of the dust of our imagination! Let\u0027s have fun, create, and love God and people together!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Chris\u003cbr\u003eOwner / Artscaper\u003cbr\u003e"
