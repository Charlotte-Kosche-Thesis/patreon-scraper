As I began my journey around the globe I didn\u0027t really know what to expect. I would hear stories of other countries and other people, but I really didn\u0027t know anything about them. I had lived in the United States my entire life, and did not have very much international experience before I left everything to go travel. What I found was beyond all of exceptions. Sure the sights were great, but wow the people are what changed my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-sit4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/251003_178789068924105_1274483947_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0\u0026amp;oh=7663a29d429f88ac8522b1ffe47b28ae\u0026amp;oe=5B64B604\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0Episode 30: Superman\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the greatest gifts of travel is the ability to look at your own culture. When you live in one place your entire life it is hard to look outside of your day to day. There really isn\u0027t anything to compare our culture to since that is the only thing I knew. It is safe to say that changed when I went abroad. The American way of life was put underneath a microscope. Fresh perspectives and fresh ways of life helped me understand not only the good and bad of my culture, but what was important to me. I began to pick and choose my own lifestyle instead of the one passed down by cultural norms. Surrounding myself with the habits that truly resonated with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://unreportedlondon.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/poets-for-hire1.jpg?w=1024\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0Episode 20: Poets for Hire\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I continued my journey and the weeks turned to months, a rather unknown feeling began to grow. The more people I talked to, the more grateful I became. Some people really received a bad starting hand in the game of life, but continued on with a giant smile on their face. The resilience of people is astounding. Listening to the setbacks of others helped me realize just how lucky I was to have food on the table, but also how resilient I was in the obstacles I\u0027ve had to overcome. Nothing seems too awful anymore. I\u0027m grateful to be alive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-sit4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/27698_124230620936889_2252540_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0\u0026amp;oh=f491c122c05599470c3ed1cffa0cdcc7\u0026amp;oe=5B2FA4A5\" style=\"background-color: initial; width: 233px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eEpisode 15: Warrior\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes it seems like the world is full of hatred. That the bad is starting to outweigh the good. This is absolutely untrue. My travels have reminded me that humanity is inherently good.

This podcast captures the stories of the people I\u0027ve met along the way. It isn\u0027t quite the same as a one way ticket, but the podcast will help cultivate the gifts that travel has given me in the comfort of your own home.
