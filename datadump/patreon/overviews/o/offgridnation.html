    "summary": "Hey Y\u0027all,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy channel motto is: Educate, Motivate and, Build Community. That\u0027s just another way to say that I want to teach others about what I\u0027m doing to become more self sufficient, motivate others to follow their dreams and make friends with like minded people along the way. If we share our knowledge, skills and resources we will be better off as a community. As of October 1, 2016 I will be selling my business and I\u0027ll essentially be unemployed for the first time in my adult life. This is a little scary because I\u0027m not sure where the income needed to sustain my family will come from but I\u0027m confident that it will also help me really start running down the path to self sufficiency that I have, up until now, been crawling down. This will most likely be harder than the career I\u0027m giving up but I also think it will be more rewarding. I know in my heart that God is looking out for me and my family and I know he will provide what we need if we do our part. If you like what I do, want to see more and can afford to sponsor me, please consider it. If not, that\u0027s okay too. I realize that we all aren\u0027t in a position to do that. In either case, come along for the ride and be part of this fun, smart and growing community of people that really GET IT. Thanks so much for helping grow the nation. ~Tommy"

     "about": "I\u0027m your average American guy that was grown up in a middle class, white collar household. My parents were born during the great depression so we were instilled with a blue collar heart and were taught the value of hard work. We were taught that nobody was going to give us a handout in life; we had to work and save for it. For the last 17 years I have made my living as a financial planner/wealth manager. In short, I helped people make good financial decisions. I have worked for a major wire-house, two regional banks, and for the last 7 years I have owned my own business as an independent registered investment advisor. This has given me a unique perspective on the economy and has allowed me to witness the dark underbelly of the way things work from the inside. \u003cbr\u003eI have an amazing wife and 2 kids that support me in my efforts but that wasn\u0027t always the case. Early on in my \"awakening\" I did get several raised eyebrows along the way but they have come around. So, we are on a new path and on a journey that 5 years ago I couldn\u0027t even imagine. No more BMW, hello tractor. So long 18 holes of golf, hello beekeeping. You get the idea. I hope you find what we are doing interesting and inspiring. I hope you are either on your own path or have a plan in place to get there. I look forward to meeting you along the way.\u003cbr\u003eYou can connect with me on Facebook or YouTube by searching Off Grid Nation or you can email me at carolinaprepper7@gmail.com.\u003cbr\u003e",
