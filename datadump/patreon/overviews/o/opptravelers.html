Or get arrested. Which is odd. But what we have done is collect some seriously funny stories along the way. Ranging form humorous anecdotes to terrifying moments that were only funny much, much later, we bring those stories to you on our podcast every single week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou like humor, and you wish you traveled more, right? \u003c/strong\u003eSupporting our show on Patreon scratches both of those itches. And gives us some scratch! (See what I did there?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSome questions you might be asking:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"So why do you need the money?\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking our home-base in Bangkok is much cheaper than living back in America, to be sure. But it still costs money to put the show out and to travel around to have the adventures worthy of a weekly podcast. The more income we get from the show, the more attention we can give it!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"If enough don\u0027t pay up, you\u0027re going to quit producing cool stuff?\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNot at all. We\u0027re committed to cranking out the current content. We\u0027re not holding it hostage, sticking it behind a paywall, or have any intention of taking it away in the future. If you know us, you know that\u0027s not our style. We\u0027ll keep doing what we\u0027re doing. Your support lets us do it longer. And could unlock some secret projects as particular milestones are reached.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn short, you\u0027re helping us do more, for longer.

As serendipity played a major role in how that year-long sabbatical unfolded, it only made sense to incorporate that feeling into our name. Our style of traveling is not for everyone. But it works for us!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we started traveling, we started podcasting. Our first goal was to keep our friends and family updated with where in the world we were at any given moment. But what we discovered was this: traveling our way had some pretty funny moments that our audience couldn\u0027t get enough of!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, we\u0027re featuring the lighter side of travel, with a weekly podcast fully of funny stories of our own and from fellow travelers. Sometimes \"funny ha-ha\", sometimes \"oh poop we almost died and wasn\u0027t \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e funny?\" funny. We think you\u0027ll dig it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon, our sponsors help us keep the funny travel train rolling along. Because we sure as hell aren\u0027t getting rich off this lifestyle, that\u0027s for sure.",
