Well, I love to create nerdy tech content. But what does that mean? I usually write articles about projects and builds that I made and wanted to share with you, sometimes accompanied by a video. Here\u0027s an example of the work that I plan to do. This was the first video I ever made, but I think it gives you a good idea of what type of content I want to produce:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KTXg2xh4yEc\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s where I could need some help. These projects take a lot of time to do and sometimes cost a lot of money. However I don\u0027t just make videos about my projects. Here\u0027s another example of my content. In this little series I order cheap electronic kits and review them:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XAngMIO1uo0?rel=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you like my content so far and you\u0027d like to see even better and larger builds, you can support me with a small pledge. Make sure to check out my rewards, there might be something that you like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow there\u0027s only one thing left to say: Thank you again. Thanks for taking the time to read this and thanks for considering to support me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave a great day! :)"
