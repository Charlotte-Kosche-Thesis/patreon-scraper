I\u0027ve always had a great love \nof not just video games, but of connecting people to products and brands\n that I really have faith in. My goal is to help keep gamers informed, \nwhile trying to paint a clear picture of what a game has to offer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\n Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eWell, my dream is to be able to focus on this and make it a \ncareer. I am pretty nervous setting out on this wild trip, and so far it\n has been great. My hope is that if I can inform people and establish a \ncommunication with them, that I can produce reviews on the games people \nare interested in. But I also love to shine a light on indie and small \npublisher gems that may have gotten missed in the big AAA world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal is to remain ad free and provide opinions free of obligation to third parties. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo,\n please, feel free to look around. And if you enjoy my articles or any \nother material I put up, I appreciate any patronage you can send my way.\n \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks\u003cbr\u003e-Old Man Mordaith"
