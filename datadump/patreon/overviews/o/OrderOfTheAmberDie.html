For our\n association, authenticity means playing published adventures as closely\n as possible to the author\u0027s  original intent, with deviation only \noccurring for player decisions and actions.  We never alter the outcome \nof rolls, and little benefit of the doubt is ever\n thrown to our players.  Consisting of the \nsame GM and an active pool of between ten and fifteen players, \u003cstrong\u003ewe have \nbeen an association since 1987\u003c/strong\u003e.  To date, Order of the Amber Die has \ncompleted \u003cstrong\u003e143 \u003c/strong\u003epublished adventures across five editions of the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo date we have done three large-scale projects playing through Pazio, Inc.\u0027s published material, two of which were done via partnership with Paizo:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Emerald Spire Project - Finished the \u003cem\u003eThe Emerald Spire\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eSuperdungeon\u003c/em\u003e\nin 195 hours of play across 35 days, becoming the\u003cstrong\u003e first group in the world\u003c/strong\u003e to\ncomplete Paizo\u0027s largest module to date.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Giantslayer Endeavor - Played\nthrough all 6 volumes of Paizo\u0027s \u003cem\u003eGiantslayer\u003c/em\u003e Adventure Path  in 6\nmarathon sessions across 6 months, setting a \u003cstrong\u003eworld record \u003c/strong\u003efor tabletop RPGs.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Strange Aeons Experiment - With 5 players and GM who knew nothing about the Elder Mythos, finished all 6 parts of Paizo\u0027s \u003cem\u003eStrange Aeons\u003c/em\u003e Adventure Path in 6\nmarathon sessions across 10 months.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are known for our \u003cstrong\u003eMarathon \u003c/strong\u003estyle of play in which we push through as much material as possible in a single session, putting in \u003cstrong\u003e100+\u003c/strong\u003e\nhours across 5 days, spending more than 60 hours in actual session time.\u00a0 Our game is documented with high-quality, dramatic still photography and what we call a Living PDF. This document details almost every aspect of our project and changes constantly as we complete published material and gain new insights.\u00a0 This\ndocument, along with supplemental material we create to accompany our projects,\nis designed to help GMs and players alike as they seek to push their game\nexperiences to a higher level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can imagine, putting together projects of this magnitude (5\nto 7 adults playing playing an entire volume of an AP in a few days, requiring\ndozens of maps, as well as hundreds of miniatures and special effects) is incredibly time-consuming and quite expensive.\u00a0\u00a0 We are looking to push the envelope of how immersive and inspiring tabletop roleplaying can be; in order to make that happen, we need the support and help of our fans and the RPG community.\u00a0 Tabletop gaming has given so much to all of us here in the Order. We\nwant to give back as much as we can to the game and to all of the\ndedicated players and GMs around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you can pledge or not, we will still continue to put out enriching content in our Marathon format, playing through published adventures from the world\u0027s greatest game.\u00a0 Every\nfan and dollar will go a long way towards helping us to create more amazing\nadventure projects, and as Patrons you\u0027ll have access to exclusive content,\nlimited edition Amber Die swag, GM/player advice and much more! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e for any contributions you can make, but most of all, thank you to everyone who gives us the most precious of assets: their time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e- Order of the Amber Die\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
