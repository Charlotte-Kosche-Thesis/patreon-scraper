F\u003c/strong\u003eirst, I\u0027d like to thank you for joining the Splash Patreon community! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMy wife Susanne and I, and our four children Victor, Jack, Lucky, and Rose, are building sailing fishing boats that will help small fishermen make a good living for their families by eliminating the cost of fuel. These boats will also make fish affordable for you, wherever you live!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFish is healthy, fish tastes great, and everyone we know likes fresh ocean fish. But none of us can afford it because it\u2019s so expensive.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eWe checked Costco\u2019s prices the other day: $3.59 per pound for organic ground beef; $9.99 per pound for frozen farmed salmon; $17.99 for fresh wild-caught salmon; and $16.99 per pound for fresh mahi-mahi, ono, and yellowfin tuna.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eOur favorite is mahi-burgers, but they cost 4-1/2 times as much as organic hamburger! We have them for birthdays and anniversaries, kind of like some people buy caviar or champagne. We like eating ocean fish; we just can\u2019t afford to. And this bothers us.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo we\u2019re doing something about it, not just for our family, but for everyone on the planet.\u003c/strong\u003e We\u2019re building boats that take the cost of fuel out of the \u201cwhat does ocean fish cost\u201d equation. No longer will the small fisherman have to devote one-half of his total income just to paying his fuel costs.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThis is a huge advantage to the fisherman too!\u003c/strong\u003e With one of our boats, he can catch half as much fish and make the same amount of \u201ctake-home pay\u201d. A fisherman in one of our boats also makes a huge impact on conservation of ocean resources when he only needs to catch half as much to still take care of his family!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThey say it takes a village to raise a child; well, in Polynesia where we live, it takes a village to build a boat.\u003c/strong\u003e Everyone\u0027s involved, from the smallest child who fetches coconut fronds to shade the canoe from the sun, to the master canoe builder who prays among the trees in the forest for days before selecting the one to make the canoe.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u0027re the same. \u003c/strong\u003eWe may be experienced boat builders and blue water sailors, but we still need our village. Especially for this project; because it\u0027s the most ambitious one we\u0027ve ever undertaken. It\u0027s truly the start of a blue-green revolution in the way we do things on the ocean! We\u0027re not just making a pretty picture or a new iPhone app; we\u0027re building a BOAT!\nThat\u0027s why we need your help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe boat we\u2019re using is perfect for \u201cartisanal \nfisheries\u201d. These are non-mechanized fisheries involving small boats with small crews, which produce maximum benefits for their local communities while taking a minimum amount of resources out of the ocean. \nWe\u2019ll compare other benefits sailing artisanal fisheries have over \n\"normal\" corporate factory fishing, but for now, take a look at one of \nthese boats:\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027re starting with a boat design like this one by master \nsailor and marine designer Russell Brown (son of Jim Brown, the renowned\n multihull designer and builder):\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://newageofsail.com/docs/Pacific-Bee-new-looks530px.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis boat of Russell\u0027s design is set up for cruising: extended voyaging \nacross the ocean, with stops at islands and countries along the way.\nWith our experience in commercial fishing in tropical waters, we\u0027ve \nadapted this type of design specifically for those fisheries; our first \nboat has a 2,000-pound capacity refrigerated fish hold, basic crew bunks\n and cooking area, fishing areas, and live bait wells. \n\u003cstrong\u003eIt will look \nsimilar to the one in the following video:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cem\u003eHigh-Speed Proa Sailing Video:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"525\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Rr_odHe5-Qw?rel=0\" width=\"700\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLet me tell you a story about sailboats, fishing, and the sea:\u003c/strong\u003e\nMy wife Susanne and I, and our four children Victor, Jack, Lucky, and Rose are building the sailing work boats that will take Hawaii\u2019s commercial fishermen to sea, safely and profitably, when gas becomes too expensive. These boats will help them make a good living for their families, even if gas is rationed or prices hit historical highs again (as in the past). \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause they are sailboats, they will allow the fisherman to catch \n\u003cstrong\u003ehalf as much fish, yet still make the same amount of money\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cspan style=\"\"\u003ebecause he doesn\u0027t have to spend half his income supporting the big oil companies!\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause of this, sailing fishing boats are \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003ethe\u003c/span\u003e most sustainable, ecologically green way\u003c/strong\u003e to harvest the ocean. Although sailing fish boats are a big part of the solution; we also need to implement intelligent fisheries management solutions such as EBS (Ecosystem-Based Management) as part of our strategy for sustainably harvesting the oceans into the future.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis type of boat is faster than most motorboats but doesn\u0027t use any gas;\n\u003c/strong\u003e doesn\u0027t pound in a choppy sea, and the motion is far, far less than that of a motorboat at the same speed. This translates into less crew fatigue and more energy for fishing when \nyou get to the fishing grounds, a better-rested crew when they hit the \ndock back at their home port to unload fish, and a boat that\u2019s safer for\n the crew during the whole fishing trip.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is perfect for any areas with small artisanal fisheries; it will make these fisheries more profitable for the fisherman while conserving the fishing stocks at the same time. These boats are also perfect for small cargo and passenger carriers in lengths up to 150 feet or so. That sounds like a tall order, so let me explain why we know we\u0027ll pull it off:\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ve been there before.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nI saw this situation coming a long time before it hit: I designed, built and launched my 56-foot sailing fishing vessel \u201cTropic Bird\u201d in Hawaii in 1978 as a solution to the fuel rationing and crazy gas price hikes I\u2019d experienced while living on the mainland in 1974, after the Arab oil embargo doubled gas prices at the pump.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI figured the time would come when I couldn\u2019t afford fuel for a conventional motor-powered fishing boat, so I built a sailing fish boat instead, and fished her successfully for 17 years in the open ocean off Hawaii.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe wind is free; diesel isn\u0027t.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nThe concept of the 56-foot Tropic Bird was a fishing vessel that \u201clived off the wind\u201d, and it worked. An important factor in her financial success was that Tropic Bird had her own refrigeration system, which meant I never had to purchase or haul ice. I never had to watch helpelssly while my ice melted during those times it took me longer than expected to find the fish (you see, if it was guaranteed, they\u2019d call it \u201ccatching\u201d instead of \u201cfishing\u201d!). When I found the fish and boated the first ones, I just turned on the Big Fridge to keep them cold.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e(Below) My 56-foot sailing work boat Tropic Bird, at the dock in Kawaihae, Hawaii, sometime in 1980. Sailing fish boats were profitable then, and even more so now.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://newageofsail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/TropicBirdKawaihae2FINAL700px-1.jpg\"\u003eThe operating cost of a sailing work boat such as Tropic Bird, or the new ones we\u2019re building, is one-quarter what the operating cost of an equivalent motor-powered vessel using ice is. As a result, if the Hawaiian fisherman using this boat brings in even half as much fish, he still makes the same amount of money after expenses as if he was doing it with a motorboat. Ask any fisherman if this would be a good idea, and he\u0027ll say \"of course!\".\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnother way to look at this is the amount of fish such a boat can conserve. If our Hawaiian fisherman makes the same amount of money catching half as much fish, he can leave the other half in the ocean and still fund a decent lifestle for his family. This is completely in line with the ancient Hawaiian values of conservation and sustainable management of our ocean resources.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e(Below) My 56-foot sailing work boat Tropic Bird, trolling on the way to the fishing grounds off the Hilo Coast of the Big Island in 1984.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cimg height=\"497\" src=\"https://newageofsail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/TropicBirdOutlineFINAL-700x497.jpg\" width=\"700\"\u003e\n39 years ago, I thought the world would see the obvious desirability of energy-efficient work boats such as his 56-foot Tropic Bird, and I\u2019d design and build more. But the embargo and the rationing ended, and gas prices went down.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlthough I made a good living fishing Tropic Bird because she was so inexpensive to operate, everyone else just gassed up their motorboats and kept on doing it the old way. That was 39 years ago. Now, we feel the world is not only ready for, but also in desperate need of this energy-efficient work boat technology.
