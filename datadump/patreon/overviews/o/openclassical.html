As the only type of music able to take the listener on a continuous journey of emotions, it can be an artistic experience unlike any other. Yet, classical music is often perceived to be on the wane and the industry as a whole is often seen as elitist and out of touch from the general public. Some organizations see these as problems of marketing, but we see these perceptions as containing uncomfortable truths. We aim to change that and have a \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eplan that is working right now\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOUR PURPOSE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOpen Classical is tackling the issues facing classical music in \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003evital \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eways that the \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003elarge es\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003etablished organizations are not equipped to do successfully\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. Our approach is to \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ecreate ground-up structures\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e which mirror those found naturally in the pop music world. Because the classical music industry is a purely top-down structure, the big money spent at the top completely drives the conversation as to what classical musicians should strive for and what they should expect from audiences. Without the confines of the traditional audiences and structures, we don\u2019t take any of the conventional wisdom for granted, and are able to experiment freely, creating innovations that have \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eproven to be both entertaining and effective\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOUR EVENTS AND PLAN\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Classical Open Mic (free for the public)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eWe use this event to create communities that use classical music as a social glue, reinvigorate the love of music in adult amateurs, and provide performance opportunities for classical musicians that can directly connect with fans. Everything that a pop music open mic does, except with generally much more awesome performers, and a paid piano accompanist that will sight read anything from violin concertos to opera arias. This event has reached many people who didn\u2019t previously have a background in classical music, but who discovered it and developed a connection for the music and performers. \u003cstrong\u003eWe currently run 7+ events a month at 3 locations in DFW. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eWith your help, we can expand this important event to other cities and train people how to create the atmosphere that has made the event so successful. \u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(219,238,243);\"\u003eWith a $20/month subscription, you can be the named sponsor at one classical open mic per year.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(219,238,243);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Professional Level Chamber Music in Relaxed Venues (priced like a movie ticket)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nKnown as the \u201cOpen Classical Artist Series\u201d, these are ticketed concerts placed in venues where the audience can usually eat and drink, like rock club listening rooms or private rooms in restaurants. These are listening experiences, many times in amplified settings. There is a focus on up and coming performers and new composition that takes the audience on a journey of emotions. We do each program multiple times, generally in each of the cities we have grown a community through the open mics. Our successful February 2015 program featured 3 local contemporary composers along with a couple of historical greats, and drew 250 people between the 4 shows. \u003cstrong\u003eWe do 4 to 6 different Artist Series programs each year, with multiple concerts of each program.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, we can expand this to other cities, creating a mid-level touring route for emerging performers and composers, making it financially viable to bring groups from NY and LA to Texas and vice versa. This is something that doesn\u0027t exist today at all.

New Works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout new music that appeals to a wide part of the classical music audience, classical music will eventually fade and go away. It\u2019s just inevitable, and there\u2019s no amount of jazzing up Vivaldi that will stop that. If every rock band now were a Beatles cover band, rock music wouldn\u2019t be doing nearly as well as classical music, which has weathered that very same situation since even before the Beatles. There hasn\u2019t been a new composer capturing wide public attention for nearly 70 years, and the change in culture we aim for has a direct aim at fixing that situation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf a touring route can be established where new works to be played, listened to and enjoyed instead of being submitted to a panel for an academic competition, talented people will rise to the occasion and the world will once again be filled with great new classical music. When classical open mic becomes the musical salons of our day, composers, performers and public will once again be joined in a symbiotic relationship as they were a century ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWith your help we can call for new works to be submitted by composers, and the composers whose works are chosen for the touring route will be paid and promoted. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(219,238,243);\"\u003eWith a $20/month subscription, you\u2019ll get to vote on new works you want to hear on the Artist Series.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBECOME A PATRON AND A PARTNER IN OUR QUEST TO CREATE A VIBRANT NEW CULTURE FOR CLASSICAL MUSIC.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
