I\u0027m very passionate about my field of study and have high goals for myself in the future!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy life situation:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this patreon to help me during a very rough time in my life. I currently moved out of my abusive father\u0027s home and moved in with friends who temporarily took me in so I could get back on my feet and be able to afford a better life for myself! And I\u0027m very thankful.\u003cbr\u003eSo far I was able to get a new job, started taking art commissions to help with my current income situation, and working on handling my severe anxiety.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, I\u0027m handicapped on many things that I could do. While I was moving out of my father\u0027s home, he took my car the whole day and I had to take an Uber and meet my friends at a secret location so my father wouldn\u0027t take a photo of their license plate. (Yes, this almost happened. My father ended up taking a photo of my Uber drivers license plate. He lied that he was in a different location but was just waiting for my friends to arrive the whole time.) Because of this I issued a restraining order against my father. I trusted my sister to give me a ride to my friend\u0027s apartment prior to this situation happening and gave her the address since she was the one driving. She ended up being an hour late to picking me up, ignoring my messages and calls, and then pretending she didn\u0027t know what I was requesting from her. A week into living in my friend\u0027s home, she came by uninvited and banged on their door early morning. I never answered the door. A few days later she comes back with her boyfriend wearing his security officer uniform (looks like a police uniform) and my friends were forced to open the door. All she had to tell me were very rude things and threats. I also put a restraining order against her but she still texts me threats and leaves vulgar voicemails. Restraining orders unfortunately are not always free. I spent $300 on these restraining orders total JUST to feel safe and know an officer will be able to take action if I ever get hurt. It\u0027s put a BIG dent in my wallet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently financially unstable and with my current job, my income isn\u0027t steady as well. I also have no heath care and that\u0027s my priority to have handled as I get sick very easily and do rely on doctor appointments for medication for my hypo-thyroid. As well, I have decided to not attend fall semester of college just so I could be financially stable but I plan to return for wintermester once I have my life become more steady.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGOOD NEWS THOUGH!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI have incredibly amazing friends and followers. I\u0027m so blessed and I don\u0027t know how much more I can show how grateful I am. I\u0027m much more happier despite being extremely stressed but I wouldn\u0027t have it any other way. Thankyou to those who have helped me leave my father and those who kept me in their thoughts throughout my time living with him and offering a shoulder to lean on.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
