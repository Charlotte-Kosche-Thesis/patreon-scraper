I love movies. Ever since Iwas a kid, movies have been a big part of my life and something I\u2019m very passionate about. Almost everything that I do in my life is related to movies in some way, including my personal projects, which I\u2019ll talk about in a second. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut first I want to address something that has been nagging at me lately. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all know that dozens of new science fiction and fantasy movies, including superhero films, come out in theaters every year. But how many of them are new original stories, not based off an existing franchise - not sequels or prequels or remakes or reboots or even adaptations - and actually do well? Sadly, not that many. But it\u2019s because of their originality (even though that\u2019s what Hollywood seems to think). It\u2019s because of either one of two reasons: they are poorly marketed or poorly made. \u003cbr\u003eThese movies, no matter how much potential they had, don\u2019t even stand a chance. And I want to change that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to tell epic original stories that will resonate with you. That make you laugh, make you cry, send shivers down your spine, and capture your imagination. I don\u0027t want to just make flashy blockbusters with lots of explosions and stuff, I want them to mean something to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to build epic worlds with big beating hearts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill I succeed?

How much you choose to donate is up to you, it could be as little as $1 a month. But it\u2019s your enthusiasm to see these movies become a reality, your encouragement to keep working on these projects, that will really mean the most to me.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd even if you can\u2019t donate any money, and believe me, I totally understand if you can\u2019t, just being a cheerleader for these projects will mean so much. Leave comments when I post things, share them around with people you think might like them, help spread the word.
