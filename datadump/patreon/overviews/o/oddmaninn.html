    "summary": "Odd Man Inn is a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit farm animal shelter. We help animals that have suffered abuse and neglect, outlived their \u201cusefulness\u201d, or have outgrown their home. We rescue, rehabilitate, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eand find adoptive families\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e who will allow them to live a natural life of peace and safety. Our animal residents live as members of our family while waiting to find their own perfect forever home. To date, we have helped over 300 farm animals to safety. That number grows every single day.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis journey began because our family refused to give up on a dog with a bite history. His name is Roswell. After a year of professional help, Roswell was out of options. We moved him from Portland, Oregon to a small piece of property where he could be safe and free. We made room for other vulnerable animals who were also out of options, and Odd Man INN Animal Refuge was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are working towards a bigger mission to give all our animal residents a \u003cem\u003evoice\u003c/em\u003e.  By sharing their stories of struggle and triumph, we give them the opportunity to be ambassadors for their own kind.  We stand beside them in the fight against abuse, neglect, exploitation, and consumption.  We give them a chance to live in a world where true equality exists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u00a0welcome both the animals and humans involved in Odd Man INN\u00a0to be a\u00a0part of our REAL life when they are on the property.  Animals live as part of our family while they wait to be adopted.  Visitors are\u00a0included\u00a0as part of the crew.  As a Patron, we invite you in to gain access to the personal details about daily life and decisions that run our organization.  We\u0027ll do the hard work of sharing candid photos\u00a0and detailed stories of rescues and adoptions.  This is also where we will post breaking news about big events and changes in our organization.
