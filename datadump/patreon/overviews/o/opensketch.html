    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\tHi, I\u0027m Erika! I\u0027m known around the internets as open_sketchbook. I write roleplaying games.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been playing RPGs since I was 13 years old, and writing them for just about as long. I\u0027m fascinated by the mechanics and concepts of RPGs of all kinds, and I\u0027ve struck upon a kind of mental formula that keeps me writing and refining.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of RPGs do you write?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\tI like my games to be highly tailored to the kind of story the game is trying to present; I love learning interesting new systems with strong core mechanics. I want there to be a game made for every kind of story and genre there is, even if it\u0027s just a hack of something else. Seeing careful design work go into crafting a system to really make a story shine is real great, and I wanna see as much of that as possible.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027m on a bit of a Powered by the Apocalypse kick at the moment, but it\u0027s hardly all I write. I have crunchy systems, like my d10 powered scarcity-and-misery simulation engine Hard Knocks, or my infantry system PATROL, on real world maps, and I also have weird custom little systems like Must be Tuesday. And sometimes I just write a one-page game about Arnold Schwarzenegger, like you do.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhere can I find your Games?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\n\tI sell my games on DriveThruRPG under the label of Newstand Press. It\u0027s like a News-Stand, like the place you buy newspapers, but also like, a new beginning, a stand for something novel? I dunno, it felt clever at the time.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/4945/Newstand-Press\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYou can find my store here.\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/4945/Newstand-Press\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/themes/dtrpg/site-logo-redesignd.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy Patreon?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\tMy goal with this Patreon is to release a game once a month. It could be one of my full-sized products, it could be a microgame, it could be something in between. Regardless, I want to have at least one new piece of content out per month, and a financial incentive for that is pretty strong.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI also want to use this Patreon to remind myself to keep people updated on my progress, to set goals and follow through. I\u0027m not the most organized person in the world, so this should help me work on that.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Watcha Workin\u0027 On, Gurl?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s hard to keep track, but here\u0027s what I got in the hopper right now.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eMy current Big Project is a Powered by the Apocalypse game called Flying Circus. It\u0027s a dieselpunk fantasy game where you play a company of mercenary heroes flying bizarre biplanes against beasts and bandits, trying to keep one step ahead of bankruptcy and shape a world post- an industrial-age apocalypse into something better than it\u0027s imperialistic past. It\u0027s got fairly crunchy, yet loose and exciting plane battles, interspersed with drunken wildness and stress-induced mania on the ground. Fly hard, party hard.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eThe eternal project of 5 Across the Heart, a custom system that makes Sailor Moon flavoured Magical Girl stories happen, is right there on the backburner. You chase your heart\u0027s desire, throw around motes representing your emotional well-being, and transform into your beautiful idealized self! I\u0027m really quite proud of the system as it is now and it just needs to be pushed forward, which I\u0027m doing in fits and starts. A lot of you are probably here for this!\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eNew Frontiers, a game that debuted at Metatopia 2016, is an original-flavour Star Trek-style RPG originally written in response to my dread at a 2d10 powered Trek game. It\u0027s kind of PbtA-adjacent; structurally similar, but with lots of strange new stuff. Expect weirdly hard-science space combat, a unique skill system, a \"conditions matrix\", and plenty of out-of-this-world technology in a retro-future setting where we didn\u0027t stop at the moon. The goal will be a huge, full-colour, hardcover book, illustrated with 3d models and stylized painting.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ePATROL has expansions coming; \u003cem\u003eWind of Change\u003c/em\u003e, an expansion centered on African conflicts between 1960 and 1980 being the big one. I\u0027m writing it in conjunction with a friend and hoping to use it as an educational jumping-off point for taking about the Rhodesia, the South African Border War, and other conflicts that arose from decolonization and apartheid. \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nThere\u0027s other stuff, but some of it is secret, and some of it is in limbo."
