I write things- for the year of 2018, my resolution was to write one short story a day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the course of doing that, I kind of started a series. It\u0027s called \u003cem\u003eNull Time\u003c/em\u003e, and you can find it on my subreddit\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiWrites/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m also writing a novel, but that\u0027s not on reddit nor really anywhere you can read until it\u0027s to be published. That is of course, if my ultimate goal hasn\u0027t been fulfilled. If you come to this page and find that it \u003cem\u003ehas \u003c/em\u003ebeen fulfilled, you\u0027ll likely find the first draft of that on reddit.\u00a0"
