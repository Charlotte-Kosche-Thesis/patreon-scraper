I recently spent a week with Jimmy in New York and I have hours and hours of material that I need to transcribe and organize. Patreon supporters will immediately gain access to a documentary about my time in NY that is just over 1 hour long.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also make videos at my YouTube channel,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/billlivolsi\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOne Car Workshop\u003c/a\u003e.

Right now, I am splitting my time between writing and client builds. The client work helps me pay the bills, but it\u0027s a necessity more than a passion. Given the choice, I would rather inspire others to make things than build bookshelves so I can keep the lights on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to support One Car Workshop but cannot make a pledge, you can also share my videos and articles with your friends and spread the word around social media.
