I\u0027m Jeffrey, and I make Bible-literacy resources for people. If you\u0027re here, there are a few things you need to know . . .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE BIG IDEA\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGet people addicted to the Bible. It\u0027s one of the most significant books in the world\u2014and certainly the most important to the Christian faith. But it\u0027s also a massive tome.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m working to help people get the big ideas of the Bible, and grasp how all the pieces fit together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat means I\u2019m making blog posts, books, infographics, comics, music, and pretty much anything I can to help folks understand the Bible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO AM I HELPING?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u2019ve found that this appeals to three groups of people:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eCurious folks who just want to know more about the Bible. (You wouldn\u2019t believe how many people show up at OverviewBible.com every week to see what the shortest book of the Bible is!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePastors and teachers looking for teaching aides.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLong-time Bible geeks like me who just like to bond over how cool the Bible is.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE SITUATION\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOverviewBible is a labor of love right now. It began as a side project, and continues to be something I work on when I don\u2019t have any \u201creal job\u201d tasks on my plate. However, it helps more people than probably anything else I\u2019ve ever done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I want to keep helping people, so almost everything I make has a free version. My dream is to build and grow a library of Bible-study resources that anyone can use, whether they\u2019re a megachurch pastor in California or a part-time theology professor in Kenya. I don\u2019t want finances to be the barrier to good material. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s the deal: making resources takes time, money, and talent. I would like to start inviting seminary professors, pastors, designers, animators, etc., to help me create more and better resources. Some funding will help me crank up both the pace and the quality of OverviewBible content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSOME IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u2019m not asking you to support me. I\u2019m asking you to support my work. I have a job, and OverviewBible makes a little money here and there from some affiliate partnerships. Nobody starves if I don\u2019t get funding. ;-)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u2019m making stuff whether you fund me or not. This is a project I started in 2013, and I\u2019ve worked on it through three different job shifts (including starting my own business) and two cross-country moves\u2014just because I want to.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIf you like my stuff and can get behind my mission, I\u2019d be super, super grateful for your support. =)\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
