At our core, Max and Cassi run the games.\nBetween the two of them they have over 30 years of GMing experience! (To be\nfair, Cassi is close to celebrating her 5th year of running games.\nMax has been GMing since he was 11 years old.) They take crafting tales very\nseriously, whether it\u2019s simply changing a module to fit a better character\nstory arc or different game system, or world building an entire campaign\nsetting. From creation myth to geopolitical conflict in their own campaign settings, they want the characters\nto make their mark on the world. Because of the feedback they\u2019ve received from their\nplayers, they decided to start recording game sessions. Since January 2017,\nthey have recorded every single game they\u2019ve ran in the hope to present them as\npodcasts for others to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe majority of our players have been tabletop gamers for\ndecades. We have more than a century of collective role playing experience!\nMany started in their teens on AD\u0026amp;D, James Bond, Shadowrun 1st and 2nd, Aberrant, and even (gasp!) Rolemaster! They know how to build complex\nand engaging characters, and they keep the characters they make grounded in\ntheir backstory, no matter how powerful they become as they participate in the\nstory. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eHow can you\nhelp?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nWe have big dreams of creating the most entertaining and\nhighest quality podcasts and videos we\u2019re capable of making.

You could be a contact, Mr. Johnson, tavern keeper, or quest giver (depending on the game), or even a guest runner when the group needs to hire some help to get the job done. Our Producer will help you make sure your mic and recording set up are the best they can be so you can be heard loud and clear along with the cast. Group recording sessions and Twitch streams are typically held on Sundays from 6:30-10:30pm EST, however some recurring roles can be scheduled to record on other days when necessary. In addition, you can lend your voice to other NPCs for podcast episodes when the need arises (additional voice work is needed almost every episode). While you don\u2019t need to support us on Patreon to voice NPCs in our podcast, you will be given priority over other volunteers.\u00a0\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRewards:\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-Become part of the podcast and live stream on Twitch as your own (possibly recurring) guest character.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-Add one NPC, location, run, quest, or event idea per month to be used in the show and podcast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-Additional 3 karma to use any way you\u0027d like, in or out of combat, to assist PCs, NPCs, or the GM during our live stream games on Twitch.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-Early access to new content 2 days before everyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-Earn 1 karma every live stream game to give a character (or the GM) in combat a reroll of their dice, a temporary edge, or an increase in damage for one attack by 1d6.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-The endless gratitude of all of us here at Original Box Set.\u003c/p\u003e",
