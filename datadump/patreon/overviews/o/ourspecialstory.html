    "summary": "Hey! Thanks for taking the time to check out Our Special Story. We are the Klinkenberg\u0027s and our family life is a little different from that of the normal family. Our oldest son Elijah was born with special needs. Now-a-days, we have one simple goal; to serve the special needs community by inviting people into our story and helping the world to understand the life of a special needs family a little better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we found out that 9 in 10 marriages who have a special needs child as their first born ends in divorce, we knew we had to do something! Many special needs families live in loneliness and frustration. Lonely because many of those around them don\u0027t know how to relate to their situation. And frustrated because of the incredible hardship they face every day. Our goal is simple - to increase awareness by sharing our story and the keys we have picked up along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in! We want to change the world and would love you to be part of our exclusive community of world changers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is so much we can learn from each other and from the special needs community around the world - We have learnt what true beauty, love, and courage look like. So with that in mind we want to give you access to the same life changing experiences and conversations!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Podcasts:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur podcasts are where we laugh together, share the highs and lows we\u0027ve recently faced, and talk about what we have learned. Listen in as we have interviews and segments with guests, friends, and family members. In our podcasts we spend time chatting about the awkward questions and topics that many people want to ask or talk about when it comes to special needs but never feel like they can. We also answer our patrons questions live on the show!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Videos:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an Our Special Story patron you can also get access to our videos. Exclusive to our Patreon members, you get to watch \"behind the scenes\" videos of us doing what we do.\u00a0Our goal is to share every part of our story with you so you will see us at our best AND at our worst. We aren\u0027t afraid of being raw and real. In an environment as crazy and abstract as our family, there is always plenty of beauty, fun, weirdness, love, pain, life, and mystery to share.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur E-books:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love writing and have created a couple of e-books which are funny, informative, heart wrenching, and eye opening. Our upper tier patrons will have access to all our current e-books AND all our future e-books which we are currently working on!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBonus\u0027s:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of our podcasts, video\u0027s, and e-books we have some additional extras that you, as our Patron, will have exclusive access to. These bonuses include things like blog writings and music. We are excited to be able to share these things with you!\u003cbr\u003e"
