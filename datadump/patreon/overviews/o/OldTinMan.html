    "summary": "Welcome everyone! I\u0027m the Old Tin Man. I analyze the soundtrack of the greatest TV shows, movies and video games on a series called \u0027Score UnCovered\u0027. I also examine and theorize many topics from these movies and such. Please make yourself at home here, grab a cookie, this might take a little bit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube started for me back on September 1st, 2015. A time when the channel was a fun little experiment. The channel was initially created to walkthrough various video games, which allowed me to test the grounds of internet entertainment. My channel was a simple, yet satisfying, part of my life. Over time an evolution refined my content, which I soon become happily comfortable with. Old Tin Man soon became a place I found solace in discussing, analyzing and sharing my thoughts on entertainment through journalism. Next to my original analysis material, I now work on a soundtrack series that I greatly proud of and passion about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUncertainty is how life started for me after getting my Bachelor\u0027s degree in Computer Science, a common factor in everyone\u0027s life after collage, until I discovered my passion in journalism in the form of a visual output. YouTube soon became the place I could devote my interest in the arts of film making, musical composition and video game development. It was here that I was fortunate enough to find viewers that found the same attentiveness in these industries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are the ones that pushed me to further dig into my dreams and continue something I love doing. I wanted to make Patreon a place where we can further enhance your experience without the need of a sponsorship by a third party organization. I want our community to be managed and formed in the way we could all enjoy without someone barging in with their money grubbing hands (I also just don\u0027t have the time to buy all those hand sanitizers to clean up that mess). I want your experience to be molded in a way that allows you to get what you want out of our community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the contribution on Patreon, I will be able to push out more high quality videos and content on a consistent basis. With this support I can receive better equipment, to help improve the quality of material, and eventually a studio to make recording more convenient and quicker. I will additionally dedicate my time exclusively to my channel and to you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this peaks your interest, I want to welcome any support you provide here. I will allow you to mold Old Tin Man into the way you want it to be formed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you my friends and I\u0027m looking forward to our further discussions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e- Old Tin Man\u003cbr\u003e"
