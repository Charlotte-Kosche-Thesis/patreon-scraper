    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I told you that you can write music with the same emotional impact and memorability as the music of Koji Kondo or Nobuo Uematsu?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll let you in on a secret. These composers are not gods of the musical realm, endowed with some innate understanding of music that few of us could ever aspire to. \u003cem\u003eTheir music is great because it\u0027s written with intent.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Every note and every chord has a reason to exist, giving their music such clarity that it goes straight for the heart of every listener. You, too, can achieve these powers. How? Through the study of music theory.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you and why are you talking to me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Joshua Taipale. I\u0027m a composer and music theorist. Some of you might remember me as \u201cthat guy who covered like every \u003cem\u003eSonic the Hedgehog\u003c/em\u003e song on the guitar.\u201d As a composer myself who wanted to learn more about the inner workings of my favorite game music, I searched for resources that could teach me about them, but I came up fairly empty-handed... so I made my own. On \u003cem\u003eOngaku Concept\u003c/em\u003e, I study the music of video games to explain how it was written, what makes it special, and how you can apply the same principles to your own music. I\u0027ve discussed \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8Pwfl7Ztl0\"\u003eforeshadowing in the music of \u003cem\u003ePok\u00e9mon\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ9XvywoDsQ\"\u003einner workings of the ranch theme from \u003cem\u003eOcarina of Time\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and even analyzed the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE_Zoggkp_c\u0026amp;t=1s\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eintro theme to \u003cem\u003eGame Grumps\u003c/em\u003e and its connection to \u003cem\u003eSuper Mario Bros.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWait, isn\u0027t music theory limiting? I don\u0027t want to follow a bunch of rules!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might be expecting me to say \u201cyou have to learn the rules before you break them,\u201d but I\u0027m going to say something a little more shocking: \u003cem\u003eMusic theory has nothing to do with rules.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0This is where most students (and many teachers) have it wrong. A proper understanding of music theory frees the creative mind to go above and beyond what you could possibly imagine otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat makes \u003cem\u003eOngaku Concept\u003c/em\u003e unique?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy study of music theory revolves entirely around principles; a moveset in a game, if you like.\u00a0What makes speedrunners so incredible at games? \u003cem\u003eThey know their movesets like the backs of their hands.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0In my videos, I explain these musical movesets, and how other composers have used them to make some of the best music in video game history. It\u0027s then up to you to decide how you put them to work. Besides \u2014 how many resources do you know that are dedicated to video game music theory?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAfter two straight years of doing weekly videos (in addition to other musical pursuits), I started getting burnt out. It takes a lot of time to create high-quality \u003cdel\u003erips\u003c/del\u003e content, and that time takes away from the time I could be spending earning money elsewhere. With an extra flow of cash on the side, I\u0027m able to justify the hours I spend creating videos, and I\u0027ll also be able to afford the equipment and resources to make the show better and better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can think of it as a sort of on-going Kickstarter. You donate each time I put out a video (around once every other week) \u2014\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z48NmdWbquw\u0026amp;t=19s\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eand the rewards just don\u0027t stop coming.\u003c/a\u003e Worried about paying more than you expected if I upload a little more often than usual? No problem! You can set a monthly cap so that you never donate more than you want to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get as a Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAll Patrons will receive my undying gratitude, access to the Patreon feed where I\u0027ll be posting supplementary materials, as well as access to the Patron-only channel on the Ongaku Concept Discord server, where you\u0027ll get an early look at what I\u0027m working on next. Further rewards are available to higher-tier Patrons, such as analysis request priority and access to my personal sheet music archives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat the heck does \"Ongaku Concept\" mean?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eOngaku\u003c/em\u003e is the Japanese word for \u003cem\u003emusic\u003c/em\u003e, literally meaning \"comforting sound.\" Since I mostly study music from Japanese games, I thought it was fitting. Also, I\u0027m not good with names...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd finally...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThank you to everyone who\u0027s supported my work over the years. Whether you donate or simply watch my videos, I appreciate your support regardless, and I can\u0027t thank you enough for it. If you\u0027d like to support me non-monetarily, sharing my videos is the best way to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
