Most offerings are walled gardens not allowing for making what you use \"yours\". We are here to change that.  We are in no way affiliated with the RetroPie, Batocera, Lakka, Recalbox, or OGST development teams nor Odroid. We are however now official affiliates with AmeriDroid. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis group is for those to of us that wish to push development forward on Odroid Single Board Computers.  We are here for like minded folks that want to discuss retrogaming and all that it has to offer on the Odroid SBCs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWARNING:  This isn\u0027t a group created for rom sharing or the likes.  We wish to expand the horizons of what we offer to the great folks out there looking for a small entertainment platform so we have begun this Patreon to assist with server costs and hardware development costs to add to our various offerings."
