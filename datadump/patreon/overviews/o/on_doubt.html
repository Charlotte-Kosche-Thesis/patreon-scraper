After studying fine arts (Daniel Richter/Harun Farocki/Gunter Damisch) I finished a PhD thesis on \"Painting and Digital Technologies\", and published my thoughts on emerging painters on a \u003ca\u003eblog project\u003c/a\u003e. Today I mostly make my living as a painter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been involved in a variety of team-based projects throughout the years. While they offered amazing synergies, they also led to conflicts because of differing ideas about creative directions. This summer I finally decided to take \u003cstrong\u003efull creative control and responsibility, and set up this platform \u003c/strong\u003e- as curatorial project operating beyond the installation of works in a gallery space: \u003cstrong\u003ewhat\u0027s portrayed is the creative minds\u0027 movement of thoughts only\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since I started making music as a teen, I\u0027ve been involved in discussions on creative doubts. I\u0027ve been listening, offering my thoughts, and stayed sleepless over the various excitements and problems that were shared with me. And I had my own doubts: about leaving the gaming industry (where I worked for 6 years), whether to study fine arts, and later about becoming a self-employed artist - which doesn\u0027t even mention the many questions one has to face when creating a specific art work.\u003cbr\u003eWhile the hundreds of unrecorded dialogs I\u0027ve been involved in will always stay in the past, they made me realize the \u003cstrong\u003esense of urgency and inherent authenticity that creators have when discussing their work and processes\u003c/strong\u003e: I understand the need to respectfully edit volatile studio ramblings, to do the creator\u0027s work and spirit justice. So I\u0027ll start recording and editing away, and start publishing,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill we get to see you in the videos?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI won\u0027t be present visually or aurally in the published portraits. While you\u0027ll get to see me in general video posts, the actual video portraits will exclusively focus the creators, their voices and thoughts: I want to set up a portrait format that uses dialog as a means to an end - the questions are intended to kickstart inner dialogs \u003cem\u003ewithin \u003c/em\u003ethe creators. What ultimately matters is not my questions, but the movement of thoughts they might trigger.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for listening - and feel free to get in touch via any of the available channels!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
