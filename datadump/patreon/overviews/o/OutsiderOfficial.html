That is exactly what I would like from this patreon account. I will set up a team chat so that we can converse about music, become friends and make connections. It is no secret that I was especially lonely and isolated when I wrote this EP so connecting people means a huge amount to me. Its one of the most important things in life and music is the most powerful way to connect people.
