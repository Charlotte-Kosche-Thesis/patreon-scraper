    "summary": "Hello! We\u0027re a duet and we create electronic music with vocals (the style is mostly chiptune/experimental/breakcore, but there\u0027s a lot of others as well), as well as manage a printed CD record label called Bytedoll Records. We\u0027ve released some solo CDs and tapes, appeared many times on various compilations released in different countries (J-Core Masterz and others), and made a lot of free albums. The music itself is very varied - some of it is very serious, but there are also some tracks that are just silly jokes. \u003cbr\u003eThe process of making music and releasing stuff by so many people requires a lot of time - time that competes with other kind of work and getting money. The more money we get here, the more time (and money as well, of course) we\u0027ll be able to put into the stuff we make for you - we could buy new hardware, get help with releasing music (especially physically), cover up some potential gig trip cost or try a little shop with t-shirts or other stuff you asked us about. Maybe we\u0027d be able to post some interesting hardware live jams, more covers, create some tutorials on YT, post sample packs or make more homemade physical releases? We offer commissions as well.\u003cbr\u003eOne of us was also a cosplayer and she creates our outfits, takes care of most of the graphic design and draws.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/YwzCPBt.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZVwPtNn.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NBqNY6m.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZOVe0WN.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease remember that Patreon works in a slightly different way than regular crowdfunding networks - with Patreon, you can donate to your favorite content creators on a monthly basis.\u003cbr\u003eThanks in advance and happy listening! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
