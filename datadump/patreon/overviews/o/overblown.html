I used to have a steady job as a secondary school teacher but my desire to champion independent, DIY music, and my fatigue with how music journalism has devalued the reader, compelled me to quit that job to found Overblown, an online music magazine based in Ireland and the UK.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReaders are valued.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn an era when streaming, internet advertising, and the internet in general have devalued journalistic content, online music magazines are now ruled by vested interests. Readers are no longer valued. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere at Overblown we\u00a0give music fans a place they belong. It is a community, like hanging out with your friends and talking about music. We put the reader first. You are Overblown\u2019s priority. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe want to create more quality and varied content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help Overblown can become even more influential and powerful in championing independent music and music journalism that values the reader.

Anything that you, the reader, wants.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we need?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving said this, we\u0027re not asking for \u003cstrong\u003e$5\u003c/strong\u003e a month from you. In fact, we\u0027re not asking for anything at all. However, we are hoping that if you enjoy the content on Overblown, and if you feel a part of the Overblown community, that you would consider contributing \u003cstrong\u003e$2\u003c/strong\u003e a month towards the maintenance of the site and to support independent, DIY music and journalism.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe have three main goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVary the content and make Overblown ad free.\u003c/strong\u003e We want to give you podcasts, videos, infographics, merch, flow charts, gigs, and get rid of those pesky ads. We want to ensure that Overblown is never ruled by chasing the cheap click for advertising purposes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo make Overblown self sustainable.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0If it is going to survive, grow, and thrive, the site must pay for itself, for me, and also those that contribute. In turn this means more quality content for you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo pay the people that contribute to the site. \u003c/strong\u003eWe have contributors from Louisiana to Glasgow. They\u0027re golden people. The best people. They deserve to be paid $20 - $40 per contribution if not more! Again, if we can pay the contributors, this means more articles, more content, more music, and more of everything for your eyes and ears.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou have no idea how humbled we are by your support."
