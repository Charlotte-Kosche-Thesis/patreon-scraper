    "summary": "Old School Gamer Magazine was created to fill a hole in the retro gaming community. In North America, there has been over a half dozen magazines attempted over the last 10+ years in this area and hardly any of them have gotten past a dozen issues. In the UK, \u003ca href=\"https://www.retrogamer.net/\"\u003eRetro Gamer Magazine\u003c/a\u003e has done fantastic, and we want to start a tradition like they have had since January 2004.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis magazine is dedicated to the gamer who enjoys everything from Arcade Game collecting \u2013 refurbishing \u2013 playing to the gamer reliving his childhood from the 70s, 80s and 90s and passing it on to the next generation of gamers. Those that collect the arcade machines, bring that back to life and play them, those that collect and enjoy games from the first generation to the current.\u003cbr\u003eOur ownership comes from a background of publishing for the last 20+ years in the mobile disc jockey industry. Our sister publication, \u003ca href=\"http://www.mobilebeat.com/\"\u003eMobile Beat\u003c/a\u003e, published in print for 25 years and ended its print run in May 2016, and now publishes digitally every month through its companion app and website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are gamers and publishers. The first generation, Ryan, grew up with his Intellivision and his Genesis, always getting the less popular systems because he liked the better, and now collects arcade machines and primarily for the Atari 2600-5200-7800. We are looking forward to meeting you in person at one of the upcoming retro gaming expos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRyan Burger \u2013 Publisher\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"mailto:rb@oldschoolgamermagazine.com\"\u003erb@oldschoolgamermagazine.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
