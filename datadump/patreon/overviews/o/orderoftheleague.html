    "summary": "Riffing is an art form by which movies and other videos are lampooned through commentary. More than mere ridicule, it can be a transformative process, changing the context and meaning of what is on the screen through the power of suggestion. Ultimately, riffing recycles depressing drivel into fresh enjoyment, breathing new \nlife into dusty DVDs, and even healing cinematic scars left by the \nsilver screen\u0027s most frustrating affronts. (Did you see M. Night \nShyamalan\u0027s The Last Airbender \nin theaters? Don\u0027t spend another night haunted by his ineptitude. \nDownload the riff and start loving the movies you hate!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Order of the League represents the combined talent of indie riffing teams QuipTracks, Drawback Productions, Ice on Mars, and TreacheRiffs. We came together to elevate each other in the art of knocking Hollywood dreck down a peg. With your support, we can rise even further. While we are all happy to work for months on a full-length riff, we do have day jobs and bills. This Patreon will fund our shared expenses and allow us to expand and improve our services. Here\u0027s some of the specific ways we\u0027ll use the funds:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeb Hosting:\u003c/strong\u003e We currently spend around $30/mo of our own money to pay for our hosting and online catalog.

But if you were to follow the easy instructions to start it playing at the same time you played \u003cem\u003eTwilight \u003c/em\u003eon DVD, Blu-ray, streaming, or however else you play movies, you would hear three people proverbially ripping said movie to shreds with their wit and tomfoolery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want a taste, some such commentaries are available for free on our website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://orderoftheleague.com/collections/all?sort_by=price-ascending\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eorderoftheleague.com\u003c/a\u003e.
