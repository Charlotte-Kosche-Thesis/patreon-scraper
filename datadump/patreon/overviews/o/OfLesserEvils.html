    "summary": "I am Matthew I. Wanner or Matt to most. Either is fine, really. I write speculative fiction, primarily fantasy, and some general fiction. I am currently working on a fantasy novel and I\u00a0maintain a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.oflesserevils.com\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e where I read a book and discuss it chapter by chapter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is a work in progress. Expect changes as I get a feel for the community, feedback, and learn from my many, many mistakes. Life isn\u0027t static, so don\u0027t expect this to be either.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e The Book:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe book is about an old trapper who lives in a valley filled with the ancient, crumbling ruins of long dead empires. He shares this valley with giants, ancient creatures who have fallen far from their old glories. Knut, our trapper, has lived in the valley and the surrounding mountains for more years than he can remember, moving with the seasons and barely interacting with humanity. Yet, a company of soldiers on horseback enter the valley, in need of a guide. So begins a journey to the heart of a forgotten valley, where the dead sleep softly, and the sorrow of the giants waits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first book in a planned trilogy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Blog:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvery Wednesday, at some time before 11:59 pm PST, I post a blog about the book I\u0027m reading. Right now that would be The Hero with a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell. The main focus is non-fiction books concerning writing and storytelling, but exceptions can be made. I wouldn\u0027t call what I do criticism, I\u0027m no academic, and it\u0027s not really a review, that would be presumptuous, but more a discussion of the content, it\u0027s possible ramifications, and sometimes a good old fashioned bitchfest.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also post about writing, and about my life. In part, sitting down and writing things out helps me work out the utter shitshow I call living, and in part, I like to discuss everything. Sometimes it\u0027ll be about mental health issues, I\u0027m bipolar and have lots of opinions, other times neat cars or video games, and sometimes just whatever happens to be wandering through my poorly organized mind.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePlease bear with me. I am rebuilding this section after a far, far too ambitious launch. I am still working the book and blog, but my reward promises began distracting from that work, so I am reworking them.\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the community grows, I will also be asking you what kind of rewards you want. What can I say? You guys rock.\u003cbr\u003e"
