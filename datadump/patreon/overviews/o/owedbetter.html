    "summary": "Hi! My name\u0027s Jo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may know me from Twitter (\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/owedbetter_\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e@owedbetter_\u003c/a\u003e), Tumblr (owedbetter.tumblr.com), or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/owedbetter\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAO3\u003c/a\u003e/fanfic.net/~owedbetter . Branding, I know. And I write all of the things, including fanfiction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some basics. I\u0027m a 23 year old, full-time professional writer in the Philippines. I have a Bachelor\u0027s degree in Communications and I aim to write stories throughout every media platform. Storytelling\u0027s my passion and I love it. My ten year plan involves me getting degrees in Communications (MA), Creative Writing (MA), and Philosophy (BA). I want to be a professional academic who also writes stories. I love helping people. I love making and telling stories through the written word.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the stuff I write professionally? Isn\u0027t mine. I ghostwrite as a day job to pay my bills and, usually, my articles are basically fodder to boost social media reputation (read: \u003cem\u003enobody really reads them\u003c/em\u003e). And yeah, it hurts because this isn\u0027t exactly the kind of writing I want to be able to do. I write fanfiction because, for the most part, they don\u0027t require as much effort as original work does, and they don\u0027t exhaust me quite as much as building something from scratch. I try to do original work, it\u0027s just hard to channel that much creative energy when you only make $22/day and work ten hours a day. It hurts my heart everyday but what can I do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully, this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing fanfiction, I do; it\u0027s just that most days, I wish I could get some sort of benefit from it as well. Living in a third world country, my salary is barely enough to cover potential tuition fees as well as bills and living expenses (and, yeah sure, some tiny occasional treats like books and comic books and other frivolities like makeup and new clothes). Money stresses me out a lot and writing fanfiction alleviates some of the stress that daily life provides. I hate my day job more than I can say and a little monetary boost would be most appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there\u0027s some way some of my readers might be able to help me economically while I provide some modicum of entertainment for them for a super low monthly price? It\u0027s a win-win, right? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy fanfiction will always be free. Some extra help, if you can and want to, would be super. That\u0027s all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFandoms include (but fics are not exclusive to; this is not an exhaustive list):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Thick of It\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBasically everything that involves Peter Capaldi \u0026amp; Jenna Coleman.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMarvel (616, MCU, Sony, and Netflix!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHarry Potter\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
