We\u0027ve never done anything like write a book before, and it\u0027s a challenge we need a little help from you to overcome. As you may know, since February 2014,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://libcom.org/blog/out-woods-new-blog-climate-change-11022014\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewhen our blog launched\u003c/a\u003e, Out of the Woods has been writing politically about ecology and global warming.\u00a0\"Behind this blog,\" we said, \"is a loose collective. We don\u2019t have any agreed positions or perspectives, beyond thinking that climate change is a vital area of investigation. We all share a broadly libertarian communist perspective, though our backgrounds include left communism, anarcho-syndicalism, the Green Party, anarchist communism, green economics, and social ecology. Some of us are scientifically trained, but none of us are experts in climate or environmental policy. We are learning as we go.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, our heterogeneous collective has mutated, grown in size, and diversified what it does. We have given talks at conferences, gatherings and art events in the UK, the US and Germany. We published articles at other venues, such as\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://thenewinquiry.com/author/out-of-the-woods/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe New Inquiry\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e. Some magazines even wanted to interview us.\u00a0Finally, we were approached by Polity Press to write a book, which is what this Patreon page is about. We want our book to be called Cyborg Ecology, and we have mapped it all out. We are more excited than ever in the face of this new endeavour. But we aren\u0027t being paid to author Cyborg Ecology, and very few of us are in a position where we can put in the hours the project needs unpaid. We really, really need you to help make Cyborg Ecology a printed, bound reality. What do you say?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much in advance for your help. We couldn\u0027t be more grateful for your solidarity and support.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the book going to be about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eOur book is going to be short and snappy, a kind of manifesto on cyborg ecology. What\u0027s that, when it\u0027s at home? Concretely, it is a heuristic for linking different struggles around \"natures\", \"places\", \"futures\" and \"borders\". Those are the names of our chapters which, in each case, show how both right-wing and left-wing environmentalisms fall into binary ways of constructing nature and technology that have racist and murderous effects in practice.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLocked between fatalistic visions of apocalypse and a commitment to resigned pragmatism, mainstream ecological politics are incapable of navigating a path through ongoing climate crisis. Supposedly radical approaches too often rely on an opposition between nature and technology, misunderstanding both in the process. Accessibly written for the non-specialist reader, Cyborg Ecology draws on climate science, political struggles, popular culture and a range of critical theory to propose an alternative. Rejecting understandings of nature as a source of either abundance or scarcity separated from society, it proposes \u2018cyborg ecology\u2019 in which the \u2018natural\u2019 is inextricably linked to the human and the technological; a world in which forests are machines and genetic modification is a millennia-old practice. Such an understanding makes possible an expansive politic that connects our environments with struggles around race, migration, class, gender, sexuality and Indigeneity. Paying attention to the way our dystopian world is made, Cyborg Ecology shows how it can be unmade; and how another world might be recomposed from the potentials latent within it. Urgently embracing the utopian while questioning futurism, Cyborg Ecology opens space not just for survival, but flourishing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho are we? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eOut of the Woods formed as a transnational research collective investigating the various historical, contemporary, and future relationships between capitalism and climate change. As we said in our opening post: \"Climate change poses serious questions about the viability of both the capitalist mode of production and the global states system, and forces us to confront questions of technology and humanity\u2019s relation to (the rest of) nature. These are huge questions. This blog can\u2019t promise answers, but will be a place for critical investigation.\"\u00a0This remains true today, in 2017. We are twelve(ish) scholars, activists, thinkers, and readers based in the heart of capital and neocolonial control. We are exhausted by the way in which hegemonic ecological politics in the Global North oscillates between a return to a romantic naturalism with reactionary tendencies and a pragmatic green capitalism. Yet we are also inspired by and seek to amplify real movements abolishing the present state of things: survivors of Hurricane Katrina, indigenous water protectors opposing transnational pipelines, migrants fighting border imperialism, struggles for black lives Ferguson and safe water in Flint.
