If you\u2019re reading this you are probably familiar\nwith the web comic Orbit: encounter of which I am the creator, writer and\nartist, and this is its Patreon page. At the moment I am a part-time\nself-employed artist (also part-time admin staff at an accountancy firm, so I can\npay bills), who has dedicated most of my spare time to producing Orbit: encounter\nsince 2014, and I would love to put more hours into this project. At present\nthis is very hard for me to manage, with only having about a dozen hours a week\nto put into this high-quality web comic, but this hasn\u2019t stopped me yet.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have always been enthusiastic about creating art and stories,\nand this is the first comic story of mine that I\u2019ve written that to me feels\nboth strong enough and well developed enough to be published online. And I hope\nthat with your support I will be able to devote more time into this project,\nand finally get it to print.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn case you didn\u2019t know Orbit: encounter is to be a three-volume\ncomic that draws from my love of sci-fi horrors such as Alien (1 \u0026amp; 2 specifically),\nEvent Horizon, and John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing; and my childhood classics such\nas Watership down, The Secret of Nymn, Once Upon a Forest and The Dark Crystal.\nI also am heavily influenced by my love for survival horror games, most notably\nSilent Hill, The Last of Us, Alien: Isolation, F.E.A.R, and also Slender Man (which\nI\u2019m too terrified to complete). I hope these influences shine through my work\nand are executed well in this medium.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRead the comic here:\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.orbitencounter.com \"\u003ewww.orbitencounter.com\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHere is a little sample of the comic:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/03e2/f/2018/049/5/3/front_by_rpakita-dc3jo3o.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/b0fc/f/2018/049/8/e/pg48_by_rpakita-dc3josd.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/0995/f/2018/049/2/5/pg50_by_rpakita-dc3jos6.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/2f69/f/2018/049/8/9/pg67_by_rpakita-dc3jorx.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatrons will get to view the comic 4 pages in advance to\ngeneral release, exclusive behind the scenes concept art, exclusive sketch rewards.\nThey will also get any news on Orbit: encounter here too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHere are some examples:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/5207/f/2018/049/0/a/68_by_rpakita-dc3jp9w.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/5c75/f/2018/049/2/7/evelution_by_rpakita-dc3jpdp.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/63d3/f/2018/049/9/f/pg60_by_rpakita-dc3jpka.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis Patreon is for people to support the production of Orbit:\nencounter and I hope to post here frequently, but I don\u2019t want it to overwhelm\nmy time dedicated to Orbit: encounter. That said, I will endeavour to complete\nall rewards that are due. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also want you to be aware that even though Patreons get to\nsee pages ahead of everyone else, all finished would will be published free to\nview in due time. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
