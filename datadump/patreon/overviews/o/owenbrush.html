    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my Pateron site!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Owen Brush, and I am textile artist who is dedicated to a daily practice of slow and methodical handwork.\u00a0 \u00a0I use simple hand tools to spin yarn, and weave it.\u00a0 It\u0027s a simple thing - the oldest of technologies - and in a lot of respects it\u0027s a practice that needn\u0027t be done given the machinery and know-how that exists today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I choose to do this, however, is not to simply produce material goods.\u00a0 It\u0027s because I believe that there is magic that happens in the process of crafting something with our own hands, or by living with something that has been made in this fashion.\u00a0 \u00a0 By opening ourselves up to a relationship with our tools and materials - by giving time, space, and energy to these little things in our world, we are giving ourselves an opportunity to connect with, and give shape to, the framework that defines how we exist in this world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve created this Patreon site as a way of connecting with other people around these ideas.\u00a0 To share what I do - the patterns, the yarn, the products, as a means of supporting others to craft their own lives,\u00a0 and to offer people who are interested or inspired by what I do an opportunity to support me in turn.\u00a0 If you would like to see the finished work that I have available for purchase, you can visit my website at:\u00a0 www.owenbrush.com\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThis is my Manifesto:\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eBe Extra Ordinary\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.owenbrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/textile-artist-owen-brush.png?w=1024\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExtra Ordinary is an idea that describes something that is so especially ordinary that it possesses a unique integrity and beauty to it. This is a beauty that can only come from a slow and purposeful way of relating to our material environment, Like hand crafted furniture passed down through generations, or a gardener who is able to eat the food that she has planted and cared for with her own hands. This is the kind of beauty that I aim to create and surround myself with. The beauty that comes from simple and loving hand work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eCraft is a Conversation\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.owenbrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/craft-as-a-conversation.jpg?resize=1024%2C768\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch of my inspiration comes from my sensory experience of the world, whether it is the sounds of the world around me, the feel of the earth beneath me as I dance, or the intricate architecture of a forest. Even the slowly changing hues and shadows cast by the sun as it moves through the sky has been known to hold my attention for a long while. This is the reason I work slowly. I use basic hand working methods in every step of the process, because this slowness and directness of experience offers me the opportunity to connect to my materials and participate in an ongoing conversation between myself, my tools, the materials I use, and the world I live in. There is so much for us to learn by conversing with the things around us \u2013 all we need to do is listen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eBeauty Will Save the World\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.owenbrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/beauty-will-save-the-world.jpg?resize=1024%2C768\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeauty is all around us, if we open ourselves to it. Everything in the world is invested with energy \u2013 physical, emotional, and spiritual \u2013 whether it be made by our hands, or born from nature. All we need do is give ourselves permission to be present, to breath in, to touch, to see, to taste, to hear, to imagine, and to reflect the amazing and endless wonderment contained in everything and every one around us. In these moments of beautiful connection, everything is right, and truth is made clear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eResponsibility is Revolutionary\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.owenbrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/responsibility-is-revolutionary.jpg?resize=1024%2C768\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile our world is plagued by the exploitation of people and the natural world, and so many things are reduced to a commodity devoid of meaning and beauty, these systemic problems can only exist when responsibility doesn\u2019t. Every player in a such a system can avoid responsibility by passing it to another. The consumer can point to the producer, the producer to the policy maker, and the policy maker back to the consumer. These cycles can begin to stop, once responsibility is held on to instead of passed away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHand craft is a stance of taking such responsibility. Through craft we claim ownership and autonomy in our lives. We deal with the world as an equal, we converse with our resources and materials, and we surround ourselves with objects of beauty and wonderment that are born of a reciprocal and loving relationship with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
