    "summary": "Hi, my name is Jeremiah and I\u0027m the creator of Of Dice and Men.\u003cbr\u003eFirst of let me explain what Of Dice and Men is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf Dice and Men is a service where I offer my services as a DM to run campaigns for people of all ages. I usually charge a small fee per person to run sessions of over six hours and spend at least two hours beforehand planning and developing stories for the following sessions. I\u0027ve been running tabletop role playing games for almost fifteen years now. I\u0027ve been told my sessions are not only enjoyable but they\u0027re a great way to experience the adventure and enjoyment that comes with exploring a fictional world..\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been running a world of my own design; Pethuania. Pethuania lives along with the players who play in it for years now and along with keeping this world updated with maps and music (all custom made specifically for this world) I always endeavor to give the best possible experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf Dice and Men is slowly becoming more successful as time goes on and that\u0027s thanks to our customers and our patrons. We\u0027re currently setting up and preparing to be able to film active sessions and other info videos, whether they be stories on the history of Pethuania, advice and tips for both players and those running the games as well as extensive details on how I organise my sessions. There will also be podcasts and videos of sessions and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the support thus far I\u0027ve been able to expand the collection of both materials and props used in addition to the costs of setting a room up for the business and to a stage we can happily record sessions and even get someone in to film. Your assistance would be much appreciated and the rewards you get can range from advice, access to the videos and podcasts we do, access to in game content and material I create and playtest myself, everywhere from classes and races for Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 and 5th editions to content specific to the world of Pethuania. Every week I run several parties in my world, they all explore and interact with it, even stumble upon things changed by other parties OR past player characters who\u0027ve been retired but still remain as NPCs. You could create a character to take part in the world of your imagining, creating a town of your design or even design your own campaign villain or dungeon. I can even help you design your own campaign to run or play in. I can offer advice as an experienced DM and give you my point of view on scenarios you may encounter or advice on how to improve. I\u0027d be willing to donate what little time I have to thanking anyone who is willing to help me achieve my dream.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil then, I\u0027m going to focus on creating the best Fantasy Role Playing experience that I can."
