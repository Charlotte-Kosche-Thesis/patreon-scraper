    "summary": "Greetings, lovely human.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to ORLA\u0027S SECRET DEMO CLUB. What the \u003cem\u003eheck \u003c/em\u003eis that, you ask. Fair question. Let\u0027s dive in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eORLA\u0027S SECRET WAHAAAHTT?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor the last couple years I\u0027ve been writing songs - I mean, LOTS of songs. It\u0027s been magical and leaves me loving music more than ever before, but it can feel like such a wasteful process - I have countless demos of songs I\u0027m super proud of (but that aren\u0027t finished enough to fully release) and these demos used to just sit on my laptop, never seeing the light of day! GRRR. So much of the music I create is made behind closed doors.. but now I\u0027m ready to open those doors to a few.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you sign up to become a patron, you\u0027re part of the club. YES. Every month I\u0027ll send you a brand new home demo for you to download, written \u0026amp; produced by myself in my lil\u0027 bedroom studio! Signing up at any amount also means you\u0027ll get access to my patron-only feed - it\u0027s like our own little secret Facebook group where we can all chat and be our most vulnerable selves. YES! The feed is full of voice memos, blog posts, talk-y videos about all sorts, the occasional cover.. just a lot of MUSIC \u0026amp; THOUGHTS from my brain, really. You can support me at different tiers for all sorts of different rewards - check out the details on the right of my Patreon profile!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy vision for this is simple - to keep creating and sharing those creations with those who really want to listen. When I (one day) release an album, I\u0027d love for you to hear songs and say \"aha! I remember this song! Orla wrote this in April of last year about that boy she told us about, what a dick he was. ooh, I hear she\u0027s changed the lyrics of verse 2 but the rest is the same!\" - THAT SORT OF THING, YA KNOW?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon? WILL IT TAKE ALL MY MONEY?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNOPE. Patreon works off the old school concept of patronage - supporting creators you love to allow them to create more. It\u0027s essentially an online tip jar, and it\u0027s awesome.. think of it like buying me a cup of coffee once a month, knowing that COLLECTIVELY all that sweet coffee money results in me recording more, gigging more \u0026amp; actually getting to live as a musician full time (the dream). I put out one demo a month and you can pledge any amount of your choice, starting from $1! Do note that it\u0027ll always be once a month - you\u0027ll never be charged more than your pledged amount.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e..LET\u0027S DO THIS.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo clarify - I\u0027ll still be releasing music \u0026amp; Youtube videos as normal - nothing changes there :) choosing to join the cluuuuub and support me on here is a total choice and no one should feel ANY PRESSURE to get involved! I\u0027m beyond lucky to give music a go in the first place - I\u0027m just on here because I bloody love making music for you and think it\u0027s OK to ask for a little help along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOK, that\u0027s it..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo much love!\u003cbr\u003eOrla x\u003cbr\u003e"
