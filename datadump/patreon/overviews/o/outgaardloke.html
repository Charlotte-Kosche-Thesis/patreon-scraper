Everyone who has played these games really enjoy them and encourage me to make them into proper games. I have contacted gaming companies to try to make this a reality but the truth is that gaming companies have already established game designers which makes it hard to break into the market with new ideas. This is why I decided I would like to share all my games for free in hope that people will support me through Patreon with the main goal of one day earning enough to self-publish where you as a patron would be able to get a professional copy of the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE TRUE GOAL\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eis to eventually\nbe able to afford art specifically designed for each game to improve your\noverall game experience. I hope to be able to generate enough interest in\nmy games to launch proper Kickstarter projects so that you can see your\nfavourite among my games as a fully finished game, allowing you and your\nfriends the best gaming experience these games can offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANKS!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading through all that information! Now you know what you can expect and I hope that this is something you would like to be part of. All feedback is of course welcome, both what you like about the game and anything you don\u0027t like. I will appreciate all of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this is not for you, but you know someone who might be interested, please share this with them as the more patrons I have, the bigger the benefits will be for everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
