Throughout the years i have a developed a unique style that makes my drawings stand out from any other out there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am i here?\u003cbr\u003eWell, i have a website where i provide tutorials and lessons for anyone interested in learning the techniques that i use.  With this platform i will provide more in depth content for anyone who is interested in advanced techniques.  I will still provide free content on my website but patreon will help me support my art and will give me the opportunity and more time to give more back.  I believe that knowledge is not worth anything unless you share it with others. Hopefully there will be enough interest in my work that i can continually add lots of content for you all.  I will provide lessons,videos,explanations,techniques, work in progress and anything that i believe will be helpful to you all. Thank you and welcome to my channel."

As of right now, the computer system that im using for editing the videos just doesn\u0027t cut it. \u00a0A 20 minute video takes approximately 5 hours to process. Hopefully a new editing system will allow me to add much more content much quicker and the production value on each video will dramatically improve. \u00a0Until then, i will continue to work with what i have and will do my best to make them quality videos. \u00a0Thanks everyone and keep on drawing!!",
