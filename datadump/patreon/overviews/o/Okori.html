I\u0027m Okori,\u00a0comic artist and freelance illustrator. As it stands, I\u0027ve always wanted to make my living producing comics, art, and sharing my world building, stories and creative ideas with all of you. I\u0027m currently in production for a remake of an old project now titled City of Asah, a post-disaster supernatural webcomic. However, I love getting suggestions! And if you\u0027re a reader of my old webcomic Trance (ended) you can still throw prompts and ideas my way if you want to see those characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not a current reader of my comic, hey, no worries! I also draw all kinds of stuff unrelated to my comic work including tutorials, monsters, or studies and character designs from my WIP writing projects. If you have an idea for a tutorial, especially, I would love to hear it.This is my first experience with Patreon, so let\u0027s have some fun! *confetti*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow my updates work:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI typically update once or twice a month currently. : ) Please be conscientious and avoid reposting or sharing my images to others. Sharing a link to the post page itself, or my general Patreon page is a very kind thing to do instead, and I would be very grateful if you want to do that. : )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cem\u003eI produce NSFW/adult work!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eIt\u0027s true, I do! Not every post is a sexy one, but some of my work is considered adult in nature. That means that you should be 18+ or whatever the legal age is in your country if you would like to pledge to me. I cover a wide variety of subject matters and as a queer creator, much of my adult content will also be LGBTQA related. I do illustrate many kinds of kinks as well, so please keep that in mind. I will be going back and editing some past updates to be more indicative of their content, including warnings if needed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRequests?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI take suggestions! If I like the idea, and feel like it would have appeal to the majority of my patrons I might draw it. Feedback on what I\u0027ve already done is really important to me as if helps me decide what\u0027s working and what isn\u0027t. So if you have a moment, dropping even a short comment on the posts, or via messages is really valuable to me."
