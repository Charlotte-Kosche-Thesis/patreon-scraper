Despite abuse, homelessness, poverty, and trauma, I\u0027ve survived, struggling to stay on my feet at every turn. The mental + physical issues mean I often need to make choices that center my health over my wallet--for better or for worse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of 2016, I faced down a second period of homelessness. Many kind friends and strangers helped to ensure that the time was much shorter than before, and I\u0027m forever humbled. I hoped to settle in Philadelphia, where work was said to be plentiful and I could surely rent a little studio to continue my writing and keep my cat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings... didn\u0027t go as planned \u003cem\u003eor\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0in ways that were good for my needs: I was in Philly, but renting with 3 - 5+ strangers; I was working but at a physically demanding low wage job. With little mental bandwidth leftover for chasing what really matters, like writing and mental health help, that\u0027s where this Patreon came in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn January 2018, I relocated outside of the city. Work that isn\u0027t low-income + physically demanding is still hard to come by for someone like me, so I\u0027m grateful for the continued support and encouragement I receive from my patrons. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE WE\u0027RE GOING\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e To supplement my income in small ways, I use Patreon to monetize my creative skills.
