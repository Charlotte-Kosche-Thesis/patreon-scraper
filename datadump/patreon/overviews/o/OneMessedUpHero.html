    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI am (R)Owen(a) Hero, but you probably know that from the name of the page.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am another random artist/writer with an interest in genderplay themes, a popular yet somewhat taboo theme that I\u2019m sure you\u2019re very familiar with. I always loved the sort of things that people would come up with when toying with this theme, be it for family friendlyish fun, or more fetishy mature themes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thought it would be fun to try my own hand at this sort of thing and it turns out, based on what I\u2019ve heard from fans (and even a troll once admitted it), I\u2019m actually pretty good at it, both family friendly and fetishy mature stuff. I have a natural need to entertain others, and I\u2019m autistic, so losing interest in something I\u2019ve ever liked is\u2026 next to unheard of. But stories and art take time, internet, electricity and art supplies cost money so in order to continue working on these projects I need a way to fund it. The jobs I get paid for are few and far between and I honestly don\u0027t enjoy doing them as much as I enjoy this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, even the smallest amount, I\u0027ll need less time to worry about everyday expenses and finish more art and stories. It will also encourage me to continue doing this regularly and continuously improve so you won\u0027t have to wait half a year to see something new.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how does this work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve never use Patreon before its simple, you make a pledge and every month the amount is transferred to the creator, in this case me, and in turn you get certain rewards.\u003cbr\u003eIf you ever have money problems, keep in mind you can change or cancel your pledge anytime, though I will be sad to see you go.\u003cbr\u003eSome of the received pledges will go to words improving my work, covering art supplies, computer hardware and software and the like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s O/RC?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/gsg62vA\"\u003eO/RC Discord Server\u003c/a\u003e is discord server I use to interact with my patrons and potential patrons, if there\u0027s anything that may encourage you to pledge of any content you\u0027d like to see in upcoming works, let me know there. It\u0027s open most of the time I\u0027m awake so it\u0027s probably the first place I\u0027ll see anything, of course if you have private suggestions you don\u0027t want in the open you can always use DA or Patreon\u0027s own message system.\u003cbr\u003eThe join links are always open so you can join, leave and return at anytime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Changelings and Changelings F?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main purpose of this Patreon\u00a0campaign\u00a0is Changelings. But what is Changelings?\u003cbr\u003eChangelings is the collected stories of\u00a0several young men\u00a0scattered around the world and beyond\u00a0whose lives change suddenly when for one reason or another they are thrown over that gender barrier to see if the grass is greener where the other half lives.\u003cbr\u003eSome seek to return to normal, some solve other unusual problems, one even spends her free time beating up monsters.\u003cbr\u003eEach has their own story and they all together share more stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChangelings F is more tales and art set in the changelings universe, but their content is far more likely to include fetishistic and adult content.\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy humiliating my characters as much as I like making them walk on the opposite side of the fence. This is where you\u0027ll find this sort of content. All such content is censored on Patreon however and requires downloading to see properly, Patreon has rules.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo is this safe for work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of my works are set in this Changelings universe, but not all are \"family friendly\"..\u003cbr\u003eChangelings F may include more sexual or fetishistic themes as may some of my more random stuff.\u003cbr\u003eSo for your safety, not at work, just in case.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what do I get out of this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome works like Changelings F,\nwill remain for Patrons only for at least the foreseeable future which means\nthat you will need to pledge in order to see them. You may also access\nprocess images, high resolution images. Some reward tiers give art commissions.\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can also gain access to the patron areas of the \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/gsg62vA\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eO/RC\nDiscord Server\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, which I use to interact with\nmy patrons, and patrons may use to interact with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePicture Reward Rules\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf\nyou earn a picture reward then please understand the following\uff1a\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can contact me via\nmessage on Patreon, Note on DeviantArt, or by IM on Discord.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI do my best to follow\nthe law when it comes to this, please don\u0027t ask for anything illegal.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlease don\u0027t ask for\nanything too complicated.
