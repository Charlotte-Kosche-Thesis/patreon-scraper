     "about": "I am a singer/songwriter and performer currently based in Austin, TX. For the last ten years I have written, lived and performed in the Northeast US. After feeling a true call to get out of my usual patterns I packed up my car, built a bed in the back of it and \"went on tour\". What I didn\u0027t tell my followers, family and friends was that I was looking for a new place to live. A year ago after 2 months of living out of my car I returned to Austin.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy work is one of the only ways I\u0027ve known to help heal myself. My insides are vulnerable, beautiful and sometimes urgently asking me to \"give up\". This is my way of living, to know that I have a purpose here. I am very excited to share my songs and work with you. It\u0027s with my whole heart that I ask you to join my on my journey. Love to all of you.",
