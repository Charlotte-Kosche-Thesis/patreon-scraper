    "summary": "Thank you for checking out my Patreon! Tabletop games are a great way to bring people together. My work is giving back to those players and game masters that pour their time into giving you a great game. With the rise of 3D printers, we need things to print for our games! Everything I model will be free, now, tomorrow, and always.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything I create will be uploaded to \u003ca href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/PieceBringer/\"\u003ehttps://www.thingiverse.com/PieceBringer/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also would like to thank\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/masterworktools\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/masterworktools\u003c/a\u003e as well, his work inspires me and I hope you too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFine print about custom tiles:\u003cbr\u003eAbout the $5 and $10 dollar reward levels. I reserve the right to cancel this reward after a backer has paid for and received their custom model. These models will also be released to the public on thingiverse. I also reserve the right to edit/alter the model to make it easier to print/build. I reserve the right to ask you to choose another model if your model is too complicated or does not fit with in the specified designs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen choosing a $5 or $10 reward, I will contact you and work with you to get the right model for both of us. The $5 dollar reward is meant for dungeon decor that is smaller than half a tile piece or updates/changes to existing models. The $10 dollar reward is meant for new dungeon tiles or terrain pieces, that are limited on size of a standard tile. Neither of these rewards are for character minis, animals, monsters etc... they are meant for mechanical/dungeon style pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy estimated time for these is a month (first come first served)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso these rewards are not permanent. They may be removed at anytime as this is a test run of what I can handle currently. I promise to you that each backer of those rewards will get one custom model (for each month of pledge) even if they are removed."
