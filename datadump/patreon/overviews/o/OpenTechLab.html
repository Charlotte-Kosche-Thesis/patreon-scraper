    "summary": "Hi,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m Joel Holdsworth, creator of the \u003ca href=\"http://opentechlab.org.uk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOpenTechLab\u003c/a\u003e YouTube channel - a channel focusing on Open Source technology.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is the story behind the channel...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m primarily a software guy. My first program was written for QBASIC for DOS on a Intel 486SX back in 1993. A couple of years later, I somehow (remarkably) got into C++ coding for Windows 3.11 - that was a long time ago. There wasn\u0027t much information available at that time. The Internet was much smaller, and most technology information was only available in books - which were often already out of date in the book shop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI first got involved with the Free Software movement back in the days of WinModems, when Red Hat Linux was available as a shrink-wrapped box of CDs from the local PC superstore. At the time, I couldn\u0027t get it to work on my PC, and even though I was intrigued, my opinion at the time was that it was too broken to be useful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFlash forward to 2007, and after many years of (rightly) mocking my attachment to Windows, a friend of mine nagged me into giving Linux another try on my PC. After overcoming some initial difficulties, I found I could use Ubuntu as an everyday desktop environment - it had some problems at the time, but it was in many ways better to use than Windows Vista which was my only alternative... and a good thing too, because Ubuntu had decided to install itself as the default OS in the boot-loader, and I didn\u0027t know how to change it back!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a while, I began to explore the massive cavern of technological wonders contained within the Open Source Software ecosystem, and quite soon found things I wanted contribute to and improve. My technological knowledge grew immensely. No longer was third-party software something locked up behind incomprehensible blobs of binary, and mysterious DLL files, instead it was something I could directly participate in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past few years I\u0027ve contributed patches to over a dozen open source projects. Over time I became more and more interested in electronics from my own study, from other creators on YouTube, and most of all from my involvement in the \u003ca href=\"http://www.sigrok.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esigrok\u003c/a\u003e project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003esigrok is a software suite for interfacing with various kinds of Test and Measurement equipment including Logic Analyzers and Oscilloscopes. Through the sigrok project I began to find out about the weird and wonderful world of cheap Chinese Electronics tools and products sold on eBay, AliExpress and TaoBao. Many people look down on these products for being of too low quality to bother with, but I personally regard the low cost of these items as an opportunity, because of the low barrier to entry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI created the channel with a few goals in mind...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eAs a way of spreading awareness of the endless possibilities contained within the vast corpus of Free/Open Source Software, and the freedom that comes from using it. Everything I do is done with F/OSS - including the production of these videos. You will never see closed source desktop software used on my channel - except as an interim solution before a fully open solution can be constructed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo demonstrate technical feats that can be achieved in a home workshop with minimal budget. If you can\u0027t get your hands on $10,000+ lab equipment, what can be achieved on a minimal budget with some ingenuity, and a suitably determined mind?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo keep a record of the various projects I\u0027m working on. Every video I create, is created because of an active project. Therefore sometimes I have knowledge to share with you, sometimes I\u0027m learning something new, sometimes I\u0027m making mistakes - but then perhaps you and I both learn something new from that also.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eIn every video I want to demonstrate some interesting technology that might be useful to you. If so, I want it to be something anyone can easily pick up and incorporate into their software or hardware toolkit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of this Patreon...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my videos will \u003cem\u003ealways\u003c/em\u003e be completely free to view,\u00a0 but I created this Patreon as an opportunity for viewers to support what I\u0027m doing if they wish to. Any money you donate to the channel, will be reinvested into the demonstration equipment used in my videos, and recording equipment used to produce them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m running this channel as a hobby project, so I can\u0027t commit to a regular video release schedule, which is why this Patreon is set to per-video donations rather than per-month. I will only trigger donation for a fully-fledged numbered OpenTechLab video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m grateful to anyone who participates in the channel in any way: viewing, commenting, donating, and I hope most of all that these videos help you discover something new.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for watching!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoel Holdsworth\u003cbr\u003eOpenTechLab\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
