    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHey guys, my name is \u003cstrong\u003eVern\u003c/strong\u003e, also known as \u003cstrong\u003eOutlaw Vern\u003c/strong\u003e. I have been writing about The Films of Cinema since 1999, reviewing movies on a crude Geocities thing that eventually became outlawvern.com. You may also know me from my stint reviewing mostly straight-to-video movies on The Ain\u0027t It Cool News or my book \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSeagalogy: A Study of the Ass-Kicking Films of Steven Seagal\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (available from Titan Books). \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSeagalogy\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eis a good example of my philosophy of criticism. I love quality action movies as well as absurd low budget messes, and I like analyzing them with the same open mind and thoughtfulness we\u0027d want for movies that are more valued by society. I try to have a sense of humor but also give respect to even the most lowbrow punchfest. I\u0027m not afraid to champion movies and genres that others look down on, and I believe that any movie can have interesting themes worth exploring, even (especially?) the type of movie where a guy gets kicked in the balls and yells \"My balls!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe I\u0027ve been ahead of the curve on many issues. I was writing about the potential of direct-to-video-movies when they mostly starred Van Damme or Seagal and were rented from Blockbuster Video. I hyped up John Hyams, Isaac Florentine, Scott Adkins, Roel Reine and Gareth Evans before most of the better known internet writers knew of them. I wrote \u003ca href=\"http://outlawvern.com/2010/01/25/us-regeneration/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe world\u0027s first positive review of Universal Soldier: Regeneration\u003c/a\u003e. I dissected the problems of modern action clarity before \"shakycam\" was a term, and when it was unpopular to criticize Michael Bay and \u003cem\u003eThe Transformers\u003c/em\u003e. What I\u0027m getting at is I don\u0027t just write about the same shit as everybody else. I forge my own path.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn \u003cstrong\u003eoutlawvern.com\u003c/strong\u003e I usually review 3 or 4 movies per week. I specialize in action cinema, both new and old, but I throw in whatever else I get interested in. In October I traditionally dive into obscure slasher movies and in February the best picture nominees. I get great joy out of all of these and allow my knowledge of one type of movies to inform the other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also like to dig into a theme or a body of work for a longer series of reviews. I\u0027m very proud of past series\u0027 such as \u003ca href=\"http://outlawvern.com/2014/02/10/robocop-cartoon/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRoboCop History Week\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://outlawvern.com/2015/12/02/thx-1138/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLucas Minus Star Wars\u003c/a\u003e (a chronological study of every non-\u003cem\u003eStar-Wars\u003c/em\u003e movie George Lucas produced), \u003ca href=\"http://outlawvern.com/2010/12/13/house-party/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKid \u0027n Play - 20 Years On Film: A Cinematic Legacy\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://outlawvern.com/2014/05/04/star-wars-episode-1-the-phantom-menace-no-baggage-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eStar Wars No Baggage Reviews\u003c/a\u003e , \u003ca href=\"http://outlawvern.com/2015/08/10/cb4/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eN.W.A Week\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://outlawvern.com/2011/06/07/2001-a-summer-movie-odyssey/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy summer movie retrospectives\u003c/a\u003e. I lean toward the lowbrow, but I believe in trying to broaden the horizons of myself and my readers, and to build bridges between exploitation and art films. As I write this I\u0027m working on a series that will weirdly zig zag between Golan \u0026amp; Globus and the French New Wave.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do this work in the mornings and nights between working a regular (low paying) job, meanwhile trying to cook up new books (my novel \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNiketown\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e is \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Niketown-A-Novel-Vern/dp/1495431029/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_mfw?\u0026amp;linkCode=wey\u0026amp;tag=outver-20\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ecurrently available\u003c/a\u003e, the horror-action hybrid \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWorm On a Hook\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e coming later this year). The generous support of my readers through donations and Amazon links has helped me to take days off from the day job to focus on what I believe is my true mission in life. After many of them suggested Patreon as a better way to do this, I decided to listen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the deal: I\u0027m gonna keep reviewing movies, analyzing action and telling stories no matter what. It\u0027s what I do and you couldn\u0027t pay me to stop. But the less time I need to spend paying the bills the more I can dedicate to this work that I hope brings a little joy to people all around the world. So if you appreciate what I do and you happen to have the means to contribute, you can help me to create more for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a racist oil worker once said after getting beat up in the movie \u003cem\u003eOn Deadly Ground\u003c/em\u003e (1994, d. Steven Seagal), \"I need time to change.\" I need that but I also need time to write. If I can make it my regular source of income instead of my moonlighting activity I\u0027ll have more hours to put into this important scholarship that nobody else is gonna fuckin do. Books about Jean-Claude Van Damme or Brian Bosworth or somebody aren\u0027t gonna write themselves, you know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u0027re down, join me in my mission to strive for excellence and become The Most Complete Writer In the World. I mean I\u0027ll still respect you either way but just keep it in mind please I\u0027d really appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethanks bud,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eVERN\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
