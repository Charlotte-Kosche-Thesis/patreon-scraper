    "summary": "Hello and welcome to the Olympic Dames Patreon. We would like to thank you in advance for your consideration in supporting the Olympic Dames webcomic and it\u2019s associated works. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Olympic Dames?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.olympicdames.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOlympic Dames\u003c/a\u003e is an long form webcomic that has been going on for 10+ years now. It has consistently been updated three times a week for the last 5 and in full color. The story is still ongoing and will continue until it\u2019s end, which is still a ways off. The concept and art are the work of Kaileigh Blue and it is written by Lyze.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is Olympic Dames now on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOlympic Dames the webcomic has always and will always will be free to our viewers. The hosting costs are paid for through the donations of viewers like yourself and purchasing of commissions and other artwork. Lately there has been a movement among many artist to move on to a formalized donation system to fund the overhead of creating their works and we here at Olympic Dames can see the advantage to do so ourselves.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat do I (the reader) get out of it this?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support provides us with more opportunity to concentrate on more work. Below there will be specific information regarding rewards for tiered patronage and overall reward goals, but in general, we have many ideas on what we would like to do with the comic going forward. We have considered games, additional side stories, animation, possible physical merchandise, and also other projects which expand upon the Olympic Dames universe that aren\u2019t necessarily directly involved with the webcomic storyline. Greater economic freedom equates to greater artistic freedom to pursue these options.\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHow do I get my reward?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\nSend a message here. If it needs to go into further discussion I\u0027ll give you my e-mail in messages.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nAre there any rules?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nNo non-celebrity real people. No graphic porn, artistic nudity is fine. It doesn\u0027t have to be fetish related. Try to have your requests in before the last week of the month to make sure I have time to complete them in the month. You can request a private reward. You can repost /your/ rewards to other sites if you want to, linking back appreciated. One character per image unless you add $5 per extra. If you want more than one image instead of commissioning me just add the price to that month.\u003cbr\u003e"
