That level of commitment sometimes clashes with other commitments and leaves me slightly out of pocket.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best thing is I don\u0027t really mind whether you donate or not. As long as people read the work, feel it\u0027s useful and keeping them up to date on what\u0027s happening or even makes them think differently about what Wales is then that\u0027s reward enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is nothing more than a tip jar. I\u0027m not expecting the money to roll in - and you can give as much or as little as you want - but anything that helps towards the running costs of the sites or helps me improve things is always appreciated; the number of people who\u0027ve already signed up for regular donations or made one-off donations has humbled me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
