There is a long wait in my area if you have to take it to a marina. Plus the cost. I try to fix all my own equipment. When I perform PM or make a repair I will share my experience by posting a video. Not as a how to, but how I fixed mine. I am not a mechanic I read the service manual and try to set it to factory specifications. I have found that their is a lot of boat motor problems with a easy fix with a little time spent on research. If what I share with you helps GREAT. If you can give a little for my time.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "When I first started boating I could not afford much of a quality boat for for off shore fishing. I started with a fixer upper. Some things I would pay to have repaired and when I would go out again the same problem was still their. I would be out the money and still have a problem. The marinas that do a really good job had a two and three month waiting list. That is when I bought the service manual for the motor I had and made sure that everything I worked on was as the book said it should be. I know how hard it is to get help so i post a video on the repairs and maintenance I perform to my motors. So if this helps you and saves you some money.\u00a0 Support my channel and we will all learn and save. This will get us better quality equipment, better quality videos, and focus on other manufactures.\u003cbr\u003eThanks from Captain Jim \u003cbr\u003e",
