Creator of \"Mitchell Hates You All.\" I tell a lot of jokes and that\u0027s everything -- also I went on the price is right and won a dune-buggy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it isn\u0027t, so I won\u0027t. Instead, I\u0027m going to use this space to tell you that I\u0027ve been writing comedy for as long as I can remember -- and the fact that you\u0027re here reading this? The fact that you\u0027re even considering donating monthly? Is such an amazing thing in my mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery cent donated will go towards me being able to write more things that make you laugh. So thank you for paying me to be me.
