I create videos about anything and everything, as my interests fluctuate and vary from time to time. However, one thing will always remain the same and that is the love of making videos for my wonderful viewers. I have so many ideas in my head, these dreams to make videos for you that I \u00a0hope to constantly improve. By contributing to my Patreon page, you are helping me grow in more ways in one. Your contribution will help me consistently and efficiently create better quality content, in all senses of the word. I hope to improve not only the visual and audible qualities of my videos but the ideas and material within them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever much you may or may not choose to donate, (which I appreciate you even considering!) I will always create videos for free, as this is my passion and what I love. Those who choose to support my videos financially will make them longer, better, and more consistent, improving not only the quality of my work but of your experience."
