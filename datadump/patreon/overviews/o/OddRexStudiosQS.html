As a director, he is incredibly inspiring, understanding, creative, and open to collaboration, and as a friend he is supportive, empathetic, and motivating. So naturally, when he told me about this fantastic project I wanted nothing more than to be a part of it. I have had an affinity for acting ever since I was small, and Jack has been there to support me as I have worked with companies such as Milwaukee Entertainment Group, Theater Unchained, Memories Dinner Theater, as well as been there for my personal projects as I have slowly began to blossom as a director and writer. I have been a part of many different film projects (many of them have been Jack\u0027s!) and I am overwhelmed with gratitude that Jack even considered me for the role of Gabe (the role was originally written as a male role (\u003cem\u003eEditor: True Story\u003c/em\u003e), let alone give me the chance to become the character.

After high school, he went back to the Milwaukee area and eventually enrolled in classes at Wisconsin Lutheran College. There he found his way into the study of film and production where he met the writer, director, and producer of \u003cem\u003eQuiet Storm\u003c/em\u003e, Jack Albert, along with much of the other talent in the show. Charlie always had a wild imagination and crazy dreams of what might come. He has some good artistic talent including a good eye for detail and composition. He is interested in the process of making films and television, but feels much more comfortable behind the viewfinder of his old Minolta X-375 35mm SLR or his Canon T5i taking pictures of old industrial buildings or intriguing automobiles. While acting has always interested him, Charlie has never acted in a stage production. He didn\u0027t get a taste of real acting until he took a few acting classes in college. He has built sets, setup lighting, and been in the pit orchestra, but learning lines has always scared him off of the limelight. Film, however, seemed to be a better fit, and now he\u0027s gone from a comic relief (in \"The Return,\" 2015) to a main role (in \u003cem\u003eQuiet Storm\u003c/em\u003e).

At the time, I didn\u0027t really know what pitches, chords, or anything like that was. I was a drummer, in the simplest sense, and only knew rhythm. Yet I can remember having an ear for pitches. I was involved in choir and could just \u201chear\u201d what notes I had to sing. I finally decided in college that I wanted to be a composer. I had a lot of ideas, and a lot of creativity, and I wanted to create. I am influenced today by many genres including rock, metal, country, classical, film, jazz, choral, and wind ensemble.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPercussion is still my first and greatest love, but of course in each situation I write for, my wide listening spectrum helps influence my music and enrich it. I would say that some of my bigger influences and current composer fascinations are John Williams, Hans Zimmer, Gustav Holst, Mozart (always), Paul Hindemith, Eric Whitacre, Ola Gjeilo, Frank Ticheli; the list could go on and on. I really have different interests that come and go at different times, but I feel that all these different interests add to my unique style and musical personality. \"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSamuel Wallace (Unit Production Manager)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg height=\"304\" src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1571/24715972651_9d1a0e299a.jpg\" width=\"320\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Greetings!

In my opinion, one of my greatest strengths is the ability to be able to take an entire process or project and break it down into its smallest individual components and analyze each part from all sides. Whether this includes helping select various scene locations, contacting actors and forwarding them their individual, personalized information for different roles, or calculating the cost of all variables, I am blessed to work alongside an outstanding team. Through this effort, I am serving in the role of Production Manager and doing my best to allow the actors and director to focus on the big things while I am able to handle the small, detailed items on the side.
