     "description": "I am creating a continuing project called \"Old World Radio - Boston.\" \u00a0It started out as a radio station mod for Fallout 4 and is now turning into a full-fledged audio-drama series. \u00a0I need your help to keep on writing, designing, producing and creating this on-going project. \u00a0If this goal is met monthly, I will be able to continue to develop Old World Radio - Boston mod and create new audio-drama series and new stations to bring into the game! \u00a0I will make sure all content created will be playable for Fallout 4 on PC and Xbox One absolutely free to everyone! \u00a0I also have plans to take it beyond the walls of Fallout 4, and continue it for Fallout 5 and all future installments of the franchise as long as I can stay funded. \u00a0I am currently creating an audio-drama series based off of the Astoundingly Awesome Tales comics found in Fallout 4 in old 1950\u0027s radio play style. \u00a0I also plan on creating a totally brand new audio-drama series set in the Post-Apocalyptic future, just like in Fallout! \u00a0It will seemingly fit right into the lore of the Fallout series with full production value including sound effects, professional voice actors and user-created music. \u00a0If you haven\u0027t listened yet, please visit..\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/oldworldradioboston\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/c/oldworldradioboston\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...and give a listen! \u00a0Check out the rewards offered and become part of the biggest Fallout audio-drama project in the world! \u00a0The more funding I get, the bigger celebrity voice-actors and talent will be coming into the future content and much more content will be written and produced! \u00a0Thank you for visiting Old World Radio - Boston!",
