We can breathe the air and feel the sun and relax with a book in the grass.\u003cbr\u003e3. We can trust strangers on the street. For the most part people look out for one another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAHHHHH IT\u0027S AWFUL\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. There is no peace! \u003cbr\u003eThere is systemic structural violence everywhere perpetrated institutionally, by prejudice, and by greed and fear and habit to fuel a global military-industrial complex. There is also emotional violence in relationships where external and ideological pressures lead to limited viewpoints and meanness. Tacit acceptance of dehumanizing behavior and structures (like eviction, incarceration, torture, pay-to-play health and education) stymies change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. The air and sun are dangerous and the grass is full of chemicals!\u003cbr\u003eWe are polluting the air by burning plant fuels (oil, etc) and releasing chemicals that corrode the protective ozone layer. In many places air cannot be breathed without deleterious consequence. The sun too, friend of plant and animal alike, is warming the gasses in our atmosphere such that one day we may go back to living in caves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Beware of strangers, don\u0027t give to the homeless or busking musicians!\u003cbr\u003eActually strangers are kind in general and most people mean well and many people do \u0027good.\u0027 We are advertised the worst parts of our nature and the most calamitous events, but most of the danger does not come from strangers, it comes from people we know well and from the institutions, corporations, organizations, that we have set up to protect us. People in power are hard to trust because of the nature of power. Do we need people in power? It can make life simpler to have\u00a0 leadership for the many things we don\u0027t want to actively think about everyday. And if not a leader, some structure for decision-making and accomplishment is probably necessary in order to have efficiency and commonly used things like transport, trade, social mixers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs it AWFUL or is it LOVE? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s both. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave you seen \"THEY LIVE\" or remember reading \"1984\"? That\u0027s one world we live in. Have you seen the documentary \"Babies\"? OR listened to love songs from this century? That\u0027s a world we live in too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo where do I fit in? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make movies and performances, events, constructs, conceptual happenings, what-have-yous that attempt to be in both these worlds or all of these worlds. The world of opression and the world of care-free liberty. It\u0027s my hope that a transformation, an individual transformation arises that brings us closer to fun and mutual respect. My movies are about the American Dream in a way, about the promise of progress, about being a human animal. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoes this speak to you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting my work! It\u0027s for people that I do this. For the \u0027we\u0027 in us! I\u0027m also driven to do it--it\u0027s my way of reacting to this weird situation we\u0027ve been born into.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
