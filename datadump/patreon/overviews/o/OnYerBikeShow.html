     "about": "Hello! I\u0027m Paul Brodie, the host of On Yer Bike. The only bike show that concentrates on the Honda Cub, the people that chop them, the people that race them and the people that just love them as they are. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo date there has been over 87 million produced world wide. That\u0027s more than any other motorised vehicle, even if you added up all the Beetles, Minis and any other popular motor you that you care to think of. And yet there is only one show for them and this is it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a world where it\u0027s faster everything, communication, transport, instant gratification.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Honda Cub, with an average speed of 35-45mph forces you to appreciate the world as it happens, like we used to in the seventies and before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is easier to name the countries these bikes haven\u0027t reached than the ones\u00a0they have, so prolific is their spread\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this show we celebrate the various characters and their relationships with their machines, as they bimble around the countryside on arranged meets in packs. Learning to live and move again at a pace that let\u0027s us enjoy the world for the beautiful place it is.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollow us as we go around the UK and Ireland for the first series then move on to Europe and the rest of the world with your help!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we offer?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently we put out at least one episode of the main show every couple of weeks \u00a0and the occasional item review! All available on our Youtube channel, and website.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main show will cover things such as the previously mentioned bimbles, endurance bike races, cub modifiers and more. From time to time we\u0027ll even take a sneaky peak at \u0027bigger bikes\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoing forward we\u0027ll be Go Pro-ing up Paul and his bike as he ventures out on to the roads and off them, giving us his view of the world as he goes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBeing new to the biking world, we\u0027ll follow Paul as he makes the transition from MPV driver to full on bike rider and eventually...racer!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a total novice we\u0027re sure they\u0027ll be plenty of thrills and spills along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Jimquisition Video SeriesMy weekly webseries, ad-free, hosted on my YouTube channel (JimSterling), every Monday at 11am Central. The Jimquisition is a topical show that discusses the game industry, particularly criticizing business practices and anti-consumer tactics among \"AAA\" publishers, as well as other interesting and often controversial developments involving games. With sarcastic self-aggrandizement, I\u0027ll be here every week to provide commentary and ribaldry, and I\u0027ll be able to do it free of any leash. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJimquisition Videogame ReviewsIntroducing \u003ca href=\"http://www.thejimquisition.com/\"\u003eThe Jimquisition Dot Com\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing about videogames. Video production has taken a dominant role in my professional life these past few years, but writing reviews of new videogames is something I have a particular fondness of. In the past, I\u0027ve served as reviews editor for both Destructoid and The Escapist, but now I want to provide the same written criticism in a completely independent environment. With your funding, I will create an ad-free website without sponsorships, brand deals, or site skins. This site will provide reviews of the latest videogames, and who knows? If I get enough funding, I could be able to do more there, and maybe even get a little freelance staff together. Maybe. Sky\u0027s the limit!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Jimquisition PodcastA weekly podcast in which I chat about videogame stuff. You know what a podcast is. I\u0027m willing to take suggestions on how this would be set up, be it with a regular group of guests, a one-on-one chat with different people, or something in between. Or maybe just two hours every week of me, alone, talking to myself and growing increasingly paranoid in a darkened room. There\u0027s lot of wiggle-room for experimentation here, but whatever we do, it\u0027s been a while since I produced a regular videogame podcast, and I\u0027m excited by the possibilities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre You Doing Rewards n\u0027 Stuff?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not planning to offer a load of rewards and tiers. The three-prong plan for Jimquisition is not tiered - I want to offer it in one juicy package! I hold myself to the same standards that I\u0027ve always held the game industry to - I want you to fund me because \u003cem\u003eyou want to fund me. \u003c/em\u003eI do not want to gate off content, hold it to ransom, or otherwise batter you into opening a wallet. While I will obviously need to raise awareness of this Patreon, I will not litter my videos and social media with constant calls for funding. I\u0027ll do \u003cem\u003esome \u003c/em\u003epromotion, because that makes sense, but I\u0027ll work hard so that it isn\u0027t obnoxious. You wanna watch and read my stuff, not be advertised to!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo access my Jimquisition content, you need only access it. Pay as much or as little as you want. Pay nothing if you don\u0027t believe you should. I have one milestone goal which would cover production costs as well as support for my family and the paying of bills. Anything above that would be incredible, and allow me even more freedom to do stuff. I want to keep this simple though. (\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eEdit: \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have removed the milestone, because while it was consistent with the money I was making previously, it was making people scratch heads, and goes against the \"pay what you want\" idea. So, no milestones at all!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClearly, I\u0027ll need to be able to make a living off this in order to keep doing it, but it\u0027s your decision as to whether or not I do. I\u0027ve gone back and forth on the idea of crowdfunding. I\u0027ve been scared to do it, sometimes critical of it, and I\u0027ve always wanted to make stuff first and get paid later. But this is a chance to strike for true independence and editorial control, and after much soul-searching, I think this could actually work. I sincerely, truly hope it works. I don\u0027t want to work in the old system anymore. I want to be able to make videos and write reviews on my own terms now, and to directly serve you, the audience. And I don\u0027t want to do it while hawking some bloody corn snack products. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything To Declare?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDisclosure is important. I need to be upfront with you all to make this work. So let\u0027s be clear about what you will and will not be funding, as well as my other sources of income. Any changes to the dynamic, to my work, to anything involving this, will be disclosed immediately, as and when they occur.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI Have Other YouTube Projects: \u003c/em\u003eThe JimSterling YouTube channel is affiliated with Maker, and current video playlists earn a humble amount of money (usually enough to buy silly Alien merchandise and contribute to my tax payments) from ads. Existing playlists are not part of this Patreon, and will continue as normal. In future, when it comes time to renegotiate contracts with Maker, this could change. You\u0027ll know if/when things change. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFistShark Marketing: \u003c/em\u003eFistShark Marketing is a free weekly comedy podcast starring myself, Conrad Zimmerman, and Caitlin Cooke. \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/fistshark\"\u003eIt has its own Patreon page\u003c/a\u003e! It\u0027s a really rad show and you should consider looking into that. My financial interest there is that it would cover the hosting costs I\u0027ve been currently paying out of pocket. The rest of the team gets it all, because they\u0027re swell. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI\u0027ve Done Some Voice Acting: \u003c/em\u003eI have contributed to a handful of videogames as a voice actor, specifically Jazzpunk, Volume, Inhale/Sepulchre/Exhale, and You Are The Reason. I have always disclosed these involvements, I have not reviewed videogames I\u0027ve performed in, and should future performances occur, I will continue to disclose them and refuse to review them.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy Agreeing With You Is Not Being Funded: \u003c/em\u003eLet\u0027s be super honest with each other - I will not always say things you agree with. Whether I tackle a subject on The Jimquisition that you have opposing views on, or I love/hate a game you hate/love, there will be times where we philosophically clash. That\u0027s okay! I love civil disagreement, personally. Of course, some people take disagreement more personally and angrily, and they may expect that crowdfunding requires my views to align with theirs. That\u0027s impossible. If you choose to fund me, please be aware that my personal opinion is my personal opinion, and that I will share it even if you don\u0027t like it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eReview Copies: \u003c/em\u003eI\u0027m not yet sure if videogame publishers will continue to provide copies for Jimquisition reviews, but every review I write will disclose how I obtained the copy in question. If a publisher provided a review code, the review will say so, as it will if I purchased the game myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre You Finished?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think that covers most of it, but if anything else pops up, I\u0027ll cheerfully discuss it. This is very new territory for me and, quite frankly, it\u0027s scary. Exciting, but nerve-wracking. For well over half a decade, the love and support of an amazing audience has kept me plying my trade to large publications. Now, it is my express hope that the same love and support can allow me to ply it directly to the audience, without middle-men and the risk of corporate pressure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you fund me or not, thank you. Honestly, thank you. The fact I even feel like I could \u003cem\u003eattempt \u003c/em\u003ethis is thanks to you all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank God for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd Thank God for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are no strings on me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e",
