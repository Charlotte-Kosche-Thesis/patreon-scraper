For those that I have been fortunate to meet on my years of tours around Scotland, you\u0027ll know that I am university qualified Historian with an Honours degree from the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. \u00a0I am also a Professional Genealogist and spread my tour business between historic, Outlander and ancestral touring. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of my past tour guests have witnessed my passion and excitement surrounding the rich and ancient history of Scotland and I have been planning to expand my reach beyond my personal tours, to those of you who I won\u0027t get the chance to meet, or those that may never have the chance to visit our wonderful country. \u00a0I want to find a way to share and explore Scotland\u0027s past with you all...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have decided to devote much more time to producing high quality, informative and entertaining video content revolving around Scotland\u0027s history, with a healthy dose of Outlander related material included! \u00a0A great deal of time and effort goes into producing these videos, including research, travel, equipment, etc., but you can be part of that journey by supporting us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to help me develop my plan and grow my Community to widely share my content, I have decided to join over 50,000+ Creators worldwide, who use Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon and why do we use it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eWe\u0027re so excited to be joining a growing list of Creators who are using this platform to reach our lovely fans and supporters on a more personal level! \u00a0Patreon is a place where you can show your support for the growth and development of our Social Media projects, focussing on producing high quality and entertaining video content relating to Outlander and thousands of years of Scotland\u0027s epic history!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you haven\u0027t heard of Patreon before, the idea is that you support a Creator (hopefully us! lol!) financially by pledging a small amount each month, to help us to continue to produce our content across our Social Media Channels and be part of our growing Community of fans and followers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow does it work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts quite simple. \u00a0Basically, you pledge a monthly amount (based on one of our three tier levels, or whatever amount you wish) which goes to help fund our projects, which we will share across our Social Media Channels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a thank you for showing your support, you will be eligible for various Rewards, which will only be accessible to you as one of our valued Patrons. \u00a0We\u0027ll share BTS footage, conduct private Q\u0026amp;A Sessions, give you one-on-one consultations to help plan a trip to Scotland and even give you a shout out on our videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhere does my money go?\u003c/h2\u003eYour support enables me to invest into producing free YouTube, Facebook and Live Stream videos to help promote and share the history of Scotland with our global Community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you\u0027ll probably guess, it takes time and resources to create content, both which require money. Your support lets me focus on producing high quality content for you, instead of spending as much time focusing on the financial side of how to deliver it to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also helps me replace any broken equipment, produce higher-quality videos, and free up some of my time to do develop new ideas and travel to some of the more far flung historic locations in Scotland, to share them with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eI\u0027d love to help, but I can\u0027t...\u003c/h2\u003eNo problem at all! Please don\u0027t become one of our Patrons if you can\u0027t afford to, or simply don\u0027t want to...this is not a hard sell! Lol!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll continue to produce as many high quality videos and engaging Live Streams as I can, so I hope that you\u0027ll continue to enjoy them and \u003cstrong\u003eI thank you for your support!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
