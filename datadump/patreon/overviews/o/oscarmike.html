It is all one big experiment. Think of it as one big sketch book. If you roll back to the early work and then flick through you will see ideas developed, built upon and thrown away. There is junk, lucky moments, no end of mistakes and the odd surprising success. Sometimes I want to create something beautiful or sad or angry. It\u0027s all in there and it all represents learning.  This is indicative of all of our lives. We are born, we learn, we die. This project is about filling in the middle part of that journey for myself. As such I need to find my own way through as do we all. For me that is done through creativity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to join me for a while on that path by supporting the Oscar Mike Project then it would mean much more to me than just the financial support. It would mean you have an interest in my journey and after all, isn\u0027t that what we all want from our time shared on this planet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e......................OLDER INTRO ARCHIVED FOR POSTERITY.......................\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by. I am Shawn and I am a photographer. And yes that is certainly something there is no shortage of. Based in Wellington, NZ, my day job used to consit of shooting commercial work and private commissions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(EDIT: To cut to the chase and find out about the\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/full-level-how-6752793\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elevels and rewards click here\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Just two years ago I started a new personal project called The Oscar Mike project. The idea of this project was for me to finally tackle nude/erotic portraiture as a cohesive project. The goal was to develop a personal style, experiment with ideas that I don\u0027t get to play with in my day job, improve how I work one-on-one with subjects and just generally improve as a photographer. As I crossed the 12 month mark on the project I felt I had achieved what I set out to do and more. The project itself had done fairly well on social media, I had made a self published limited edition photo book and had exhibited a branch of the work in a show called A State of Modern Erotique which explored censorship of nude art on social media platforms.\u00a0The question was what did I want to do next?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I have felt the growing need to define the Oscar Mike project I looked back to the beginning and what it represented to me. There are two points that seem to stand out to me. The first is that I can still recall the day I decided to stop censoring myself. I live in a relatively small town, in a relatively small country. I had always been conscious of this and there was always a concern that if I just shot what I felt like it would impact people hiring me for commercial work in the region (it has). But as life is short, design by consensus is boring and mediocrity for the sake of not offending the overly sensitive is a living nightmare, I decided to move on. And therein lays the second point...moving on. That was what I was aiming for...not to throw away what I was doing but to build upon it and MOVE ALONG. In other words... I was Oscar Mike (On the Move).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has taken me sometime to work out where the OM project fits within my wider commercial and art work. Yes, it is predominantly nude work but there is a pretty broad spectrum of styles. In many ways it is all one big experiment. I would encourage you to think about it as one big sketch book. If you roll back to the early work and then flick through you will see ideas developed, built upon and thrown away. There is junk, lucky moments, no end of mistakes and the odd surprising success. Sometimes I want to create something beautiful or sad or angry. It\u0027s all in there and it all represents learning.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why support the\u00a0Oscar\u00a0Mike Project on patreon? After all that\u0027s why you have\u00a0read this far.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike most learning there is a cost involved one way or another, and the OM project is no different. I want to point out that I will be continuing to make this work and release it via instagram and in as many publications as possible, as well as free for all image and diaries here on patreon. So if you can not afford to (or just don\u0027t want to) donate to the project that is more than fine. But if you have enjoyed it all so far and want more access and insight into the sketchbook book including;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- AMA questions,exclusive diaries, content and work made just for my patrons, tutorials, videos and any other kind of media I choose to experiment with for The Oscar Mike Project...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen think about becoming a patron and supporting art. I would love to have you along for the ride.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunding will be used to help cover all aspects of shooting including travel, locations, gear for the models, production of a second photo book before then end of the year and all manner of things that are currently making an ever increasing hole in my bank balance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShawn\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

As I was turning 30 I decided to get in early (I hope) on the whole midlife crisis thing. I walked away from the restaurant game and got back to working creatively.

However showing my patrons what I am working on is a bit tricky. The adult nature of my work means sites such as youtube are out and I don\u0027t want to go to near services such as pornhub. This means that buying hosting is my only option.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to produce a regular Vlog, behind the scenes videos from most shoots, model profiles and erotica/concept videos. This is a lot of data to upload each week and so I need your help. A little back of the envelope calculations tell me that it would be doable with about 80 regular patrons so here is the goal. When I hit one month of 80+ patrons I will sign up to the biggest year long hosting package I can afford. To celebrate I will shoot, edit and upload a brand new concept video for all patrons regardless of your contribution level. Of course I will continue to upload videos as much as possible but as I am currency constrained to 5 gigs per week it is still going to be a little slow ...... for now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please do spreed the word!\u003cbr\u003eAs always any and all support is greatly appreciated.\u00a0",
