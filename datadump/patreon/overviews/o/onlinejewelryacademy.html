    "summary": "The Online Jewelry Academy (OJA) was established in 2012 by co-founders John Ahr and Don Hunt.  Working with just a cell phone camera, the two produced their first videos for YouTube.  The response to their initial videos was encouraging.  So, Ahr and Hunt decided to continue to produce educational videos for anyone interested in making jewelry.  As their access to video recording and editing technology increased, so did the number and quality of their videos.  But, the two men have remained consistent in adhering to three principles in each of their videos:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSafety First\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStep-by-step instruction that\u0027s easy to follow\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eConcise and interesting lessons\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eJewelry training has historically been the realm of apprentices and journeymen working under the direction of a master.  But with the popularity of both do-it-yourself programs and personal technology devices there are now many self-taught jewelry designers and craftsmen.\u003cbr\u003eThe OJA seeks to bridge the extremes of today\u0027s jewelry training.  Using detailed video instruction and demonstration, students will be able to have a virtual first-hand visual learning experience.  Our hope is to eventually offer other services and products as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJohn Ahr divides his career between artistic exploration and arts education.  His work as an artist explores the silly to the sublime in a variety of media to form a uniquely expressive hybrid.  Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Ahr now lives in Southern California.  He regularly teaches jewelry design and fabrication at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising (FIDM) where he serves as the Creative Director of the Jewelry Program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAhr has worked as an artist and a designer for over 30 years.  He has produced a wide variety of fine art and commercial work in both traditional and non-traditional materials.  Ahr\u0027s work has been exhibited in the US as well as Europe and Japan.  He is especially known for the skillful eclecticism of this work that often incorporates his photos.  In 2003, Mr. Ahr designed the featured decor elements for HBO\u0027s Emmy Awards and Golden Globes after parties.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2001, Ahr earned a M.F.A. in metals from California State University, Long Beach.  He has appeared on both the \"Lifetime\" and \"DIY\" networks where he has shared his knowledge of crafts."
