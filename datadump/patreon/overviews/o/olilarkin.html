    "summary": "I\u0027m an independent audio software developer based in The North of England and I have been making audio plug-ins since 2003. I started\u00a0developing plug-ins with Synthedit and then I got into Max (Pluggo).\u00a0Eventually I realised I had to learn C++ in order\u00a0to develop more professional cross-platform products.\u00a0Since I didn\u0027t come from a programming background I struggled for many years to\u00a0get started. When I found IPlug (originally by Cockos, makers of Reaper) I finally managed to get somewhere. Unfortunately\u00a0IPlug was in need of lots of work to support more plugin formats and to add basic functionality that was missing.\u00a0In 2011 I released WDL-OL/IPlug which takes IPlug and puts around it a well structured build system that makes it relatively easy for others to start making professional plug-ins and audio apps. It is available to use for free with with a no strings attached liberal license, and it can save you vast amounts of time if you want to make your own plug-ins.\u00a0At this stage\u00a0I have contributed a lot of code, bug fixes\u00a0and new functionality to IPlug (along with others whose work I have merged when I agreed with their changes). My fork of IPlug\u00a0is used by lots of others to realise their products, including by some large companies.\u00a0Although I intended to release lots of products using this framework, I have only managed to release two so far (Endless Series and VirtualCZ).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently a student (again) and not able to spend\u00a0as much time as I\u0027d like making new products to generate income. If you appreciate my continuing efforts\u00a0to maintain WDL-OL and the various open source projects that facilitate\u00a0your work and products,\u00a0please consider becoming a patron\u00a0to help me justify the time I put in!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u00a0looking forward to see what you create!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOli Larkin\u003cbr\u003eHuddersfield, UK\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.olilarkin.co.uk/i\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy website\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.kvraudio.com/developer/oli-larkin\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKvR Audio\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/olilarkin/wdl-ol\"\u003egithub\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/olilarkin/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLinkedin\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
