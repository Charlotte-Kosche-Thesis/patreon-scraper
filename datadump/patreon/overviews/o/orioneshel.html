I make travel films, music videos, vlogs, tutorials, and other subjects that aim to inspire others to create, adventure the awesomeness of the world and chase after their dreams. With Patreon, you can support my journey and help make my dreams a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(38, 38, 38);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn the year that I have been doing YouTube, I have managed to gain over 3000 followers and I get messages daily from people telling me how much they like my videos. I want to take those videos to the next level. With your guys support, I would like to improve my camera gear, make bigger, higher production videos, and maybe even go on trips that I wouldn\u0027t be able to afford other wise. Patreon allows me to not only do all that but also keep in touch and keep all you guys updated\u00a0with what\u0027s going on in my life as well as show you some behind the scenes that I don\u0027t normally show in my videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI film a lot of footage that doesn\u0027t make the cut for my YouTube channel. It is still good content but I obviously cannot put everything I film in my YouTube videos because it would make them less professional and focused on the message I am trying to pass along. Patreon gives me the opportunity to share all of those ideas, adventures, tips and bloopers that don\u0027t make the final cut with you guys, my biggest fans.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI have been asked multiple times if there is a way to support me. Patreon lets you support me, and gives me another platform to share my creations and get in touch with my biggest supporters on a more personal level.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(38, 38, 38);\"\u003eHow Much Should I Give?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eYou decide how much you want to support me.

This is the ultimate level.\u003cbr\u003e\nI didn\u0027t know if I should make this tier because I couldn\u0027t think of anything that is worth $50 a month, but just in case one of you is generous enough I thought of something interesting. Once a year, you can send me some videos or photos (has to be family friendly) and I will make a little video edit out of it for you. At the end of this video, I will also include a little video message from me. If you do choose this tier, a minimum of two months of patronage at this level is required before you can ask for your first video.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIncludes:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e*Minimum of two months patronage before requesting the message.* Once a year, I will make a little video edit for you.
