They were pretty successful and a lot of fun. My favorite thing about these projects was the constant communication with backers, sharing new yokai with them and giving weekly updates on my newest creations.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am launching this Patreon because I would like to continue working on yokai, but at a more steady pace. Instead of releasing 100 yokai all at once in a large book, I would like to \n\u003cstrong\u003ecreate a steady stream of new yokai illustrations\u003c/strong\u003e and add them to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://yokai.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyokai.com\u003c/a\u003e as they are created. I aim to create between \u003cstrong\u003e1-4 new yokai per month\u003c/strong\u003e, and of course continue the tradition of A-Yokai-A-Day during October!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you enjoy learning about Japanese folklore, then please consider backing me. Your patronage supports me both financially, allowing me to devote more time to my art, and creatively, by connecting me with an active audience. Sharing my work with you is the most fulfilling part of being an artist.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jnYM5fF.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eLike with other Patreon projects, all of the yokai I create will be \n\u003cstrong\u003efreely available on the internet\u003c/strong\u003e. And whether this project gets 0 backers or 100, I will still be creating yokai anyway. You can cancel your pledge at any time, so there is no pressure to continue if you decide you don\u0027t want to support me any more.\u00a0But your support means a lot to me, and will make it possible to do much more than I would be able to do without it!"
