    "summary": "Thank you for visiting our Patreon campaign. We know you have a lot of options for how to spend your entertainment dollars. We appreciate you considering sponsoring Our Turn! Women on gaming.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur Turn! Women on Gaming started because founding host, Cathy Ford, an avid podcast listener, could not find any gaming podcasts hosted and led by women. She found several that has women as co-hosts but none that shared purely the women\u0027s perspective. So, she decided to create one.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCathy reached out to all of her women gaming friends via Facebook Messenger and asked if anyone would be interested in helping her create and run a podcast on gaming. Five women came forward and a nascent idea became a reality. The group, made up of Cathy Ford, Ella Dowell, Maida Farrar, Melissa Farrar, Nicole Martin, and Sarah Reed, began planning and working to set up the show in April of 2016 and on June 15, 2016 Our Turn! Women on Gaming was LIVE.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the next 12 months there were some significant changes to the team. Life happens and takes some down other paths. Maida, Melissa, Ella, and Nicole have taken on other challenges in their lives but are always welcome to come back any time. Sarah and Cathy welcomed a new host to the show. Jessica Wade made an excellent addition to the team. However, Jessica also had to step away in 2018. Since then we have welcomed a variety of new guest hosts\u00a0to the show and we love getting to chat with them and share in their points of view on the gaming hobby we all love so much.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Our Turn! Team has been happy to welcome some contributors. These include Cathy\u0027s husband, Mark Ford, who edits the podcast every week; Frank Vicari, who does a segment on solo gaming and Jesse Metcalf, who does a segment on Role Playing Games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are all making great connections in the gaming industry. Cathy is interviewing game designers, publishers, artists, and authors; and Sarah is deeply involved in the game design community and reports on Kickstarters on a daily basis. We have joined the Dice Tower Network and are developing relationships with other gaming podcasters, both within and outside of the network. These relationships enable us to bring you more and better content every week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you find value in our show and want to help us do more, please give us your support. We will use these resources to pay for:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWeb and Media Hosting\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEquipment Upgrades\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eConvention Expenses\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGames to Review\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdding More Content \u0026amp; Interviews\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAgain, thank you for your consideration.
