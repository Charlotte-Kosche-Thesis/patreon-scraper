     "description": "Open sourcing a site like OpenGameArt.org isn\u0027t as simple as you might think.\u0026nbsp; OGA runs on top of Drupal, which stores a lot of information necessary for the site to function in the site database, which means that in order for someone to download a copy of OGA that works well enough that development can be done, the database needs to be included.\u0026nbsp; Unfortunately, the database is a) way too big to allow people to download without bringing the server to its knees, and b) contains personal information such as email addresses and hashed passwords, which can\u0027t be released to the public.\u0026nbsp; What this means is that I\u0027ll have to write and maintain a program that sanitizes and shrinks the OGA database so that it will be easy to download and not compromise anyone\u0027s personal information.\u0026nbsp; As new features are added to the site (along with necessary database schema changes), this program will need to be kept up to date so that the database remains properly sanitized, which means that not only is open sourcing OGA a large initial effort, it will require that I devote some amount of time to it continuously just to make sure people can always get the latest working version.\u0026nbsp; In the event that we receive code contributions (and open sourcing your code is not in any way a guarantee of that), I\u0027ll need to spend time coordinating developing, cleaning up code, coaching potential developers (Drupal has a hefty learning curve), and providing support to people wanting to get a working copy of the site running on their own machine.\u0026nbsp; Ultimately, this may result in a lot of new features, but going open source is a time investment; you can only get back what you put in.\u003cbr\u003e",
