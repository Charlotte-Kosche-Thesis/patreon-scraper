    "summary": "Creating art is my passion. Sharing ideas is\nmy profession. To inspire is my mission.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor\nnearly twenty years collage has been the lens through which I see the world. It was how I shaped my views and expressed my voice. In that time, my definition of collage has gotten a little hazy. When I was twelve my mom went\nback to school for Graphic Design. We got a Mac and this thing called\nPhotoshop in the house, and it was game over for me. Until then, I\nhad been drawing monsters on lined paper at school when they tell me\nI should have been paying attention. My monsters would evolve from\npage to page. I called it Monster Days. Their survival mechanisms\nwere put to test by tiny army men, helicopters, and tanks shooting\ndotted lines. Some monsters learned to fly. Some grew bigger teeth or\ntwo heads or twenty. I was designing. I was iterating. I was having fun, but suddenly I had a\nctrl + z, and a file \u0026gt; save as at my command.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDigital\nart had opened the door to a creative outlet previously closed to me.\nThe ability to take a photograph and tweak it, blend it, destroy it\nwas utterly appealing. I poured over books (Scott Kelby\u0027s mostly) and\nonline tutorials learning new techniques to apply them to my own art,\nthat sometimes I affectionately refer to as shart.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eA\nfriend, who I can\u0027t remember a time that I didn\u0027t know him as such,\nwas also interested in art and game design signed up to go to our\nlocal tech school, Gloucester County Institute of Technology, for\ngraphic arts our last two years of school. I asked what the class\ninvolved. \"You\u0027d be all about this\" he said. He was right.\nI was.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eGoing\nfrom an environment where I was bound to a desk feeling left behind\nand left out to one that valued creativity and was working towards an\nend goal greater than a piece of paper and throwing a funny hat into\nthe air was incredible. It was one of those times where you feel\nyourself shift course and end up exactly where you belong at that\nmoment.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAt\nGCIT was when I met one of the greatest teachers ever. I know a lot\nof people say that about some teacher or another, but they would be\nwrong. I knew I loved technology, and I loved art, but it wasn\u0027t\nuntil seeing the passion that this teacher had for sharing his\nlifetime of knowledge gained in the world of printing, and the world\nin general, that I developed a complete admiration for the craft of\nteaching. Teachers, and a couple in particular, are why I do what I\ndo today. And not all teachers work in a classroom. Also, Graf Comm.\nEnough said for a few of you :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAfter\nGCIT, I attended Antonelli Institute. A small photography and art\nschool outside of Philadelphia. My graduating class was something\nlike 42 people. Antonelli had more of the studio based classroom\nenvironments I seem to thrive in. All of our projects were with the\nend goal of producing a portfolio. This made sense to me. One teacher\nin particular there noticed me, and really took an interest in\nchallenging me. I was helping with designs for the school and\nteaching other \n\u003cbr\u003e\nstudents\nin his class almost immediately. To this day we are still friends,\nand I am honored to say I was the best man in his wedding a couple\nyears back. Our friendship and shared interest in all things worn and\ngrungey has done more for my art, professionalism, and dedication\nthan any classroom by far. Thanks you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eCurrently,\nI am back in school myself for art education. The passion to teach\nand spread knowledge was bestowed to me by those teachers I looked up\nto growing up. For the last 10 or so years I have been working as a\ngraphic designer, but now my focus is much more on learning and\nteaching.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy\n\"day job\" now is that of Maker in Residence at a local\npublic library\u0027s Maker Space where I teach 3D Printing, STEAM based\nclasses, and facilitate self-directed learning within patrons. I\nfound out about the MakerStudio@GCLS from my dad who was reading the\nnewspaper, and saw an article that the library had gotten a 3d\nprinter. He knew I was really interested in this, but didn\u0027t have the\nmeans of purchasing my own yet. I was in luck, and knew the\nlibrarian, in the article. We were both volunteers with The FAF\nCoalition in Woodbury, NJ and happened to have a meeting that night.\nI basically blurted out, \"Dude, let me get on that 3D Printer!\"\nHe did. Thankfully.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy\nfirst project was printing an Usonian inspired home I modeled. I\nrecently decided that despite not having a degree to teach, or any\nreal qualifications besides my enthusiasm, I would get a job teaching\nat a arts and tech based Summer camp program. That weekend was when I\nwould have my first face to face meeting with the company, Black\nRocket LLC, to present a sample lesson. I really wanted to blow them\naway. I did. The library let me print this house the next day, and\nwhen I showed it around it was the first 3D printed thing almost\neveryone I knew had seen. That was so cool to me. I was on my way of becoming a modern day\ntroubadour for 3D printing and emerging technology.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\nwould love to do more than I am capable of doing just through the\nMakerStudio. If you enjoy my work, attended a show, been given a\npiece of art, please considering helping me bring more of it into the\nworld. Having the financial backing to be able to purchase new\nequipment, software, art supplies, and coffee would not only allow me to take my passion to the next level, but also to connect\nmore closely with those of you already supporting me with your love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for reading (it\u0027s okay if you skipped to the end), and all of the support you have shown.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Jim\u003cbr\u003e"
