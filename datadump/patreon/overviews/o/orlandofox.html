    "summary": "Hey everyone! Brianna here; or, as a lot of you may more commonly know me as, Orlando Fox!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just a teenager that tends to visually portray herself as a cartoon fox online! I\u0027m very shy and socially awkward in person, but if there\u0027s one thing I adore in this world (let alone, am most \u0027skilled\u0027 at), it\u0027s drawing. Day and/or night, I practically commit all my free time to it! Without the support and kindness of many friends and folks, I wouldn\u0027t have gotten where I am today. And, while I still have a lot to improve upon in my work and the thought of making a Patreon here hasn\u0027t crossed my mind much before, but I thought I\u0027d give it a shot and try my luck with this thing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough... I\u0027m gonna be honest with you; while I have a huge love, admiration, passion; pretty much positive outlook about art and engaging in it myself, I\u0027m not the most \u0027consistent\u0027 or \u0027organized\u0027 in theme of what I do. I don\u0027t do daily sketches of a particular nature, weekly portraits, or anything like that. I just doodle what comes to my mind, be it fan art or anything else. And eight times out of ten, I decide to post it online somewhere. However.. I do tend to draw many things that never see the light of day. Never do I think to post them at any point, or go back and finish them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith this Patreon, I mainly plan to post sketches/doodles that I\u0027ve never posted before, sketch phases of completed drawings I\u0027ve made, more secret stuff, and all that jazz! \u003c/strong\u003e(\u003cem\u003eAnd I\u0027ve even been trying to get into storyboard work (my dream job) and small animation stuff, so who knows what could go on here!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThere won\u0027t be any schedule as to when I post what either! I\u0027d like to aim for at least one or two things weekly (anything I can manage to do during school and such)! But aside from that, digital/traditional stuff galore may come from me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd given this, I\u0027m just going for a $1 minimum-a-month payment reward. I do enjoy drawing and showing what I do, and since I have nothing truly special planned with this thing (yet), I\u0027d just be flattered at any bit of support each month. Of course, this will earn you access to see whatever un-posted works come from me and I want you to know how thankful and appreciative I am! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo... yeah! That\u0027s all I have to say here! Thank you so much for giving this page a look! Have a nice day!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther places I\u0027m at:\u003cbr\u003eTwitter:\u00a0twitter.com/orlando_fox\u003cbr\u003edeviantART:\u00a0thedoggygal.deviantart.com\u003cbr\u003eTumblr:\u00a0orlandofox.tumblr.com"
