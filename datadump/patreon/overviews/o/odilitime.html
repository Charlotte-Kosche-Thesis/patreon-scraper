This person is an expert in her field, and therefore would be a great source of knowledge for your forum; but if a registration, complete with e-mail and password, is necessary before posting, she might just give up on posting and do something more important. People with \u003cem\u003elives\u003c/em\u003e will tend to ignore forums with a registration process.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRegistration lets in bad posters.\u003c/strong\u003e On the other hand, people with \u003cem\u003eno lives\u003c/em\u003e will thrive on your forum. Children and Internet addicts tend to have free time to go register an account and check their e-mail for the confirmation message. They will generally make your forum a waste of bandwidth.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRegistration attracts trolls.\u003c/strong\u003e If someone is interested in destroying a forum, a registration process only adds to the excitement of a challenge. One might argue that a lack of registration will just let \"anyone\" post, but in reality \u003cem\u003eanyone can post on old-type forum software\u003c/em\u003e; registration is merely a useless hassle. Quoting a 4channeler:\u003cblockquote\u003eTrolls are \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e out to protect their own reputation. They seek to destroy \u003cem\u003eother\u003c/em\u003e peoples\u0027 \"reputation\" ... Fora with only registered accounts are like a garden full of flowers of vanity a troll would just love to pick.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnonymity counters vanity.\u003c/strong\u003e On a forum where registration is required, or even where people give themselves names, a clique is developed of the elite users, and posts deal as much with who you are as what you are posting. On an anonymous forum, if you can\u0027t tell who posts what, logic will overrule vanity. As Hiroyuki, the administrator of 2ch, writes:\u003cblockquote\u003eIf there is a user ID attached to a user, a discussion tends to become a criticizing game. On the other hand, under the anonymous system, even though your opinion/information is criticized, you don\u0027t know with whom to be upset. Also with a user ID, those who participate in the site for a long time tend to have authority, and it becomes difficult for a user to disagree with them. Under a perfectly anonymous system, you can say, \"it\u0027s boring,\" if it is actually boring. All information is treated equally; only an accurate argument will work.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom a recent write up about how ideas should work in anonymous community:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnon has an idea\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnon posts the idea anonymously\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOther anons dismantle, improve or hate on the idea\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou get honest critique for the idea\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf many anons like the idea then it gets done\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eAdditionally, anonymity is more honest about your identity when you\u0027re posting on the Internet. \u003cbr\u003eThere are plenty out there claiming that anonymity causes bad behavior on the Internet. But is this really true? As long as one can use a fake name, a bad actor can still be a bad actor and to the\u00a0those who are uninitiated to the ways of Internet, a fake name maybe taken for the truth. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsing your real name on the Internet just causes serious problems, people got doxed, they get their identity stolen. The 1990s it was common wisdom NOT TO USE YOUR REAL NAME on the Internet. I don\u0027t know what happened, I\u0027m guessing, someone try it and nothing bad happened to them, so it must be ok right?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s very little ways to prove you are who you say are. Some hide behind handles, others will use a fake name and most will use a real name. All of these are no better than saying you\u0027re anonymous. An a fake name is harmful because it makes the people using their real name think they\u0027re in good company for using their real name. This leads to a false illusion of authority and does no one any favors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso there are no women on the Internet:\u003cbr\u003e\"In real life, people like you for being a girl. They want to fuck you, so they pay attention to you and they pretend what you have to say is interesting, or that you are smart or clever. On the Internet, we don\u0027t have the chance to fuck you. This means the advantages of being a \"girl\" does not exist. You don\u0027t get a bonus to conversation just because I\u0027d like to put my cock in you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you make a post like, \"hurr durr, I\u0027m a girl\" you are begging for attention. The only reason to post it is because you want your girl-advantage back, because you are too vapid and too stupid to do or say anything interesting without it. You are forgetting the rules, these are no girls on the Internet.\u003cbr\u003eThe one exception to this rule, the one way you can get your \"girlness\" back on the Internet, is to post your tits. This is, and should be, degrading for you, an admission that the only interesting thing about you is your naked body.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003etl;dr: tits or GET THE FUCK OUT\"\u00a0- Anonymous\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel this is important because it\u00a0fosters more intelligent discussions, more honest critique and helps defeat\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-authority\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eappeal to authority fallacies\u003c/a\u003e (your level of knowledge should be easily demonstrate through discussion and everyone should make up their own opinions on whether to trust it or not).\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e/rant\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOpen source software projects\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://gitgud.io/u/odilitime\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://gitgud.io/u/odilitime\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/odilitime/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://github.com/odilitime/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
