    "summary": "Hey guys! My name is Leanne, or rather Onyxeia! I\u0027m an aspiring cosplayer and alternative model living on the south coast of the UK.\u003cbr\u003eSince I was little, I was into Comics and video games. One of my earliest memories was sat watching my brother playing Sonic The Hedgehog on the Sega Megadrive, eagerly waiting till I was old enough and capable to play myself.\u00a0\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eFast forward a few nerdy years, I attended my first Comic Con in London. I was in awe of the very few people who were dressed as some of my favourite comic book characters. From then on I decided that I too would start dressing up for cons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next con I went to, I dressed as Misa Amane from Death Note, consisting of stuff mostly from my wardrobe (being into the goth look) and a few bought things. It wasn\u0027t great, but I had fun and that is what cosplay is about, and from then on i\u0027ve been hooked. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow with each cosplay, I am trying to learn and improve my skills, challenging myself and having the time of my life! Over the last year I have attended around 15 local conventions as a guest, holding panels and judging cosplay competitions. With your amazing help i\u0027d love to be able to attend bigger conventions spread further around the country and possibly other countries, better my skills with every new build and give back to you amazing people! As cosplay builds can cost anywhere from \u00a3100 to \u00a31000 depending on how many materials are needed, with your help I could create bigger, better, more magical cosplays and provide you all with tutorials and behind the scenes whilst i\u0027m making them! I am beyond grateful for any help and support given to me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate goal is to become well known in the industry and attending bigger cons as a guest/judge/holding workshops and to make cosplays that reach new heights! \u003cbr\u003eThank you for looking and all of your love and support\u003cbr\u003eLove Onyxeia \u2665\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
