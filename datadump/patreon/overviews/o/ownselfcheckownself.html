Whether it\u0027s through satire, spoken word poems, raps or parodies, I see my videos as a way of informing the public about the shortcomings of our politicians in an entertaining fashion.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/98Jt4yG.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThey\u0027re meant to be light-hearted and \n\u003cstrong\u003enot intentionally provocative or offensive\u003c/strong\u003e. I try to produce my videos in a different format each time to keep things fresh, and so far, the topics I\u0027ve covered includes the elite\u0027s dismissive view of the 99%, the government\u0027s elitist and racist comments, their hypocritical actions and remarks, and the farce that is Singapore politics.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wenkai31/videos/10207643513876582/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lhuwenkai.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/to-the-rich-kid-who-complained-about-me-complaining-promo.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/2M5agr8.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have already written and planned for a number of videos in 2017, and they will touch on a multitude of topics besides the government per se. There will be more rap videos/parodies, and in line with my goal of having a different concept each time, there\u0027ll also be content with unique styles not \u0027used\u0027 in my previous works.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wenkai31/videos/10209366151621449/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lhuwenkai.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/if-you-wont-vote-for-me-thumbnail.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/VHRfI8p.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am also interested in producing more Mandarin-based content as I find that language more enjoyable to work with. It\u0027ll allow me to not only target overseas markets, but also the elderly (extremely vital demographic) as well since most of them aren\u0027t well-versed in English.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, with all that being said, \n\u003cstrong\u003ethe increasing financial cost of such projects will prove to be a massive stumbling block eventually,\u003c/strong\u003e which is why I need your help, here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3umpM3J.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?
