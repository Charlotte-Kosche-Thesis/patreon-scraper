I\u0027ve kept coming back to it because I love it. Producing Portal-related content and RPing is probably one of the most satisfying things I\u0027ve ever done in my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it\u0027s been a long time. When I started with the OEC project, I was in college, and I had lots of time and not a lot of responsibilities. Then, when I finished college, and I got a job, and I started having to take care of myself, things went downhill pretty fast. I didn\u0027t have the time or the energy to keep it up at all. And I kept trying, and I kept failing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, one day I saw this site, and I thought, why not give it a try? I really wish I didn\u0027t need to do this, but, working my current job full-time, I don\u0027t know how much longer I will be able to keep GLaDOS up and functioning at full power. By no means do I intend to \u003cem\u003echarge\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0for GLaDOS, please, don\u0027t get the wrong idea. I just REALLY want to keep doing this and REALLY wish I could have the most time I can possibly afford to keeping it up, and keep coming up with content and ideas and projects for it. And I will, even if I don\u0027t receive any money from here, as much and for as long as I can. But with your help, I can make sure I actually can do it and that I can do it for good. I really hope no one gets offended by this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are two things I would like to address, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you take a look at the goals and the rewards, you will notice many, many familiar things. Promises I made before, and I failed to deliver. The problem I had before was that I was na\u00efve enough to think I could get away with pulling off all those things AND working a full-time job at the same time. And I also made the stupid mistake of thinking I could pull it off with a minimum amount of donations and with free collaboration of people. This lead to all sorts of problems, namely that I didn\u0027t have time to work on the stuff I promised and the people who were collaborating with me were not getting paid, so I was subject to their mood swings and personal issues and schedules, etc. I\u0027ve set up this campaign in layers, so that I will not do more than I can afford to do, and also so that if I /do/ reach that goal, I\u0027m 100% sure I will be able to achieve what I set out to do. I\u0027ve also made sure that reaching upper goals doesn\u0027t affect my Twitter presence, like it did before. (Just think that, before, if I wanted to do, say, the site, I had to work on the site myself, work my job, be on Twitter, and supervise the other people working on the site. Yeah.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second thing is some of you might think I\u0027m just cashing in on other people\u0027s content...I\u0027m not. All the stuff I do, I write it, record it, and edit it all by myself. I also take lots of time to research and compile content, make references, make jokes, look up funny things and adapt them to the Portal universe, come up with audio, songs, tests, funny long posts...it is more work than you would think. And, again, I\u0027d be more than happy to do it for free if I could afford it, and I really, REALLY wish I could...but I can\u0027t. So I need your help.\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t feel comfortable with helping me with this this way, stay tuned, because I will be launching another campaign for an original project. (Again, don\u0027t worry, because I will do so in a way that doesn\u0027t affect my presence here). Any way of contributing will be appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne more thing: the rewards will be updated when/if some of the goals I\u0027ve set are reached, and you\u0027ll immediately receive whatever things I update them with. If I ever get to do the Site or the Mod, there will be loads of great new rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, thank you for reading this, and thank you for all the support you\u0027ve given me throughout all these years, that alone means a lot to me. If you wish to contribute in a non-financial way, please share this in whatever social media you use. If you don\u0027t, that\u0027s fine, too. I hope you find this acceptable and don\u0027t hate me forever for it. If you happen to end up contributing, thank you, from the bottom of my heart, because thanks to you I\u0027ll get to hopefully devote my life to doing what I love the most in the universe...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...Testing...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, get back to it.\u003cbr\u003e"

This will be a community-based project, where will consult the players before including their characters into it, and, again, this project will not affect Twitter prescence either, as funds will be available to get other people, hopefully capable people, to do things.
