The notion of swimming in cool chemical-free freshwater has got a lot of us so excited, we\u0027re digging holes and jumping into ponds. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, I\u0027m David Pagan Butler, I make films about making Organic pools and invent bubble powered pond equipment. I have also been known to drink pond water.\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank all my followers that have helped me on this wondrous journey. The response to my film material has been staggering, with over 35 million views.\u003cbr\u003eIt seems many of us love the idea of swimming in freshwater. My motivation is to help more people make their own Organic Pool, through instructional films laced with humor and occasional disasters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy films and DIY Manual from my website organicpools.co.uk have already inspired Organic Pools all over the globe and, as you may imagine, I get a lot of questions. Also, some have asked if I provide a subscription service and that brought me to Patreon. As I find it easier to make films on the subject,\u00a0 I thought Patreon would be the best way to help me to make regular Organic Pools DIY films to help those making their own pools and those that are still dreaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I aim make a video every 4 weeks or so, maybe more, and Patreon subscribers will be the first to see them. I\u0027ll put them on youtube, a week later.\u003cbr\u003eBy being a patron, you will help me cover costs and get more of these films made. I think it\u0027s a great way for me to provide this information, while being supported by lovely people that choose to help.\u003cbr\u003eSome of my films take years to make ... others seconds. I have got loads of video material of pools over the years that can illustrate long term processes and I have also got lots of spontaneous ideas to share.\u00a0 And I\u0027ll be even more inspired knowing you lovely people are waiting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
