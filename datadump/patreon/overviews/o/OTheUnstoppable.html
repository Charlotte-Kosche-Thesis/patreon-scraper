I grew up around avid social rights activists and wanted to changed the world with my words. I was militant and angry - and so was my poetry - for a long while, and then...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I met Zen 17 years ago - though I had been meditating in a way since I was 5 - and I have dedicated the power I find in my words to promoting peace ... the peace that I find within. \u00a0I have been moved, rocked to my very foundation by the words of Rumi, Hafiz, Shakespeare, Sanchez, etc. etc. ... \u0026amp; and I want to move my world as I have been moved.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My Mom asked me once, \"So, Oni, how are you going to make all of this change in the world that you talk about?\" I said, without hesitation \u0026amp; without knowing exactly what I meant at the time, \"with who I am.\" So I change myself, over and over, to be a source of positive change and vision.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I write these words of peace and joy and upliftment not in denial of the pain and suffering in our world, but to focus on the Light...because I have a choice. And, peace is my choice; poetry is my vehicle. Your support will help me to compose everyday and to support myself in doing what I have always loved. Poetry was my first voice. It gave me a stage on which to play and profess and be heard and to hear. I am also a classically trained actor \u0026amp; professional voice actor and have always been told that I should put my poems on tape (back when there was tape). Now, finally, I am recording a series of singles and albums of me reading my work. The first 2 - \"To Be You\" \u0026amp; \"My Skin\" are out now on iTunes, Google Play, Bandcamp,Tidal, and all other music streaming services. These tracks will soon become a weekly podcast. Further, I\u0027ll be video recording some of these readings and releasing them in a video blog. All the world\u0027s a stage, and now, apparently, it\u0027s also a poem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I\u0027ve published the 3 books in a trilogy of works, \"Speed Limit 55: poems in a Chicago season\" in 2014, \"Mile 84: poems to ride to\" in 2015, and now the 3rd - \"Illinois 19: poems on the way home\" in 2016. Additionally, three more books are mostly written and nearing editing phases. I will use \u00a0your encouragement and support to expand the life-affirming words of peace and joy coming through me out into a world that is aching for better news, more love, a little relief. Your support will create a platform for a newer vision of humanity via the written word, audio, and video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Peace is possible. Love can be a lifestyle. Someone must proclaim a new vision for our world; let\u0027s do it together. Check out the first single on Bandcamp:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://otheunstoppable.bandcamp.com/releases\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\"To Be You\" on Bandcamp\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
