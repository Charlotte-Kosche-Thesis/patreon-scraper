He\u2019s a Wizard. He knows \nstuff. Go ahead; ask him anything.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo the guy decides to be clever. He says to me: \u201cAlright, Mr. Wizard, you tell me: What is the question I should ask?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout\n missing a beat, I reply: \u201cThe question you should be asking yourself \nis, \u2018What am I here for?\u2019 And when you figure that out, then that\u2019s what\n you should be doing with your life.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe guy goes, \u201cWow. That\u2019s heavy.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd Richard says, \u201cWhat did I tell you? Wizard!\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what am \u003cem\u003eI\u003c/em\u003e\n here for? Early in my life, I came up with a personal mission statement\n that I have pursued unchanged for the past 55 years: \u201cTo be a catalyst \nfor the coalescence of consciousness.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis\n is the not-so-secret agenda behind my founding of the Church of Worlds,\n the Neo-Pagan movement, and the Grey School of Wizardry, as well as \nevery other project I have created throughout my life. In furtherance of\n this Mission, I have also written a number of books, and I have a long \nlist of more that are either in process, or on the drawing board. In \norder to continue this Work, however, for the remaining years left to \nme, I need your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recently passed my 75th\n birthday. Over the past few years, all of my contemporaries have been \ndropping like flies. After 40 amazing and adventurous years together, my\n beloved lifemate, the incomparable Morning Glory, made her passage to \nthe Summerlands nearly 4 years ago, and I am deeply bereft. Among the \nvarious Founders, leaders, teachers and Elders of the Pagan community \nfrom the dawning days of the movement in the early 1960s, I\u2019m pretty \nmuch the last one still standing, having done my first initiatory \nwater-sharing in 1962, and having been the first person to proclaim \nmyself as \u201cPagan\u201d in 1967. I have all that history in my head, along \nwith memories of all the other dedicated pioneers it has been my \nprivilege to have known over half a century. But my own remaining days \nare surely numbered (I was operated on for colon cancer in 2007\u2026), and \nwhen I too have gone, all that founding era will pass from living \nmemory. While I\u2019m still around, I make this appeal to my People for \nwhatever support you feel called to offer. Even as little as a dollar a \nmonth from so many could make all the difference in the world\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\n already have two e-books available, and I have it in mind to create \nseveral more as I get support. I will email copies to any Patrons who \npledge $10 a month. So far I have:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eProphecy \u0026amp; the End of the World (as we know it): Apocalypse or\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eSolartopia? \u003c/em\u003ewith Harvey Wasserman (TheaGenesis, 2012)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBarsoom: A New Map of the Mars of Edgar Rice Burroughs\u2019 \u201cJohn Carter of Mars\u201d Novels \u003c/em\u003e(TheaGenesis, 2012)\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am honored to share with you these testimonials...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMorning Glory was a Natural Witch since the 1950s, and a dedicated Pagan activist since the early 1970s. Without her and her husband Oberon, both the face and the depths of modern Paganism would look very, very different. It is largely thanks to them that the Pagan movement in the USA embraced the Goddess as Mother Nature.\u003cbr\u003eThe Zells articulated the Gaea Thesis and spread the word about it in GREEN EGG in the early 1970s. Back then, GREEN EGG, published by the Church of All Worlds, was the only real pan-Pagan publication, and it was the one place where regularly-published unfettered and uncensored discussion and debate occurred among many different individual practitioners and paths of Pagan practice.\u003cbr\u003eGREEN EGG was what we had: No Aquarian Tabernacle, no Circle Network, no Witchvox, no Pagan music publishing companies, no Internet, no Pagan or occult section at Barnes and Noble\u2014indeed, precious few books at all, really. GREEN EGG was the lifeline that let us connect to each other.\u003cbr\u003eWe cannot possibly give back to the Zells as much as they have given to us, their\u003cbr\u003ecommunity. But we can do our best: take out our incense and candles, and get that mojo working! And donate money to support the preservation of their legacy for us all. Really, it\u2019s the least we can do!\u003cbr\u003e\u2014Valerie Voigt, Independent Religious Institutions Professional\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo those who study the occult, in particular, Witchcraft, the name of Oberon Zell is internationally-known and respected\u2026 Perhaps, as some have written, Oberon is the real Albus Dumbledore to aspiring Harry Potters! One of the American pioneers of Paganism in the United States, his lifetime of learning and information is shared with readers from all walks of life. He started in 1968 with the publication of his award-winning journal, Green Egg, and is often considered by readers as one of their favorite Pagan writers.\u003cbr\u003e\u2014Lee Prosser, Fate Magazine 3/19/2004\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOberon Zell was the first person to conceive and publish the biological and metaphysical foundations of what has become known as the \u201cGaia Theory\u201d\u2014the unified body and emergent soul of the living Earth. Oberon\u2019s profound reconciliation of science, mythology and spirituality inspired and infused a worldwide neo- Pagan, pantheist movement. His visionary sculpture of the \u2018Millennial Gaia\u2019 is a three-dimensional revelation, an artistic masterpiece that fuses evolutionary biology with sculptural elegance. For 36 years he has\u003cbr\u003ebeen writing and lecturing on Gaian consciousness!\u003cbr\u003e\u2014Ralph Metzner, Ph.D., Founder-President, The Green Earth Foundation\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmerican NeoPaganism would not be the vital force it is without having benefited from Oberon\u0027s creativity and insight. I am, and I think all of us should be, grateful for the services he has rendered to us and to the Gods\u003cbr\u003eover many years.\u003cbr\u003e--Gus diZerega, Writer, Futurist\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
