We are Matthew Enthoven, Charles Green, Aaron Rutledge, and Richard Triggs, and we\u0027re the four founders of OpenCritic.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBut we\u0027re more than just \"founders of OpenCritic.\" We\u0027re also gamers. From the throne of the Lich King; to Summoner\u0027s Rift; to Mirage (sorry Dust2); to the Vault of Glass; to the Boston wasteland; to Skyrim; and to the fields of Aiur;\u00a0we love games across the entire spectrum. Games are more than just a hobby for us; they\u0027re part of our very identity. The future of the industry matters to each of us on a personal level.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re also builders. We\u0027ve built a lot together, from WoW addons, to guild websites, to automating guild recruitment, to Diablo 3 bots (just for fun, we promise), to League of Legends features, to WoW armory data mining. Each of us still has a full-time job with other companies building things. We think that evolving the gaming industry is going to take more than just talk and criticism - it\u0027ll take builders.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOpenCritic started with us - four friends that want to drive both real and positive change in the video game industry. Call it naive optimism, but we do truly believe that we can make things better for developers, critics, and most importantly, gamers. While we are (currently) a review website, our long-term vision for OpenCritic is to be the place where gamers come to celebrate games.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYour Patreon\u00a0donations matter to OpenCritic, but we also wanted to stress that they matter to us as people too. Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003eThe money goes to supporting OpenCritic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook, OpenCritic is \u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0profitable. It\u0027s not even close. Servers alone run us into a loss, and when you toss in engineering time, visual design outsourcing, and more, this becomes a very expensive project. We need you support as we move forward and try to take OpenCritic from its humble beginnings to an industry force.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re using the money currently to pay for our servers and operational costs.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s OpenCritic planning?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/h1\u003eWe don\u0027t really know, and we like it that way.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOpenCritic doesn\u0027t really have a plan. That\u0027s not how we approach development. There is no 1-year plan. There\u0027s barely even a 3-month plan.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOur development culture and philosophy is based around iteration, running small experiments and then building where we see success. For example, gathering and displaying critic names were a small, 2-3 hour effort. We launched them and saw a lot of gamers and critics enjoy it, so we built on it and made critic pages. Another example is the score graphs: we saw that people really liked the score graph and that they had an increased chance of coming back if they clicked on the score orb, so we moved the graph to be more focused. We\u0027re making user accounts so that you can save your trusted outlets after seeing a lot of users gravitate towards this feature.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, we\u0027re honest when we say \"we don\u0027t really have a plan.\" We\u0027ll try a whole bunch of small things and keep building whenever gamers, critics, and users say \"MOAR! Better! FASTER! DO EET.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe have a lot of ideas for how to make the gaming industry better (seriously, a LOT of ideas), but it starts with just these three:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e \u003cli\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eBe as transparent as possible\u003c/strong\u003e. No hidden weightings. No black-box processes. Actively participate in the gaming community. Straight answers.\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFocus on people\u003c/strong\u003e. Gamers and the gaming industry consist of some of the most creative and passionate people in the world. We want OpenCritic to have a clear human and personal focus.\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGamers first\u003c/strong\u003e. Games are more than just a hobby, art form, or competitive realm. They\u0027re a medium for connection, introspection, and mastery. They\u0027re something worth celebrating, together.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get for donating? What are the rewards?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/h1\u003eWe\u0027re... still working on rewards. Like I said above, we like doing small experiments. Patreon\u00a0is an experiment for us, so we have no idea how things are going to go.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf we see a lot of Patreon subscribers, we\u0027ll work to make new rewards and give back to you guys. If we don\u0027t see a lot of subscribers and this is a total flop, we\u0027ll probably stick with the basic rewards that we have now.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAny donation is met with our sincerest thanks. We\u0027ll also occasionally post previews to things we\u0027re working on for Patreon\u00a0donors to see and give feedback on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt $9/mo, we\u0027ll add you to our list of donors on OpenCritic.com.\u003cbr\u003e"
