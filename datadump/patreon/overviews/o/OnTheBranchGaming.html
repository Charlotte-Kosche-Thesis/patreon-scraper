    "summary": "Hi. I\u0027m Amarith, and I own OnTheBranchGaming, a Let\u0027s Play Youtube channel that focuses on gaming, old and new. We have been making content daily on Youtube for about a year now, and have put a lot of effort into getting better at making interesting and fun videos for people to watch, or even just to listen to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a small channel, we really appreciate every viewer that checks out our content, even if they don\u0027t decide to become a subscriber for a while. The whole point of this Patreon account is for people who do enjoy our content, and want to support us in our endeavors to keep creating content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEarning money from Youtube is difficult and takes a while before you even see the first paycheck. Getting revenue is all based on the people who watch, like, and subscribe to the content that is created. The most important factor is having the advertisements run on the channel, as that is what is actually paying us. Many people we know use an extension known as AdBlock, that disables advertising on pages. If you do want to support us, whether you watch the ads on our videos, or block them with AdBlock, we appreciate every little bit that you are willing to give us. Because even $1 a month is way more than we would ever get just from advertising revenue per person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you for considering helping us out, and to keep out content running. I will still be editing regardless of whatever is donated here, but it is nice to see that people would choose to support what we really enjoy doing."
