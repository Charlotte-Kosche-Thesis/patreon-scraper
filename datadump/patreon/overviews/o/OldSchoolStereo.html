My name is Dereck, aka \"BigDWiz\" and I\u0027m known mainly for my expertise in old school car audio and amplifier testing. I started my YouTube channel,\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/bigdwiz\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBigDWiz\u003c/a\u003e, back in 2006, but didn\u0027t start actively uploading videos until around 2009. I grew up in what I think was the \"golden age\" of car audio....the late 80\u0027s and early 90\u0027s. I decided to start showing off videos of the older car audio equipment I used mainly because I wasn\u0027t seeing anyone else doing it on YouTube. Did you ever drool over a chrome plated Rockford Fosgate Power 1000 Mosfet back in the day? Much like classic cars, classic car audio is becoming very popular and I enjoy showing off the equipment and talking about the details. We test and overview amplifiers, speakers, tape decks, CD players, processors and more from the 70\u0027s through early 2000\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.smugmug.com/photos/i-DZsGqtZ/0/M/i-DZsGqtZ-M.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/bigdwiz\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.smugmug.com/photos/i-DZsGqtZ/0/M/i-DZsGqtZ-M.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a great way for those who can afford it, to help out with the ongoing costs of creating videos. I\u0027ve spent several thousands of dollars buying cameras, microphones, testing equipment and more to bring these videos to my followers. By supporting me here on Patreon, you\u0027ll not only help me continue to bring new and exciting videos, you\u0027ll also support the cost of the testing equipment, supplies, website, software licensing and even the electric bill (\n\u003cem\u003emy 240V power supply spins the meter like Clark W. Griswold\u0027s Christmas lights\u003c/em\u003e).\u00a0\nThe best part is you can be a part of the VIP club for as little as $1 per video! Call it a \"tip jar\" for OSS.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a Patron, you\u0027ll have inside access to the \n\u003cstrong\u003eOldSchoolStereo Labs\u003c/strong\u003e and see things I won\u0027t share with my YouTube or Facebook audience...such as early releases of new videos, exclusive behind the scenes footage and even access to a monthly Google hangout!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease don\u0027t feel bad if you can\u0027t afford to support me, I\u0027ll continue to offer free videos. I\u0027m not doing this to become rich, I just want to have a way to offer special perks to those who help with the ongoing costs of making these videos.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u0027s an example of one of my videos:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/iWNGeePHEeA?rel=0\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGeneral Patreon FAQ:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to pay in U.S. dollars? \u003c/strong\u003eNo! Pay in any currency! This site is based in the U.S. so everything is shown in dollars, but your currency will be automatically converted!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if you release 50 videos? I don\u0027t have that kind of money!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eNot to worry! Patreon lets you set a monthly maximum, so lets say you only want to donate a max of $10 per month, but you want to give $5.00 per video! No problem! Once I have uploaded two videos you will no longer be charged the rest of the month!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow many \"released videos\" do you produce a month? \u003c/strong\u003eI typically shoot for two a month. I may do more, so simply set up your monthly maximum if need be!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI noticed it says \"Per Released Video\" what does that mean?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eSometimes I like to upload random, funny or behind the scenes videos and I don\u0027t consider those my \"premium content\" so they are not \"Released Videos\" and I will not monetize them here on Patreon. This means you are only contributing towards the content that you love!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSorry man, I don\u0027t have much money! \u003c/strong\u003eThats fine! There is no obligation here! I am going to keep making free videos for you to enjoy, but even if you set your monthly max at $1 it would mean the world to me!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCan I stop donating if I can\u0027t afford it? \u003c/strong\u003eOf course! If you find the need to make a change in the future simply log in and change or cancel your account!"
