It\u0027s a massive and tedious project yet that is part of what makes it so interesting for me to work on.\u003cbr\u003eBriefly explained, the \"SPIKE\" project is basically the same story told in different mediums: it was originally intended to be a graphic novel, but when I began writing the script I realized I wanted to write it as a novel too. So now it\u0027s gonna be both!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s a quick synopsis:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"SPIKE\" follows the story of the titular main\ncharacter, Spike Shaffer, and his best friend Sam Saunders.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eSpike and Sam have known each other for years, but they\u0027re both carrying heavy\nsecrets they have not yet dared sharing with one another. In contrast to Sam\u0027s\nseemingly idyllic life, Spike\u0027s life is pure hell; he is being fostered by\nhis uncle, Charles, who in addition to beating Spike on a daily basis is also\nregularly molesting him. Spike\u0027s tense and fearful view on affection and\nphysical contact mixed with Sam\u0027s obliviousness to Spike\u0027s home situation has\nthe two boys\u0027 friendship put harshly to the test when Sam one day reveals his\nsecret; that he is in love with Spike.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eDespite the story\u0027s heavier themes, its varied and wide cast of characters helps provide a refreshing balance, complete with silly humor and dorky shenanighans\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig15.deviantart.net/88d2/f/2012/243/f/8/animation___derpin___around_by_oomizuao-d5cyw0x.gif\" style=\"width: 398px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re curious about reading parts of the old first draft and check out some artwork from the project, take a look here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://oomizuao.deviantart.com/gallery/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"SPIKE\" related artwork\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://oomizuao.deviantart.com/gallery/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://oomizuao.deviantart.com/gallery/15894619/SPIKE-the-novel\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\"SPIKE\" chapters 0-15\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will release content as often as I can, which can be all from twice a month to twice a day.

You can set a monthly max for yourself too so you never go over budget. Pledge whichever amount you are comfortable with, every dollar helps a whole lot and I am very grateful for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy fans and supporters mean a lot to me, and interacting with you all is also a nice way for me to give something back and show my appreciation of you all as well. Therefore I will try to do monthly streams, which can be either art-and-chat livestreams, or Q\u0026amp;A webchats and tutorials even. These are usually free to access for everyone, patrons or not, but as a patron you will get noted in advance on when it\u0027s scheduled to be, as well as the non-scheduled streams and you\u0027ll get invites to exclusive Patreon-streams/chats. You will also get\u00a0the first peak of new artwork before I upload them to DeviantART, in addition to bonus material, work in progress art, sketches and more that may or may not be posted on deviantART at all.\u003cbr\u003eI am also definitely open for suggestions on what you would like to see in the updates. Your opinion matters! :-)\u003cbr\u003eIn the All Posts feed, people can post fan art, get to know other patrons, and leave comments. In the Patreons Only feed, you get access to all the exclusive, monthly goodies as a reward for your pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEvery pledge helps\u003c/strong\u003e, no matter how big or small you feel it is, \u003cstrong\u003eit helps A LOT\u003c/strong\u003e! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
