I\u0027m\n just an ordinary self-taught artist trying to make a living off of something I enjoy. I typically do character design and vore content. I work on commissions for the most part but I would like to \nget more into personal art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY GOALS?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e My\n goal is to share as much as I can with everyone whilst also supporting myself! In the future, I\u0027d like to focus more on personal kinky projects and more character design stuff. I\u0027d love to have characters people love to see drawn and have art that people love to look at. Doing more personal projects also means I get more opportunity to branch out and try new things and work on improvement (My shading definitely needs work, so I don\u0027t typically offer it in commissions)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYOUR REWARDS?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo, the point of patreon is for you guys to get something out of it too.
