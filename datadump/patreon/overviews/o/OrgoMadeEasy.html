Yup! I recently brought on 4 Peer Tutors: \u003cstrong\u003eSafiya, Lynden, Sally, and Abraham\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0to help me out with tutoring and managing Orgo/Physics Made Easy. 2 of them actually are former students of mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut anyways!\u00a0No matter who you are, a current or former student or just a supporter of what I am trying to do. You can help me achieve my mission of showing students world-wide how fun, simple, and fascinating Organic Chemistry and Physics can be by becoming a Patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227,108,9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I doing and Why?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy vision for Orgo/Physics Made Easy is to eventually be subsidized by small donations that are as little as $1.50 a month from former students and people who believe in what I am trying to do.\u003c/strong\u003e This way I can eventually give raises to my tutors, lower my tutoring rates to work with lower income students, and not have to worry about not making enough money to cover expenses. It also will allow me to tutor a little less and redirect more time into completing the\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eOrgo/Physics Made Easy \u003c/strong\u003evideo library\u00a0for students everywhere.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love making videos for all of you, and my dream is to eventually create a video library of all the topics in Orgo and Physics, but Made Easy. I believe in the potential in every student and I\u0027m tired of seeing struggling students unable to access that potential because of financial situations, not so great Professors, or other reasons. They should be able to get the help that they deserve, and \u003cstrong\u003ereach their full potential\u003c/strong\u003e. Because when they do, it\u0027s incredible what they can\naccomplish. I was once a struggling and lost Pre-Med student who was feeling\nunmotivated and uninterested in my science courses. I didn\u0027t believe that I\u0027d\never be able to \"get it\", and now I still can\u0027t believe that I eat, sleep, and breathe Orgo and Physics 24/7. Haha\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was thanks to a special combination of amazing \u003cstrong\u003eProfessors\u003c/strong\u003e (Ken Adams, Chip Celenza, Ed Loechler, Eric Widmaier, Andrew Duffy), \u003cstrong\u003eTeaching Assistants\u003c/strong\u003e (Leila Haery, Sanda Zolj, and Tom Sisto), and me \u003cstrong\u003eworking as a Tutor\u003c/strong\u003e that showed me how to have more fun with science while thinking about it in a more simple and logical way. It also involved thinking more critically and logically\nwhich made a HUGE difference. They helped me approach and learn science in a\ndifferent way that blew my mind!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThinking in this new way made me feel super curious, excited, and most importantly, passionate. Which was just an incredible feeling that I hadn\u0027t ever felt in my life. I went from getting grades in the B range to almost straight As for the rest of College. And\never since, through tutoring and videos, I want to pass on the way I think\nabout science to students and to help them reach their full potential as early\nas possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhy am I asking for support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eSo I\u0027ve always joked that my videos are multi-purpose. (1) Educational for college science students and (2) Sleep-Aids for the common-person who doesn\u0027t care about Organic Chemistry. (Never underestimate the power of Boredom.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSurprisingly the second purpose hasn\u0027t been strong enough to catch enough viewers to make my YouTube channel sustainable. But anyways all jokes aside. Educational videos like mine unfortunately are not the best way to thrive on YouTube. Even many big educational YouTube channels don\u0027t receive enough money from YouTube when you consider the number of people working on each video or the time it takes. It usually takes me \u003cstrong\u003e~8-16 Hours (Two Days)\u003c/strong\u003e to Plan, Film, Edit, and Finalize a video. Also nowadays a majority of viewers having ad-block really reduces the ad-revenue we receive. It\u0027s totally understandable though, Ads are annoying, but unfortunately it still hurts YouTube content creators out there. I am grateful for the fact that I can even receive ad-revenue from my videos but it would be awesome if I could focus more of my time on planning and creating my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I thought Patreon would be a good solution and a win-win for everyone. With a little help from you guys, my supporters and students, I can put more time into my videos and keep the videos \u003cstrong\u003e100% free \u003c/strong\u003eand\u00a0available for everyone. Because let\u0027s be real, paid subscription services are not as cool. Even if it\u0027s just \u003cstrong\u003e1$\u003c/strong\u003e or \u003cstrong\u003e2$\u003c/strong\u003e a month, if just a small fraction of my viewers donated, it would really help keep the stress bugs away and allow me to devote more time into Orgo Made Easy with less distractions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I like about Patreon is that I can continue to do what I love, get to interact with you all a little more, and also give you rewards for helping support my channel and my dream!
