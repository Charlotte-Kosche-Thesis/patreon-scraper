     "about": "Hi there! I\u0027m well..Tonya Narzinsky. I\u0027m a Florida Native studying Psychology (trying to make it to my MA Degree). I am a pisces and love to create from dance choreography, to modeling, to my recent last year of recording music ( My first EP album) which I wrote my own lyrics and wish to produce more that I have been sitting on. Everyone has a story, a backpage, a ripped out shredded burned page, that they do not wish to ever see, read, ever again. But this is what makes us who we are in the present. We can choose to keep going, keep working, keep trying to smile and enjoy every moment. I created this patreon page purely for your enjoyment but mostly to support my progress in doing the things I love which get pricey at the start. This is a no bullshit page. I 100% appreciate every supporter of mine because times are tough period. I have the drive but not always the income when it comes to the projects I want to fullfill and start on. Although you may think I seem materialistic, I am not. The things that make me happy are creating art. I have been putting off recording new songs because well, everyone has bills and hardships to go through in life. Lately what makes me happy is recording music, painting, dancing, reading, learning, and ofcourse the theoretical aspects of life. The unknown, the alien talk, star gazing, wondering about different dimensions and such. I am an animal lover, onwning two rednose pitbull mixes that are rescues. I have also rescued other animals. let\u0027s just say when I see a lizard stuck inside the walls of where it doesn\u0027t want to be, I help it free itself to the outside world. I\u0027ve actually done this three times probably in the last month, including yesterday...lol found a little guy in \u00a0my closet and helped him out \u0026lt;3 I believe in helping each other, growing, learning, and ultimately trying to better our lives without being selfish in an evil way. If you choose to be one of my patrons....I will be truly blessed because YOU will be helping MY happiness. I told you this is a no bullshit page. I have suffered and still do from anxiety, PTSD, and depression. Today I can say I mainly have anxiety and what drives me the most is that I have hit rock bottom and I am still GOING. This is not a pitty party page. I simply am asking for your support so I can feel the ecstasy of being in the recording studio again and to continue my journey with creating which makes me happy. I\u0027m sitting on songs and lyrics I cringe that I have not started on yet. I want to also inspire others to KEEP GOING even when times are truly feeling unbearable. I started reading again, dancing again, writing again, all because in time things start to get better. Life is not PERFECT and no one is.....I try to live for myself now a days, previous relationships have nearly ruined me. I purely want to create my work, share it, and inspire others, as they do inspire me as well each and every day. I hope this doesn\u0027t come across again no bs. Of course I have a backstory but you can take this as a prelude to the better parts of my life and learning and hopefully some true support I have had lack of. I do not produce my modeling photos for attention, I do not seek to be utterly famous over my music....I dance because it releases internal supressed emotions. In which I had a fall out for a while due to insecurity, relationships, losing myself and more. Some people say \" don\u0027t say too much\" others like me speak from their heart and soul in hopes for support and to help others with insight and similarities. Anyway I will be posting more now that I have created my first patreon page....I am still exploring the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith love and soul,\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Tonya Narzinsky",
