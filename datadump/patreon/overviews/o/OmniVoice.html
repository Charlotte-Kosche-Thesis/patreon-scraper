    "summary": "I am Omni Voice, an aspiring Voice Actor and Youtuber, creator-editor-script writer-casting director-etc. for the Perfectly Normal Warframe series (Which is primarily the reason why you\u0027re here). I also do many other things, narration, pixel art, I uh...unfortunately still don\u0027t have juggling down. But I\u0027m working on it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerfectly Normal may seem on the surface as a slapstick comedy styled series that really has no direction this way or that, but let me assure you, this is not entirely the case. I have a vision for this series. An overarching plot, developed characters, plot twists characters that aren\u0027t even voiced by ME! I know, crazy, but hear me out.\u003cbr\u003eI have a plan to create a series that will shake the very foundation of Warframe, to become it\u0027s Red Vs. Blue, in a way. But to do so, I need your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make this series a worthwhile endeavor, I need the help and support of you. I currently am using very basic tools to accomplish my videos. I am currently using Videopad as an editing software, which while it has worked for a while is sadly terribly limited in what it can do. Since I am self employed, I dedicate my time to running around place to place to make ends meet in order to keep things rolling. A helping hand from you can not only drastically improve the quality of my videos, but allow me to allocate more time to making this series as great as it can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot to mention, despite my fun little joke in my Patreon announcement, I do actually have people that, in truth, are my Actors. Body doubles, occasional voices, they take time out of their often busy schedules to help me put together this show for you guys. I lack the ability to compensate them for this, and they truly deserve at least something.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut funds are funds. Whatever the case is, show me that you truly care enough for me to take this series to the next level and make it something that we can all be truly proud to be a part of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIMPORTANT INFO REGARDING 5$-10$ TIER REWARDS:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOn the 15th of each month, I will randomly select 5 and 2 patrons per month of said tiers via Random Name Picker to receive either a-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8-Bit stylized rendition of their warframe.
