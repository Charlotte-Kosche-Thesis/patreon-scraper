    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eMy Background:\u003c/h2\u003e\nI have been making video content for the past 12 years beginning with an instructional robot video called \"How To Do The Robot\" and have been passionate about online dance education since that time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2016 I began creating dance commentaries where I analyzed dance battles and showcases. This has grown into a big part of my life and I have always wanted the opportunity to make even more content. At the same time, I have felt wary of flooding people with too much stuff and also have been kind of lazy.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePatreon:\u003c/h2\u003eSo the idea came to me to do regular practice sessions focused on drills and concepts and just plain practicing. I know though that I\u0027ll be lazy and I\u0027ll end up mostly just not doing it. That\u0027s how I\u0027ve always lived. And then I realized why capitalism is amazing. It creates INCENTIVES!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if I recorded these practice sessions and set up a Patreon membership to have access to the recordings of the sessions, it would give me a good reason to make as much content as possible so that people would have the INCENTIVE to subscribe!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then I also realized that I am really enjoying living in my little bubble. The internet is such a crazy place and these are such crazy times that I am happier when I just focus on my creativity and making the videos I care most about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m mostly interested in communicating with the people who are most into what I\u0027m doing and have ideas and thoughts and positive critiques.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo the rest of the rewards are focused on ever-increasing levels of interaction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis way I can just keep focusing on making the content and practicing more and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way I look at it is a total win-win. I practice more and more and you guys sustain me so that I can practice more and more and we all get super dope together. It feels like destiny tbh.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\u003cbr\u003eOtis"
