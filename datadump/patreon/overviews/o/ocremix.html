While we\u2019re keeping that in place, we ALSO want to provide instant gratification in the form of an enhanced workshop that integrates works-in-progress and finished arrangements with our database. For artists, this means more exposure \u0026amp; instant feedback. For listeners, it means WAY MOAR MUSIC!!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",
