My name is \u003cstrong\u003ePenny LeLeux\u003c/strong\u003e and I live in Southeast Texas \njust a few miles from the Louisiana border\u2026 the swamp end of Texas. Down\n here it is\u003cstrong\u003e the land of Cajuns and Cowboys\u003c/strong\u003e! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have spent several years \nhelping to promote the fun and positive aspects of Orange County, Texas \nand am known as the \u003cstrong\u003eFempress of Fun\u003c/strong\u003e. I love promoting events and if \nthere aren\u2019t any good events going on, I have been known to create one. \nIt has been suggested I should go on the road, visiting interesting \nsites, interviewing people from a diverse culture and show you great \nevents such as concerts, festivals, theater and more. We are going to be\n busy \u003cstrong\u003eMaking the Dash\u003c/strong\u003e\u2026 that part between birth and death\u2026 the part that \nreally counts... and documenting as we go, for the pleasure of the people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting out, we will be exploring mostly Texas and Louisiana and venturing further out as funds permit. On the Road doesn\u0027t necessarily mean in a car. You might find us on a train, in a boat...heck, there might be an elephant in our future. It will be an eclectic adventure as my tastes and interests are quite varied.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ontheroadwithpenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/arrow.png\" style=\"width: 82px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Patreon is a website where people can support creatives in their efforts.As a patron you will get some exclusive behind the scenes footage and have access to special rewards, depending on the level of sponsorship you chose.We\u0027ve got reward levels as little as $1 a month up to $100.If you choose to be a patron, just look to the right of your computer screen and choose the level you want to support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhose ready for an adventure?
