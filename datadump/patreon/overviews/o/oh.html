Her music is rich in symphonic and harmonic \nchoruses accompanied by powerful sultry vocals in the timbre of Sharon \nDen Adel, Anneke Van Giesbergen and Tori Amos. Her music always \nchallenges the listener to journey in her sonic landscapes and escape \ninto the atmospheres she creates \u2014 with sounds take the listener \nmusically to places they have never been before.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBio\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe real \nstory about Oh. and her music is not disguised behind her moniker or \ncultivated in the place she was born. What drives her to play a \nhalf-dozen instruments or insist on mixing and mastering her own music \nisn\u2019t revealed so much in a succession of outer events. It\u2019s driven more\n by her passion to musically reveal her \u201cinside-story\u201d - her path to \ngnosis or revelation and share that process with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, \nshe calls herself Oh. because those are the initials of her real name \nOlivia Hadjiioannou *, - unpronounceable to most except to other natives\n of Greece, where she was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd though, some hints as to why \nshe became a musician can be found scattered in snapshots of instruments\n on her childhood\n walls or heard in the music that played late into the nights entering \nher bedroom walls. She says:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI never felt as if \nthere were ever a question of whether I can play music or not, playing \nmusic was always only a question of whether you have something to \nexpress.\u201d\u0026lt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHer time in her studio\n is spent in crafting a sound, as she says. \u2018epic enough\u2019 to touch the \nsoul, whether in the darkest recesses of sorrow or heights of elation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd\n as you go deeper into her music you will hear a strong and powerful \nvoice of hope. And after a couple listens more you will notice her music\n has somehow changed you in a subtle way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is so much more \nto Oh., you just need to listen and her music does ask you listen \ncarefully because there are many twists and turns in her progressive \nrock and metal landscapes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- J.C.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReleases\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh. has released a debut progressive rock EP \u201cSleeping World\u201d in 2013 with the award winning video \u201cTrials \u2013 A Song for a Lost Generation\u201d and metal album and vinyl release, \u201cSynemotion\u201d in 2015 and two singles, \u201cLove Will Heal\u201d and \u201cLove of Avalanches\u201d in 2016 with an innovative 360 virtual reality music video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo more singles, \u201cI\u2019m in Love\u201d and \u201cDeserted Eyes\u201d are coming up for release this summer and a prog metal EP, \u201cMetallia\u201d is coming in fall 2017.
