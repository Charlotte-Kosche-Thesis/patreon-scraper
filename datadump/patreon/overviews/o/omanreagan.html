For my M.A. thesis I wrote an ethnography of Indonesian activism focusing on how the Occupy social movement travelled from the encampment in lower Manhattan to Indonesia both online and in physical space. Now, in my doctoral research I\u0027m engaged with exploration beyond our solar system through space science, interstellar space, SETI, imagination, futures, and science fiction. A key part of this is to understand how space science and exploration imagine and work toward futures that are more just. As author Ursula K. Le Guin wrote:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u201cWe will not know our own injustice if we cannot imagine justice. We will not be free if we do not imagine freedom. We cannot demand that anyone try to attain justice and freedom who has not had a chance to imagine them as attainable.\u201d [\"The Wave in the Mind,\" 2004]\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Anthropology?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I took a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://michaelomanreagan.net/about/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecircuitous route\u003c/a\u003e to anthropology, starting in biology because I wanted to understand marine mammal minds and societies. I then moved to philosophy to ask \"what is a mind?\" I went to religious studies for the stories we tell about our minds and societies. Then settled in anthropology because it lets me do all of them at once.\u00a0I\u2019ve always been fascinated by the stories we tell about where we come from, why we\u2019re here, and where we\u2019re going. To compliment the humanities work in religious studies I wanted a way to look at what people were actually doing on the ground in everyday life. So I added an anthropology degree, and in my first anthropology class I realized I\u2019d been an anthropologist all along. It is the field of study that allows me to do interdisciplinary work as I try to answer the questions I\u2019ve always had about humanity, the planet, and the universe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/OmanReagan\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea lot of opinions\u003c/a\u003e, often about \u003cstrong\u003epolitics, capitalism, histories, presents and futures.\u003c/strong\u003e Perhaps you\u00a0followed me on Twitter because of my posts about these issues, and if you like those you will find more depth on here. With more characters, and the ability to add more images and links and have troll-free conversations, we\u0027ll be able to come up with better ideas, critiques, and solutions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for making my research, writing, and work on social media possible.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
