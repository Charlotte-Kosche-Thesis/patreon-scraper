    "summary": "I am a Bechloe fanfiction writer; mostly writing GP Beca. \u003cbr\u003eMy entry  into Patrreon was bittersweet and was borne out of a bad experience. I never knew of Patreon until one of my readers suggested it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI entered a GP Beca fanfiction contest and in the end got practically ghosted. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI joined the contest on January 12, 2018 -  a few weeks after the creator posted about it along with the guidelines (December 27, 2017). The deadline was March 12, 2018 and I started posting my chapters. I was working on two (2)  entries -minimum of 2k words per chapter, minimum of 15 chapters. I was done with 10 chapters  for both stories - but posted only eight since I was editing the newer chapters \u2013 when a reader messaged me advising that I check with the creator because she doesn\u2019t see any other stories being posted. I checked and the creator responded that there were other entries. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I kept writing and posted the remaining two chapters I had. So all in all, I got 10 chapters posted of each stories.(20 chapters in total). \u003cbr\u003eOnce more I received messages telling me that the creator had stolen their stories  before and that I should confront them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I did, the creator denied the accusations and informed me that the other contestants dropped out and I only need to deliver the remaining 5 chapters for each story and she\u2019ll forward me the $300  prize. I did not believe her and after some back and forth she fronted $50 on February 19, 2018 with the promise to send the $250 by March 12,2018..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019d like to note that she originally set the initial $50.payment on February 12 but it was delayed for a week. She went MIA and stopped answering messages. Days later she messaged me that she lost someone hence the non-responses. \u003cbr\u003eI completed both my entries and posted them by March 11, 2018. \u003cbr\u003eShe once again went MIA but messaged me on March 20 2018 that she got hospitalized and has no idea when she can give the rest of the money. I kept an open line of communication with her but it\u2019s April 21 2018 now and she won\u2019t respond anymore. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  I joined the contest for the money. I will be honest about that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need the money because I can\u0027t go back to my old regular job as an industrial engineer for manufacturing company in my country after I suffered a stationary cardiac arrest in mid  2015. The arrest resulted in Hypoxic anoxic brain injury that basically left ne in a vegetative state.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was in coma for 10 days and was bed-ridden for almost two months, along with other issues such as short term memory loss, quadriparalesis, cortical blindness in which the area of my brain responsible for  vision becomes disconnected from the brain. Because the brain could not tell that this part is  damaged, it appeared as though I can see though I displayed no ability  to recognize letters or objects or people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not from the US but if we\u0027re talking about costs, my family and I  I shelled out about t  $30k from our own pockets  (I converted that from my currency to US) on the first year alone.  We\u0027re not rush so that money cane  mostly from the sale of one of our land properties (rice farm)..\u003cbr\u003eI was  deemed  \"legally blind\" .per my social security doctor who tested me before I cam get my disability benefits. My social security disability benefits could only cover so much.\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that were the therapy costs and another surgery to reconstruct my tongue  that had substantial tear after I bit it during one of my seizures. Therapy lasted over two years  and that\u2019s the lucky rate because as per my OT and PT,  I was young. I can walk on my own now but I can\u2019t run nor get out of the house without a companion since I sometimes just fall without warning from time to time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy eyesight is better;  though it\u2019s never the same. I can\u2019t read handwritten notes. I can\u2019t see faces clearly unless they\u2019re super up close.  \u003cbr\u003eFor now,  I tutor grade school kids at our house mainly because the books\u0027 texts are huge and I can teach then even without reading much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had to turn down HS  and college students since the numbers get jumbled and frankly I have been slowed down and the texts are smaller. And yeah,  I do tutoring and ghostwrite simple essays and projects for kids.\u003cbr\u003eI joined because I could use some relief.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI worked hard typing on my phone (since my laptop makes it hard for me to type and see despite zooming.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn advance,  my apologies for the typos. I mostly rely on Spellcheck and sometimes even editing or proofreading  more than thrice still results in errors. \u003cbr\u003e"
