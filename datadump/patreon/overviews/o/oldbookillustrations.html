With the wealth of resources available online, it became increasingly difficult to resist the temptation to explore other collections and publish these images along with our own. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe pursue healthy eclecticism and include illustrations from novels, children\u0027s books, reference books on plants, animals, medicine, travel, within a time-frame ranging from the eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur site offers various resolutions of the restored illustrations, as well as full-resolution raw scan images. Every illustration comes with as much relevant information as possible, including the artist\u0027s details, engraver\u0027s name, etc. This involves a lot of work behind the scenes and a lot of time spent editing images, doing research, and maintaining and improving the site. Contributions will allow us to spend more time doing all this. More particularly, they will make it possible for us to free more time to add content. They will help us face the challenges of  a rapidly changing Web, which requires ever more resources and specialized skills. They\u0027ll fund the necessary hardware and storage upgrades. In a few words, they\u0027ll help keep the site online and relevant. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy becoming a patron, you\u0027ll gain access to the full-resolution version of restored illustrations. Full-size means anywhere between 2000 and 4000 px, with the largest part settling around 2500 px, a small proportion being smaller than 2000 px, and some images being bigger than 4000 px. The quality of the scans may somewhat vary and we cannot guarantee a strict uniform quality of the final result, although most images will produce at least decent prints when outputed at their original size.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVisit \u003ca href=\"https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/\"\u003eOld Book Illustrations\u003c/a\u003e"
