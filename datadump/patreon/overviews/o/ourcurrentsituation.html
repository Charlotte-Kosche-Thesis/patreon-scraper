Until I married one.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNick was my best friend. Smart, caring and charismatic, he made me feel like the most important woman in the world \u2013 even though we lived on different sides of it. But once I left England to be with him in America, he became a different person. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe things Nick had promised in order to persuade me to quit my job and leave my family and friends never materialized. Instead, he grew increasingly controlling. Soon I found myself trapped, broke and living with a man who was Richie Cunningham in public and Frank Underwood behind closed doors. But every time I tried to leave, he turned on the charm again just long enough to convince me he could change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen Nick had me served with divorce papers out of the blue, everything I thought I knew about him fell to pieces. Our therapist revealed she believed my husband had\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enarcissistic personality disorder\u003c/a\u003e (NPD), a form of psychopathy, and had likely been manipulating and deceiving me since the start of our relationship. Disturbingly, she was right. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wasn\u0027t the only one Nick managed to dupe. Two days after he suddenly disappeared, he made a false police report accusing me of assault, utilizing a law\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/2u2zMzR\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eintended to protect victims of domestic violence\u003c/a\u003e. Despite the fact there were no witnesses or physical evidence, a warrant for my arrest was issued without the police even reaching out to me. To clear my name, my only option was to spend a night in custody and face Nick in court.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eOur Current Situation\u003c/em\u003e is memoir-meets-psychological-thriller in the same vein as \u003cem\u003eGone Girl, Girl on the Train \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eBig Little Lies\u003c/em\u003e. By sharing my story I hope to raise awareness of NPD and offer strength and support to other survivors of psychological abuse. I\u0027m currently 10,000 words into my manuscript and really appreciate any Patreon investment \u2013 however big or small \u2013 to help me dedicate time to finishing it in 2018. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/TVo7Fo3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWHY I\u0027M ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a journalist, my opportunities for employment are somewhat limited in the US until my Green Card is cleared (my current visa only permits freelance work).
