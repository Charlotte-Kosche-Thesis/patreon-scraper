I produce live content every day, record gameplay videos, and script and edit editorial content too. I produce and co-host a weekly podcast covering movies, games, comics, and other pop culture topics. I am also the host of a blog where I\u0027m regularly posting video game reviews and editorials. Everything I produce is released free to the public, and always will be, but as the channel, and the community around it grows, it comes with greater costs and responsibilities. By making a pledge to this campaign, you can help support the content, and continued growth of the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* * *\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat\u0027s the channel like?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has a diverse audience, ranging from young people who watch my daily Minecraft streams, to older fans who come to watch games like SOMA and Assassin\u0027s Creed. I live stream a lot my content, and, depending on the game, encourage a lot of audience interaction. I try to involve my audience actively in the growth of the channel, holding votes for future games and special events at channel landmarks. I also produce non-live videos of mobile and PC games. Since establishing this campaign, I have been able to branch out into producing more editorial and opinion based content, like my \u003cem\u003e\"Britpinions\"\u003c/em\u003e series covering industry topics. In future, I\u0027m eager to move in scripted and filmed entertainment in some way. Developing beyond just gameplay videos into real entertainment production.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* * *\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eHow would contributions be used?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eMaintaining a Youtube channel can be more costly than you might think. Video production itself requires a lot of time, patience, and software. I own most of the necessary physical equipment, but occasionally it needs replacing. On top of that, live streaming effectively requires a better than average broadband connection. Other costs are required to access online services required to play games online. $10 per month, for example, would cover the cost of the Playstation Plus subscription I need to stream multiplayer games, and provides a steady stream of new games to cover. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContributions to this campaign will mainly go to general costs, ISP bills, domain name and hosting costs, occasionally new games to cover, and new storage when needed (USB sticks, SD cards etc.). Should the contributions exceed these costs, money can be put towards a better quality equipment, and eventually, new hardware like GPU upgrades, or potentially VR.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually funding from this campaign will be used to allow me to work on making content full time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* * *\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Future.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last year, my channel has show consistently increasing growth, with an enthusiastic and invested audience. I would like to take the channel as far as it can go, but that means working every bit of spare time I have, and then some. With your support I can continue to grow to channel, as well as make more new series, videos, reviews and projects for the channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading!"
