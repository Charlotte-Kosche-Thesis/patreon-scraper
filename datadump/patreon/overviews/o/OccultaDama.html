This will be a 3D animation fragmented with feverish, acidic children televisions adverts and shows animated in 2D (Much like the satirical adverts found in Growing Pains). Set 3 years on from the 1st film - the baby is now a toddler, blind and mute. The mechanical workings of the towerblock prison flat gradually begin to harvest the mothers parts - starting with the teeth. By the end of the film the mother will be left as a shell becoming the helpless child and the child evolving into a updated version of the mother. This allows the end of the film to restart at Growing Pains seamlessly. My intention was to have this be part of Growing Pains and serves as the escalation and resolution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Growing Pains and all of my work is funding on nothing or very little and i achieve my results solely on dedication, talent and passion. With combination of funding, the development and skills i have harnessed since Growing Pains and the growth of art i really feel this would result in a incredibly polished, impactful and artistically valuable film.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my work - great! help! - your investment will be well founded and i will deliver on my set goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e For updates on my works please visit my site - \u003ca href=\"http://www.occultadama.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.occultadama.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003esubscribe to my NEW youtube -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxfYFaZ9E351b5l2XdLRmVQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxfYFaZ9E351b5l2X...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand follow me on Instagram my most used form of Social Media: @occultadama\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOCCULTA DAMA: Animation/spookiness/framerates/BASICALLY.
