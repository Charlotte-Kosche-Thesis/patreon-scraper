I don\u0027t make much money doing what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a snapshot of life as a comic book writer/artist who has his own series at Image. Aside from getting paid for a one-time sale of books to the Scholastic Book Fair and the one-time sale of Free Comic Book Day special issues over a year and a half ago, I haven\u0027t been paid for regular sales of \"Oddly Normal\" since issue #2... in 2014. That was 13 issues or 3 books ago. I\u0027m about to put out a 4th book that will immediately put me even \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e in the red at Image Comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see, making comics can be a rough business for a one-man-band-creator like me. Long hours, little pay and lots of side work to pay bills. And that\u0027s even with a series picked up by \u003cem\u003eIMAGE COMICS\u003c/em\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m looking for ways to a) earn more money so I can, you know, pay bills, and b) expand my creative output so that I can get more of my own stories out into the world. In the past, I\u0027ve relied on freelance and savings to help me keep my head above water while I worked on my original projects. I just finished illustrating 6 books featuring Justice League characters for DC/Capstone. I\u0027ll be using the money I earned from those books to live off of as long as I can while I work on \"Oddly Normal\" Book 4 (hitting stores in July of 2018!), but it won\u0027t last long. And taking on freelance work takes time away from my main work and it doesn\u0027t help me get my own stories out into the world. So while it helps, and I\u0027m grateful to have the option, it\u0027s not a long-term plan for success for a creator who hopes to earn a living from telling his OWN stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a writer at heart. A storyteller. And that\u0027s what I should be doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always been more of a writer/artist than an artist/writer. I\u0027ve been writing as long as I\u0027ve been making art and for a while, all I \u003cem\u003edid\u003c/em\u003e was write. I love telling stories and I have a LOT of stories that I want to tell. I have many projects that have been sitting around for years waiting to be realized. All of them have been attempted as comics or graphic novels at some point in the past, but never quite worked out. And I think that\u0027s because they are all really meant to be books, not comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I can write and self-publish eBooks, I can (hopefully) create a revenue stream that helps me not only tell my own stories, but continue to create \"Oddly Normal\" books at the same time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I need?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTime\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.

Think \"\u003cem\u003eHarry Potter + Ghostbusters + Nancy Drew + Pokemon\u003c/em\u003e.\" This will be a serialized story, told in 12-part \"seasons.\" Each episode will be about 10,000-12,000 words each (novelette length) and come out once a month. They will be stand-alone stories that fit into a larger narrative that, when finished, will be one long, epic tale that takes the title character from 3rd to 12th grade. Each season will be collected into a single volume. \"Elliot Pickleberry\" will be the main writing project that I focus on, with the intention of delivering one episode each month. My goal is to start self-publishing episodes of \"Elliot Pickleberry\" to various platforms (Amazon, Kobo, Nook, etc) in June of 2018.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Flynn\"\u003c/strong\u003e - This is a young adult fantasy adventure with airships and magic and gryphons and pirates. Think \"\u003cem\u003eStar Wars +\u00a0The Chronicles of Prydain + Dune + Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\u003c/em\u003e.\" This is a series of three longer books that will be stories I\u0027ll work on at a slower pace, not as serialized pieces. I already have about 1/4 of the first book finished. Each book in the series will be the typical length of a traditional fantasy novel, about 120,000 words. \u003cstrong\u003e(NOTE: as of November 28th, this book is being reviewed by a major literary agency as consideration for representing me to book publishers. So I\u0027m not sure how much of this novel\u0027s development will be used for the purposes of this Patreon. We\u0027ll see. Fingers crossed!)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Zoey\"\u003c/strong\u003e - This is a middle grade story set in L. Frank Baum\u0027s \"\u003cem\u003eOz\u003c/em\u003e\" universe. If you\u0027ve read \"Oddly Normal,\" then you probably know that I\u0027m a big Oz fan. Well, I\u0027ve had a story that I wanted to tell that is set in that world, and this will be my chance to get that story out. I haven\u0027t decided yet, but the book will either be set after the last Baum book (before Ruth Plumly Thompson took over the series) or it will take place just after \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" and ignore the other books in the series completely, placing it in an alternate timeline. Since the Oz books are in the public domain, I will (like many authors before me) be free to write and sell the story when it is complete. This could be the first in a series, but right now it\u0027s one book, one story. But things happen while wandering around in Oz, so... never say never. This book should end up being between 70,000 and 100,000 words (novel length), depending on how lost I get in Oz.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Spellbinder\"\u003c/strong\u003e - This is the most mature of the four projects that I have planned. I would recommend them for young adults, but they could easily be read and enjoyed by older readers. Some of my longtime fans may remember this project. I was working on it with two other artists for a while (I was the creator/writer and colorist on the project), but it petered out. It\u0027s a western fantasy; guns, magic, and fighting dragons from atop a horse. Think \"\u003cem\u003eUnforgiven + Men In Black + \u003cem\u003eThe Wild Wild West\u003c/em\u003e + The Arthurian Legends\u003c/em\u003e.\" This will be a set of 10 serialized novels that will be between 50,000 and 90,000 words each (novel length). Probably somewhere in the middle. I see them like the old pulp westerns... long enough for an airplane ride or a weekend afternoon with nothing else to do but sit and read a good story.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of these projects are genre/fantasy fiction.
