    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe short version\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year, I released my first major piece of writing into the world, when I self-published my speculative fiction novel: \u003ca href=\"https://otterlieffe.com/latest-book/\"\u003eMargins and Murmurations\u003c/a\u003e. As a working class trans woman, a sex worker and an activist for nearly two decades, my writing has a voice that is rarely heard and I am so proud to be creating radical new articles and fiction towards a less oppressive world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is a huge commitment and although I love every second of it, it\u0027s extremely hard to balance with the work I do for survival. If you\u0027ve loved my work so far and want me to keep writing, becoming a Patreon supporter will make it happen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll receive exclusive access to an audiobook version of Margins and Murmurations, sneak-peeks of the new novel and be part of a unique transfeminist community coming together to create this work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe long version\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- who am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a trans woman, particularly a non cis-passing trans woman, gender and sexuality have always been at the centre of my writing and I\u2019ve been creating short stories and political articles that reflect my intersections for as long as I can remember. I\u2019m also a trained ecologist and environmental activist, so themes of ecocide and connecting with more-than-human nature have inevitably emerged in my work. I have worked at various times as a sex worker, in professional BDSM, as a holistic therapist and as a language teacher. Let\u0027s say I\u2019ve had a wide range of experiences to draw from. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy life is intersectional and my work has always been deeply so, almost by default. I experience white privilege and I grew up in poverty. I am a trans woman and I hold a European passport. I am feminist, queer, an activist, but at times have found feminist, queer, activist spaces some of the most hostile to be in. I speak between three and five languages, have lived on four continents and yet feel most at home when away from the city and the noise and voices of its people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- what am I writing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrans people live gender in a way that others can never truly understand. Exploring gender, sex and sexuality is as normal for many of us as breathing, or dreaming, and just as essential to our survival. In Margins and Murmurations, I let this exploration run free, allowed myself to create characters who until now have been invisible or written by people without lived experience. I know what sex work can really look like, so writing complex sex workers of various genders fighting for both their own survival, and that of a radically diverse resistance movement, felt natural to me. I know what some trans and queer experiences can feel like, so writing strong, feminine, freedom fighters, healers and self-defence instructors, felt like a relief. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, there are now characters with my intersections out in the world. Finally, some better representation exists. Writing speculative fiction has been a truly selfish act. It has also become activism. Almost by an impulse I cannot seem to avoid, I want to politicise everything I do. To justify the years of hard work it took and to create the biggest change that I can. So the book quickly became an activist project in itself. Working with LGBT Books to Prisoners, we crowdfunded enough money to send nearly 60 copies of the novel to trans women in US prisons, to raise awareness of their situation and to provide some well-needed solidarity. And the work itself has become a political tool. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach week, I receive messages from trans folk who have read the novel and found something in it that spoke to them. I read to trans audiences, sex workers, queers and others and I feel honoured to be given the time to tell my stories. And I run workshops asking how we can use speculative fiction for change. As the novel is set in the future, deep in the heart of a transfeminist resistance movement fighting an oppressive state, it opens up a space to imagine, to ask \u2018what if?\u2019. This is the power of speculative fiction \u2013 for without the space to imagine what we want, how can we possibly work towards it? I am proud to have become a small part of this beautiful tradition and, with all my heart, I feel like I have found the work I should be doing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- money\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that Margins and Murmurations is out, funding will help it to reach new audiences and help me to support myself while I work on the sequel. I currently have no financial support except my own hard work. This often means I have to choose between cash work and writing work. Invariably, survival comes first and writing projects get delayed. I believe in the writing that I\u2019m producing and I\u2019m encouraged by the feedback I\u2019ve been getting from people who have connected with it; but ultimately I still need to pay the bills. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis work does need to come out into the world. With each new project that it births and each new person that connects with it, I feel more strongly that my writing should reach more people and that I want \u2013 and need - to share more stories. There needs to be more speculative fiction with better representation, more narratives of resisting ableism and racism, cis-sexism and classism and more realistic experiences of survival in a world that hates anyone at the margins. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a person with a complex experience, with complex intersections, surrounded by supportive, loving communities of people who help produce this work with me, I\u2019m in a unique position to tell some of these stories. I hope I\u2019ll have the opportunity to keep doing just that."
