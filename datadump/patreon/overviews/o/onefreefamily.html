    "summary": "Hi! We\u0027re Taylor and James Davis. We are the parents of 3 children - Oliver (7), Ezra (5), and August (1), and our journey to our rather unconventional approach to education is an odd one. We both earned their teaching certificates in college in the early 2000s, but underwent a paradigm shift in 2010 that led us more in the direction of self-directed education. You can hear more about our journey by listening to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://onefreefamily.com/1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e episode one of this podcast\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then we have been involved in multiple self-directed learning communities (most recently\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://campstompingground.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Camp Stomping Ground\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://longacre.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Camp Longacre\u003c/a\u003e), creating small self-directed ecosystems to help kids be free and learn to use that freedom wisely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe moved to the Seacoast of New Hampshire as a part of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.fsp.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Free State Project\u003c/a\u003e in 2014, and have since been focused on creating community among other unschooling families on the coast. We\u0027ve also become self-employed entrepreneurs, each of us working at times and hanging out with the kids at others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJames\u0027 professional journey took him from playing poker professionally for the 7 years after college to being the executive director of a non-profit summer camp to eventually working in the camp consultant space while also helping run a website he co-founded called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.dailyfantasysportsrankings.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e DFSR\u003c/a\u003e. Over the past several years James has had the opportunity to speak at camp conferences, unschooling conferences, and libertarian festivals to share his experience of creating communities where kids can be self-directed (and all the magic he\u0027s seen along the way).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter college, Taylor became a teacher at a private elementary school. She learned so much during those years and first became exposed to the idea of self-directed education during that time. Her path radically shifted after having children and she is now a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.taylordavisdoula.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e birth doula\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0, childbirth educator, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.doulatrainingsinternational.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e doula trainer\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0, helping families begin their journey into parenthood and encouraging new parents to trust their instincts and trust their children.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince we\u0027re constantly researching the latest in child development theory (and inevitably talking about it every night after the kids go to sleep), we figured it\u0027d be fun to share our thoughts with you. Welcome, and we hope you enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions or feedback, please don\u0027t hesitate to email us at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:jamesandtaylor@onefreefamily.com\"\u003ejamesandtaylor@onefreefamily.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
