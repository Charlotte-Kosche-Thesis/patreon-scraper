Oops is a childrens book about a rambunctious young zebra with alot to learn. I like to thing of the book style as Dr. Suess meets Shell Silverstein only without too many made up words. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My goal is simple. I want to take Oops into the public by going on a short tour (at first) of local schools and children\u0027s hospitals, and give out free copies to the kids I meet there. Thats where i need your help. Since I am self publishing this book, I have to foot the bill for all the printed copies, the publishing website, gas, hotels (if any) etc. This as you might expect is rather pricey. If you would be so kind to help me bring a fun children\u0027s book to some awesome little kids for free that would make you kinda awesome. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
