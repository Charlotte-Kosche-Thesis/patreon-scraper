Furthermore, there will be numerous chains\nof adventures that can be tuned for adventurers at the Lv1, Lv5 or Lv10 benchmarks (many of which you can directly shape through this Patreon page!). All of these can and will tie into the main narrative surrounding the Mountain.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut still, numerous Mountain-based campaigns are already out there. While I\ncertainly can craft you a great series of stories, I understand that a lot of\npeople want to create their own world rather than play a campaign on rails, but they just need a little help on the art work.\nBecause of this, almost everything in my campaign will be customizable. As long\nas you have a basic understanding of Photoshop, you\u2019ll be able to edit the\ncampaign elements to suit your needs. And I don\u2019t mean just changing names; I mean\ncomplete character, city, faction, and enemy overhauls from the physical\ndescription all the way down to the saving throws.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor Patrons that want to support its development:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see below the different tiers of \"rewards\" that can affect this project and many of the templates are previewed there as well.

Therefore, many of the rewards have \"quick customization\" options where you only need to provide me with the broad outline of what you\u0027d like and I\u0027ll design the rest.

     "description": "If we manage to reach this goal, I will contract with my amazing make-up/stylist to create a series of cosplay images (and Behind-The-Scenes video) of the campaign boss that has already been designed by our top Patron. These images will then be worked into the art that ships with the campaign. All Patrons (from $1 on up) will be able to download the images. Here is a small sample of the stylist\u0027s previous work under a \"peacock\" theme:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.ltsmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/Peacock-200px.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
