Here we can discover and explore together the inner workings of my journey through artistic and creative expression in Nairobi.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Ondi, and I love exploring, expressing and sharing my thoughts and ideas through art. Meeting and jamming and creating with people is the stuff that makes the universe real to me. Whether it\u0027s music, or poetry, or art, or film, or fashion... I\u0027ve been sharing for a while all over Nairobi, and infrequently in travels around the globe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, as most stories go, I had a thought... what if I could make an album in this spirit, sharing, connections, collaborations across the artistic board. A fashion shoot, a film, a piece of art, a story, a jam session all around this story that would become an album. It would capture me, but also the art scene in Nairobi, and also the process of creation from the idea, to the fleshing out, to the final piece. The story of a song, an album, an idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon was suggested to me by a friend who said it would be the best platform to share globally and get sustainable support for the project. So far so awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s my first time so excuse my fumbling. :) As I understand it, you amazing people can pledge a a certain amount per month and depending what you pledge you receive artistic goodies!
