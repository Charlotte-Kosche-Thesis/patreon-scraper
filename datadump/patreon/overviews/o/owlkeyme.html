    "summary": "2018 marks my 6th year as working full time as an artist!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome background: From 2007-2012, I worked as a designer in the fashion jewelry industry, where my designs were distributed throughout North America (from small boutiques to big box stores, roadside stops to giant amusement parks), via overseas mass-production on established brand labels. It definitely paid the bills and got my work seen and worn by millions. Yet it meant having to sacrifice great design and innovative aesthetic to make something more cheaply and with broader appeal to satisfy corporate commands. It wasn\u0027t something I could believe in.\u00a0I wanted to create sustainable, original, long-lasting work that the end-user would be able to cherish for their lifetime and beyond.\u00a0That whether it was a piece of jewelry or a painting, it would have meaning for the person, and not be something disposable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn May 2012, I left my corporate job to move across the country and start a new life in Seattle - and I haven\u0027t looked back.  Since then, I have been making a living doing design, making more and more fine art, wax casting bronze talismans, crafting a line of sigil-related products, and most recently, becoming a published author! I also continue to create and teach dance, and partner with my husband Nathaniel Johnstone to make music and ritual experiences.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon has been extremely helpful in helping me devote time to making (painting, sculpting, writing, drawing, designing), as well as promoting my work. Every bit helps and is appreciated. It keeps me in brushes and paint - as well as helps to cover important things like health insurance. I can\u0027t tell you how much of a relief it is to know that if something happens while we\u0027re touring, we\u0027re covered - or at home!\u00a0 Also, your support is vital for aiding me to work on projects like books - which require a LOT of time invested with quite the delay in (eventual) financial return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2017 saw the release of my first book, \"The Witch\u0027s Cauldron: The Craft, Lore \u0026amp; Magick of Ritual Vessels\" and at the tail end of it, \"Sigil Witchery: A Witch\u0027s Guide to Crafting Magick Symbols\" got released a few weeks ahead of schedule.\u00a0 I also worked on two more book projects that will be released in late 2018 and early 2019.\u00a0 But for 2018 now, my focus is ART.\u00a0 Making new series of art, focusing on crafting an oracle and/or Tarot deck (finally), and other things I\u0027ve been putting on the backburner due to book projects.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy patrons get first peeks at much of what I do, seeing process photos available only here + video too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
