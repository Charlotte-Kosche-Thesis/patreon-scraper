    "summary": "Hello my name is Ortiz, and I am a full time volunteer at the Los Angeles Dream Center. I recently graduated from my second year of the Dream Center Leadership School (DCLS) program. I now have the amazing opportunity to continue to serve this ministry as a member of our guys discipleship team. This means I will be one of the people in charge of mentoring, building character, and ushering in spiritual growth for the men who are apart of their first year in DCLS.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the course of my two years of being a student here my life has changed dramatically. I came to LA, in the fall of 2015, a child who was afraid and insecure but searching for God. Now I am a man who boldly knows who he is and his identity in Christ! This ministry changes the lives of hundreds of students just like myself ever year, while daily giving them the opportunity to serve the amazing city of Los Angeles through the Dream Center\u0027s many outreach ministries! That is why I am so grateful for the privilege to continue to be apart of the life change of students who truly are the next wave of leaders and world changers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in! In order for me to continue serving the city of Los Angeles and the students of DCLS to the capacity that I am called I need you to partner with me financially. When you partner with me you are not only helping me; your also supporting a ministry that doesn\u0027t just create leaders, but pours into them, grows them and equips them with the tools necessary to be leaders wherever they may be called well after their season at the Dream Center is over! If you are capable please partner with me for as little as 10 dollars a month and you too can become apart of the life change that happens here daily! Thank you so much for your support and your prayers, they truly do make a difference in my life and the lives of every student in DCLS!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
