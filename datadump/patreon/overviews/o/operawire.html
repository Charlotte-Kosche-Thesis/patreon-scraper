    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/2gEeFRW\"\u003eOpera Wire\u003c/a\u003e came about as a desire to explore opera and allow its passionate fan base access to everything this wondrous art form has to offer. On a daily basis we offer the latest news from around the world while also providing readers with greater insight through interviews with prominent artists, reviews and other detailed features.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince launching in December 2016, we have managed to develop relationships with some of the greatest opera houses in the world including the Metropolitan Opera, the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, La Fenice, the Bayerische Staatsoper, the San Francisco Opera, Santa Fe Opera, and the Teatro Comunale di Bologna, among others. We have interviewed some of the greatest opera singers in the world, including Sondra Radvanovsky, Diana Damrau, Susan Graham, Javier Camarena, Matthew Polenzani, Pretty Yende, Angela Meade, Klaus Florian Vogt, and Gregory Kunde, among many others. And we are only getting started.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a tremendous commitment to putting a spotlight on smaller and more independent companies that are working to grow and develop the art form for future generations. We have slowly developed an international team that is helping us extend our reach and communicate with more audiences.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoreover, we have started to expand our content to include interactive quizzes and have also introduced a new section known as \"Opera for Beginners\" that aims to introduce newcomers to the great works and artists of the art form.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eLooking to the future we have a number of exciting projects in the works.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe see this is as the beginning of OperaWire and are looking for more ways to make it the ultimate opera experience online for both established and potential opera lovers. To that end we are currently working on a full website redesign, the incorporation of a new opera business section, a section that speaks directly to aspiring artists in the opera world, and an exciting app that we think will change the way the opera world interacts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd we believe that we are only scratching the surface of how we hope to make OperaWire all that it can be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow You Can Help Us\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour contribution does the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Help us expand our team to include a marketing team, editorial staff, and strengthen our digital team. Not only does this help OperaWire improve its overall content and approach, but we would be providing new work opportunities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Help us invest in an app that will provide stronger connectivity for our users through updates as well as a \u003cstrong\u003emajor surprise\u003c/strong\u003e we have in the works.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3.
