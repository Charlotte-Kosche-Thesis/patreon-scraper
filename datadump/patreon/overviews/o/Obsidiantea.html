In addition, Obsidian is going to discuss Black culture and make it approachable for other cultures.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to thank you for supporting this research endeavor! My hope is to record our oral history and share that with the world. In the future I would love for Obsidian to have a range of topics and medias covered. I dream of being able to travel to events, museums, tours, and find musicians for interviews. I hope to have an extensive library of books for Obsidian. I would love to work with universities and bring on special guest voices. And so, so much more!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting Obsidian!\u003cbr\u003eObsidiantea.com"
