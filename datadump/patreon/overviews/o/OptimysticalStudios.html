People who love what we do and want\nto support us on an ongoing basis for $1, $2 or $5 a month. These\nfolks are going to get perks like an inside glimpse into the design\nstudio (that we don\u0027t even share on Tumblr), a say into what new\ndesigns we bring to life, first dibs on pre-orders, a\nsekrit Tumblr to watch us create,\nand monthly coupons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor\nthose folks who have a little more to invest each month ($30+)\nthe perks are the same as with the lower patrons PLUS you\u0027ll get\njewelry shipped to your door each month. These are like wine of the\nmonth clubs, only you don\u0027t have to be 21, and you can wear these in\npublic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo\nif you like what we do, and are interested in helping us expand\nbeyond what we\u0027re doing now, please become a Patron today.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
