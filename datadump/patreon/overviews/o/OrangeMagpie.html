    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Melissa and I like to make things. I also like to share things.\u00a0I consider myself a magpie of the art world.\u00a0I\u0027m always attracted to shiny new mediums, techniques and toys which I can fold into my creative toolbox. Unfortunately I do tend to be a little mercurial when it comes to creating and switch projects quite often. And art supplies are expensive. That\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made this page to share my creations with you and I want you to enjoy them. This page is not about fundraising so much as it is about interaction. By posting my work publicly and having pledges from patrons I create a level of accountability that my magpie brain can manage. There\u0027s no pressure to create on a schedule (like a job) or to stick to one medium or to ask for funds for one big project (like a kickstarter). Instead I am free to be the magpie I am, explore new mediums and make my nest of shiny new art that I can then share with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a few goals in mind I hope to put your patronage towards:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelp me pay for art supplies\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eProduce better videos\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInteract with my patrons and fans!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI\u0027ve made \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/OrangeMagpie?ty=c\"\u003equite a few posts\u003c/a\u003e to give you a taste of the breadth of my interests. I think I\u0027ve got a little of everything in there.\u00a0Here\u0027s a short list of previous and/or current obsessions: mandalas and geometric drawing, figurative art, bookbinding, oil painting, marker coloring, printmaking, shadow boxes, origami (tessellations, modular and traditional), paper-craft automatons and figures,\u00a0ceramics (pottery and handbuilding), 2D/3D abstract design, paper cuts, quilling, felting, puppets and more that I can\u0027t think of right now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve started making\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/orangeinthesunshine\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube videos\u003c/a\u003e of my processes and updating my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://instagram.com/orange.magpie/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e on a regular basis. My current goal is to post every Tuesday and produce a new video each month. The posts will cover my recent purchases from Patreon funds, current projects, throw-backs to past creations and behind-the-scenes. For Patrons only there will be sneak peeks, advanced viewing for the videos and other bits exclusively for you.\u00a0I want this to be as fun for you as it is for me! I hope you\u0027ll join me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
