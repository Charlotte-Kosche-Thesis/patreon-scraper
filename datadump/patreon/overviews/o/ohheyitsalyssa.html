With this goal achieved, I\u0027ll inevitably be drinking fancy coffee every once and a while and it\u0027s all because of you! Apart from the occasional coffee, this will go towards traveling/tabling at comic cons, and keeping my supplies and studio gear to help me make you more stuff!\u00a0",

At $500, You\u0027re pretty much helping me make rent solely off of comic work, which is INCREDIBLE. The dream, really.
