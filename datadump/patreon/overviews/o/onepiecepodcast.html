As of right now, no contributors have received a cent from the podcast or any of the content produced on the website.

Should the circumstances allow it, we would love the opportunity to pay for those contributors -- however small the amount may be. Their time is extremely valuable and we appreciate all the hard work they put in to make The One Piece Podcast what it is.",
