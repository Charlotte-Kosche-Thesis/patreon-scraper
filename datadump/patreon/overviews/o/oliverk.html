    "summary": "Hi\n- thanks for checking out my page! My name\u0027s Oliver Kaufman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\nare a lot of things that I like to create, and endeavors I\u0027m pursuing\nthat are interesting to me. I\u0027d like to be able to share my creations\nand experiences with everyone I can. To help with that, I\u0027ve created\nthis Patreon page, so anyone can help support me in living a creative\nlife - one where I can contribute what I can from my pursuits to the wider\nworld.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery\nbit of support you give will go towards me being able to more freely\npursue the things I find personally fulfilling, and to share the\ncontent I create, as part of that journey, with a wider and wider\naudience. And, with you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo\nwhat kind of content can you look forward to? Well, the main\ninterests I have, and the work that I do with them, are listed\nbelow:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInner\nWork\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nspend a lot of time reflecting on my own inner world \u2013 the world of\nthoughts, emotions, feelings, decisions, and more. Within this place,\nI can find dilemmas, buried dreams of mine, vulnerable sides of\nmyself, wise teachings and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis pursuit has helped me with so many things in my life. It\u0027s given me perspective on my problems, shown me ways forward when I was completely lost, shown me gifts of self-kindness, self-acceptance, trust, peace, relaxation, and appreciation - just to name a few of them. Given the impact it\u0027s had, I wanted to share the things I\u0027ve learned and the techniques I\u0027ve found to be effective, which I do on my website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theworldwithin.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe World Within\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, I mostly focus on major topics on the website, but I\u0027m constantly investigating new topics in my personal\nwork. I plan to share bits and pieces from that work with\npatrons on here, as I find them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFiction\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nhave two major areas that I work on for fiction: one are my short\nstories, the other is the continuation of my fantasy epic,\nDelucion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor\n\u003cstrong\u003eshort stories\u003c/strong\u003e, I often write them as a way of working through complex\nor plaguing feelings, by putting those feelings into the story, and\nseeing how they work out as the story changes, along with the\nfeelings. These stories often touch on common human experiences, so I\noften enjoy sharing them with others. I recently put together 18 of\nmy stories in a collection, entitled\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAVOT7O\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Windless Echo\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s\navailable via that link, but also as a reward for anyone who donates\n$10 or more a month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDelucion\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003efollows\nthe story of a young man named Delucion as he seeks to uncover the\ntruths of the world that exists beyond the boundaries of what he was\ntold to be real. The town of Falborough, bounded by seemingly endless\nmountains and seas, thrives within the belief that there is nothing\nelse in the world aside from what they know. But, Delucion has always felt there must be more, and feels the calling to find out for himself.\nThis story is an account of his journey, as he travels into the heart\nof the unknown. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nam still writing this story, and it\u0027s written in such a way that\nthere is no known conclusion. The happenings of the story unfold\nspontaneously, just like in real life. I want to share this story as\nI go, but it takes editing and time. I plan to publish it in some\nformat soon, but for now, the first seven chapters are available at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.delucion.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edelucion.com\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ll also be making content that I\u0027ll share on Patreon\nonly, such as chapter previews, character interviews, drawings, and\nmore. You can have access to all that, here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusic\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nenjoy expressing myself in music sometimes, with piano and singing\nbeing the main ways. I usually express to work through feelings, but\nthis also brings a sense of joy and peace to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeriodically,\nI make videos to go along with my piano music, which you can find\nhere\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa5AVwNw1CUUZHI-sUrS8rA\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon my YouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e.
