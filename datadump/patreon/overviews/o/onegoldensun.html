Read on...\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here, you probably know me best as OneGoldenSun. In the clubhouse, you can call me Pidge.\u003cbr\u003e(because we\u0027ll obviously need code names if we\u0027re in a secret club together, right?)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a published illustrator, muralist, fiber artist \u0026amp; designer with a wide variety of clients and 16+ years of business under my belt and its a great gig because I spend most of my day in pajamas (#adulting). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike a lot of people my age, I was raised on cartoons and dreamt of living in a castle, with talking animal friends, and sleeping under a fireworks filled sky... as one does.\u00a0In July 2015, I created my OneGoldenSun identity (and Instagram account @_onegoldensun_), as a place to share \u0026amp; celebrate my happiest place on earth. The account was only ever supposed to be a \"side project\"; an escape-- a place to share vacation photos and silly bits of fan art. BUT, in less than a year, its become the happy place for so many wonderful friends and fantasy-lovers alike \u0026amp; I am so thankful for the connections I\u0027ve made from it. Together we\u0027ve helped people have magical moments \u0026amp; have raised money for charity, and I think we can do more still! I have SO many ideas for pieces I want to make and series\u0027 I want to complete... alas, there\u0027s only so much I can do on my own, while also juggling \"real\" work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, why are we here? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGlad you asked! You\u0027re here because we share a common interest and I *know* the things I want to make are also things YOU want to have made. Through the Patreon platform you will be able to very easily \u0026amp; safely support me and in turn drive more content your way. Each pledge you make ensures that I will be able to spend time making new content for you, without having to worry about it pulling time away from \"work\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a patron, you are saying \"hey! thanks for doing what you do\" and I will say \"you\u0027re so welcome-- here\u0027s a thing i made just for you!\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd what kinds of \"things\" are you making?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, all sorts of things really. I am currently in the middle of at least 4 different \"series\" and I would love your help finishing them all up! If you go to my instagram (@_onegoldensun_) and search #OGSdiamondseries, you\u0027ll see the beginnings of one of those projects-- I am bound and determined to reimagine each of the animated classics in the catalog. I\u0027m also working on 2 different re-imaginings of the princesses and hero/villain tropes. And lastly, (and currently for you), I would like to make a seasonal coloring book for my fellow Dreamers, where I merge location and character icons with events or activities that evoke that season. And I\u0027ll be asking YOU for feedback \u0026amp; ideas as we go, too! For now, \u003cem\u003ethose \u003c/em\u003eimages will make up the monthly coloring sheet \u0026amp; full color prints (though, if you choose one of the larger packages, you may get prints from one of the other series\u0027 as well). Each month I will complete an image and if you sign up during that month, THAT will be the image you receive the following month (art created in May will ship in June. Patrons who sign up in May will get the art created in May sent to them in June).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow\u0027s this all work? I see options... I see buttons. Talk to me about these buttons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy pleasure! Buttons are my favorite!\u003cbr\u003eIf you look over there ------\u0026gt; you\u0027ll see a variety of pledge options. Each pledge level equals a different reward/ reward package. Take a minute to read through your options and choose the one that best fits your interests and budget. The pledge amount is a MONTHLY contribution to my work-- it helps pay for supplies and materials \u0026amp; works to \"crowd-fund\" these projects in advance, and then YOU get \"paid back\" in the form of your reward, as a thank you from me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of your pledge level, \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon will charge you only once per month\u003c/strong\u003e and your rewards will all ship/be available, the FOLLOWING month, once payments have cleared (typically in the first week or so).\u00a0You can also change your pledge amount at any time during your subscription (+/_) as needed and you will get the reward for whatever level you are on when payments clear that month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo... what can I get? ( I\u00a0mean, besides the warm feeling of awesomeness for supporting a creative endeavor aimed at making me smile every month)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThanks to the awesome little community we\u0027ve already created over on Instagram, I feel like I\u0027ve gotten a good sense of what kinds of things you would all like to see. I already have an entire notebook filled with ideas for series to complete (\u0026amp; you can see some of them already in progress over there too), and\u00a0I\u0027ve been working on some \u003cstrong\u003eTOP SECRET totally awesome magical and wonderful extra extra extra side-side-side projects\u003c/strong\u003e too and I want YOU guys to be the first to know about them \u0026amp; to help me decide what to do with them. SO, one thing EVERYONE who pledges gets is \u003cstrong\u003eaccess to the Patron-only feed\u003c/strong\u003e here on this page (talk about a Secret Society!!). Over here, I\u0027ll post behind the scenes pictures, and sneak peeks at things you wont see on Instagram. It\u0027ll be a place for us to chat \u0026amp; for you to be sure you don\u0027t miss anything (which is great, since the new Insta is kinda a mess... #sideeye).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to that perk, each pledge level introduces a new reward. Rewards include everything from \u003cstrong\u003edigital downloads to actual prints, to coupon codes and other special offers, to a full on subscription \"box\" (possibly a padded envelope...) chock full of assorted ***magic and wonder***, delivered to your doorstep each month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAND \u003c/strong\u003eas a special gift, we\u0027ll also have monthly goals, which, once met, will mean additional rewards can be offered.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo... Are you in?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eCAW, CAW, ROAR!!!!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
