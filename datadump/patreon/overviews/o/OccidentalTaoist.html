    "summary": "Hello there. Thank you for coming to visit my Patreon page and considering becoming my patron. I am Jeff Cot\u00e9, The Occidental Taoist, and I make\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eQigong and Tai Chi Instructional Videos. \u003c/strong\u003eI have been studying and teaching Qigong, Medical Qigong, Tai Chi, Baguazhang, Tao Yin, Taoist Meditation and Zhongyi Medicine for nearly thirty years. I have been teaching these arts for the past twenty years at senior centers, councils on aging, community centers, schools of Asian healing Arts, and in my own martial arts facility. I have also practiced Zhongyi Medicine in the disciplines of Tuina, Medical Qigong, and Herbalism for over twenty years, and I have been called one of the hidden treasures of New England.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat exactly does it mean to be the Occidental Taoist, you ask? Culturally speaking, I was born and raised in America, but somewhere along the meandering path of my life, I found my feet firmly placed upon the Way (the Tao). This has expressed itself in many ways; a calm demeanor, a peaceful and hopeful attitude, in my love for all of the \u003cstrong\u003eTaoist Internal Arts,\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0the philosophy, and the metaphysics of Ancient China. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the things that I have observed through my decades of teaching is that we, in the West, simply do not think in the same ways as our Chinese cousins. As a result, we in the West do not learn in the same ways. This means that by solely following the traditional methods of teaching, it rarely leads to the same depth of skill found in one who is born to these ways of thinking and learning.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have long had a dream of offering these arts to those who might not otherwise be able to afford it. As my patron, you will contribute towards me to doing that. Through this page, I wish to share with you my experience as one who has lived this path on a daily basis with discipline. More importantly, I wish to share it in a way that speaks to the Western mind and learning style. I hope that you will join me here in creating radiant health, long life, and calm demeanor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eJust a note of gratitude, some of the images used on the Patron Tiers are courtesy of and with kind permission from Assi Ben-Porat. The others are my own.\u003c/blockquote\u003e"

     "about": "Jeff has been a student, practitioner, and a teacher of Martial Arts, Qi Gong, Tuina, Qi healing, Chinese Herbal Medicine, and Taoism for nearly 30 years. He began his journey in the Asian healing arts through the practice of martial arts and meditation. This naturally led him to a deeper awareness of the purpose of such arts; the wholeness of mind, body and soul. To further his understanding, Jeff sought professional training; first at the Tai Institute of Oriental Medicine in Oveido Florida where he studied acupuncture, Chinese herbs and Asian bodywork therapy. He sought training in western massage at American Spirit Institute in Williamsburg, Virginia in order to interface with the western bodywork community.\u003cbr\u003eUnsatisfied with simply educating himself scholastically, Jeff then continued his studies in clinical apprenticeships with Dr. Hou Zhi Lian and Dr. Feng Song. He also trained extensively with Dr. Tzu Kuo Shih, Tao Shih - Bill Helm and Tom Turcotte. During his training with T.K. Shih, Jeff was encouraged to attend the NanJing University College of Medicine and trained in an extension program in Medical Qigong.\u003cbr\u003eJeff has carried professional certification through numerous organizations including a  Registered Instructor and Certified Practitioner in Asian Bodywork Therapy in the discipline of Tuina through the American Organization for the Bodywork Therapies of Asia (AOBTA) and he holds a certificate in Massage Therapy. He also holds a Qi Gong Therapist Certification through the Chinese Wu Tang Chuan Gung Association. He served for a time as the National Director of Education for the AOBTA, where he interfaced with numerous colleges and schools of Asian Bodywork.\u003cbr\u003eJeff spends the majority of his time practicing and teaching the internal arts. Current classes include Qigong in Shirley and Townsend, and both Qigong and Tai Chi in Berlin, Harvard, Lancaster, Clinton, Ashby and Shirley. \u003cbr\u003eHe offers both private and group instruction and has specialized in longevity.\u003cbr\u003eJeff has taught Martial arts, Qi Gong, Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, Chinese Herbal Medicine and Tuina in Chinese Medical schools, massage and bodywork schools and workshops both around the country and internationally. He has been a guest lecturer at Northeastern University for graduate studies in holistic health, was the Traditional Chinese Medicine and Tuina instructor at the Charles River Shiatsu School, and taught Orthopedic Tuina at the New England School of Acupuncture. He is the Founder, Director, and Head Instructor of Formless style Tai Chi Chuan.\u003cbr\u003e",
