This was followed by D\u0026amp;D Basic and Expert Set. I shifted to Advanced D\u0026amp;D the summer of 1982 and also played a ton of Champions, Traveller and Call of Cthulhu. I\u0027ve been writing and illustrating RPGs since 1999 with work for Guardians of Order. I\u0027ve published paper mini pdfs and role playing games and supplements on RPGNow since 2010. I\u0027ve run two kick-starters and really enjoyed the collaborative aspect of creating game material with a group of supportive and motivated people who share the same interests and passions for gaming as I do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Worlds Exactly?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMostly, I want to flesh out the world of Darkfast Dungeons, the original print and play tabletop adventure game I created with my first Kickstarter. It\u0027s a fantasy setting based on my original 1981 D\u0026amp;D campaign so there will be lots of familiar sandbox elements to play with, but I\u0027d like your help with the details as they come up (deities, adventures, NPCs, etc.). Other genres will also be explored such as Sci Fi, Retro Sci Fi, Magical Girl, Steampunk, Horror, Superhero, etc. It\u0027s going to be up to you to help guide the creative output of this endeavour. The outcome will be a set of minis, adventures, game material, and other products every month, depending on the path we are taking. The goal is to have something you can use to enhance your own gaming experience no matter what game you play: sometimes it will be a set of paper minis, other months it will be a bestiary or adventure. Once and a while a core game book might just appear. Signing up for the Patreon at the $5 + level also enables you to get passes to freshly released paper mini sets as they come out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Games Will Be Supported?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost material will be designed for use with Okumarts Games Games (Darkfast Dungeons, Save the Day) AND Swords \u0026amp; Wizardry: White Box (and compatible games). Of course, much of it will be game-agnostic and usable by most every gamer out there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout the Artist\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve been a published comic book artist\nsince I submitted my work to my high school and university newspapers in a\nseries of increasingly less embarrassing bodies of work that culminated in\nsuccessful work for Antarctic Press with the \u003cstrong\u003eGirls of Ninja High School\u003c/strong\u003e\nanthology comic for 1992 and a follow up in 1993. Emboldened by this success I\nproduced a few issues of \u003cstrong\u003eContraption \u003c/strong\u003eand worked off and on in the comics and table\ntop role playing game industry while pursuing teaching and\nraising children. This was followed up with illustration and writing work for games company Guardians of Order in the late 90s, early 2000s. My big work came in 2003 with the release of \u003cstrong\u003eManga Madness\u003c/strong\u003e,\nan instructional book on drawing manga. This was followed by a series of books\nwith \u201cmadness\u201d in the title and a panel at \u003cstrong\u003eComic Con \u003c/strong\u003ein San Diego with Lea Seidman Hernandez and Will Eisner. More recently I have been producing work for the table\ntop gaming industry including a successful collection of print and play paper miniatures\nand the Kickstarter-funded fantasy board game \u003cstrong\u003eDarkfast Dungeons \u003c/strong\u003eas well as\u00a0the Superhero RPG \u003cstrong\u003eSave the Day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLinks\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.rpgnow.com/browse/pub/3639/Okumarts-Games?affiliate_id=195160\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRPGNOW OKUMARTS\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.okumarts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttp://www.okumarts.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
