Whether you meant to click this or happened to stumble upon it, I thank you for checking it out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, to explain what I do,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/OoTuckoO\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI make videos on YouTube\u003c/a\u003e! To be a little less vague, I started with small gameplay videos and am still currently evolving. For the most part, you will see\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/OoTuckoO/playlists\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLet\u0027s Plays\u003c/a\u003e \u003cem\u003e(Ranging from years ago to now)\u003c/em\u003e, with a slow progression to much, much more. I hope to do additional content such as reviews, top 10s, other gaming related videos, as well as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/OoVlogoO\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003evlogs\u003c/a\u003e \u003cem\u003e(Which will pick up in the future)\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and even streams \u003cem\u003e(I\u0027ll be trying my best to get this up sooner or later)\u003c/em\u003e! I love being able to share my own experiences with games both past experiences as a child or even new experiences with blind Let\u0027s Plays. I mainly do Nintendo content, but I also will hopefully evolve into a plethora of other games. I\u0027ve always wanted to play others from other consoles or even PC games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan on doing videos for as long as I possibly can, as I am passionate about what I do. I appreciate all the thoughtful messages and such that I receive from people who watch my content. Now,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eyou can choose to support if you wish\u003c/strong\u003e. With donations and support, I will be able to get new equipment, any games that are requested, be able to advance my content further, and hopefully one day get the chance to meet you guys at conventions in hopefully as near of a future as possible! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, with Patreon\u0027s plans, those who support will be rewarded in a multitude of ways!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time out of your day to read this!
