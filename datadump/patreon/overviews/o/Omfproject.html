    "summary": "See Art, Be Art and Make Art\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2009, I began a deeply personal project called One Million Faces, inspired while Bon Jovi sang \"I\u0027ve seen a million faces and I rocked \u0027em all.\" as I drove into Boulder. I had a vision that included large scale portraits, live art and music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe One Million Faces project has inspired connection and community across Colorado. As the creator of the \u003ca href=\"http://www.onemillionfaces.org/?page_id=29\"\u003eOne Million Faces Project\u003c/a\u003e my passion is to inspire people to write their \u201cmessage to the world\u201d and connecting community, spreading hope, love and peace through a tapestry of faces. With over 12,000 faces to date and counting, I can tell you that I have. But don\u2019t just take my word for it\u2026 Look at the images here and you will see exactly what I mean.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014 the OMF team worked with the Elementary school community in Lyons, CO creating \"Time to Shine\" giving kids an artistic outlet to express their feelings from the Sept 2013 floods that displaced them and devastated their town. Each morning I led students in a short yoga sequence followed by creating artful collages on wood panels. This powerful community installation resides on the walls of the school a shining example of art and yoga coming together to help the children of Lyons Elementary in their recovery by letting their littlest voices be heard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAndrew Moore, school principal, commented, \"The One Million Faces Project has helped our community commemorate the highest aspects of our experience with the flood: our newfound sense of grit, resilience, and interdependence. Peggy\u0027s work has inspired our entire community by bringing joy, music, and art to our healing - we cannot begin to understand the reach this work is having on our collective experience and psyche.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cPeggy\u2019s work has changed our lives, it helped me know I have powerful words.\u201d Sophie Pike, 3rd grader\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI am a resident of Lyons, mother of two Lyons Elementary students and a flood survivor. This \"Shine\" project was exactly what our community needed. You could feel the excitement in the air. The trauma of the flooding, loosing all of your possessions, being without a home and once again transitioning back to school was difficult for us all. With smiles, dancing, singing and love Peggy helped us all to SHINE\u201d. Bernadette Taylor - parent\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy powerful \u0026lt;ins\u0026gt;images\u0026lt;/ins\u0026gt; have also benefitted non-profit organizations, like the Davis Phinney Foundation, ARC, The Red Cross, Boys and Girls Club, Off the Mat into the World, the Give Back Yoga Foundation, and Eat, Breathe, Thrive and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Peggy brings out the smile in those who are subjects and in the viewer - She has a gift, and with it, she is simply shedding light on humanity. The scope of the project is huge but she\u0027s focused on one image at a time. It\u0027s beautiful to be part of the process. Her work with the Davis Phinney Foundation has put a face on Parkinson\u0027s Disease in a way that touches thousands of lives daily. She has made our work easier because as they say, a photo is worth a thousand words.\" Connie Carpenter-Phinney, Gold Medal winning Olympian, wife of Davis Phinney\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith each blog post, I\u0027ll tell a new story and create art from the archive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for supporting my work in the world.\u003cbr\u003e"
