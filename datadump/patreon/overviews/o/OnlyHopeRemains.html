    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to Featherfoot Farm\u0027s Patreon!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeatherfoot Farm is a horse rescue which I started in \n2011, entirely on my own, without any financial help from outside \nagencies. I rehabilitate and rehome horses that have been abused, \nneglected, retired from racing, or retired from work in general. Horses \nthat come through my rescue are rehomed on a contract, which means that \nshould the adopter of the horse need to rehome the horse in the future, \nthe horse comes back to me, is re-evaluated, and then rehomed again \nthrough my farm. Adoption fees are generally only what I have invested \ninto the horse, and very often less than. For example, if an old, worn \nout mare comes in needing $1000 in vet work, I\u2019ll never make that back \nin her adoption, because she\u2019s not able to do work anymore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe rescue started unintentionally when I went to try \nout a jumping horse I was interested in buying at a private property, \nand found a skinny, frail Clydesdale gelding, half-blind, getting \nbullied out of the food by six healthy, young horses, in a tiny muddy \npasture. My heart broke for him, and I couldn\u2019t leave him there to \nwither away. So, I threw 14 years of horse jumping, shows, and \nprofessional riding training out the window, and instead of trying out \nthe jumper, I asked how much they would take for the Clydesdale. He was \nhome the next week. That Clydesdale, named Tanner, was my first rescue, \nand my first horse. 5 years later, I still don\u2019t have my jumping horse, \nand I am more than totally fine with it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTanner is still with me today, along with three other \nbeautiful, special horses.  After acquiring my second pony, Lilliput, \nand rehabilitating her extremely neglected hooves, word spread in the \nsmall community where I live that I would take on horses.  Soon, I had \npeople from racetracks calling me, asking if I could help them rehome \ntheir racehorses when they had been retired from racing, so that they \ndidn\u2019t have to send the horses to auction, and potentially, the \nslaughterhouse. To this day, I have rehomed 3 dozen horses, either \nthrough my farm or directly from racetracks. It is a labour of love \nwhich costs me half my annual income to maintain. I still receive no \ngrants, government money, etc. for my work. There\u2019s no programs \navailable. I currently run everything out of a two stall stable, which \nacts more like a run-in shelter for the current herd. Some day in the \nfuture, I hope to be able to expand my barn, and my capacity!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent Horses Living at Featherfoot:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003eTanner\u003c/em\u003e \u2013 17 years young \u2013 18HH \u2013 Clydesdale -- Photo: \u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/a/Yy8Nz\"\u003ehttps://imgur.com/a/Yy8Nz\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTanner was my first horse and first rescue. He\u2019s a \ngiant, goofy boy, always looking for attention and snuggles. He\u2019s blind \nin his left eye, but that doesn\u2019t slow him down at all. Tanner is \ntrained for both riding and pulling, and LOVES being in the woods. The \nhorses have access to a section of trail in their pasture, and I often \ncatch him in there, enjoying the breeze and the birds. His favourite \ntreat is banana, he will even try to steal the peel from your pocket. He\n is a permanent resident of the farm, and will be living the rest of his\n days here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003eLilliput (Lily) \u003c/em\u003e\u2013 15 years young \u2013 11HH \u2013 Shetland Mix \u2013 Photo: \u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/a/wBrWT\"\u003ehttps://imgur.com/a/wBrWT\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLily is a quirky little pony, and was the second \naddition to the herd. She is sassy, sweet, and stubborn, classic pony \ntraits. Lily came to me after a local farmer informed me of her \nsituation. Her hooves were in terrible shape, and she has permanent bone\n remodelling from the neglect. Today she is comfortable, healthy, and \nhappy bossing the goat and other ponies around. Lily\u2019s favourite things \ninclude laying her head across your lap to nap, apples, scratches behind\n the ears, and nipping the vet\u2019s ears. ;) Lily is a permanent resident \non the farm due to her leg/hoof issues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003eAlissandra (Alise)\u003c/em\u003e \u2013 20 years young \u2013 14.1HH \u2013 Norwegian Fjord \u2013 Photo: \u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/a/Qs2b8\"\u003ehttps://imgur.com/a/Qs2b8\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAlise is a retired brood mare, and has had EIGHT foals \nin her life. She has also been a school horse, and a show horse. She was\n surrendered to me by her owner after a fall caused an injury to her \nhock, which prevents her from jumping anymore. Alise is sweet, motherly,\n and very patient. She spends much of her time with Tanner, though Lily \nand her are very fond of each other. Her favourite things include \nscratches on her belly, carrots fresh from the garden, cuddles, and \nchasing the goat.  Alise is a permanent resident due to how hard her \nlife has been, and her injury.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003eHeartsong Lyric (Lyric)\u003c/em\u003e \u2013 4 years young \u2013 13.1HH \u2013 Purebred Hackney Pony -- Photo: \u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/a/qqDMQ\"\u003ehttps://imgur.com/a/qqDMQ\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLyric is the latest addition to the herd. She came to me painfully \nunderweight and malnourished, and has grown significantly since \nrecovering. Lyric is still learning manners, and enjoys chasing the \nother horses in an attempt to get them to play, stealing hats and \ngloves, pushing things over, and ear scratches. She had been allowed to \nmisbehave in her previous home because it was \u201ccute,\u201d and is now slowly \nlearning to be respectful. Lyric\u2019s favourite things are apples, shaking \nobjects around with her mouth, scratches on her neck, and galloping in \nthe field. Lyric is a semi-permanent resident on the farm, and may be \navailable for adoption after a few years when she is trained for saddle \nof harness. Alternatively, my father may keep her as his cart pony. Time\n will tell!"
