We\u0027re both accomplished musicians, amateur film makers, gamers, film buffs and have made the rounds through several Nerd-dom sanctuaries such as Anime Cons, Magic the Gathering Tournaments, Gaming conventions, Craft and DIY /Maker Culture from out various bands, projects, and hobbies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith our interests ranging from Anime to X-wings \u0026amp; Zombies, we think we bring a richer perspective to our reviews that cover the scientific to the silly; the socially acceptable to the taboo \u0026amp; macabre; and the idiotic to the profound.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough we can be a bit stubborn, we always keep an open mind and love a good discussion. Since our friendship almost spans 2 decades, these moments can lead to witty, well thought out arguments as well as childish remarks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why not join us for the ride and enjoy the fireworks?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach episode of The Transformers Beast Wars Podcast covers one episode of Beast Wars, with a focus on the plot and character interactions. Looking for G1 callbacks and funny\u00a0audio clips from the TV episodes cut into the discussion make The Transformers Beast Wars Podcast a real nostalgic treat for the Transformers fan!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes there will be some toy love, but this is not a toy review show - this show is about celebrating the great story that the Maximals and Predacons lived out for us during the late Nineties - and watching a close friend watch it for the first time! So join us in re-living the Beast Wars!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contributions will help us handle hosting and supply costs, enable equipment upgrades and the freedom to launch new shows - a G1 Retrospective series to start with, and with your help even more great shows can be enabled through your support!
