The gods have fallen, after harrowing years when oracles foresaw what was coming. Factions within congregations beset one another and were eventually shattered, and after years of bloodshed their allegiances were blamed and hunted down. In the absence of the divine powers, the Darkness Before has reawoken, ensnaring the weak and meager to do its bidding. The war rages on some thirty years after the foreshadowed but forsworn Godfall, but its stakeholders and driving forces have since long been altered or replaced. The misery is widespread, and matters of life and death set the course of action for most survivors.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe game setting explore four core themes:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFantasy in ruins:\u003c/strong\u003e The world that was has ended, and the only option for the remnants is to survive the godless world. Everyone is desperate, and anyone still alive is undoubtedly marked by their experiences. Scarcity in food and shelter is common, and genuinely safe havens are rare to stumble upon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eUnholy and heathen identity: \u003c/strong\u003eThe gods have fallen or have died and cannot help the remnants. Cults of faith are what started this mess in the first place; the cults that follow in their ashen footsteps are perceived as mad and few remnants beyond those cults would look so far into the past for answers, for the only seemingly divine power left is the Darkness Before. Questions arise: Where do we go when we die? And what is a sin if there are no gods to judge us?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMysterious magic:\u003c/strong\u003e Magic exists, but has survived only as a hidden practice for centuries, and was before the Godfall been associated with sorcerous deeds and dark crafts. Given that conjunction, it is subject to much superstition and fear. When manifested, magic is either subtle and invisible \ufe58 easily mistaken for natural phenomena \ufe58 or an unseen but highly desired power. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eEldritch tales:\u003c/strong\u003e Many mythical things exist beyond what can be seen in the light of the day. Tales of them are passed on by the fireside. Evidence may be found out, but only by the curious. To commoners, these tales of beasts, treasures, curses, and fair folk are much the same, but for heroes and servants of the shrouded Archmages, they hold different value.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you want to have a closer look, we have published Chapter 1 of the game at \u003ca href=\"http://www.fateoftheremnants.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eour website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe 30-second version \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"\" height=\"412px;\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8C8QZ0E8S_V2-9af79wSySsAzlLrMi-jlYu6Kz88ShWUYXA1BVpb3C2qDFermDkuCk-5y0IbsfvKyJjjb6slDsSliQyLBPlbS2dUtDm4jHutmJoQY_mF7yzfazkC63JiRzSGC8tF\" width=\"602px;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eA release summary\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eWe at Obscure Tides are currently producing Fate of the Remnants, a tabletop roleplaying game based on Fate Core rules from Evil Hat Productions.

This allow us to have a steady flow of content coming your way, but it also mean the material is subject to updates and changes. The pro\u2019s will outweight the con\u2019s we think, and makes it possible to inform you about what is happening and a sense of what is coming. At the same time we will be able to collect feedback and input before we turn it into a physical hardcover game.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you will get\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eEach release here will be a chapter from the full game, with added content formatted for the Patreon model. With that we mean is that not only is the chapter copied straight out of the game, but you will get a chapter filled of complete content, adjusted to be used right away. Every chapter is either centered around the setting or the rules, and will be fully usable as it is for you as a Fate Core gamer. It will be designed as a separate entity and only not for use as an excerpt or a part of the full game. With one or two exceptions, the chapters will land on circa 20 to 30 pages plus each, beautifully laid-out with art from our amazing artists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first few chapters will be designed as standalone releases \ufe58 modules you can plug into your own ongoing Fate fantasy games. They will also include content about the setting of Remnants, which we hope will be useful as inspiration, but the initial chapters alone will not be enough to play the complete game. A few chapters in, the bigger picture should become clearer, and we hope players will consider starting their own Remnants games. Once everything is published, we will collect it all, edit it, and release as a complete product. Patreon backers will get a substantial discount on the final product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to deliver a top quality game that will provide you with a rich experience, regardless if you are a GM or a player, but also provide releases here that are usable directly for play. If we reach higher milestone goals, each chapter will either have additional content according to our funding goals, like additional artwork, maps, thematic music, etc., or we will plan to publish separate add-ons for you to enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eEDIT: We have revised our publishing plan, and decided to make the game in 15 chapters, without leaving anything out. Rather, we have decided to pack it better and make the content more accessible and relevant.

Our current goal is to release the whole game here, and the current budget allows already to do so. Your funds here will help us improve the game, and everything here will go back into the game, allowing us to add content and more illustrations. As each chapter may vary in size and content, the amount of fundings allocated to illustrators and writers may vary as well, but our ambition is to find a balance between them. As a founder, I will personally not lift one dollar as commission or salary until the game is completely done.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce we have released all chapters here, our next step is to make it a physical book.
