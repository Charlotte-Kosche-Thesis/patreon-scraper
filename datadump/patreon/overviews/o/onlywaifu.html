Some people wanted to support me in what I love to do, so, what better way to do this than setting up a Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I looking for with this Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003eBasically, \u003cstrong\u003eto improve. \u003c/strong\u003eThe biggest base on which this Patreon stands is to gain new resources to make better content for you guys, and if possible, to better my quality of life a little bit. I study System Engineering at my local UTN (Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Nacional), and this leaves me not-so-much time to do what I love, which is making content! So having a source of income that helps me \u003cstrong\u003eimprove \u003c/strong\u003eand is linked to what I love to do is nearly utopical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo,\u003cstrong\u003e how can you help? \u003c/strong\u003eSimply by donating \u003cstrong\u003e$1 to 5$\u003c/strong\u003e you\u0027re already helping me \u003cstrong\u003einmensely \u003c/strong\u003emaking this a bigger deal. It would help me get new gear for my PC, which would lead to me being able to purchase new games that I would normally not be able to pay, a new microphone, maybe a good camera so I can also share myself with you guys. This would also lead me to work with other artists, such as ilustrators, designers, other content creators such as myself, basically doing bigger and better projects, which in the end it all comes down to give you people a better experience. It\u0027s also a matter helping each other out, so maybe, while helping me, we can also help other people to get bigger and them improving themselves, too! As Bertrand Rusell said: \"The only thing that will redeem makind is cooperation\" (but I actually heard Shaun say it in the movie \"Shaun of the Dead\", but you guys get the point, hehe (?))\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, care to join me in the never-ending ride?\u003cbr\u003e"
