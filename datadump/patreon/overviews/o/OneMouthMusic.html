Briefly: I\u0027ve been into singing since my youth, but outside of that, I\u0027d never heard of the things I am now doing (contemporary a cappella, beatboxing, live looping) until I was an adult -- and I never learned about any of it around where I grew up.  I made a commitment to myself when I started that if I someday got the privilege of making my living doing something like this, I was going to be sure that any kid who wanted to could see what I\u0027m doing now live, in their backyard whenever possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEarly on, I found that the impact I often make in classrooms (especially with younger students) is not so much about \u003cem\u003ewhat I\u0027m doing\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003ehow I am doing it \u003c/em\u003einsomuch as, simply, \u003cem\u003ethat it\u0027s different\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eit\u0027s something I love. \u00a0\u003c/em\u003eI work with students in the hope\u003cem\u003e\u00a0that they too can also find something like that for themselves and potentially do it for a living \u003c/em\u003e-- simply put, the world\u0027s a big place and there\u0027s lots of stuff in it for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I feel strongly that people shouldn\u0027t have to figure out what new and different things look like, sound like, or feel like like by streaming it from their mobile devices.  It can come to them, it can work outside the offerings of what\u0027s available in their community, and it should be able to happen whether or not it\u0027s affordable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis isn\u0027t simply about funding single experiences and counting on them to change lives -- it is about creating a lasting footprint everywhere we go with a tactical minimum of resources, creating more opportunity for ongoing learning.
