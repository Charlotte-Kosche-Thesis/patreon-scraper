    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m going to be writing horror stories.\u003c/strong\u003e Horror\nstories of all kinds; standalone short stories, serialized fiction, maybe even\na comic or two if I get enough funding and can rope celebrity Mistmare player\nIvan Ulyanov into some collaborations. Horror about the human condition. Horror\nabout the supernatural. Horror about the creeping, unknown terror that lurks\njust at the bottom of the stairs when you\u0027re off to get a drink in the middle\nof the night. Horror about middle-management and corporate workflow tools.\nMaybe. All sorts. It\u0027ll be fun. Ever since I was about six, I\u0027ve wanted to\nterrify people. It\u0027s a noble goal, I think. People like being scared and\nI\u0027m happy to oblige. I\u0027ve always loved the horror genre, and always loved\nworking in it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPreviously, I\u0027ve written a bunch of short\nstories dotted around the place. Some you can find on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ashtonraze.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e, and my favorites\nyou can find in my first published novel,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blgh.ashtonraze.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBright Lights \u0026amp; Glass Houses\u003c/a\u003e.\nThere\u0027s quite a lot there. I enjoyed writing that book. I also run a blog taking\nan irreverent look at giallo, extreme and obscure horror movies over on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.suddenscream.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSudden Scream\u003c/a\u003e, as well as covering horror video games and interactive horror in general.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMost of you reading this probably know me from\nmy video game writing;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/279260/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRichard \u0026amp; Alice\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://owlcave.net/sepulchre-game/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSepulchre\u003c/a\u003e, and the follow-up\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/288930/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Charnel House Trilogy\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0There are also at least THREE games we\u0027re hard at work on which haven\u0027t been revealed yet. Maybe if you keep an\neye on my Patreon you\u0027ll get a sneak peek at those. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u0027re not familiar with my past work, or\nyou just fancy being a voyeur and reading my life story, here\u0027s something of a\nsummary:\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOriginally I started out writing prose fiction;\nhorror\u003cem\u003eand\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ecrime. I even\nfinished a crime novel, and was in the process of shipping it around to agents\nwhen various medical funtimes got in the way. I retired the project for a bit\nand ended up finding myself writing about video games instead. This was great,\nfor a while, but not something I wanted to do long-term. The next logical step\nwas writing\u003cem\u003efor\u003c/em\u003evideo games,\nsomething I started doing in 2012, when I joined the studio\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://owlcave.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOwl Cave\u003c/a\u003e of which I am now a\npartner. Our first game, Richard \u0026amp; Alice, came out in 2013 and\nreceived a fair amount of critical and fan acclaim. Richard \u0026amp; Alice is a\nmystery/crime story about two people who find themselves locked in a mysterious\nprison while a blizzard rages outside. Subsequently we released a free game,\nSepulchre, which chronicles the adventures of one Doctor Harold Lang aboard a\ntrain where nothing\u0027s quite right. This was my first foray into writing true\nhorror for video games, and it rekindled my love for the genre. We then re-released Sepulchre, bookended between two other games, Inhale and Exhale. These starred newcomer protagonist Alex Davenport, and people seemed to rather like them. I\u0027ve also written a number of horror\ngames using Twine, an interactive fiction tool, which I find to be a pretty\nexciting method of storytelling.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ninaowlcave.itch.io/the-prom-king-and-other-stories\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Prom King (and other stories)\u003c/a\u003e was my most popular. Be warned; it\u0027s majorly NSFW!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy writing career\u0027s been kind of haphazard,\nreally. Switching from prose to critique to game scripts. Originally, my life\nplan was to write novels, find an agent, get published, etc. This was kind of\nscuppered by a severe spinal condition I suffered in my youth, which led to me\nrequiring multiple reconstructive surgeries; surgeries which, due to the\nextremity of my condition, involved lengthy recovery times, metalwork,\nvertebrae removal, all sorts of exciting things. As such, it meant any concrete\nplans I had for a career were pretty much constantly changing or being\ndisrupted. In the end I\u0027ve just sort of rolled with it, adopting whichever type\nof writing suited. It has meant I haven\u0027t had much of an opportunity to go back\nto prose fiction though, and my aim is for this Patreon to allow that to change\na bit; for me to be able to fund working on new short stories and novels while\nexploring a new method of distribution. I figure it\u0027ll be an interesting, fun\nexperiment at least. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo! If you\u0027re looking for regular short (or\nlong!) horror fiction then you\u0027ve come to the right place. Pledge away! Enjoy\nthe TERROR. I\u0027ll try and make them scary, I promise. Patreon backers will also\nbe able to get sneak peeks at the various projects I\u0027m working on, and if\nthings go alright there may very well be a bit more multimedia content than\njust prose available to scare you.\u003cbr\u003e"

The book will also contain an exclusive short story only available in the collected editions. All Patreon backers will receive a free copy of the ebook in the format of your choice.",

The comic will be released digitally, and if possible, all backers of a certain tier and up will receive a print copy of the comic at no extra cost.",
