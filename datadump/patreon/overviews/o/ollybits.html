    "summary": "Hello there! Thank you for stopping by. My name is Olivia. I go by many aliases in the world of gaming: Q__Q, Q, Bootysweat, Ollybits. At the end of the day, I\u0027m just a girl with the dream of making it big in the world of Streaming and Art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 1996, I knew what I wanted to do. Playing games like Pokemon, Final Fantasy, and MMORPGs day in and out, I loved every moment of it. I loved meeting people, I love playing games with passion, and I love the art and dedication people put into it. I knew that I wanted to be in the industry that makes people of all ages feel that love of video games. I wanted to share my experience with people and become that bridge between video games and the community. Every path I\u0027ve taken, art school, graduating in Business, doing playtests for video game companies, and even working at the wonderful company, Discord, has brought me to where I stand today: \u003cstrong\u003eI want to become a streamer and create pixel art\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help I can make my dream and passion real. My life isn\u0027t about making the money, but its making the content for people to love, enjoy, and laugh about. That\u0027s what I strive for: Making you feel excited for gaming and gaming art just as much as I did since I was a child.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be creating more tiers down the road and continuously editing here. Thank you so much for your support!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;3 Olivia aka Q\u003cbr\u003e"
