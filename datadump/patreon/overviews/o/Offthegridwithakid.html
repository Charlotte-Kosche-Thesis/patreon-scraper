    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m Bionca and I have a 9 yr old son named Carter. I\u2019m a cultured high energy globetrotting life coach, public speaker and soon to be an author. Carter is a spiritual goofy homeschooled kid, gamer, and humanitarian. Together we want to inspire others to be bold enough to chase their dreams despite challenges. A year ago we decided to get rid of our fancy things, homeschool and travel the world until further notice. By popular demand, we share our journey on YouTube, Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram. 6 months ago we decided to buy a van to live in that would enable us to work, homeschool, explore the world and give back to communities we travel through. We are touring the U.S in a 1989 Ford Econoline that is a symbol of freedom and service. Right now we wish to relaunch an anti-bullying nonprofit foundation called the Bully Barricade.\u00a0For every $500 raised, we will travel to a school and host an anti-bullying event.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eOur values (L.E.G)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLearn\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEngage\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGive back\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eSome examples of what Carter and I love to do throughout our travels:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLearn and explore various regions of the world while engaging with locals\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCook delicious foods\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHosting play date meetups for traveling families with kids\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFeed the homeless\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRescue animals\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eClean up beaches\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLife coaching and delivering empowering speeches which include, speaking about bullying in schools\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003eWe will continue to share our travels, homeschooling schooling, business and volunteer work on all platforms, however, I\u2019ve decided to grant access to people who want to know how we do all of this while contributing to something that we need your help with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eBy becoming a patron of our work, you will HELP us:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRaise funds to relaunch the Bully Barricade Foundation, recruit a team and help us sustain the organization\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eObtain the necessary resources to work, and share the journey.
