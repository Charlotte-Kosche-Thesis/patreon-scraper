How did Game of Thrones turn into a cultural juggernaut? What techniques turned Pulp Fiction into a classic of cinema?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd how can you tell a story as mesmerizing and successful as any of them?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s what I\u0027m here to answer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to produce four quick-paced video essays a month exploring how good writing shaped Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and other works of fiction into what they are today. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to put together similar examinations of shows like The Sopranos, The Wire, Lost, Breaking Bad, etc. Not to mention the Tarantino movies, superhero films, and even video games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that is just the tip of the iceberg. As soon as I figure out the best way how, I want to analyse novels and short stories by heavyweights like Stephen King, J.K. Rowling, and George R. R. Martin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a nutshell, I want to create the learning resources that weren\u0027t available when I set out to become a writer, and help others realize that there are methods to the madness of storytelling. I want to remind them that, with both hard AND smart work, they can be just as good as their favorite writers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf not even better.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you\u0027re an aspiring writer yourself, or simply a film aficionado who enjoys a good analysis, with your help, I can grow this channel into an ever-growing library of resources, case studies, thorough analyses, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThink of it as an optional subscription to your favorite magazine. You\u0027ll still get free access to the magazine, but by way of Patreon, you can support the creator of said magazine so he/she can keep on producing more content. The best part? You yourself set the subscription rate. The donor is in complete control, and can stop donating any time you want. \u00a0There are no risks to you. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Do I Need Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDoing the research, writing, recording, and editing for several videos each month is pretty time-consuming. If I don\u0027t have to worry about how I\u0027ll pay the bills or when I\u0027ll get my next meal, I can dedicate more time to these projects and put out even more content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I start earning a steady income through Patreon, I will treat this like a regular job and use the platform to stay in touch with my donors and hold myself accountable to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for reading this far. Whether you support me or not, I\u0027m grateful for your attention,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, take care and go write a great story...if you dare."
