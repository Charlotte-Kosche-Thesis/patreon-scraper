If you\u2019re reading this page, I hope it\u2019s because you\u2019re passionate about your work as a creative musician. You may already know about the Orchestration Online community, and its mission to foster the development of resources, training, and creative alliances for the first generation of internet composers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBack in 2009, I started the whole ball rolling with a few videos about orchestration manuals and a few bits of advice for composers just starting out, talking off the top of my head to the video function on a cheap digital camera. I was surprised by the huge support those first videos generated, and how a community quickly built itself around my continued presence on YouTube. Today, thousands of members on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/OrchestrationOnline\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/278568792265515/?fref=nf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/OrchestrationOL\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e continue to find a home for their training and discussion with Orchestration Online. I feel enormously fortunate to be at the eye of that hurricane.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAt this point, our community has reached a turning point. In order to grow into a permanent online resource, with regularly scheduled training videos, community activities, and perhaps a series of open courses, Orchestration Online needs support. A very small donation per video will help maintain the flow of new insights and training on the YouTube channel. This new content in turn will enliven discussion and participation on Facebook and Twitter, and help shape our growing resources for subscribers of the main\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://orchestrationonline.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOrchestration Online website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eImagine the Orchestration Online YouTube channel running at its full strength, with a regular stream of videos.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/Bn8LMM1c3ek\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInterviews\u003c/a\u003e of composers, orchestral musicians, and conductors.

I plan to create a step-by-step series of courses in scoring that familiarise students with each instrument in depth, building on that training through works that also reach out to performers, eventually resulting in a powerful grasp of the craft of orchestration that\u2019s founded on creative achievement.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThese courses will be completely open to all on the internet. But here on Patreon I\u2019ll be offering an enhanced level of support, with premium course content and assignments, written feedback on compositions, and personal consultation. There\u2019s a lot more I could say about this, but there are many details yet to work out. I\u2019ll share them with you on the Patreon feed, and your suggestions may well help to shape some of the ways the courses will work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePesky Questions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003eWill there be more than three videos per month?\u003c/em\u003e \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eA.\u003c/strong\u003e Yes, but I won\u2019t ask patrons to fund more than three. I may make short video announcements to the community, and certainly those don\u2019t require support. When the MOOOC courses run, they may represent the three videos per month. I haven\u2019t yet worked out the details.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003eWhy not a $1 minimum?\u003c/em\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eA.\u003c/strong\u003e The $2 Minim level is actually calculated on cups of coffee: how many cups would you shout me if we were talking about these topics at a caf\u00e9? How about two or three? That equals around the lowest level of support. Also, \u201cMinim\u201d is better as an iconic name for a minimum level. No one wants to be a \u201cCrotchety\u201d patron. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
