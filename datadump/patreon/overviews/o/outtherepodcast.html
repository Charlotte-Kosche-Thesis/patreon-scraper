    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eNature has a remarkable capacity for helping us make sense out of our lives and the world around us.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eAnd Out There is a testament to that power.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all started in 2014, when I quit my job and set out to hike 500 miles through the wilderness of Colorado -- by myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had been working as a reporter and anchor for Wyoming\u0027s NPR station, and it was the kind of job I\u0027d always wanted. But I wasn\u0027t happy.\u00a0The constant deadlines and the 5 a.m. schedule wreaked havoc on my social life, and I couldn\u0027t shake a sense of quiet desperation. To make matters worse, my mother had passed away several years earlier, and the lingering grief from the loss was weighing on me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I decided to hike. I told my boss I was leaving, packed up my blue backpack, and set off to thru-hike the Colorado Trail, all the way from Denver to Durango.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe five-week trek did all the things that wilderness journeys are supposed to do: it helped me come to terms with my mother\u0027s death, gave me the confidence to risk a new career path (producing this podcast), and made me fall in love with life again. For many of us, spending time in nature can have a similar effect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut not everyone gets to go on grand adventures.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.outtherepodcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOut There\u003c/a\u003e bridges that gap by bringing you stories about other people\u0027s transformative experiences in the outdoors -- stories that make you laugh and cry and think about things a little differently than you did before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.outtherepodcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOut There\u003c/a\u003e has won several national and regional awards, has been listed as the #1 outdoor podcast on iTunes, and has a steadily growing listenership. I couldn\u0027t be more thrilled.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut producing the show takes time -- and money. Most episodes take months to put together, and there are significant overhead costs each month. We can\u0027t afford to pay our freelance producers anywhere near what they\u0027re worth, and my colleague Alex and I don\u0027t get paid at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is where you come in.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf Out There has made your life brighter in some small way, help us take this show to the next level by becoming a patron. We welcome pledges in any amount - whether it\u0027s $1 a month, or $100 -- and are eternally grateful to everyone who helps make this podcast possible.\u003cbr\u003e"
