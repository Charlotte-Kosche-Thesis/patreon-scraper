You might have found me via my blog,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.octoberesque.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWords Like Foam on the Waves\u003c/a\u003e; my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/octoberesque\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e account; or one of my poetry articles on the web.

So, since a lot of people I admire have taken to Patreon as a way to reward folks for helping them, I\u0027ve been thinking. It\u0027s always felt sleazy to me to ask for donations, or expect people to support me in any way other than buying my work. Here\u0027s the thing, though--with your assistance, I can create more and better things than ever before. And you can be involved.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel like this is a win for both of us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to my current supporters, I\u0027ve finally got a computer of my own. I\u0027ve moved away from the desert of the Bay Area and I\u0027m on my way to a new apartment. I\u0027ve had some bad luck in the last few months, but with your help, things are looking up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSadly,\u00a0I\u0027ve dropped my membership in the EFA due to the lack of funds to pay for it, but I\u0027m still very much an editor at heart, and want to get back into that side of work as soon as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe listed goals will change as this campaign evolves. So might the rewards! If you have an idea for a reward you think others might enjoy, and I have the ability to fulfill it, drop me a line. I would love suggestions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy my work, please consider contributing to the everyday mundanity of a life that makes it possible for me to dredge up those words and throw them around. Every little bit helps, and if you reach out to me, I\u0027ll show you my appreciation. You\u0027ll have more of my horrifying stories and scab-ripping poetry than you can shake a stick at, and I hope the rewards aren\u0027t half-bad, either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this. And thank you for stopping by. I love to see you around."
