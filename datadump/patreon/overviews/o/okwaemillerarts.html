Through the lenses of choreography, interactive projections and set design; the work investigates the darkness represented by a combination of confusion, shame, embarrassment and guilt through historical and contemporary victimizations of black men. Referencing collections of personal essays, Fighting Words; public observation of local communities; a collection of research studies and collaboration with local HIV/AIDS organizations; this work will examine the intersection of racism, homophobia, relationships and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe g[R]ay Boi will be performed in a life-sized constructed maze to provide a multi-dimensional experience by encouraging migration and audience activation through interactive multi-media imagery and choreography. The work will be set to an original score by collaborator and sound engineer, Colin Harden. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe production of The g[R]ay Boi is supported through the City of Atlanta Office of Cultural Affairs, AID Atlanta\u0027s, Fulton County Arts Council and SPARK Atlanta.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Okwae A.

Highly graphic and expressively pure, Miller\u0027s regard to identity politics and creative environments are informative through the texture of movement, creative process and the use of collaborative effort.\u003cbr\u003e"
