My name is \u003cstrong\u003eAli\u003c/strong\u003e and for as long as I can remember I have loved playing dress up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"500\" src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/802/26633446227_c45f6739c1.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginally from Florida, I moved to \u003cstrong\u003eLos Angeles\u003c/strong\u003e after I felt I reached my ceiling of opportunity in the acting scene. Over the last 6 years Los Angeles has provided an environment of bubbling creativity. I\u0027ve acted in a lot of really cool projects, but my favorites were when I could wear beautiful costumes and become someone else entirely. Unfortunately the acting world didn\u0027t see me as much of a \"character actor\" so I was cast in the same role again and again. I longed for something different, a creative challenge, but also wanted to maintain flexibility so I could continue to act, so I started my own business - a princess party company. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWanting to keep the start up cost low, I made my own \u003cstrong\u003ecostumes from scratch\u003c/strong\u003e. It was thrilling to see the reactions from kids at these parties and watch as my business grew. Then one day my friend said, \"let\u0027s go to a con\". We were already dressed up and volunteering for a set of triplets who were homeless and wanted to meet Elsa and Anna for their birthday, so even though I didn\u0027t know anything about this con world other than what I saw on tv, I went with her to the last few hours of the last day of a con. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was overwhelmed by the \u003cstrong\u003epositivity\u003c/strong\u003e I received. People stopped us left and right to take our photo, artists gave us art because they loved the costumes so much, and cosplayers insisted we come to the next con. I was hooked. That was \u003cstrong\u003e2015\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"240\" src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/793/40789431604_844d346c15_m.jpg\" style=\"width: 174px;\" width=\"191\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg height=\"240\" src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/785/40609241195_b447bd4868_m.jpg\" style=\"width: 145px;\" width=\"160\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg height=\"240\" src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/861/41462678802_c80476e3a4_m.jpg\" style=\"width: 159px;\" width=\"175\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(\u003cem\u003eGingerlassCosplay, TheScientistWrangler, and Oextremelunatics\u003c/em\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCosplaying quickly became my \u003cstrong\u003ecreative outlet\u003c/strong\u003e. It allowed me to create costumes that interest and challenge me, play characters I would never be cast in normally, and meet so many creative individuals who share the same interests as me.

Recently I\u0027ve taken a turn with social media and decided to stop trying to be like everyone else, but instead embrace who I am and what I want to see out there in the cosplay community.
