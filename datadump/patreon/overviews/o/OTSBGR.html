The first video will be a quick overview video that should be approximately 7 minutes long and will give a rough idea of what kind of game it is. The second video in the series is a complete tutorial video that will teach you how to play the game, hopefully without you needing to crack open the rulebook. The third video will be a game play video showing the game played. Sometimes even the best rulebooks and tutorials need some game play to help the game click and I\u0027ll be sure to explain the game and decisions that can go into playing the game. Finally the fourth video will be a review of the game, mentioning who will enjoy the game, some things to consider before buying the game, and potential things that may be negatives for some groups of gamers, especially optimal player count. Some games fall apart at some player counts while shining at other player counts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe channel has been active for over two years and entirely self funded, now you can help the channel grow! I am sponsor and network free, so you can help\u00a0with more content covering newer games,\u00a0better equipment (a new camera, a better PC for video editing),\u00a0 and possibly bring a variety of new content such as interviews and more! If we can hit a high enough milestone I would really love to bring content directly to the viewers from the floor of Gencon!"
