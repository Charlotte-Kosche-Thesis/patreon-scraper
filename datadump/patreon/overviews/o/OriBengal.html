    "summary": "The world of 37 years ago was different than the world of today. \u00a0Many people taught their kids to grow up and get a real job. \u00a0I was one of those kids, and despite that I got a ton of enjoyment from drawing or painting or sculpting, I never actually had the thought that this is what I could do for a living. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt took 35 years \u00a0of my life to discover that this is not only something I can do, but what I must do. I must create art... it\u0027s what I was wired for, and it seems to bring lots of joy to people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt took nearly another year before I did something about it. \u00a0You see, I never had discipline, or the will to get any good at art.... Everytime something would get difficult, I\u0027d quit... But now, I chose to do daily art, so that I can get better. \u00a0That was on April 23, 2012... and I haven\u0027t missed a day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve since abandoned my other businesses, and am now exclusively creating art. \u00a0 With your help, I can become one of the best in the world, as well as expand my art into more mediums.... \u00a0Such as glass and bronze.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll funds raised will go towards more equipment and supplies. \u00a0But additionally, with your support on Patreon, I am being given more time... not just to create art, but also to create more videos that show the processes involved in creating some of this art. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChoose your patronage amount, and then share this with your friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to creating art for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
