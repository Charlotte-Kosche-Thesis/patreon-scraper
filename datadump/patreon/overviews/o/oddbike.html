My aim is to provide the highest quality content free of the meddling of the industry that has degenerated motorcycle journalism in recent decades. As a result I am able to profile whatever I see fit, and present the facts and anecdotes that most outlets overlook (or don\u2019t dare share). Plus I feel it is an insult to the intelligence of my followers to blast them with the banners and advertorial crap that proliferates elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat of course means that I run OddBike at a loss. I generate zero income from my work. While that is fine by me, as OddBike has never been about the money, it makes it difficult for me to find the time to pursue my subjects.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u2019s where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am fully committed to my followers and consider myself accountable to them and them alone. With Patreon, I am able to seek funding for my work directly from you, the people who read my writing and watch my videos. With your help I can expand the scope of OddBike and devote more time to writing, traveling and interviewing the men and women behind the weirdest and most wonderful machines in motorcycling. My ultimate goal is to secure enough funding to be able to devote myself to OddBike full time - but any little bit helps.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo I thank you for your contributions. Without you, my readers, OddBike would be nothing. I am forever grateful to you all for the opportunities this endeavour has presented to me, and I hope to do even more in the future with the help of my patrons here on Patreon.    \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eAbout OddBike\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nIn a nutshell, OddBike is the intersection of my passion for motorcycles and my skills as a historian and writer. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the course of becoming a certifiable cycle nut, I\u0027ve encountered or heard tell of many strange machines. I\u0027ve always taken a keen interest in weird and rare motorcycles, with a particular eye towards their technical aspects, whether they are underappreciated gems or magnificently awful turkeys. I started OddBike in November 2012 as an outlet for my creativity and my all-consuming passion for bikes. I wanted to share my fascination with these odd bikes with the world, and hopefully keep the memories of these unusual cycles alive. Thus OddBike is a sort of archive, a historical register of all that is weird and wonderful in two-wheeled contrivances. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut OddBike is also more than a simple register of unusual motorbikes \u2013 I seek to provide accurate, meaningful and insightful profiles of these machines, free of sponsorship or corporate interference. I use my experience in history and my skills as a researcher to separate the facts from the drivel. I use my technical expertise to write meaningful analyses of mechanical details. I use my skills as a writer to convey the stories behind, and context surrounding, these fascinating machines. Finally I channel my enthusiasm for, and knowledge of, motorcycles into my writing to make my articles approachable and honest. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.odd-bike.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Q3TKSTMyl5s/WnSfzsACv8I/AAAAAAAALWQ/5iAM012Yu3celQoQa5-hhWYcDUJGrYrNACLcBGAs/s1600/Jason%2BCormier%2BDucati%2B916%2BOddBike.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nMy name is Jason Cormier, and I\u0027m obsessed with motorcycles. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been riding and fixing bikes since I was 17, and they remain my number one passion in life. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m a prototypical jack-of-all-trades. I do many things; I even do some of them reasonably well. By education, I am a historian. By experience, I am a mechanic. By trade, I am a salesperson. By pastime, I am an artist. By personality, I am obsessive and driven by perfectionism.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince 2006 my daily rider, touring mount, backroad-scratcher, and all-around grocery-getter has been a 1997 Ducati 916 superbike, which I recently supplemented with a far more \u003cem\u003esensible\u003c/em\u003e 2007 Aprilia Tuono 1000 R. I\u0027ve had a variety of bikes over the years, including a BMW K-bike, a couple of Honda V-4s, and a heavily modified Suzuki SV650. I did time as a Triumph-Norton-BSA mechanic during university, and continue to freelance as a Ducati wrench-for-hire when I\u0027m not busy fixing my own intemperate Italian bitches.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Ducati, however, is my bike \u2013 the machine I desire, the one that gives me an adrenaline rush on every ride, the one that compliments my personality, and the one that has accompanied me through several important stages in my life. My surroundings, circumstances and relationships have changed \u2013 but my 916 has remained a constant. And so it will always be. With over 50,000 miles under her wheels, I feel our relationship is only just beginning and I foresee us being together for a long time. I am occasionally tempted by newer, shinier, faster, and less temperamental bikes - but a thundering high-speed blast through a tight set of twisties on the 916 always cures my wanderlust. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI grew up in the Canadian Maritimes, spending my youth on a farm in New Brunswick before I moved to Montreal, Quebec in 2005 to pursue my desire to escape the simple life and earn my education in the big city. I had visions of the good life, of moving up in the world and becoming a cultured man enjoying the finer things. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEight years later I came to my senses and escaped a soul-crushing post in the luxury business to renew myself. I moved to Calgary, Alberta in 2014 with the hope of starting my life over (again) and finding some of the meaning that I had lost sight of while catering to the miserable elites of the world. I still haven\u0027t found it, but my travels have ignited a nascent wanderlust that has driven me to explore and examine the world with newfound enthusiasm. \u003cbr\u003e"
