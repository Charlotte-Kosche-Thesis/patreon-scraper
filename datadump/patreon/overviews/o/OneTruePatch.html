For years fans have been restricted to a small selection of patches or pre-made clothing items, usually bearing just the logo of the series, and we feel that a more personalized touch is needed to really show how you enjoy your media!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe company itself is a small start-up of self-managed and self-taught artisans operating out of their home. Our designs are made with passion and care, from sketch to stitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does \u0027OneTruePatch\u0027 mean?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\nThe name of our line comes from the phrase \u0027one true pairing\u0027 or OTP which is a common way for fans to refer to the relationship they appreciate the most in a story. Our patches are generally made facing one way or another so that fans can buy matching pairs that look at each other to represent their OTP. In the future, we will also be selling heart patches to fully express fans\u0027 intended meaning, including patches for OT3 for three-way relationships, plus patches to string together the perfect poly relationship and aro/ace colored hearts for clear understanding. OneTruePatch is about expressing your feelings at a glance and being able to proudly show off your OTP.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhat will my money contribute toward?\u003c/h1\u003eAt present, OneTruePatch is operated in the evenings and on weekends due to the members having other jobs that pay the bills during the normal Mon-Fri work week.\u00a0Our campaign runs as a per-design pledge to help make supporting us more worthwhile to you! We often go through dry spells of being too busy to release new designs, so a per-design pledge helps you earn more rewards comparable to the amount of work we put in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe funds themselves go toward compensation for time and effort put into drawing, vectoring, digitizing and testing new designs as well as the cost of subscription-based programs (namely Adobe Illustrator and StitchEra Universal) and materials for testing and prototyping. The retail price of the patches includes the materials used to make them and the time it took to stitch them out but fails to address the back-end costs at present as to keep them affordable. It also helps to cover lost materials in the case of a prototype or patch that fails to meet our standard for sale."
