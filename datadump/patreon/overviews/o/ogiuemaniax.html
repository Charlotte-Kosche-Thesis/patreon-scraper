I love the multitude of talented creators working to provide us exciting, terrifying, heartfelt, and even educational stories about the past, present, and what very well might come in the future. I love the interesting ideas that are explored by artists and fans alike. Perhaps more than anything, I love sharing my thoughts on Japanese popular media. It\u0027s why, back in November of 2007, I decided to start a blog. I named it \"\u003ca href=\"http://ogiuemaniax.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eOgiue Maniax\u003c/a\u003e,\" after my favorite character from the manga \u003cem\u003eGenshiken\u003c/em\u003e, which is about anime and manga fandom as a way of life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of you have likely never heard of Ogiue Maniax, though if you type \"Ogiue\" into Google it\u0027ll be the first thing that pops up. I\u0027ve written reviews of titles both popular and obscure, translated posts from Japanese anime fans and critics, analyzed visual and narrative trends in anime and manga. Not only that, but over these 7+ years I\u0027ve consistently made at least 2-3 blog posts per week, in rain or shine or anime convention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I\u0027ve continued with the the blog, I\u0027ve grown a small but loyal following. If you\u0027re \nalready an Ogiue Maniax reader, I can\u0027t thank you enough. If you\u0027re \nbrand new or have only come across it by happenstance, then I also \nappreciate you giving me your time. It\u0027s because of people like you that\n I\u0027ve pledged to never abandon Ogiue Maniax or let it grow stale. After \nall, writing it has been one of the best decisions I\u0027ve ever made. I \nwant to keep writing for the blog no matter what, though it becomes \nincreasingly difficult as I get older.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecome a Patron!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where \nyou can contribute, starting at only $1 a month. If you\u0027re interested, go straight to the bottom and take a look at the rewards you can get for sponsoring Ogiue Maniax.

This is one of the central questions of the film, and \u003cem\u003eThe Wind Rises \u003c/em\u003eanswers\n that this passion, as much as we might want to bottle it and isolate it\n from the world, is nevertheless still a part of it. Even the refusal to\n compromise ends up being a type of compromise in itself, and the film \nmakes this point clear not only through Jirou\u2019s profession but also his \npersonal life. Falling in love with a woman suffering from tuberculosis \nin a time when there was no cure, throughout the movie they make \nsacrifices between their immediate and future happiness. When ultimately\n they decide to live together despite knowing that this will shorten her\n lifespan, the parallel is clearly established that, whether it is at \nhome or in another country, Jirou\u2019s passion in a sense destroyed lives.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ogiuemaniax.wordpress.com/2011/09/23/explaining-decompression-in-comics/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eExplaining Decompression in Comics\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15,36,62);\"\u003eIf you were to go up to a manga author and say to them, \u201cYour manga \nwastes the vast majority of its space,\u201d they would probably look at you \nincredulously, because efficiency in page layout is actually very \nimportant for manga creators. If you then pointed to a Silver Age \nsuperhero comic as an example of brilliant economization of panels, they\n would probably react with still more disbelief, amazed at how much the \npage seems to be weighed down by its own contents. This is because the \nconcept of \u201cpanel efficiency\u201d is defined differently between the \nAmerican superhero comics tradition and Japanese comics tradition. The \ndifference can be summarized to some extent as the contrast between \nefficiency defined as the greatest amount of \u201cstuff\u201d packed into the \nsmallest amount of space possible and efficiency defined as a slick, \nstreamlined experience, but that doesn\u2019t quite tell the whole story.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ogiuemaniax.wordpress.com/2011/02/01/youre-magical-ojamajo-doremi/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYou\u0027re Magical: Ojamajo Doremi\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eOjamajo Doremi\u003c/em\u003e\u2018s is a message of positivity, but it is not so \nafraid to expose its viewers to some of the sadder, potentially more \nhurtful aspects of life to the point that it would pretend they do not \nexist. The problems that the girls help out with can range from rescuing\n a boy who fell into a hole to helping a girl come to terms with her own\n guilt over killing a pet. This also extends to the main characters \nthemselves, such as the fact that Aiko\u2019s mother walked out on their \nfamily. It\u2019s quite a sensitive topic for Aiko, but Aiko doesn\u2019t let it \nget her down, and it\u2019s this emphasis on enjoying life, bumps and all, \nthat also contributes to \u003cem\u003eOjamajo Doremi\u003c/em\u003e\u2018s success as a children\u2019s show that has much more substance than other anime like it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ogiuemaniax.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/evangelion-3-33-you-can-not-redo-as-response-criticism-and-renewal/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEvangelion 3.33: You Can (Not) Redo as Response, Criticism, and Renewal\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis clone Rei in the third film (although technically all of the Rei \nare clones) is a strikingly powerful presence, acting as a strong \nargument against the classic criticisms of Ayanami Rei and the \ncharacters she has inspired. Typically, Rei is seen as an almost \ndoll-like fetish object, an attractive girl with pale features and no \npersonality whom men can sexualize as the \u201cperfect\u201d passive woman \nentirely subject to their desires. Here, in \u003cem\u003eEvangelion 3.33\u003c/em\u003e, we\n get the truly subservient version of Rei, a character who is so passive\n she cannot even read a book without being ordered to do so, and the \ndisturbing nature of this iteration of the character actually highlights\n just how much characterization and personal will is present in the base\n character of Ayanami Rei. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s missing until it\u2019s \ngone,\u201d as the clich\u00e9 goes, and the fact that a truly doll-like Rei is so\n bizarre and alien underlines the fact that Rei is defined not by her \nloss of humanity but by her pursuit of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ogiuemaniax.wordpress.com/2014/10/21/why-battle-spirits-shounen-toppa-bashin-is-still-the-best-card-game-anime-ive-ever-seen/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWhy \"Battle Spirits: Shounen Toppa Bashin\" is Still the Best Card Game Anime I\u0027ve Ever Seen\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eThe obvious joke with TCG shows (thanks in part to \u003cem\u003eYu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series\u003c/em\u003e)\n is that whenever there\u2019s a deep emotional connection, it\u2019s usually in \nthe sense of friendship, that one\u2019s companions give the moral support \none needs to overcome any adversary. Though that also exists in \u003cem\u003eShounen Toppa Bashin \u003c/em\u003eto\n a strong extent (and is better developed compared to other series as \nwell), the situation between Toppa and Hayami is actually a moment where\n the show says that its own card game is meaningless if it means \nneglecting those close to you who are in need.
