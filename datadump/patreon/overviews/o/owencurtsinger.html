    "summary": "I\u0027m a comic artist and scientific\nillustrator living and working in\u003cstrong\u003e Fort Worth, Texas\u003c/strong\u003e. For most of my\ncomics career, I\u0027ve been combining research with\ngraphic storytelling to help make sense of some really interesting scientific research. I\u0027ve worked with a\nnarwhal biologist, neon sign artists, a flu virologist, and a marine\necologist. I believe that creating nonfiction graphic works can\neducate, inspire, and change the way we look at the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom 2008 \u2013 2013 I interned and\nwas a boardmember of the \u003cstrong\u003eZine Archive and Publishing Project\u003c/strong\u003e,\nor \u003cstrong\u003eZAPP\u003c/strong\u003e, which solidified my belief in zines and comics as an\neducational tool to empower and give voice and purpose to all people\nof all backgrounds and abilities. My educational background is in\n\u003cstrong\u003eCreative Writing\u003c/strong\u003e, but in 2016 I completed a \u003cstrong\u003eCertificate Program in\nNatural Science Illustration at the University of Washington\u003c/strong\u003e that\nopened me up to a new array of subject matter and mediums.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my comics and printed matter\nhave been self-published and sold in several Seattle-area bookstores,\nbut my work has also been published in Seattle Magazine and Quest, a\nquarterly journal of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeattle was a great place to become\ninterested in comics and self-publishing with a huge network of folks\ndoing really creative and experimental work. In the summer of 2017 I\nmoved from Seattle to Fort Worth. I\u0027ve been continuing\nto draw comics and illustrate the flora and fauna that I am\ndiscovering each and every day here, and if you like what I do and\ndecide to support me on Patreon, you\u0027ll have access to all of my\nTexas-based comics and nature sketching as I explore this new place.\nThese will be collected and self-published in late 2017/early 2018 as\nmy \u201c\u003cstrong\u003eTexas Comics Journal\u003c/strong\u003e.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also working on a couple of\nlong-term projects which your support will help fund. The first is a\ncomic about \u003cstrong\u003eKristian Birkeland\u003c/strong\u003e, the Norwegian astrophysicist who\nstudied the Northern Lights in the late 19th century and\nwho first proposed the idea of solar magnetism to explain why they\noccurred. I have been chipping away at this long-form comic with\nshort installments released over the past few years; your support\nwill give you access to see progress on this project as well as help\nfund the creation of the third and final culminating work. The second\nlong-term project is a\n\u003cstrong\u003echildren\u0027s picture book\u003c/strong\u003e that I\u0027m writing and illustrating about my\ndog, a blue heeler named Willie, who tells some tall tales about how\nhe lost his missing tail.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a believer in self-publishing and\nhaving a DIY ethos in most forms of self-expression, it\u0027s not in my\nnature to solicit help or contributions for ongoing projects. But\nhaving just moved to a new place and being away from many of my\nfriends, family, and followers, Patreon provides a unique way for\npeople around the world to keep up with the work that I\u0027m doing and\nbe able to show their support. I\u0027m not naively trying to quit my day\njob and make comics full-time (yet), but having a consistent flow of\nsupport through Patreon, however large or small, will provide me with\nan impetus to keep refining my passion and keep in touch with those\nwho follow my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your interest and support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a sample of what you\u0027ll find in my regular posts and sneak preview of \"Texas Comics Journal:\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/547912b7e4b05e2320d6ee93/t/59a88753f43b55f0179eaaa1/1504216922551/Green+Alleys+2.jpg?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
