    "summary": "Theatre is changing with the world around us. There will never be anything quite like the smell of a theatre, and the excitement you feel from a crowd before a show starts, but getting to experience quality theatre from the comfort of your own home is also an exhilarating idea! We have 3 kids, super busy lives, and dozens of friends who are in dozens of shows that we would love to see, but always miss because getting out of the house is not an easy thing to arrange. We want to support all of our theatre friends, we would go to every show if we could. This gave us the idea to begin a small space online carved out for exactly this. We want to be able to pull local, original theatre right into the interwebs and breathe into it the life it deserves. We want to make local shows and productions available to whoever will watch. Eventually we want to spread our idea large and far, hoping it will catch on in other cities with viewers who have similar dilemmas. We are going to produce our own content from home, while also promoting the content of other artists around the valley. Join us on our journey to bring theatre into the 21st Century.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Theatre has been evolving for centuries. Who knew that outside amphitheaters would eventually morph into air-conditioned state of the art, graphics-infused mega-shows? Going to see a musical is an amazing experience, but we have also grown fond of being able to enjoy entertainment in the comfort of our own homes. Netflix and Chill is a wildly more popular option on the regular than \"grab tickets, put on pants and drive to a show\". We want to cater to the future, and we believe the future is a combination of live online performances, YouTube accessible content, and community based and involved in-person shows. We want to revolutionize theatre and make it so much more accessible to everyone. Creating online content is still costly, which is why we created this Patreon, but it at least somewhat eliminates the initial overhead costs that a newer non-profit like ours might accrue. We don\u0027t want to have to charge people just for the roof over their heads while they enjoy a show. We want you to be able to give what you think our productions are worth, and feel like your money is going straight into production value. Every dollar goes directly into producing our next online show, or live Facebook performance.",
