    "summary": "Hi! Thanks for looking in, I am a queer, disabled artist, writer, and photographer living and working in Finland. Local bog cryptid works, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am almost entirely self-taught, the only art classes I\u0027ve ever taken are those in my regular schools, same goes for language and writing and those were in Swedish. I learned photography through observing my father and my own trial and error. I did also take sewing classes at school but we never covered cross-stitch. Everything I do I\u0027ve learned on my own and from the tips of other creators.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always had a love for fantasy but found myself disappointed at the lack of diversity in nearly all the books I grew up with. It\u0027s these feelings that drive most of my creative endeavours. My love for nature and animals drives most of my photography, but I do take pictures of people and man-made things, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had a need to make things since I was seven years old when I first started writing and while it took me a while to pick up the other things I do, I\u0027m happy that I have. I\u0027m always trying to move forward with my art and if you decide you want to support me on this journey you have my eternal gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImportant practical note:\u003c/strong\u003e From my research I\u0027ve only been able to find negative reviews on Patreon\u0027s screen-reader accessibility. I don\u0027t know if this is still the case, but I will be operating on the assumption that it is until corrected. I am very disappointed by this but will have to use the site regardless as it\u0027s the only one of its kind that I know of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a related note, if anything in my rewards is a problem for you accessibility wise contact me and we\u0027ll work out a suitable replacement.\u003cbr\u003e"
