Meshing the traditional advertising-supported publishing model of a curated and themed quarterly publication, it uses digital distribution and Print On Demand (POD) purchasing models to allow you, the reader, to be able to choose how you want to receive your content! By removing the boundaries to traditional printing and distribution and using \"just in time\" publishing, this represents a paradigm shift that provides content in the two major mediums that old school gamers like to receive it: digital and print.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1.wp.com/oldschoolquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Old-School-Quarterly-Patreon-Early-Access-Logo.png\" style=\"float: right; width: 137px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eThis Patreon campaign allows you to become a \"subscriber\" at a discounted rate, get extra content, and help get each and every issue of \u003cstrong\u003eOSQ\u003c/strong\u003e into the hands of other old school gamers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT EXACTLY DO YOU MEAN BY OLD SCHOOL GAMING?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor many people, \"old school gaming\" means something specific.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://oldschoolquarterly.com/2015/04/12/of-old-school-and-our-purpose/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWe have a very broad definition of what it means to us\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. In short, for us it means focusing on games that were designed between 1974 and the early \u002790s and that have a focus on the GM/Judge/Referee as the central authority on how players interact with the game world. This not only includes the original games that came out during that time, but also includes what could be called clones or simulacrums that attempt to create variants or revised versions and allow products to be continued to be developed for those. It includes products released in print and digital (PDF, web, ebook) formats, for a fee or released for free. Old school gaming also has a huge community focus, which is very active online on different web forums, websites, and social media platforms.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY A MAGAZINE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://oldschoolquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OSQ-More-Issue-Zero-Front-Page-1.png\" style=\"width: 171px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eOld school gaming has always had magazines, and there have always been publications that covered many different game as well as \"house organs\" (publications that support a specific company\u0027s products). The most famous of thee are obviously the print editions of \u003cem\u003eDragon\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eDungeon\u003c/em\u003e magazines, and \u003cem\u003eWhite Dwarf \u003c/em\u003emagazine, but there are many others including the recent \u003cem\u003eGygax Magazine\u003c/em\u003e that ceased publication this year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA magazine blends together content for a specific audience including content (articles, reviews, commentary) and advertising for a specific special interest area, providing utility as well as a snapshot of what the community involved in the subject is currently interested in. Magazines are a great way to get long-form well-thought out articles and new information and content, all in one place on a regular basis, created by a trusted team of editors and freelancers. While the Internet offers everyone a platform for publishing content, a magazine allows a focused vision to bring together ideas and content and present multiple times a year. It also allows an additional venue for new and established creators to publish additional work outside of their normal body of work, allowing them to flex their creative wings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1.wp.com/oldschoolquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OSQ-Issue-Zero-House-Rules-Sample-Page.png?w=825\" style=\"float: right; width: 136px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eOf course, there is also a massive zine movement in the old school community, although zines are not produced with the same design, content, and marketing approaches that magazines are. Apart from the differences in scale, zines tend to be highly focused to support a single or small number of products, while magazines tend to be much more umbrella-like, covering more products and having a different purpose, as well as being supported by advertiser-centric model that sees advertising as a integrated feature in the publication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://oldschoolquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/OSQ-Issue-Zero-The-Dakkan-Job-Adventure-Script.png\" style=\"float: left; width: 166px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003ePatreon allows us to offer the most modern and agile equivalent of a subscription approach without having to build in lots of administrative overhead.
