Our mission is the creation of a trauma-informed world: a world in which survivors of all types can expend our energy and resources on \u003cem\u003eliving\u003c/em\u003e rather than having to spend it on simply \u003cem\u003esurviving\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther Lives is founded on the belief that individual healing is just one part of the challenge facing survivors today. We also need to change our laws and our culture. We are therefore committed to principles of intersectionality and social justice. We seek to model, in our own lives, the changes that we need. We seek to act differently: we seek to live more in alignment with our vision and our mission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOurs is a community not just of radical intersectionality but also of radical vulnerability. You do not have to be radical yourself to participate with us, but we need you to know who we are. We need you to know that Other Lives is just another manifestation of the work we have been doing to heal ourselves and make change for others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther Lives is a place where it is safe for survivors to be heard.\u003cbr\u003eWhat happened to you is real.\u003cbr\u003eWe believe you.\u003cbr\u003eWe are here and we are not going anywhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat are the current ongoing projects of Other Lives?\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have multiple projects in the works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) An online forum for peer support and education. The forum is primarily for trauma survivors to talk amongst ourselves, but there are sections that exist specifically for loved ones who want to know how to help. Just as our loved ones need us to survive, we also need you to understand what we are going through and get support for yourselves while you witness our struggle. The forum has been launched, and you can find it at \u003ca href=\"https://forum.otherlives.org/\"\u003eforum.otherlives.org\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e2) A resource list for trauma survivors, vetted both by experts in the medical community and by actual trauma survivors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA more ambitious goal is to create a mobile app that lists trauma programs, treatment centers, help lines, emergency shelters, and other advocacy orgs by location, insurance type, exclusion/inclusion criteria, and specialty. The issues that result from our injuries leave some of us struggling with employment, housing, and legal trouble. We want to create the list that many of us have needed in the past and that we still might need in the future. In this unprecedentedly connected world we live in, every single one of us should be able to go online and easily find the nearest source of help, along with practical how-to guides, written by other survivors, about the reality of navigating those bureaucracies when you are least capable of thinking clearly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) Continuing to develop the Other Lives website which contains, among everything else listed here, a blog with personal writing and a blog that publishes survivors\u0027 stories. Our writing can have great power as a tool for advocacy, community-building, and self-therapy.\u003cu\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cimg height=\"582\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_SSXO2n0Qms9tzq9YeG3OGTtEeN2ke394DsPq_PIp5dv_piSEF7DoAZmggsSEWVsjlB8zHyk8F-GMSvutQ5quXOCNrxqx4NW1tge8OkPZhPcA8VQfm93GvVuhYMB5hwDXDRpZtb8\" width=\"438\"\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur Most Immediate Project: A Very, Very Long Walk\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to more fully explore the differences between surviving and living, Other Lives is funding an experimental project in which our founder, Joseph King, is undertaking a marathon hike during which he will participate in our advocacy campaign from the paths that make up the Eastern Continental Trail.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike many trauma survivors with Complex PTSD (C-PTSD), including others on our staff, Joe is too disabled to work a full-time conventional job, and the process of coming to terms with this is part of his personal impulse to begin this journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Eastern Continental Trail (ECT) is a 5400 mile patchwork of seven or eight trails and road walks that begins in Key West, includes the entire Appalachian Trail in the middle and stretches from Key West to the northern tip of Belle Isle, Newfoundland, 2km from the only authenticated Norse Viking site in North America. Only a handful of people have ever thru-hiked the entire thing, and even some of them stopped in Quebec. A northbound thru-hike, meaning the trail is completed in a single year, requires leaving Key West in January and keeping a rigorous pace in order to finish before the weather shuts it down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoe will be meeting with interest groups - disability groups, veteran groups, accessibility groups, hiking groups - along the way. He will be inviting others to walk along with him, to literally mobilize our community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere are many ways to support this project, including the Patreon tiers described here, but right now the most simple, direct, and immediately necessary is to sponsor a piece of gear. If you pay for it, you get to name it and Joe will refer to it by name in videos and audio he creates along the way! Other Lives\u2019 only rule is that the name not be scatalogical or otherwise offensive. (Inside jokes are fine as long as they meet the above guidelines.) If you are interested, please Paypal the amount via the link above as \u201cfriends and family\u201d along with a note stating what you would like to pay for, what you would like to name the item, and the name you would like to be credited under.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGear list: \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dYMaGJTK4mgZQlZ3m3jvwf3sohzf9yPSRGEY6Bc8r1o/edit?usp=sharing\"\u003eJoe\u0027s ECT 2018 Gear List\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaypal link: \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/jking443\"\u003eJoe\u0027s PayPal\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoe\u2019s personal perspective is available here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@otherlives/a-substitute-for-pistol-and-ball-why-i-am-walking-5400-miles-for-complex-trauma-survivors-63913e3b5fb4\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/@otherlives/a-substitute-for-p...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"960\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/btga4Go5QcskTBuod74grYKOzcZYJI8D9OOkmZ0SsNqHP2l0PA2iUEGZQY9YsAjbvf1yls6_Ml98hj5NJ8I0wH6zyTk72RhV1bu1tTWm92IUMlNzL7G7uYMPW8UnqXZktys4jSUQ\" width=\"540\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhy are we asking for help?\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need your help because maintaining the websites, launching these resources, and funding this experimental advocacy campaign, all represent significant expenses for an advocacy organization.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the time the organization has existed, our small staff has worked entirely on a volunteer basis, and we have all taken personal expenses. Your money will initially fund our current projects and pay back the expenses we have already incurred.

We invite you to be a part of this journey with us. Initially, this will primarily mean access to information about the pilgrimage and our other limited-time projects. As time goes on, we will add other projects to which you will get additional access. The current tiers reflect access to the pilgrimage, but further access to Other Lives projects will be similar if your support continues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe look forward to walking with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove and solidarity,\u003cbr\u003eThe staff at Other Lives\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

This will include reimbursement those three staff members for initial expenses paid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny excess from these goals will go toward financing new goals for the organization. Your money will always go directly to benefit work for trauma survivors.",
