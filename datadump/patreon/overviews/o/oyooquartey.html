I am a life \u0026amp; style blogger, YouTuber and a digital content creator from Ghana and I have been doing this for close to 7 years now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany people thought I was crazy to be waking up at dawn to write on my blog\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.naaoyooquartey.com\"\u003eNaaOyooQuartey.com\u003c/a\u003e about things I cared about which included; my love for food and recipe development, fashion, my passion in sharing other people\u0027s life stories, creating videos of best places to eat when in Ghana, sharing pieces of history surrounding our lifestyle as Ghanaians which needs to be documented digitally. But thanks to being crazy, my blog won a few awards as Best Lifestyle Blog in Ghana and Best\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.africanbloggerawards.com/2016-winners/\"\u003eLifestyle Blog in Africa\u003c/a\u003e . I started a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.seemychow.com\"\u003efood blog\u003c/a\u003e in 2016 to create more conversations around African food and developing new recipes using homegrown local ingredients.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhat Am I Creating?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI am insanely passionate about sharing our lost and almost forgotten lifestyle history as Ghanaians, telling the untold stories of families in Ghana who have sustained their small food businesses over time whilst using traditional methods of cooking, creating \u0026amp; developing modern cuisine recipes using our local ingredients and featuring everyday people who have incredible life inspo stories to tell. My feature of one such family got the business viral in no time. The business owner couldn\u0027t be thankful enough for the exposure. You can read that story here .\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI create \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYouTube Lifestyle videos\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e to show the world what Ghana offers with respect to food, music, fashion and more food.

I stuck to my guns and continued like nothing happened. I still continue to go beyond myself to go places, interview people, create new recipes etc all with a singular purpose of telling untold stories. All this is being self-financed but it\u0027s not easy. Not easy at all. \u00a0I work with a photographer and sometimes hire an intern from the local university to team up on creating content. I believe it\u0027s also a way of giving back to my community by collaborating and mentoring upcoming bloggers in Ghana. I am working hard on creating more video content which will require investing in good video equipment from lights to reflectors and tripods. One of my dreams is to travel Africa to see more of my continent and share the different cultural experiences of our land.\u00a0It\u0027s not easy also being a female content creator in Ghana. Sometimes brands want to work with you but are however reluctant in paying for content I create \ud83d\ude10. It\u0027s either they laugh at my message that I have a quotation for content creation or they ask for \u0027free\u0027 package. This is a dire challenge which can be discouraging at times. But trudge on I must \ud83d\ude0e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have refrained from placing ads on my blog for the longest of time as I have always believed in keeping my readers focused on the content and not to be distracted by flashing and over-colourful ads.\u00a0I would appreciate your smallest donation and more as I believe it adds towards a greater good. \u00a0Sadly, I can\u0027t escape adulthood, there are bills to pay \ud83d\ude29, journeys to be taken and live\u0027s to be impacted. This is your opportunity to get exclusive access to content created exclusively for my patrons way before anybody else sees \u00a0it anywhere. Join my exclusive community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs that all?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes \ud83d\ude00 Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
