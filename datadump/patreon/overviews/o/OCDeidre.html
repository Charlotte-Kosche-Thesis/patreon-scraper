    "summary": "When I started this channel, I wanted to share my love for all things video games.  I wanted to build a community of gamers, who shared the same passion that I have for games.  I am a small channel, but my love for this channel is not.  We are a small but strong community and I am grateful for everyone who has ever watched a video, liked or left a comment.  I love playing games on the channel, producing analysis videos of games, reaction videos, a monthly gaming news show and my favorite, my fan trailer tribute videos!  I upload about 4 to 5 videos a week.  (Sometimes more!)  I am a huge fan of single player, story driven games.  Some of my favorite games are \u003cstrong\u003eThe Last of\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eUs\u003c/strong\u003e and the \u003cstrong\u003eUncharted\u003c/strong\u003e series.  I am also a huge fan of Double Fine.  Some of the games I\u2019m most excited to play in 2018 is \u003cstrong\u003eDays Gone, Red Dead Redemption 2, God of War, Detroit Become Human and Spider Man!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never started this channel to make money.  I am so passionate about gaming and had to share the love!  But unfortunately, YouTube has flagged my channel and a majority of my videos as \u201cnot suitable for advertisers\u201d.  So I need to come to you for help.  I am really looking for a little help so I can pay for all of the games that I play on the channel, and to upgrade my bare minimum set up.  I put so much love into my videos, and it makes me so happy when I get such positive feedback from you!  So I want to thank you so much for any and all help you can give to me.  This truly is my passion, and I want to keep creating my own content, without worrying about being flagged all of the time.  If you can\u2019t help out, no worries!  I will still keep uploading my videos as usual.  Thank you all so much for just watching my videos, it really means the world to me!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThanks for watching, and I will be back with more! \u003cbr\u003e"
