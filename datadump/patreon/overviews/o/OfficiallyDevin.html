From filming, to writing, to editing, narrative let\u0027s plays are \nsignificantly harder to make than the traditional LP format, but as far \nas I\u0027m concerned it\u0027s all worth it for the much increased quality -  I \nhope my viewers agree!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy contributing to the channel you\u0027ll be feeding my amateur profession as a writer, commentator, editor, and all the other juicy bits of being a YouTube creator. I make videos full(ish) time to get as much quality stuff out there as possible, and really that\u0027s only happening thanks to the support of my existing patrons and the goodwill of supporters like yourself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut there\u0027s still a long way to go until the channel reaches \u0027break even\u0027 point financially, so if you\u0027ve found yourself thoroughly entertained by some Offy-D works, it would be truly magical to have you back the channel as a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b50c7e_85542c3d1d1148fa9090e94ac895bb90%7Emv2.jpg?dn=NTTracks.jpg\" style=\"width: 615px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll that said, remember that all videos will always be free to watch as far as I\u0027m concerned, so all financial support is purely optional. And of course, it\u0027s no problem to donate once and leave, or generally stop your support if you feel it is no longer warranted / you are no longer able to provide it. Even if I have to stop being full-time due to running out of dough, I\u0027ll still put in as many shifts down the content-mine as I can to keep the channel going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly other thing to mention is that you can check out a page on my website for more details on my Patreon campaign and the rewards: \u003ca href=\"http://officiallydevin.wixsite.com/devin/support\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDevin\u0027s Support Page\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for stopping by and reading, and whether you become a patron or not, I am grateful for your continued viewership and support! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b50c7e_db1e0d5b3b504fa596aca50096a33a77%7Emv2.jpg?dn=17834039_10158536367315029_6561632302130867208_o_edited.jpg\" style=\"width: 446px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the channel:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn my channel I produce Narrative Let\u0027s Plays, a new take on LPing where I use a combination of editing and insertion of original content to turn game-play footage into a piece of entertainment, adding value to the experience of playing the game. These days I also do more a few traditional LP videos on the side , but this Patreon page isn\u0027t really about that - the narrative, effort-requiring videos are what I hope people will donate for, and what I am most interesting in producing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b50c7e_968de8a050b646a89fa6c79f6b058187%7Emv2.jpg?dn=2016+Setup.jpg\" style=\"width: 673px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
