During school I worked and after I graduated I dived deep to find gigs, anything I could get my hands on. I\u0027ve been apart of a slew of shorts, a few commercials and I associate produced my friends feature film! However it has become increasingly difficult to make/produce content, especially as an independent creator. The last thing I directed was \u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/21Gz6vU).\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFallout, My Thesis Film\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0After I made that movie, as much as I love that film I knew I could do better and I needed to become better, I had to foster my craft. So I dug deeper into the indie scene. For a while I hustled and in the back of my mind, I had an ever growing itch to make new work. I met many amazing filmmakers and folks in the industry that gave me their time and without them I would not have the skills I attained.\u00a0So after much thought, I decided to launch a page here at Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If you liked my first film and would like to see more stuff from me with more support behind it and some proper pre-production, then with your donations I will be able to create solid new pieces of work. Not just films and sketches but also photography runs, behind the scenes and special bonus stuff here exclusively. Your contributions will go into gear, equipment, festival fees, paying crew members, actors, and the myriad of other things that pop up making films and sketches! You can also donate to my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://paypal.me/orangejacinto/5\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePayPal\u003c/a\u003e if you can\u0027t contribute monthly. I truly appreciate your support!"
