Our goal was to deliver a show that reported on the news about the game, provided in-depth analysis, and included meaningful discussion between the regular hosts (Chill and Teo) and a rotating panel of guests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe we have achieved that, with a show that has grown in popularity over the intervening years. This campaign is a way to provide funding to maintain the show\u0027s audio quality and production values, maintenance costs and other expenses. If we can raise enough, we will attempt to send a representative to SWTOR-related events. We\u0027ve resisted the urge to include in-program advertising, and would prefer to avoid that if at all possible!\u003cbr\u003e"
