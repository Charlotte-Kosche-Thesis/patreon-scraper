Here you will find\u00a0 guest interviews from interesting local people. In addition to their unfiltered viewpoints, they are smart, witty, and filled with Midwestern charm. Be prepared because any topic can send them off the rails.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTom graduated summa cum laud with his bachelor\u2019s degree in \nneuropsychology, and has a background in physical therapy. With his \nmedical knowledge and sharp wits he makes a great addition to the \nuniverse. In the past, he has been a president of an honor society, a \nsemi pro soccer player, and a state champion armwrestler. If he was on a\n star trek landing party, he would definitely not be wearing a red \nshirt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMark is a 85 year old man stuck in the body of a millennial. He enjoys \ndrinking Brandy Old Fashioneds and shaking his fists in rage at the \nneighborhood children. His resume includes third string High school \nFootball, an esoteric college degree and the dream jobs of an 8 year \nold: Movie theaters, Video game stores, and a Pizza restaurant. Sorry \nladies but this one is taken, Mark now spends his days as a stay at home\n Dad/trophy husband.\u003cbr\u003e"
