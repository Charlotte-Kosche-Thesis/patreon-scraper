    "summary": "O2 is an adventure travel magazine produced in Eugene, Oregon. We began as the brainchild of our Editor-In-Chief, Kyle Hentschel, who believed that a small group of dedicated peers could create a different kind of student publication, one that went beyond a classroom assignment and truly tapped into the culture of athleticism, exploration and tomfoolery that is our happy place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the beginning, we had no idea what we were doing. We wanted to make something beautiful, attract sponsors and build our voice. Now our sixth issue is in the works, and we\u2019ve established a growing network of readers, benefactors and contributors who share our love for fresh air and adventure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re endlessly grateful for all of the support and constant excitement that\u2019s allowed for such rapid gains. So, in response to all of your requests, we\u2019re finally giving readers a way to subscribe to O2. Whether you miss a (rockin\u2019) launch party, don\u2019t live in Eugene, or simply want to support us, this is the perfect way to make sure you never miss out on your copy of the latest O2. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour subscription allows us to keep producing great content, trying new things and spreading O2 to more people and places. Whether you\u2019re donating a dollar or fully subscribing for the magazine and O2 gear, you\u2019re a part of this project\u2014and that\u2019s pretty rad. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eO2 is produced quarterly, and our Patreons can expect to billed once every 3 to 4 months. Expect to receive your rewards around a month later.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more ways to get involved, visit\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.oregonoutdoormag.com/\"\u003eour website\u003c/a\u003e.
