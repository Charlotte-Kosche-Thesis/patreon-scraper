Shooter games specifically sparked my interest, as all of the stress and anxiety that I had from school when I was young would totally disappear when I hopped on my Xbox to play some Halo 2.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideogames separated and protected me from going down paths that I\u0027m proud I never took. A lot of my past friends got into heavy drug use, bad relationships,\u00a0and bad habits overall, and although my parents thought of videogames as a distraction from schoolwork, they never knew that if I had stopped playing videogames, I would\u0027ve never found the communities and friends that I still have today, and my life probably would\u0027ve been a lot worse without them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI finished highschool wanting to show people who don\u0027t play videogames just how magical they are. You can get immersed in totally different universes when you first login to your first game, whether it be an RPG like Skyrim, a fast-paced FPS like Battlefield, or a military-sandbox title like ArmA.\u00a0These are places that real people can live, communicate, and even compete through, bringing the player to diverse locations and settings that they won\u0027t ever experience in real life. I wanted to show the viewer how much videogames can excite, teach, and heal people who are having a rough time in life, and just how much they helped me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i37.servimg.com/u/f37/19/28/20/02/dsada10.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an 20 year old content creator on YouTube. I\u0027ve had such a passion for content creation that I finished highschool dreaming that I could create a successful channel on YouTube and one day create videos that might just entertain a viewer or two :D \u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eSO, WHAT CAN I DO TO SUPPORT?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eA very special few have asked me a method of supporting me even more than merely watching my videos, and usually i\u0027ve said \"share this vid with your mum I bet she loves ArmA!\" but some have asked for even more, of which i am very appreciative, so I created this Patreon page. Patreon allows you to \u003cstrong\u003epay as much as you want when you want\u003c/strong\u003e, or you can choose the presets that it has available to get some shiny roles in our Discord.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i11.servimg.com/u/f11/19/28/20/02/aaqaaa10.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eSO, WHERE WILL MY MONEY GO?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eAs of 8/15/17, 85% of the support I\u0027ve received from patreon (and Twitch.tv support) has gone towards new equipment, such as my microphone, cameras for future projects, licensing for software, buying the games that you see in my videos, etc. The other 15% goes towards teamspeak server that we utilize for ArmA videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of 5/18/18, 100% of the support I\u0027ve received through patreon goes directly into new equipment and software. Recently, equipment/software purchased using Patreon support has been:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSony A7S 2 Camera (It can record color nightvision, I\u0027m using it for airsoft videos)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdobe Premiere Pro CC (My editing software)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGopro Equipment (Replacement batteries, MicroSD cards)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEpidemic Sound Licenses (Licenses for the songs i use in my videos)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSteinberg UR22 (USB Audio Interface for Microphone)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd maybe a few of those $ went to breakfast tacos but I love tacos so shhh\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
