    "summary": "Hiiii! You\u0027re here! Just considering supporting this already makes you a baller.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u0027ve wanted to create something to explore and celebrate Ologies of all kinds for...probably over a decade. This is an idea and a project that gives me butterflies every time I work on it, and I\u0027m cheesily thrilled to share it with you. Ologies the podcast gives a voice to the folks in lab coats or sweating through field work or hunkered down over data and asks \"WHAT IS YOUR DEAL.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLearn about what drives these ologists, why they love what they do, how they stumbled onto their careers and take away facts about topics through the lens of the people who love it. And through my own slack-jawed wonder. Also: it\u0027s nice to finally hear the dirty side of science: swear words are left in, weird stories, the dark parts. Because learning shouldn\u0027t stop when you leave a classroom.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a very candid look at how the show gets made, please enjoy this pajama-clad make-upless video. I spend about 30 hours per week recording, researching, writing, doing social media, finding ologists, etc. because this idea -- and you all -- \u00a0deserve a good podcast. I hope you like it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU. YOUR SUPPORT \u0026amp; ENTHUSIASM MAKES ME SENTIMENTAL OKAY.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/234944091\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Sound engineers are not cheap and this podcast has about 300 little edits an episode, which I was doing all myself. I\u0027ve begun to sleep/bathe more by hiring someone to help with production, but they undercharge me because they know my budget, so I\u0027d love to pay them what they deserve. Also: better sound for you! Also I make about $0/hour myself because I\u0027m still paying back start-up costs, so keeping some money for the work I do to make the show would be great.\u00a0",
