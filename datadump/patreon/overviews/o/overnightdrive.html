    "summary": "I always find it so off putting when you listen to a podcast that is in it\u0027s third episode and the host is going on and on about how \"the show has to sustain itself\", in some kind of passive aggressive veiled threat. Go to hell, dickhead. Enjoy doing what you do or go find something else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA podcast is not expensive to run. That\u0027s why literally everybody has one. The barrier to entry is insanely low. We are on year four of Overnight Drive and I sincerely doubt that either of us are in this over $1000. It\u0027s effort heavy and cash cheap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what we\u0027re both starting to learn is that running a podcast and growing a podcast are not the same thing. We get offers to do live shows somewhat often, have some interesting pitches that come through, and larger ideas that we\u0027d like to make real. But more often than not I wind up passing on them just due to the fact that our system is a bit of a mess. People extending us these offers are forced to take on the bulk of the risk and that\u0027s hard to justify when your entire playbook is \"let\u0027s go up and wing it.\" We appreciate the hell out of everything that is extended to us, but it never feels like we can add the value that we want. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe traditional antidote to this is to sell advertising. I see the benefit on paper. More stakeholders means more accountability and greater means to grow. But the problem here is basic. Advertising sucks. It sucks to do, it sucks to listen to people do it. Nearly everything moving backwards on the web can be traced back to advertising. The people who create it and perpetuate it suck. It\u0027s manipulative and ruins art and confuses creators as to where their time is best spent. Is there any part of you that honestly thinks that I would ever have a stake in what kind of online shop platform you use? Would that ever be a genuine moment of insight in our podcast?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s naive of me to say that I will never be in a position where I have to use a traditional advertising model. Life is long and I\u0027ve got a lot of things I want to do. But it\u0027s easy for me to say that we will not be taking ad money on Overnight Drive. It\u0027s just not going to be a thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo as our options are narrowed considerably by having adult brains and consciences, we were left with crowdfunding. Again, good on paper but the model largely didn\u0027t fit our output.\u00a0As I started to explore the idea of user support, I came to three non-negotiables for any platform I would feel comfortable using.\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eBe unintrusive - Reading on-air ads seems to be the most undignified act in podcasting today and creates a shitty experience for the listener. The appropriate platform would have no editorial impact.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBe reasonable - Other platforms would either require listeners to pay $10 or $20 a month, or offer a tiered model, which is some draconian shit. We don\u0027t podcast to hedge fund managers and it\u0027s hostile to pretend that $10 to me means the same thing to you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBe accountable - While it would ideally improve our workflow, it couldn\u0027t jeopardize our content by imposing a strict timeline or punish supporters by inducing a variable into the support value. In plain English: we don\u0027t want bosses but we don\u0027t want to fuck you out of money if we miss a week from time to time.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eNo crowdfunding platforms managed to meet all three of these requirements until Patreon allowed for a per-episode subscription as opposed to a per-month. I don\u0027t know if this is a new thing, or if they have always offered it and I\u0027m just dumb as shit and can\u0027t read. In any event, it meets our list of demands. So our ideal model is very simple: a suggested patronage of $1 per episode. Ideally four episodes per month (never more than five). You can give more than that if you like, you can give nothing at all. Entirely up to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the podcast becomes self sufficient and hopefully beyond, we can start to work towards some of the loftier goals that have been outside our reach\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eImproving our equipment \u0026amp; upgrading our bandwidth for Skype interviews, group episodes, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreating a more centralized site for people to go for our latest episodes \u0026amp; other news rather than always trying to keep five different social media accounts up to date\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaintaining a full archive and other weird projects like \"The Thing\"\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore live shows and the possibility of touring\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eQuicker turnaround on merchandise fulfillment\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFinally get that weird intern we\u0027ve been searching for\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s the bottom line. We aren\u0027t going to stop Overnight Drive. It keeps us happy and sane. We aren\u0027t going to hold our listeners hostage and waste your time pretending that we prefer one web hosting platform or underwear company over another. We aren\u0027t going to upsell you on some pay-only episode bullshit. That\u0027s all very gauche and outdated. This podcast will continue on for free regardless of support, perhaps until one of our deaths. Time will tell on that. If the projects above are something you want to see happen, jumping into the donation pool would be a very cool move and we would super appreciate it. Over the next few days and weeks we\u0027ll have some bonuses to offer and some non-episode content for our backers coming down the pipeline as a thank you, so check back often and thanks for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTell your weird friend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Andrew, 3/24/17\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
