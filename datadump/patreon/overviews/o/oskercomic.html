He keeps to himself in a small village on the outskirts of his society, where he makes a living exploring dangerous terrain to collect mushrooms for local shamans. This changes when he makes an unlikely ally and some monstrous enemies. He will discover what he is truly made of when dire circumstances push him to his limits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe comic has been online since September 2015. With my current schedule I will be able to post up to four pages a month. I will notify patrons of any extra pages or bonus material before they are posted.
