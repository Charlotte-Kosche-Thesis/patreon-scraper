I can focus more on my channel and not have to pick up shifts at work. The money would allow for higher quality video and also an increase in content along with more variety. I would love to focus more on my channel and content and all patrons would help in making this hobby more of a part time job! Thanks for stopping by my page :D\u003cbr\u003e"
