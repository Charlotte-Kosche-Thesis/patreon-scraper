    "summary": "OneTogether is a community of\nlike-minded people using a podcast format to provide a safe place where we\nshare real stories about a variety of topics and issues. It is a place where we come together to listen, to share, or to ask questions\nfree of judgement or ridicule. We come together as one, but each on our own\ntime when it\u0027s convenient for us. You can contribute a story (anonymously or\nnot), reflect on another\u0027s story or just listen. This allows us to communicate on a deeper level, but doesn\u0027t take time away from your busy schedule.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out my first episode to see if this podcast might add value to your life or if you might be able to help add value to the lives of others. You can email me through my website at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://onetogether.world\"\u003eonetogether.world\u003c/a\u003e to respond to a story you have heard or offer insight that might be helpful others listening. You could submit your own story for the podcast - or just listen. I provide a safe place for listeners to share because I ensure the community will keep it respectful. The goal is to share and connect with one another, not to ridicule or criticize. Everything goes through me so I can weed out the insincere jerks who troll the internet judging others. I will never share anything hurtful or rude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will start by sharing stories from my own life: mistakes, failures, trials and triumphs...with the hope of inspiring others or at least entertaining them. Some stories are funny. Some are sad, and everywhere in between. If you would like to contribute for the time it takes me to process the episodes and or help pay for the website services I would be grateful, but I am doing this because it brings me joy to help others. I am not trying to get rich or famous. I only used my picture here because I am not trying to get name recognition. I\u0027m not sure where this podcast will go. But, I do hope these stories inspire you, make you laugh, cry, or ponder. I hope that you will find value in having a safe place to share or help others. Even if just one person benefits from knowing they are not alone and they are part of a community that cares, it will be worth it to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTO THE WORLD YOU MAY BE ONE PERSON; BUT TO ONE PERSON YOU MAY BE THE WORLD. --Dr. Seuss\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNamaste.\u003cbr\u003e"
