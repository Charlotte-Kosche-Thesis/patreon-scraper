We are Janey and Glenn and\nwe\u2019re passionate about doing our best for the planet and sharing our journey\nwith others.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJaney: \u201cMother\nNature has always been my best friend. She sustains me on every level \u2013\nphysical, emotional, spiritual, intellectual \u2013 and is my greatest teacher, as\nwell as my playground. I\u2019ve lead expeditions into wild corners of our planet;\nsailed her oceans; slept under her stars and shared her beauty with many\nfeathery, furry, scaly and watery friends. I\u2019ve articulated my experiences in\nwords, pictures and maps, creating newsletters, writing articles and drawing\nmaps, (yes! I trained as a cartographer in the 1980s). Variety has always been\nimportant to me and as such I\u2019ve done some amazing jobs: safari hostess, Royal\nGeographical Society research assistant, Operation Raleigh International\nCo-ordinator, Out of Parliament Secretary for a New Zealand Green Party MP,\nTESL teacher. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy crazy paving path\nin life had to satisfy 3 important ingredients \u2013 fulfilment, happiness and\nservice to a greater good. I\u2019m adaptable and insatiably curious with a boundless\nenthusiasm for life and learning.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGlenn: \u201cI fell in\nlove with the Ocean at age 5 when I watched a Jacques Cousteau film about\nsharks. The Ocean has been my passion ever since and has been my \u201coffice\u201d for\n30 years. I\u2019ve worked as a professional diver and commercial skipper. I\u2019ve\nstudied Ocean ecology and worked as a marine naturalist. She enticed me to sail\nbeyond the blue horizon.She inspired me to become a cameraman so I\ncould record her diverse beauty, and a writer so I could describe her many\nmoods and primal power. As\nan Ocean ecologist, the scientific understanding of how the Ocean works as a\ncomplex system fascinates me, but as a practitioner of Deep Ecology, I\u2019m filled\nwith profound reverence for the intrinsic beauty and powerful life force that\nis the soul of the Ocean. Our very existence depends on a healthy Ocean. I\ncan\u2019t think of a better reason to celebrate, or a greater motivation to act.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur home base is currently on the Tutukaka\ncoast in Northland, New Zealand, with a spectacular view of the Pacific Ocean. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nHow did\nOcean Spirit come into being? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOcean Spirit came\ninto being through our shared passion for the Ocean. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe met in Tonga in\n2008 when Janey, as a founding trustee of OceansWatch, went to Glenn\u2019s diving\nand whale watching base in the Ha\u2019apai Islands for Reef Check training. On\nreturning to New Zealand Glenn invited Janey to sail back to Ha\u2019apai with him\non his 38ft Polynesian style Wharram catamaran, \u003cem\u003eCatKnapp\u003c/em\u003e.\nBeing a sailor, impulsive and loving adventure she leapt at the chance. The\nnext three years were spent taking people out on \u003cem\u003eCatKnapp \u003c/em\u003eto be with the\nhumpback whales during their tropical breeding months.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipMt5WVZzOITw8Wj5BpZJyiXkAleRnc_ZdQY6AnI\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nBecoming\nincreasingly dissatisfied with the limitations of the \u2018tick and click\u2019\nmentality, we began searching for deeper meaning in our lives and in 2011 were\nled to Schumacher College. Glenn gained his MSc in Holistic Science and Janey\nworked on their Short Course Programme - one year turned into four, and after a\nrich and deeply transformative time, we returned to New Zealand ready for Ocean\nSpirit to emerge. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat is\nOcean Spirit? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOcean Spirit is the\n\u2018vessel\u2019 to hold and nurture our passion for living in harmony with this big,\nbeautiful blue planet we call home and as a way of sharing, not only our own\njourney, but also those of the amazing and inspiring people we come across on\nour travels.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe media happily\nfeeds us a diet of bad news, while good or positive news takes 2nd place or\ngets ignored completely, making us feel disempowered and discouraged. Our focus\nwith Ocean Spirit is not only highlighting the beauty and magic of life, but\nalso exploring some of the many issues threatening the very web of life from\nthe perspective of \u201cWhat can we do about it?\u201d Our intention is to inspire and encourage\npositive action. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe see the\nOcean Spirit journey as a co-creative one with you. We intend that this shared\njourney will evoke a sense of wonder, awe and connection. We hope to ignite in\nyou a deep desire to plunge below the superficial, to dance on that exciting\nedge where we open ourselves to new possibilities, ways of seeing and being.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are convinced that for greater harmony between all life on\nEarth to become a reality, there is an urgent need to move away from the\ncurrent anthropocentric perspective to an \u003cem\u003eeco-centric \u003c/em\u003eview point, in\nwhich all life has intrinsic value beyond what it offers humankind. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo be effective and encouraged in this vital work, we all need\nto feel supported. We would like Ocean Spirit to be instrumental in bringing\ntogether like-minded people and organisations to create a network of support,\nidea-sharing, actions and commitment to a healthy, harmonious planet. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat we are currently doing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are\ncurrently involved in a variety of projects and initiatives including:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTutukaka Coast Plastic Free Initiative (\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/AWc9qpeLwVk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echeck out this intro video\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eJust Pick It Up (yep you guessed it: just picking\nup plastic and rubbish wherever and whenever)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003ePresentations and talks (see an example here)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eArticles and publications including three books:\nThe Ocean is Alive (2016, see Amazon reviews\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ocean-Alive-Re-visioning-Relationship-Living-ebook/dp/B01EA3BR5O/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1496009406\u0026amp;sr=8-7\u0026amp;keywords=ocean+conservation\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ocean-Alive-Re-visioning-Relationship-Living/dp/0473352605/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1496009235\u0026amp;sr=8-2\u0026amp;keywords=the+ocean+is+alive\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e), Humpback Whales of the South West Pacific (2010),\nPoor Knights Wonderland (2001)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eTeaching and tutoring about Ocean ecology and Gaia\ntheory\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eDeveloping the Reef Guardian program in support of\ncommunity monitoring of marine ecosystems.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eProducing informative\nand educational videos, connecting people and their stories (see some examples\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/-U5V0Qt57hE\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e here\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/tplGfqZLpKM\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/LCWVklAsyJY\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e).  \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhy we are on Patreon.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBeing supported by Patrons offers us the gift of Time to devote to the projects we are passionate about.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt gives\nus Freedom \u2013 the freedom to say \u201cyes\u201d to new projects and challenges as they\nare presented to us.
