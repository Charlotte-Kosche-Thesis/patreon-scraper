During my 10 years of slowly adventuring around the world, there has been one constant: the calling of the ocean. In, at or near the sea I\u2019m the best version of myself.

I may not have a boat or a budget (yet), what I do have is a creative mind, an urge to explore, stories to tell and a determination to make a difference in the world for our ocean. And a smile! This brings me far. Not far enough. My dream is to sail around the world making maximum impact to save the seas and get as many people involved as possible! How exactly the boat building will unfold is a mystery and marathon and lots to figure out. What is for sure, is that the journey itself is pretty exciting too! I love to bring the stories out, document the journey, and connect others to the ocean. Patrons, aka Very Important Pirates, enable me to do that!\u00a0 In February 2018 I\u0027ll launch the first episode and will publish maximum 1 video every two weeks untill I have the resources to produce more.

And combine that with new technologies which will help to make a bigger impact for a better planet.

There is no time to look away any more. The ocean gets emptied, trashed, polluted and acid because of us. Shark population are being wiped out. Tuna is being eaten like there is no tomorrow. And we have 1,5 million extra people on the planet per week. It\u2019s just not sustainable. I cannot force people to change. But I can encourage, inspire, and inform. Hopefully that broadens some horizons and trigger you for adventure and positive change.
