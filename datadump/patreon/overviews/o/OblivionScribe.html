    "summary": "I\u0027m a transmale freelance artist and fledgling comic creator. My interests lie in homoerotic art (both fanart and original)\u00a0and I like drawing anything from video games to bara, monsters, furry/anthro, robots, aliens, and demons. While you\u0027ll see plenty of content from Overwatch or Dragon Age, I\u0027m a multi-fandom kind of guy. I\u0027m currently plotting and drawing concept art for my adult (nsfw) sci-fi/modern fantasy with paranormal elements (a lot going on I know!) comic which stars a gay transgender soldier and his otherworldly lover during the events of a world-scale\u00a0catastrophe which turned to a cold-war. I will also feature smaller, non-sequential comics. I would love to make webcomics a profitable venture and would like to open an online store for prints, charms, stickers, and art books. I have a few fan\u00a0comics I\u0027ve always begun working on which will be slow release which I\u0027m using as practice for my longer running comic (and because they\u0027re fun!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI offer wips, sketches, updates, and a monthly \u0027pin-up\u0027 and in the future will devote more of my art to being Patreon exclusive. NSFW will be available at the 5$ tier and patrons will be first to see any updates on my comics. While my comics will never be behind a paywall,\u00a0those supporting me should be the first to see pages and have access to wips, sketches, among other drawings. Tiers starting at 4$ will be able to request quick doodles, these will be outlined per tier reward description.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Requests can be made between the 10th and 15th of each month and will be filled as I receive them.-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour interest and support for what I do will forever be appreciated not just by me but my significant other and our two kitties.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Due to having fraudulent accounts \u0027support\u0027 me, please forgive me if your pledge is deleted. You can contact me via twitter @oblivionscribe and I\u0027ll make sure to resolve the issue. I apologize for any inconvenience\u00a0that may cause but bot accounts looking for free art hurts all of us.-\u003cbr\u003e"
