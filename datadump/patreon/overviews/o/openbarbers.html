    "summary": "Open Barbers is a team of queer and trans hairdressers and artists who work together at Open Barbers C.I.C salon in London. This creative team of individuals have found each other as a result of at least one common belief - that there is a desperate need for an affordable and accessible hair salon that doesn\u0027t presume or judge people\u0027s identities. Since 2016, our collective dreams have been channeled into our very own salon in London, where communities come together for haircuts and so much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOpen Barbers is a hairdressing service for all lengths, genders and \nsexualities, co-directed by Greygory Vass and Felix Lane. We are a \nregistered Social Enterprise (community interest company number 9335422) Founded in 2011, the project based its ethos around personal experiences of being turned away from \u0027men only\u0027 barbershops and feminine styling in \u0027women\u0027s\u0027 or \u0027unisex\u0027 hair salons. For the founders, it was impossible to have their style and identity respected in these binary and stereotypical environments, so they decided to use build on self taught skills by qualifying as hairdressers and setting up their own space! The salon is now valued and appreciated by hundreds of clients with a vast range of genders, sexualities, ethnicities, disabilities and income levels, and our salon appeals most to those who have been at the sharp end of discrimination most of their lives and are looking for a safer and non-judgemental environment to get a haircut.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough this Patreon scheme we are looking to increase our reach to people in financial difficulty and those with disabilities and / or mental health support requirements. Currently 8-10% of our clients require our \u0027affordable appointment\u0027 scheme priced at \u00a32-10 for a 1 hour haircut. These appointments have been described as a \u0027life saver\u0027 for people in short or long term financial struggle. Equally, our longer 1.5 hour appointments at no extra cost are so essential for people who require the time and support with their hairdresser to work out a change in style that suits their identity without feeling rushed or pressured. We are looking to increase the number of home haircuts we provide for clients whose access requirements make it impossible for them to visit our wheelchair accessible salon, due to high care needs, poor transport options or lack of PA support. The time and cost involved in traveling to people\u0027s homes limits the number of visits we are able to make, leaving some of the most vulnerable members of our communities further isolated and lacking in opportunities for a haircut tailored to their needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA monthly Patreon donation will enable Open Barbers to continue delivering affordable haircuts, keep appointment lengths generous to those who need more time, and cover the time and travel costs associated with home visits for those who otherwise find it impossible to visit our shop. If you believe in accessible and affordable haircuts for all, please help any way you can!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
