    "summary": "Running the Oh! Pawpets! Show may be a lot of fun, but it can also be pretty costly. Your contributions ensure that the Oh! Pawpets! Show is kept in the loop with software and hardware updates and maintenance, server costs, puppet repair, new puppet cast members, and other things like props and set designs to supplies for our line of DVDs, Blu Rays, and music CDs. We assure you all that every dollar that is raised through Oh! Pawpets! gets placed back into the show for its needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming an Oh! Patreon!, you will not only be rewarded for your contributions, but Patreons from all levels will get exclusive Patreon-only sneak peeks at any new changes being made to the show before anyone else even gets so much as a whisper about them. This includes any new puppet characters and their photos and bios, new special features that are in the works, and any new products that are releasing soon in the Oh! Pawpets! Store. Patreons will also be able to take advantage of Patreon-only discounts on our storefront items whenever they go on sale. Who knows, we may even have some special apparel only for Patreons sometime down the road as an extra perk for remaining on the Oh! Patreons! list...but I can\u0027t make any surefire promises about that one just yet. For now, we do invite you all to become an Oh! Patreon! and you will all get any first sneak peaks at the new events that will be hitting the Oh! Pawpets! Show before anyone else!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to be given a rare opportunity to become a part of Oh! Pawpets? by having your voice as a character in some productions we make? You can, only if you become a Patreon! This offer is only open for Patreons to participate, and if we find that we have some open spots in any of our productions, we may post a Patreon-only message to our subscribers to give them an opportunity to become a character in some of our future projects! Please bear in mind that this opportunity is only limited to our filmed productions, and not our live show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe at the Oh! Pawpets! Show believe that if the viewers are going to go out of their way to help us grow and prosper, the least we can do is include you in our show perks and activities. So many rewards await you, and all it takes is a starting pledge of only $1.00 a month. You can easily find that in the cushions of your couch, but you would get a lot more benefits here on Patreon by putting it to good use, than being sat unnoticed and wedged between your body weight and a plush cushion. So, don\u0027t delay another day, and become an Oh! Patreon today! Then sit back and enjoy our production, and take in the super exclusive goodies that only Patreons can enjoy! We\u0027d love to have you among the Oh! Pawpets! family. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a Patreon opens the door to you for our own Patreon Perks, which is an exclusive access to purchase early releases of our new material before the general public can even place an order for them. You will also be eligible for special discounts, contests, and lots of other privileges that only a Patreon can receive, and it all starts with $1.00 a month! The more you pledge, the more you\u0027re rewarded, and the more thankful we\u0027ll be for your contributions, and your Patreon Perks will remain for as long as your pledge is active. So please see what you can do to help support the art of independent entertainment and help keep our production lines and live shows going by making a pledge today. All funds raised for the show gets put back into the show for productions, hardware and software upgrades and maintenance, puppet repair and new puppet characters, props, set designs, server costs, supplies, etc. Many thanks for your time in reading, and we look forward to adding you among the Patreons who are already receiving their perks and benefits for their contributions.\u003cbr\u003e"
