So from time to time, I explore the lives and ideas of great thinkers through traveling to the places where they lived and worked. I follow in the footsteps of thinkers who are no longer alive, since those who are still telling their own stories. But those who are no longer alive in the body live on in the ideas that they pass on. Here are my tributes to them:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.ordinaryphilosophy.com/p/travel-philosophy-series.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://ordinaryphilosophy.com/traveling-philosophy-history-of-ideas/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOrdinary Philosophy is dedicated to philosophy in the public square and the history of ideas that change the world\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis forum for ideas is founded on the belief that philosophy is an eminently useful endeavor as well as a fascinating and beautiful one, that citizen philosophers and academic philosophers alike share in making it so, and that the legacy of human thought, short of the universe itself, is our most valuable resource.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why the name Ordinary Philosophy?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u2018ordinary\u2019 in Ordinary Philosophy means: philosophy and the world of ideas are not only arcane subjects in the exclusive domain of academia.\u003cbr\u003ePhilosophy is an ordinary activity, something we do regularly whatever our education, background, or profession, from our homes, workplaces, studies, public spaces, and universities. It\u2019s applicable to ordinary life since it\u2019s about solving the problems we all encounter in the quest to pursue a good, happy, and meaningful one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s about seeking answers to the \u2018big questions\u2019 we ask ourselves all the time: \u2018What\u2019s the right thing to do?\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s a meaningful life, and how can I make mine so?\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s the truth of the matter, what does truth mean anyway, and how do I know when I\u2019ve found it?\u2019 \u2018What does it mean to have rights?\u2019 \u2018How did reality come to be as it is?\u2019, and so on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s also just as much about the ordinary, day-to-day questions: \u2018Should I take this job, and will it help fulfill my highest aspirations?\u2019 \u2018It is wrong to put my interests first this time, even if it will harm someone else?\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s the difference between just talking about other people and malicious gossip?\u2019 \u2018Why should I go out of my way to vote?\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd in the end, it\u2019s about \u003cem\u003eliving\u003c/em\u003e philosophy, about philosophy in the public square and the stories of human thought as it is realized, personified, lived out over time, by scholars, activists, writers, artists, educators, leaders, engaged citizens, and everyone else who loves what\u2019s just, what\u2019s beautiful, and what\u2019s true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~\u003cem\u003e Amy M.
