My church is full of people who don\u2019t like going to a church in a building for many reasons, the main one being educational difficulties including autism (my own son is autistic). Some just have interesting lives... We grow faith together in loads of different ways, in coffee shops, in homes and on the internet. \u00a0I am funded by grant at the moment, rather than the usual way vicars are paid, but the grant is running out. I have been given special permission by my church to minister for part of my day, and build a self-supporting business for the rest of it. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u2019s where you come in\u2026\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e By supporting me you will be helping to support our local community (many of whom are affected by educational and mental health difficulties) by enabling on-going ministry to our church and community and even further afield, without being a burden on anyone. If you are a bible type person go and read \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1 Thessalonians chapter 2, verse 8-12\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e and you\u2019ll get the idea.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eHey, you might want to choose to support me even though you aren\u2019t interested in the creative side of things. That\u2019s cool too! Just choose your level, and let me know who you are and why you are supporting me. That\u0027s why I have added the crazy $200 funding amount, because you might just want to do that. Like I said, check out the goals I have to see what my vision is to help me give back to the community.\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0And if the thought of supporting a minister turns you off then no worries. \u00a0You\u2019re awesome anyway! Let\u2019s stay friends - find me on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Revandyg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esocial media\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eAt first my aim was to have supporters pay me to create images which I thought they would like so that I could complement other income through the book illustrations that I was hoping to do. Well the illustration business has grown, but I don\u0027t want to give up on ministry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI also have found that the supporters\u00a0were doing so not for their own benefit of pictures, but because they believed in the ministry. In fact they told me that getting a print every now and again was an added benefit.\u00a0 Some even told me that they don\u0027t even read the email I send out every month! (ego hit...hahahaha!)\u003cbr\u003eDuring September to November 2017 I found myself reflecting on my journey in the last twelve months. From just painting pictures hoping it would fund ministry, to the discovery that I could help other people to tell their stories. Then as things have grown I\u0027ve discovered that pastorally I seem to be able to really help people by illustrating books for them. But as that continued, sometimes I would also create videos. Sometimes just a talking head shot of me, at other time animations. And it was the animated art that would really be of interest to people.\u00a0 It seemed to go where I didn\u0027t normally, and get shared many times. Always a message of hope and good news baked in.\u003cbr\u003eSo as i reflected on all this I started to wonder, perhaps actually I should be producing stuff that people could simply share. I still need to eat...but if my patrons could support me in that? They could use the resources, but we could also make them available to others? Already they were supporting me to pay for a day and a half of videos. If I could increase that even to ten days I would be able to produce three, maybe four videos a month. Or pieces of art. All paid for already. Partnering, not just supporting. And by making them copyright free it would mean people would have no fears about sharing them, or using them in services or schools. I could make them downloadable onto ipads an phones (so although they would be on youtube, providing the download links for free so that people could use them in their own ministry on the bus, in a coffee shop, in a home)....\u003cbr\u003ePlease, join the journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://onegraydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/andygrayink.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(attribution: Coffee cup images on this page\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.freepik.com/free-vector/coffee-types_803190.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDesigned by Freepik\u003c/a\u003e...everything else is mine ;-) )\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u00a0\u003c/h2\u003e"
