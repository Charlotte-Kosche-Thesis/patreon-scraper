It is designed to be used with a low cost eye-tracking device to bring keyboard control, mouse control and speech to people with motor and speech limitations, such as people living with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) / Motor Neuron Disease (MND). I released it recently to an amazing response from Reddit. It has since been featured in publications and podcasts all over the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor four years I\u2019ve worked on OptiKey on my commute to work in the morning and at the end of the day when my wife and baby boy are asleep. I am\nimmensely proud of what OptiKey has achieved since its release; offering people\nwith speech and motor limitations the chance to communicate and achieve full\ncomputer control, without having to spend huge sums of money for sub-par\ncommercial systems. The positive feedback I have received and the feeling of\nachievement, of knowing that something I\u2019ve written is changing people\u2019s lives,\nis indescribable. It\u2019s made me realise something\u2026 I need to take this beyond a snatched hour here and there. I need to do this full time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to build all of the features on my to-do list,\ntranslate OptiKey into all of the languages people have requested, and have the\ntime to test and improve OptiKey with real users in conjunction with world\nleading hospitals.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI am asking for your help...
