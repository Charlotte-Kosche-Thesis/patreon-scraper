What gives me greatest satisfaction, however, is making tunes of my own. \u00a0\u00a0Since I was a kid, I took for granted a kind of hazy soundtrack accompanying me through the days. \u00a0Sometimes, a very vague one with only a few misty chords and a few lyrics. \u00a0At others a noisy big-band which is so loud I can\u0027t hear it! \u00a0I\u0027d like to make sense of it all so I need lots of time for learning, practicing and producing something okay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving been a professional painter for 30 years, and an author for 10, \u00a0I\u0027ve so enjoyed expressing in paint and in words, the surreal, eye-catching moments that pass me by. \u00a0But painting and writing can be quiet, and you can\u0027t share a creative conversation with others in quite the same way that music allows. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTO SUM UP\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo I would love your help in enabling me to record, edit, arrange and tame my soundtrack. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I need to raise funds for now are editing sessions in a recording studio and for making a CD.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, please do NOT feel obliged. \u00a0Feedback is just as important, and I would welcome any comments and ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW PATREON WORKS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough \u00a0Patreon, you donate a fixed amount per month. \u00a0As you help me, I release back to you clips of work in progress. \u00a0The content is available in a tier system, dependent on how much you choose to donate. \u00a0The current donation levels range from $3 per month to $10 per month. \u00a0If at any time you wish to cancel your donation, then that can easily be arranged.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are examples of rewards ranging from standard patron-only feed to the larger rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatron-only news-feed\u003cbr\u003eClips of piano pieces before recording.\u003cbr\u003eClips of recording sessions in the studio of jazz piano player, Chris Ingham.\u003cbr\u003eDownloadable MP3s\u003cbr\u003eClips of the creative process at home on the piano\u003cbr\u003eClips of Art images featuring fictional musicians which I love to paint.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0A BIG THANK YOU TO ALL WHO HAVE READ THIS, AND WHO ARE SUPPORTING ME ALREADY. \u00a0IT IS BECAUSE OF YOU THAT I CAN GET ON WITH SOMETHING I LOVE TO DO!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
