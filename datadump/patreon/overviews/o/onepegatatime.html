But\nin 2011 my life lit up again when I discovered loom knitting. Once again I\ncould make things...creative things...useful things!!

Atrophy is the medical term for getting\nsmaller, which is what generally happens to muscles when they\u2019re not active.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SMA involves the loss of nerve cells called motor neurons in\nthe spinal cord and is classified as a motor neuron disease.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In the most common form of SMA (chromosome 5 SMA, or\nSMN-related SMA), there is wide variability in age of onset, symptoms and rate\nof progression. In order to account for these differences, the chromosome 5 SMA\noften is classified into types 1 through 4.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The age at which SMA symptoms begin roughly correlates with\nthe degree to which motor function is affected: The earlier the age of onset,\nthe greater the impact on motor function. Children who display symptoms at\nbirth or in infancy typically have the lowest level of functioning (type 1).\nSMA onset in children (types 2 and 3), teens or adults (type 4) generally\ncorrelates with increasingly higher levels of motor function.\u201d\n\n\t\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
