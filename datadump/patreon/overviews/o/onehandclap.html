    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eFirst of all, thank you thank you thank you for even \u003cem\u003econsidering\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0donating to my Patreon. The fact that I might be able to create content full-time based on all your donations is humbling, inspiring, and, frankly, shocking. I\u0027ve always gotten a kick out of the little projects I\u0027ve worked on, whether writing stories, making movies, or editing videos, but the fact that\u003cem\u003e someone else\u003c/em\u003e make get a kick out of all this feels like a true blessing. So, again, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I make video essays\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve started this video essay channel for one reason: I love making video essays. It\u2019s as simple as that. I like watching things and looking for trends and themes. I like learning in depth about subjects I\u2019ve only vaguely considered. I like turning my thoughts into video matter with snazzy animations and connecting with people on YouTube. To me, video essays are just another way to communicate what I\u2019m feeling, and the fact that full communities can form around that communication, to me, is a very special thing. Whenever I make something that resonates with others, whether with 5 people or 50,000, my whole life gets a lot brighter and bubblier.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u2019m asking for money\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSadly, these essays take about 40-70 hours each, which I know sounds absurd and excessive, but between the script writing, the recording, the sound editing, the clip finding, the animating, the assembly, the revision process, and the final touches, it\u0027s a whole lot of work. I am currently working as a full-time video editor and hiring a freelancer for my videos (not the script or direction, just the animation and editing). At the moment I simply don\u0027t have time to make content all that often, but if I were to get a dollar from just half of my subscribers, I could quit my job and make high quality content full time. If you\u2019d like to help out but don\u2019t have much, even just a dollar can really help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOutside of the video essay world, I\u0027m an aspiring filmmaker and writer, currently working on my first collection of short stories. If you\u0027d like to watch a weird short film I made, you can check it out \u003ca href=\"https://floridareview.cah.ucf.edu/article/a-new-acquaintance/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. Or if you\u0027d like to read a couple stories I\u0027ve had published online, you can check them out \u003ca href=\"http://www.hobartpulp.com/web_features/the-resurgence-of-plain\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.primenumbermagazine.com/Issue107_Kaplan.html\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. Beyond that, not much to say\u2026I\u2019m mostly just flesh and bones with some meat between the ears. If you want to help me do this more consistently, feel free to throw a few bucks per video. If not, no worries. Much love, Michael\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
