This could be a monologue, sonnet or possibly even a scene, depending on the length (must be able to be produced under five minutes). In addition to the credits, you will receive a high-quality digital file of the movie and the freedom to enter it into festivals, should you desire to do so. In order to earn this reward, you must \"patreonize\" my shorts for a minimum of six months (negotiations are possible).",
