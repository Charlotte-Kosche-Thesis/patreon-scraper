    "summary": "Back when I started this blog, I noticed that people had become incredibly cynical, both in the real world and regarding video games. There are many, many voices out there that automatically jump to the worst conclusions, or bash on something for the sake of bashing on it. My disposition is generally much more upbeat, and I wanted to share that with everyone, to add that voice to the crowd.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s always a place for cynicism, of course, and I\u0027m not blindly optimistic; my goal is just to take a look at all of the many positive aspects of gaming: what impact it has on our lives, how it affects and helps me in daily life, and how far it has come and will go as a medium. I hope you join me on that journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you don\u0027t know what Patreon is or what it\u0027s for, it\u0027s simply a way to show support to content creators through direct contributions, the size of which you choose. In return, you get fun stuff, and you get an active part in shaping what this blog will become! If you donate a small sum, you get access to my Discord channel where you can suggest games for me to play and game-related subjects for me to write about. Any money I make will go\u00a0directly to paying for equipment such as microphones, capture cards or cameras that I will use to generate more content for my blog. Thank you for your support, from the bottom of my heart, and Stay Optimistic."
