I spend whatever time I\u0027m not doing my IRL job on delving into the art of video games as a way to help us better cope with our own lives and understand the world around us.

These articles are well-researched and documented for the sake of presenting accurate interpretations of the stories within video games point to something more than simple entertainment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis series will be available in written article form on my website and will be featured once a month on my Twitch channel as a live lecture/talk show to be later uploaded to Youtube!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrigger Warning!
