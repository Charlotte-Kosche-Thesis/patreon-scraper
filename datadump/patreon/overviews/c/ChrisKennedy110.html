    "summary": "81% of\nAmericans have a story they want to write, but I wasn\u0027t one of them. I never had a story...and then,\u00a0one\nday, I did.\u00a0After writing the\nfirst draft of my novel, \u201cRed\nTide,\u201d though, I looked for representation and was\nunable to find it. After\nbeing turned down by over 75 agents, I decided to do it myself. I researched\nthe self-publishing industry and everything needed to be a\nindependent author, and, on my daughters\u2019 birthday, I launched my first novel.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\ndid fairly well, and people began to take notice. Soon, people began to ask me\nif I would publish their books too. Knowing how hard it had been on me, I decided\nto help the newer authors out. I took on a lot of folks\u2014so many that I\nbarely had time for writing myself. All editing and no creating made Chris a\ndull boy, and I began to lose the joy or creating.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy\never-supportive wife saw this and told me I needed to quit my day job before I\nburned out. That was a \u201cbig thing,\u201d though. I have three kids in college, and\nthe tuition monster is relentless in hunting me down. How could I quit my day job,\nkeep up with my commitments to the authors I said I would publish, and still\nstay out of the clutches of the tuition monster?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis\nis where you come in. By sponsoring me through this page, you help give me the\nability to continue writing myself, while continuing to help publish newer\nauthors (including some you may not have heard of--yet), and still win the war against the\ntuition monster. That\u0027s what it\u0027s all about--winning the war against the tuition monster. For your part, you\u2019ll get access to a number of things you may not have had access to prior. It\u2019s\na win for everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPlease\ntake a look at the level of support you can give and the goals I am shooting\nfor. Anything you can do to help win the war against the dreaded tuition\nmonster is greatly appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e"
