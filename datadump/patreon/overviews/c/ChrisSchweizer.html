I used to be a cartoonist and a college\nprofessor both, but for the past four years I\u2019ve been doing art exclusively.  My day job is writing and drawing graphic\nnovels, and I couldn\u2019t be luckier to get to do it for a living.  But I also love to do other work, work that\ndoesn\u2019t have the kind of infrastructure that publishing does for bringing about\na financial return.  But Patreon offers\nthat infrastructure, and as a result projects that might not otherwise be\nfeasible for me are suddenly in the realm of possibility.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn addition to the books\n(usually about history), I like to make paper figure sets for display or gaming,\npapercraft dioramas,  portraits of\nhistorical figures with accompanying mini-biographies, posters, and essays about\nthe craft of comic-making.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m proud of this extraneous\nwork.  I enjoy doing it.  It sharpens my skills, leading to better\nbooks.  It allows me to dip my toe in a\ngiven research pool and do a project about, say, Mountain Men in the 1830s or Mamelukes\nin the 1500s without having to commit to a book about them at the expense of\nsomething with richer narrative possibilities. \nAnd, most of all, it\u2019s a way to share something that excites me a great\ndeal with others.  Whether that be\ncharacters from a book I hold dear to my heart (like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://schweizercomics.tumblr.com/post/73204142408/since-i-was-a-kid-i-have-loved-the-three#notes\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Three Musketeers\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://schweizercomics.tumblr.com/post/113869010908/about-a-year-and-a-half-ago-i-posted-a-bunch-of\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHarry Potter\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://schweizercomics.tumblr.com/post/71637466651/a-writer-whose-work-i-follow-with-some-enthusiasm#notes\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Thousand Autumns of Jacob De Zoet\u003c/a\u003e) or historical figures\nwhose exploits are less well-known than they might be (like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://schweizercomics.tumblr.com/post/109986050791/black-history-month-2016-edit-a-lot-of-teachers\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eblack adventurers\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://schweizercomics.tumblr.com/search/warrior%20women\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewarrior women of renown\u003c/a\u003e), or an aspect of comics-making that I find\nparticularly important (\u003ca href=\"http://curiousoldlibrary.blogspot.com/2011/10/schweizer-guide-to-spotting-tangents.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eavoiding tangents\u003c/a\u003e), I\u2019ve found that it not only\nenriches my life to make these but it has the chance to enrich the lives of\nother folk, as well.
