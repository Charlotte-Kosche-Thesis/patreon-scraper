    "summary": "Hello. My name is Christie and I make Creepy dolls. This has been my full time job for almost 15 years and my work is collected worldwide. Each doll begins and a found doll- thrift shops, yard sales, estate sales, gifts or other interesting places. I then hand paint each doll and post it online for purchase. Each doll is one of a kind and most are porcelain although for the past few months, I have been listing a few vinyl pieces. I have a couple molds and cast up a few things as well- my skull head dolls and pumpkin head dolls are resin. My favorite day of the year is Halloween and I use real life as the inspiration for my pieces. Death, music, decay, gothic imagery, bones, Halloween, vintage fabrics, and love/heartbreak are a few of the things that go into my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor or the past few years, I have been dealing with some health issues including endometriosis and most recently a car accident and pain has become a huge influencer over my work. I have become obsessed with clowns after hating them for so long. A few weeks ago a customer asked me why I was making so many clowns lately (she is terrified of them) and I told her that one day I was in terrible pain from my endo and I saw an article about a lady who dressed like a clown to cheer up sick people at a local hospital. That night I started making a bunch of clowns. I figured that maybe my clown dolls could cheer up people who were suffering from chronic pain.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy my work has been featured in print, on television (worldwide), on album covers and in various other projects. My most infamous doll was what is now known as \"the Singapore doll.\" A few years ago, a customer bought some dolls from me and claimed one was haunted. They placed the doll against a tree in Singapore with a blindfold and some Arabic writing. (The blindfold was their doing, not mine). The story made the news worldwide and went viral and over the past few years, I have seen the doll pop up on several YouTube channels and websites as being a modern day urban legend.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking the the dolls is my passion. It brings me great joy to create them and I love hearing how my dolls have impacted someone\u0027s life. But it is becoming more and more difficult to sustain life as an artist in this economy. So I am launching this page. Your support means more to me than a dollar sign. It means happiness because this is all I know how to do. Painting brings me great joy and I want to be able to keep creating until I am no longer a part of this realm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei am on etsy and Instagram under ChristieCreepydolls\u00a0"
