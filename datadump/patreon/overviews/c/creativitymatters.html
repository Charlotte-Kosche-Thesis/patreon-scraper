I have been tracking personal creativity and the creative journey for more than 10 years through the CMP, first as the voice of the Creative Mom Podcast and now as the voice of the more broadly-focused Creativity Matters Podcast,\u00a0a podcast for people who believe that Creativity Matters, are interested in their own creative journey, and making time for their creative selves in and around their days, are curious about the nuances of our individual creative lives, and believe in the value of their own \"creative me.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe CMP continues to thrive and evolve because of a loyal community of listeners who are attuned to their own creative journeys and to the ways in which my story nudges, nurtures, and inspires them. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI love the Creativity Matters Podcast, but I want to do more with the show and be able to focus more of my time and attention on the show to make it even better. To do that, I need your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support through Patreon can help keep the CMP alive--as well as help increase the reach (and frequency) of the CMP. With support, I can create more art, produce more episodes, pay for necessary changes on the backend, upgrade older equipment, and continue to grow this show and the many threads of creativity that make up the CMP.\u00a0 (In reality, your support also helps with real life.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to learn more about the CMP and get a feel for what this podcast is all about, check out some of these favorite past episodes: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.creativemompodcast.com/wp/2017/02/episode221/\"\u003eEpisode 221: Goggles\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.creativemompodcast.com/wp/2016/08/episode-197-the-moments-within-the-moments/\"\u003eEpisode 197: The Moments within the Moments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.creativemompodcast.com/wp/2017/01/episode-213-by-the-numbers/\"\u003eEpisode 213: By the Numbers\u003c/a\u003e \t\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.creativemompodcast.com/wp/2015/05/episode-176-personal-big-data/\"\u003eEpisode 176: Personal Big Data\u003c/a\u003e \t\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.creativemompodcast.com/wp/2016/08/episode-194-color-code/\"\u003eEpisode 194: Color Code\u003c/a\u003e \t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind show notes, subscription links, and additional information on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.creativemompodcast.com/\"\u003eCMP site\u003c/a\u003e.
