    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eWelcome to the Patreon subscription portal for Canberra Sightings, your one-stop shop for satisfying all your Pok\u00e9mon Go needs!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho or what is Canberra Sightings?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCanberra Sightings is a group of local people who love scanning for Pok\u00e9mon, whether in the wild or after a boss has taken control of a gym, and helping to \ufb01ll the gaps left by Niantic. We\u0027re also the only Canberra scanners who prioritise use of Canberra-based or Australian service providers to help us bring these mons and raid bosses to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are dedicated to helping the people of Canberra, whatever their needs may be: whether you\u2019re looking to \ufb01nd those elusive mons still needed to complete your pokedex, build a portfolio of gym-ready bruisers, takedown raid bosses, want to know about (or report \ufb01nds relating to) current nests and EX-raids, or just because all things Pok\u00e9mon-related are fun. Whatever the people of Canberra want or need to improve their Pok\u00e9mon Go experience, we\u2019ve got you covered!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do you need my money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe funded the early days of Canberra Sightings from our own pockets, but this was not sustainable long term, especially not as the services provided grew and we expanded to cover all of Canberra and even beyond. Servers, hash keys, proxies, captcha and bandwidth all cost money, and without these things there would be no scanning services to start with. This is where you, our supporters, enter the picture. However, Canberra Sightings is strictly not-for-pro\ufb01t: all funds received are dedicated to maintaining the quality and reliability of existing services, and expanding our platform as required to meet the needs of our community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does it mean to be a supporter then?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe major bene\ufb01t for being an o\ufb03cial supporter is gaining full unrestricted access to all regional and special channels and the live sightings fed and raids directly to them (compared to the feeds that public members can access). Supporters also get better access to the power of Novabot, our fully integrated custom-built bot - and unique in Australia for the services and power it provides - that personalises your Canberra Sightings experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about the supporter tiers?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporter tiers are designed so that you can choose how much you can, or want to, give to keep Canberra Sightings operational and scanning for the people of Canberra and its connected communities. As a supporter, you are valued equally, regardless of your supporter tier. Those of you who have been here since the beginning will see this re\ufb02ected our revised tiers, with the addition of a new entry-level supporter tier and the removal of unnecessary higher-priced tiers. It remains a matter entirely for yourself as to which tier you choose, but we see little point in o\ufb00ering higher tiers that aren\u2019t necessary and which would be contrary to our egalitarian philosophy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a number of di\ufb00erent services that are required to support scanning operations such as those provided by Canberra Sightings, as noted above. Although some of our service providers are unavoidably international, Canberra Sightings strives wherever possible to utilise local providers (i.e. Canberra-based, or at least Australian)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do next?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019d like to contribute an amount each month to keep Canberra Sightings operational, then we\u2019d love to have you as a supporter! Simply register with Patreon and follow the prompts - you should be automatically registered as a supporter soon after, and have all the access that comes with this status. However, if it looks like it has not happened automatically then please go to our discord server and tag @Admin in a message in #help and we\u2019ll get it sorted for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen do I get charged?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon bills supporters on a monthly basis for their pledged amount. This will generally happen between the 1st and 5th of the month, commencing the month after you pledge. Please note that this means that supporters are getting full access in advance, but are not \u201cbilled\u201d for this until the end of the month; your payment, then, is always for the month preceding. We have set this up so that no one is ever billed without \ufb01rst having received full supporter access; it allows you the opportunity to evaluate our services, decide whether you\u2019d like to support them, and do so without obligation. We trust that when you see what we are doing for the community, and experience the great vibe of our community, you\u2019ll want to stick around :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOTE: Patreon is a US subscription processing company. As such, all pledge amounts are in US dollars. As of January 2018, this is approximately AUD$1.25, which means that a USD$2.50 pledge is equivalent to AUD$3.13. There are NO additional fees or deductions for you - it is a straight conversion from AUD to USD and that\u0027s it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
