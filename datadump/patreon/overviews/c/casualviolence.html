He\u0027s now a writer for shows including\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Amazing World of Gumball, Bravest Warriors\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eSpace Chickens In Space. \u003c/em\u003eA myriad of talented actors kindly lend their silliest faces and voices to the things we make: just like the Animorphs, we started as a small group and have since expanded into a bit of an army (spoiler alert for the Animorphs series of books).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur original core group of performers - Luke Booys, David Arrondelle, Alex Whyman, Greg Cranness and the aforementioned James -\u00a0 used to be a stage act, making elaborate, story-driven sketch shows to perform at the Edinburgh Fringe and across the UK. We did quite well! We got a lot of good reviews, we won three awards - one in 2011, one in 2014, one in 2016 - and have been nominated for a bunch more, including twice for the Malcolm Hardee Award for Comic Originality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2012, we\u0027ve also made\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/casualviolencecomedy\"\u003ea whole bunch of short films and sketches\u003c/a\u003e with our supremely talented and hardworking filmmaking partner James Roberts - who, upon seeing\u00a0us perform live in 2011, thought we\u0027d be nationally successful in no time. (Turns out he was right, but only if you mean something else by \"no time\"). In 2016, we also made\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://hectorvsthefuture.com\"\u003ea seven episode podcast sitcom series, Hector Vs The Future\u003c/a\u003e, with co-writer James Huntrods and producer Andy Goddard (of Wooden Overcoats).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/00c956_57fd28add42c4ce5ab98c4e98bfedf0a~mv2_d_4256_2832_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1260,h_838,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/00c956_57fd28add42c4ce5ab98c4e98bfedf0a~mv2_d_4256_2832_s_4_2.webp\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more films and podcasts we\u0027ve made, the more we\u0027ve realised we prefer the immediacy, the creative flexibility, and the reach we can have with online comedy - so we\u0027ve decided on a change of approach. We\u0027ll still be performing live every now and then, but instead of being a live act who occasionally makes films and podcasts, we\u0027re now officially an online act who occasionally performs live.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis means we\u0027re making and releasing\u003cstrong\u003e multiple\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003enew sketches every month in 2018\u003c/strong\u003e, more than doubling our current total. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis means we\u0027re developing a \u003cstrong\u003ebrand new podcast sitcom series\u003c/strong\u003e, which we\u0027re aiming to release by the end of the year, fingers crossed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd if it all goes well, we\u0027ll be making a heck of a lot more stuff in 2019 too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEverything we make will be available to everyone, for free. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eBut these things cost a lot of money. \u003c/strong\u003e We need to pay our crew and our additional performers and creatives, or at least buy their lunch.
