    "summary": "Thank you so much for stopping by my Patreon Page!  My name is Crystal, and I create video game,\nanime and original music on YouTube. \nMusic is my passion, and making it for a living is a goal that I strive\nfor every day. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI love making music, and sharing it with anyone who will\nlisten.  Audio is an art form that I\navidly participate in, because it\u0026#8217;s accessible to anyone:  You literally can create something out of\nnothing but sound waves, and it\u0026#8217;s something that has always captivated  me.  It\nalso combines all of my passions: \nSinging, writing, and music making, so it\u0026#8217;s the best of three worlds!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith your help, I\u0026#8217;d be able to\nfulfill my music goals.  I\u0026#8217;ve been\nlegally blind for 18 years now, so the more visual aspects of YouTube and video\ncreation are harder for me to do.  I use\nstill images to create my YouTube videos, and for anything else I go to someone\nelse for help.  With the pledges I get on\nPatreon, I\u0026#8217;d be able to pay for video editing, graphics for my channel, and overall\nget help producing the visual aspects of my channel that I\u0026#8217;m unable to do, to\nmake it the best possible channel it can be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou also would be helping me by allowing me to get  audio equipment upgrades, help producing my\noriginal, and cover tracks, and make higher quality videos for all of you to\nenjoy.  With your help, I would be able\nto create more frequent, more polished content, and deliver it to you on a\nregular basis.  I also would be able to\nlicense my music through digital music distributors, so you\u0026#8217;ll be able to listen\non other platforms!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat else will becoming one of my patrons do?  It will give you different rewards!  All you have to do is pick a payment amount\nyou would like to pledge, and you\u0026#8217;ll get all rewards provided by that\ntier.  For more information, look at the\nrewards section!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you already follow my work, thank you from the bottom of\nmy heart.  Just knowing you listen to,\nand enjoy my music means the world to me, and you\u0026#8217;re under no obligation to\npledge.  I\u0026#8217;ll still be creating content\nfor everyone to enjoy, but if you\u0026#8217;d like a way to monetarily support me, you\ncan do so through this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
