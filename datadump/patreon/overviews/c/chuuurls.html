    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello, I\u0027m Chuuurls.\u003c/strong\u003e You might know me from any / many of my social media. You might even know me from real life as\u003cstrong\u003e Callie G\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027m a commission artist who usually works other non-art jobs to stay afloat. When I\u0027m not working, I\u0027m artworking. Art is my passion, but I struggle to make headway and gain recognition in the art world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo where do you come in? You come in the door, unless you\u0027re not into that method of room entry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy primary goal is to fund \u0026amp; send limited-edition postcard print runs.\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003eA high-quality postcard with my original art on it is yours with a puny pledge of \u003cstrong\u003e2.00USD\u003c/strong\u003e or more per postcard printing. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m doing 200-250 cards per order I make, and it costs 50-70 dollars to get them printed. Your patronage will help to pay for the cost of print and the postage needed to send out your rewards.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny leftovers I have will go towards paying for my cost of living. If I can make more than rent, groceries, gas, bills, AND production costs, I will be saving money to buy better, longer-lasting materials to make my art with. \u003cbr\u003eFor instance, if I make 100 dollars more than what I need, I can slowly save up for a new computer, replace old hardware (like tablets or hard drives,) or purchase software. I can reliably and more prolifically produce if I can maintain and update my tools. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHaving your financial backing will also help me produce more time-consuming or involved projects\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, especially those that I might need to learn new techniques to create. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve badly wanted to make animations or publish a comic for years, but it\u0027s difficult to do when you have limited time, money, and materials. Most importantly, I can \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ereward you with the results \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eof the security you provide me. I want to make my patrons feel as happy as I do when they support my work. Check out the sidebar with my long-term goals for more information.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a helpful analogy to visualize the impact of your financial \nhelp: Instead of trying to recreate the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel with Magic Markers \nand paper plates, I can buy some paints and a plane ticket to Italy \nto yell at Michelangelo\u0027s grave and gain his ghostly knowledge. In other words, you and I both would reap the benefits of the money that I receive through my ability to make more and nicer art for your enjoyment.\u003cbr\u003eEven at lower amounts, the funds you provide can buy me a fancy can o\u0027 beans that will sustain my tiny skeleton and protect it from Death\u0027s scythe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePossibly Asked Questions (PHAQs)\u003cbr\u003eQ\u003cstrong\u003e: DOESN\u0027T YOUR JOB COMPLETELY SUPPORT YOU? WHY DO YOU NEED PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA: NOPE! I don\u0027t have a day job and I don\u0027t have non-catastrophic coverage in my state, which I will be losing in March 2016. It is now more important than ever to need Patreon. It\u0027s my biggest source of income right now along with commissions and whatever I can make selling off the remainder of my postcards that I don\u0027t use for rewards. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: HOW IS THIS POSTCARD GOING TO COME TO ME? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e1)\u003c/strong\u003e I can write on the postcard and send it like a real postcard.
