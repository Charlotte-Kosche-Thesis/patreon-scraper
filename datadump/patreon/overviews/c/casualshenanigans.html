Over the years, our interests have expanded and so has\n the podcast. Our focus is on our love of gaming on both PC and \nconsoles, PC hardware, and whatever else we feel like talking about at \nthe time. We like to have fun when we chat, are often irreverent, are \nall good friends offline, and love the interaction we have with our \nlisteners.  \u003cbr\u003e\nCasual \nShenanigans hosts its podcast live on Thursday evenings at 8pm EST. \nApart from the podcast, we try to offer a variety of content and \ncommunity gaming events. We record and stream our podcast as well as \noccasionally host Arma 3, Minecraft, and other games on the \u003ca href=\"http://casualshenanigans.com/home/the-potato-masher/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePotato Masher\u003c/a\u003e; our $350 PC built to compete with the PS4 for the rest of the console\u2019s life cycle.\u003cbr\u003e\nWatch our\n podcast live and join us in chat!

YouTube\u0027s revenue model isn\u0027t very friendly or beneficial to smaller channels. We are growing at a healthy pace, but we want to expand the podcast\u0027s opportunities faster than YouTube ads will let us. The podcast has very minimal costs, so our first priority would be to cover them. After that, the money will go towards making the podcast experience better for you guys (better mics, cameras, lighting for those who need them), having more opportunities to record podcasts together (instead of over the internet), and more opportunities to play with you, the community! Also, we would like to provide a small amount of compensation to the hosts and regular members of the podcast, for the amount of time it takes to prepare and put on a good show. Of course, the sky is the limit, but that\u0027s how we would like to start.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur promise to you:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast\u0027s quality will never drop for anyone that doesn\u0027t donate. Seriously. The podcast will only get better for every viewer. There will be premium features for people who support us, but that will never block off parts of the podcast experience for the average viewer. The premium features will be additional things that we add, not existing features that get moved behind a paywall!\u003cbr\u003e"
