My name\u0027s Cheese (or Josh if that\u0027s easier), and I have a passion for making and writing about games.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSince first learning AmigaBASIC in the late 80s, I\u0027ve been on-and-off making games in my spare time, always with a hope to someday be able to focus on this as a full time activity.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI also enjoy writing about games and since 2011 have been running \n\"\n\u003ca href=\"http://cheesetalks.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCheese Talks\u003c/a\u003e\", a website where I publish interviews, articles and data \nprojects exploring game and game development related topics.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the past few years, I\u0027ve managed to push out about one prototype a year, always with the intention of expanding them into full games, but never really with the time to do so alongside other commitments.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Are You Using Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEarly in 2015, I resigned from several community groups and other commitments to allow me to give more attention to game development and writing. This Patreon campaign was created to allow people to support me in this endeavour.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy plans are to release one small prototype or make a notable contribution to a Free/Open Source Software game every six months, one large prototype per year, and give ongoing development attention to turning one of my prototypes into a full game (some of these will be F/OSS, and some will be commercial projects). Alongside this, I will be writing semi-regular dev blogs to share some of my development/content creation workflows, design intentions and musings. In addition, I will be aiming to release one piece of Cheese Talks content every two to three months.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo recap, supporters will be helping to make these things happen:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOngoing development toward turning a prototype into a full game\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 small game prototype or contribution to a F/OSS game every 6 months\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 large game prototype per year\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVaguely regular dev blogs\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlmost-monthly progress update livestream\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 piece of \"Cheese Talks\" content every 2 - 3 months\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy hopes here are to raise enough support, through Patreon contributions and through sales of games that I manage to finish and release, to reduce my reliance on contract work and day jobs and \ndedicate full time hours to making and writing about games.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Are Some Of Your Previous Games?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2002, I released my first public game, a silly deathmatch Half-Life 1 total conversion created with fellow students as a side project whilst working on a more serious team based multiplayer game inspired by Looking Glass Studios\u0027 Thief series (both are projects I would like to revisit and give closure to someday).
