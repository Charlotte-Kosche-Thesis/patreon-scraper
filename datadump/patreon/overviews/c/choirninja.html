My goal is to be able to dedicate more hours of my life to serving the choral community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u2019t get me wrong, this is already like a second full time job! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though this podcast is free, doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s cheap. It costs money to put it out every week, and I believe in value for value.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo pledge is voluntary. You would only give if and what you can and upgrade or downgrade your patronage whenever you wish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou all may have started out as fans, but many of you have become true friends. I think this is the next step to making this podcast even better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you find the podcast as valuable as I think you do, please consider showing your support through this campaign and I\u0027ll keep the good stuff coming.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more support I receive the more I\u0027ll be able to offer you. Take a look at the \"Goals\" on the right and see what your support will bring for the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for listening and for being a member of Choir Nation! \u00a0I cannot thank you enough. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Ryan Guth is probably the sappiest choir director you know. He can\u0027t help crying in front of every new choir he speaks to about the power of choral music to transform the lives of singers and those they touch through performance. Having spent his entire professional life with middle school musicians, Ryan knows how to bring the energy. \u00a0When he\u0027s not directing choirs, Ryan hosts the Find Your Forte podcast, a choral music niche show aimed at helping his audience (affectionately named \"Choir Nation\") step up to the podium with purpose each day...which they do because they\u0027re awesome. Pretty much every day he eats Cocoa Puffs for breakfast, and for dinner, a chicken parm panini with Ruffles potato chips inside that he purchases from the deli in his Manhattan apartment building. Ryan\u0027s friends all eventually end up referring to him as \"Guth\" behind his back, but \"Ryan\" to his face; a phenomenon he has yet to understand.",
