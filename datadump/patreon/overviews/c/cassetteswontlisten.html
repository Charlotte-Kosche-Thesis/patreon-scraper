I\u0027ve released numerous albums under Cassettes Won\u0027t Listen and run my own audio-visual label, \u003ca href=\"http://www.daylightcurfew.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDaylight Curfew. \u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT DO I WANT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf \nyou\u0027re a fan of my work or are interested in being a patron of my \nprojects, I\u0027m asking for the support of anything from $1 and up.\u00a0 This guarantees \nthat each song I put out under Cassettes Won\u0027t Listen (as well as my \nside project, Dfalt) will be written, recorded, and produced with your \nhelp. Every little bit goes a long way and by supporting, you not only receive all the warm/fuzzy feelings of being a patron of my \nprojects, but you also get patron-only access to downloads, photos, and \ninteractions with me during the creation of each track. Your support goes to the creative process as well as the financial aspects of writing, recording, and producing music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO YOU GET?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on what you pledge as a patron, you have access to everything ranging from a simple demo, stemming from initial song ideas all the way up to the two of us hanging out and drinking beer while I perform for you and your friends in your living room. By becoming a patron you\u0027ll get access to the process of \nwriting, recording, and producing songs. You\u0027ll also get to experience \neverything along the way from the initial idea of a song to the \nfinalized completed album. Interested in the music industry? You\u0027re in luck, I run a record label and am available to help consult you and your music as well as offer advice in starting your own record label. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to interacting with you through Patreon and thank you in advance for being a fan of what I do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInteresting anecdotes about CWL: I once received a cease and desist from Kevin Spacey for calling my album Kevinspacey. I hosted MTV2\u0027s Subterranean back when MTV played music videos. I launched CWL as a fictitious 4 man band with fake names but had to come clean when the first single topped indie rock radio charts and I had to start touring. Many more to come...\u003cbr\u003e"
