    "summary": "I started out on YouTube talking about Scientology as part of my own exit and recovery from that destructive cult. Since then, I\u0027ve been learning and promoting critical thinking, science and reason - hot topics which I believe can make things better for all of us. My channel is not just about debunking Scientology now but is about education and being real about some of the crazy things that go on in all parts of our lives - politics, religion, social issues, science and all the rest. I think a healthy dose of skepticism and tolerance are the keys to a better life for everyone and I want to forward that message in all kinds of entertaining and interesting ways.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goals for every video I make are to make you laugh and to get you to learn something. If I can accomplish that with the majority of people I meet for the rest of my life, I think I\u0027ll have done something that mattered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I need some help. I want to do more and I want to do better and that\u0027s where you come in. I\u0027ve taken my channel as far as I can with the resources and time I have available to me. If I am going to do more, I\u0027d need to get some assistance. I have crazy ideas that involve collaborations and travel and interviews and podcasts and other things. Most of these ideas have come from you, my viewers, in the form of comments and suggestions. I\u0027ve had a number of people tell me I should get into public speaking or teaching. I realized I can do both of those things right here!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy viewers are awesome and I want to thank every one of you just for being there and for the incredibly kind words I get from most of you. If you are new to who I am and what I\u0027m about, check me out on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF326xyA0QHI7Z5xAwKQDJg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy channel\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided that a monthly pledge is the best and easiest way to support what I\u0027m doing with the least amount of inconvenience or attention on the part of my patrons. You can give anything from as little as $1, $5 or $10 a month to exorbitant amounts beyond my imagination (although I can imagine quite a bit). Whatever you can do, know that I do and always will appreciate it beyond any words I can say. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have instant rewards for any of my patrons right now, but once I start hitting certain goals I\u0027ll be able to do more with this in the form of hangouts and live chats and even some merchandise ideas I have. More than a couple of you have asked about some of the custom shirts I wear from time to time and I\u0027d love nothing more than to produce those for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your attention and your time and whatever support you would like to give.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
