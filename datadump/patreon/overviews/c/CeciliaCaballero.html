    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho I Am\u003c/strong\u003e: I am a mother, creative writer, short fiction writer, poet, and scholar. I love to write about all things speculative and spooky. I am currently working on a poetry manuscript, a series of creative non-fiction essays, and an Afro-Xicana speculative memoir. My dream is to become a full-time writer and I am working toward my dream a little bit every day. As Afrofuturist feminist foremother Octavia Butler taught us: so be it, see to it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBio\u003c/strong\u003e: I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area to low-income, formerly undocumented immigrant parents from Michoacan, Mexico. Much of my writing is inspired by my parents and their storytelling. My parents worked in many low-paying jobs--construction labor, farm work, fast food, and street-vending--and they taught me what it means to survive in a country that doesn\u0027t want them and yet this country depends upon their invisible labor. I currently live in Los Angeles with my son and I\u0027m finishing my dissertation. I also bold BAs in English and Chicanx Studies from UC Berkeley and an AA in Liberal Arts from Los Medanos Community College. My creative writing seeks to explore the unseen, the invisible, the speculative, and the spooky in the everyday lived experiences of women of color.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChicana M(other)work Activism\u003c/strong\u003e: I am a co-founder of the Chicana M(other)work collective (chicanamotherwork.com), a grassroots project founded in November 2014 which amplifies Chicana and mother of color voices within academia and beyond through podcasts, publications, and presentations. I also produce, co-host, and edit many of the Chicana M(other)work podcasts (\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/chicanamotherwork).\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/chicanamotherwork).\u003c/a\u003e I see my activism with Chicana M(other)work as a powerful form of women of color knowledge production and collective resistance. I am also a co-editor for the forthcoming book, \u003cem\u003eThe Chicana M(other)work Anthology: Porque Sin Madres No Hay Revolucion,\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eforthcoming from the University of Arizona Press and The Feminist Wire book series. Since Chicana M(other)work is an independent grassroots collective, all of my work with CM is unpaid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Writing Idols (in no particular order!)\u003c/strong\u003e: Audre Lorde, Octavia Butler, N. K. Jemisin, Nnedi Okorafor, Sabrina Vourvoulias,\u00a0Gloria Anzaldua, Assata Shakur, Ana Castillo, Carla Trujillo, Aurora Levins Morales, Saidiya Hartman, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, James Baldwin, Roxane Gay, Carmen Maria Machado, and many more radical queer writers of color.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat your Patreon pledge will do\u003c/strong\u003e: Your financial support will help me write more poems, creative non-fiction essays, and short fiction. Pledges will also help me pay for submission/readings fees for contests and fellowships. Patreons will also get access to some of my previously published work and some of my current working drafts. Thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInformation for One-Time Donations\u003c/strong\u003e: For those who would prefer to make a one-time donation rather than commit to monthly Patreon donations, here is my Square Cash information:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.cash.me/$CeciCab\"\u003ewww.cash.me/$CeciCab\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMil gracias y un abrazo,\u003cbr\u003eCecilia\u003cbr\u003e"
