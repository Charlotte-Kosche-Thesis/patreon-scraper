    "summary": "Hola pueblo,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, I\u0027d like to thank you for being ardent supporters and friends of my digital presence. I\u0027ve been asked several times to create my own online show. This is my attempt at doing so.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the Road to Consciousness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the Road to Consciousness is a series of car and ground\ninterviews with marketing, social media, corporate,\nartistic, philanthropic, and educational connoisseurs with the occasional lighthearted commentary. The short\ninterviews are in the same vein as\nComedians in Cars Getting Coffee, Carpool Karaoke, and The Young Turks with a \u201cconscious\u201d and educated intersectional\nLatino of color as the\u003cbr\u003e\nhost.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom known experts in their respective fields\nwith a large following to \u201cundiscovered\u201d talent and thought leaders, the road and ground interviews will\nbring a different perspective to what is\nbeing offered online and mainstream. \u201cEdutainment\u201d with a bang that will\neither enlighten people or have them careening\ntoward a cognitive\u003cbr\u003e\ndissonance that will bring engagement, but\nthey\u2019ll definitely keep coming\u003cbr\u003e\nback for more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow the show has been pitched to a major Network, but they wanted it to be done in Spanish. My main focus at the moment is with our English-speaking community. Since most of our youth are also bilingual (and usually prefer English), it\u0027s preferable if we launch it in English first. I also would like our independent thought to stay independent. With no strings, no curbing of ideas and thoughts. My social criticism has always been organic, honest, and raw. I\u0027ve managed to be published in both independent and mainstream media because of it. I\u0027d like it to remain as so and so do many others and have full control. Let us run our own shows. Independent media is gaining a lot of ground right now. I\u0027ve successfully launched my own (with writers, editors, web designers, social media strategists), upliftt, so experience and ganas are covered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, this will be achieved.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is how we become part of something for the benefit of us all. As a loyal servant for the community who has been fighting pro bono, I\u0027d like to continue doing so without the many insecurities when one does a project on one\u0027s own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me produce this show so we can elevate and emancipate ourselves without outside validation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s validate ourselves.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little about me:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a strong,\nvocal, and unapologetic activist with a loyal following and a robust social capital that\nspans from coast to coast: Journalists, celebrities, activists, artists,\nexecutives, community\nservants, organizers, and many more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was recently\nnamed one of 40 Under 40: Latinos in American Politics by the Huffington Post. I\u2019ve written\nabout internal and external Latino affairs to several news outlets and quoted\non others: The Huffington Post, NBC, Fox News, Voxxi, Okayafrica, Okayplayer,\nSky News, Salon, The Guardian, Latino Magazine, Vibe, The Hill, and my own online magazine\u2014which\nhas a fan base (celebrities, politicians, activists, blue and white collar\nworkers, immigrants, citizens, and many more) of\nover 23,000 and has reached over a million people\u2014UPLIFTT. I\u2019m familiar with\nhaving an active voice that informs, invigorates, and inspires people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve worked\nwith both corporations and artists as a marketing strategist with a successful track record.\nAs an emotionally intelligent lover and autodidact of human behavior, I live and breathe\nsocial media, multiculturalism, people\u2026 Like all Latinos, I\u2019m an early adaptor and\nover-indexer of new technologies, social media, the media, and all things pop.\nI am familiar with targeted marketing and organic reach. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born in\nthe Dominican Republic and came to America two months shy of turning 13. I managed to\nrise against all odds in a poor, crime-ridden neighborhood in Brooklyn and received a\ncollege education. I am an immigrant who became an American Dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReferences:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eC\u00e9sar has\nthe tenacity, wisdom, experience and relationships to bring a much-needed\nvoice to the masses. Now, that voice is not *the* voice \u2013 which is refreshing. When\nmost are seeking to align themselves with a socially constructed camp, and thus\nbe their voice, C\u00e9sar roams the entire hillside secure in his integrity. He\ntravels among various camps (conventional schools of thought and position) yet\nis also comfortable in the proverbial \u201cno man\u2019s land,\u201d calling out to the rest\nof us to embrace a level of understanding, critical thinking and communal\nawareness that has not been seen since Biblical times. OK, a bit of hyperbole\ntowards the end there-call it artistic license! An artist however, is truly\nwhat C\u00e9sar is. His wit and sarcasm are dismissed at ones own peril as they\nreflect one of the most successful mediums through which serious advancement\nhas been achieved. Fundamentally, he is a creative and passionate professional,\nwhich is what we are all striving for in our own right. C\u00e9sar exists within the\ntension all Latinos experience; highly sought after yet thoroughly dismissed,\npatronized yet exalted, immigrant yet patriot - he just expresses it better\nthan most. - Joshua Mason Program Manager, ReSET (Contra Costa County) at Bay\nArea Community Resources\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eC\u00e9sar is one of my favorite people and I wish we had more\nlike him. Don\u2019t ever expect him to \u201ctoe the company line\u201d- on anything. He is\nloyal to nothing but his own free thinking and morality. To C\u00e9sar, hypocrisy is\nthe greatest sin. He\u2019d rather deal with an upfront jackass than a fake\nactivist. He uses provocative language to inspire others to think for\nthemselves. He\u2019s open to opposing viewpoints \u2013 and of course, he is really\nfunny. - Gary Acosta, Co-Founder and CEO at \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nahrep/?ref=br_rs\"\u003eNAHREP The National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpdate: We\u0027ve raised over $4,000 so far. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
