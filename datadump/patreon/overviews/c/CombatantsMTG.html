While this podcast started out as a way to highlight some of the talented competitive women playing the card game we love, it\u0027s quickly turned into a place for us to grow as MTG players - and, well, as people (as cheesy as that sounds).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe wanted to give back to the community that has shown us so much support through additional content and by beginning our own little community of grinders and players. We could not do this cast without our listeners and we want to keep our content growing and improving so we can give the community the best we have!\u00a0"
