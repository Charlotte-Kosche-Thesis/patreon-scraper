    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWelcome everyone, my name is Alex and I\u2019m the creator of\nCryptoCandor.\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI started the channel as a way for me to focus my energy on\nprojects I felt were worthy of being talked about. When I got into\ncryptocurrencies a year ago I found myself constantly saying, \u201cI need to read\nup on that\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019ll do more research on that later.\u201d Of course life gets busy\nand the end result was I didn\u2019t often have the free time I needed, and when I\ndid I found most projects were so dense and technical I couldn\u2019t get very far!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n  As a resolution I decided to make the channel and focus on one project a week. This would require me to sit down and do some serious research so that I would be knowledgeable enough to discuss it on my YouTube. I also wanted to make a resource for people who are getting involved in crypto for the very first time, or looking for a solid project overview without being overwhelmed by loads of technical jargon like I was when I first started this journey. I have been blown away by the amazing support from everyone and how welcoming the community has been. I want to thank everyone for contributing to what has quickly become a very successful crypto vlog!. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n  A friend recommended\nI make a Patreon, so here I am. I never started this channel with the intention of earning money; but contributions to my work would certainly help me have more free\ntime for research. When the community donates they help keep the content\nflowing on my channel and would help me eventually expand the amount of\nresearch and topics I can include to offer everyone.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThanks for checking out my Patreon page, and I hope you\u0027ll\nconsider supporting the channel!
