    "summary": "\u003cblockquote\u003eMy projects, though seemingly varied, all come down to one thing: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewriting and adventure...telling The Tale. It is my desire to reach new heights by using my talents for the good of all, with an emphasis on the \"Tramps and Freaks\" of the world. Tramps= those who love travel. Freaks= those who live off the beaten path of the \"norm\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes. I\u0027m still writing and recording with SPLICE Records and putting on the unpredictable stage shows. You will support me in making my next album and going on tour and crazy videos from the road. But there\u0027s more! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eEnter another world...\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eImagine if Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell created a D\u0026amp;D campaign, and then J.R.R Tolkien wrote their gaming sessions out as a novel. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eClearly a high bar, but that\u0027s what I\u0027m shooting for in this epic serial tale told from the world called: \u00c9st\u00f3ri\u00e1. Every gaming session that my seven players and I complete, I record, then turn into epic fantasy prose! With an over arching thru-story of, intrigue, incredible villains, romance, and world wide war, a heroes journey of the highest order, watch as seven fascinating characters battle for the salvation of their bonds and desires and the salvation of the entire world! Will they survive? Even I, the author, don\u0027t know! Each role is critical! #critters ;)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI am also working on my first book of mainstream fiction, The \"Things of This Earth\". More on that later. You\u0027re support will hurry that along. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI am starting a YouTube channel of my travels and the crazy tramps and freaks I know, as well as videos on topics regarding my philosophy and psychology degree and my years in a catholic monastery as a monk. This is born from numerous people over many years encouraging me to publish my thoughts and the things I\u0027ve said to them. I\u0027m going to try it, guys! If the things I say actually help people, we can all share this joy. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI have many other projects that I\u0027ll keep secret for now. But none of them are possible without funds. Joining me helps me live my art and acquire new gear, travel for music and videos, pay musicians and assistants, and more. I can\u0027t do it without you! If you know my work, then trust me, hop on in, you\u0027re gonna enjoy the ride! If you\u0027re just meeting me, go ahead, start slow and watch what I do. This will be an adventure on many levels. And anytime you want to stop donating, simply click and stop. No problem.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, roll the dice! Join the community and let\u0027s see where this story leads!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e"
