    "summary": "The Cannabis Culture Blog is all about spreading information among both those already involved in this once counter culture, and those outside the industry as well. \u00a0The website has really taken off as of recently as far as readers go and I can\u0027t thank those of you who subscribe/follow my blog posts enough for what you do. \u00a0I would really like to return the favor by providing content on a more regular basis too keep up with this growing demand for information about this amazing plant. \u00a0Along with that making ad revenue is impossible just because of the stigma that still surrounds the topic of cannabis. \u00a0It takes a lot of education to undo 70 years of war on a very safe psychoactive drug. \u00a0This is the motivation for creating this Patreon page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI became passionate about the movement to legalize marijuana when I myself became informed of the harms of the war on drugs and the countless benefits of this plant. \u00a0I hope to make the same impact through education and get others involved in the rewarding and profitable industry of natural medicine."

With its current legal status and history of being demonized, it\u0027s also important that I reach those with a biased or nonfactual view.\u00a0 Erasing this stigma is a priority of mine and to do it through something I enjoy as much as writing, would be an awesome experience.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",
