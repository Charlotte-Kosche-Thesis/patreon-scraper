In an online world where most parenting sites churn out content like popcorn, we\u0027re going against the grain by letting our words breathe. We want our readers to be able to rest in our content, to fully appreciate each story without feeling rushed to get through it. Our site is 100% ad-free, and we really really like it that way. We live in a noisy world\u2014between clickbait content and ads in our faces 24/7\u2014it\u0027s rare that we enjoy a moment of quiet, especially as mothers.\u00a0We \u003cem\u003edesperately\u003c/em\u003e want to keep Coffee + Crumbs a quiet place ... we want our site to remain a refuge, a breath of fresh air, a place where you can show up morning, noon, or 3am and feel understood.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWe don\u0027t offer advice. \u003c/strong\u003eWe know when it comes to motherhood, advice is everywhere (solicited and unsolicited). We\u0027re not going to tell you how to sleep train, how to potty train, or how to do anything at all. We just want to come alongside you with our own warrior stories and tell you that you\u0027re doing a great job. Instead of offering advice, we offer ourselves.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWe keep it real.\u003c/strong\u003e Our stories are honest, raw, and vulnerable. Always. We never shy away from talking about things like miscarriage, body image, infertility, postpartum depression, etc. We don\u0027t gloss over the messy, broken parts of motherhood; instead, we approach these topics with our whole hearts, as truthfully and bravely as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWe also offer hope\u003c/strong\u003e. We care very deeply about telling the truth, about naming our scars and writing openly about our struggles. But rarely will you find us wallowing. You\u0027ll almost always find us looking for light among the darkness.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWe are crazy intentional.\u003c/strong\u003e We approach every essay, every podcast episode, every newsletter, and every offering we put out to the world with great love and intention. We are not careless with our writing or our speech or even the e-mails we send to our subscribers. We take our roles in this space very seriously, and consider it an honor and privilege that we get to use our creative gifts to encourage mothers around the globe. It is always our prayer that we would be good stewards here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eand finally,\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOur readers are really, really, really kind.\u003c/strong\u003e Seriously. We have no idea what we ever did to deserve this, but the comments we receive on our site are 99% positive. Our community of readers (that\u0027s you!) have shown tremendous grace and respect toward our writers. We want to believe this is the law of attraction at work, and that the space we\u0027ve worked hard to create has attracted an amazing audience. When you support Coffee + Crumbs, you\u0027re also supporting an entire community that has shown respect, kindness, and grace to one another on a regular basis.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: But I already get to enjoy Coffee + Crumbs for free; why should I give you my money?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is a great question! Here are a few reasons: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e1.\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eWe think maintaining a clean, simple, beautiful website adds to the reader experience.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Websites like ours typically make money one way: through advertising. Our site is currently ad-free and we would \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e love to keep it that way.\u00a0We want to keep C+C a quiet place for mothers in an already-too-noisy world. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e2. \u003cstrong\u003eWe believe the art that we create at Coffee + Crumbs is valuable\u003c/strong\u003e, and we hope you do, too. When you support us financially, you are encouraging and affirming us as writers and artists.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e3. \u003cstrong\u003eWe cannot grow without this.\u003c/strong\u003e We have hopes and dreams to grow C+C in the future through adding paid staff and pursuing more opportunities to connect with and encourage you (iPhone app, in-person events, etc). We want Coffee + Crumbs to reach its full potential, and with your help, it\u0027s possible!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\t***\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCool, but . . .

But before we sell our souls (kidding, kind of), we wanted to give our readers the opportunity to vote with their dollars. Being financially supported by our readers would be a dream come true.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\t***\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, okay, you\u0027ve convinced me . . . but why aren\u0027t you guys asking for more money? $1 a month? $5 a month? Why aren\u0027t you asking for $20 or $50?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eWe believe in the power of community! If everyone who regularly reads C+C gave $1 a month, we\u0027d surpass our first goal right away. We don\u0027t want to be a financial burden for anyone, which is why we set our rewards at such small amounts.
