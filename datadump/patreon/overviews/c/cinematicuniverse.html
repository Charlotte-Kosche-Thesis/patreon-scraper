Along the way we also recommend related reading for Joe to explore, compete to pitch our not-always-entirely-serious ideas for future superhero films, and run through the latest comic book movie and TV news. Every other week, we also put out a minisode in which some or all of us get together to catch up on the news and generally discuss anything else that might be going on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince launching in January 2015, we\u0027ve put out over 150 episodes and minisodes, which you can find on\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://cinematicuniverse.libsyn.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLibsyn\u003c/a\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/cinematicuniverse\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiTunes\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eand\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/70CiEX7JZvzzYCjoBXuXyX?si=ocVPsAMnQOab14jnYV1mkA\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpotify\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. Anything either featuring a superhero or based on a comic book is fair game, so as well as the MCU, DCEU and other universes, we\u0027ve also covered everything from \u003cem\u003eGhost World \u003c/em\u003eto \u003cem\u003eScott Pilgrim\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eTank Girl\u003c/em\u003e to \u003cem\u003eKick-Ass\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eDredd \u003c/em\u003eto \u003cem\u003eHoward the Duck\u003c/em\u003e. We\u0027ve met three Peter Parkers, seen two Johnny Storms redeem themselves, and watched Hugh Jackman go from Young Man Logan to Old Man Logan. We\u2019ve also featured guest experts including Sarah Dobbs (SFX, Total Film), Caroline Siede (The AV Club), Al Kennedy (House to Astonish) and Michael Leader (Sight \u0026amp; Sound, Film4).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe think we\u0027re just about the best podcast out there for insightful, knowledgeable and entertaining coverage of this genre - we love these films and these characters, and if we sometimes get a little angry about Zack Snyder, well... that\u0027s done with affection too. Our aim is always to be accessible and entertaining whether you\u0027re as much of an obsessive as Seb and James are, or if you\u0027re as new to this world as Joe was three years ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO WE WANT?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSimply put, our Patreon is here to keep the podcast going. We all have full-time jobs, so we\u0027re not looking at it as a way to make money - but conversely, \u003cem\u003ebecause\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0we all have full-time jobs (and families), for the podcast to be worth the time we spend on it every week it needs to support itself. That means hosting costs, recording equipment, travel, cinema tickets, movie rentals, comics research and prizes for you guys - this is all stuff that the Patreon budget pays for, and so far we haven\u0027t taken a single penny of profit for ourselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s not a complaint, either - we\u0027re more than happy to put every bit of cash the Patreon earns back into making the podcast, and indeed Cinematic Universe as a whole, a better experience for you the listener. If our income rises, then we\u0027ll look to start spending it on exciting things such as production of merchandise and possibly even some public events like quizzes or screenings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO YOU GET?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone who backs us on Patreon gets to read our behind-the-scenes updates and hear occasional offcut material from episodes, as well as getting at least one entry into our monthly competition. Each month we create a post showing what prize (or indeed prizes) are on offer - usually toys, comics or DVDs - and if you want to enter, you just leave us a comment. The winner\u0027s name will be drawn randomly, BUT - you get one entry in the draw for every dollar you back us at, up to a maximum of 50.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s more, our goals system is set to oblige us to make a new bonus episode every time we reach a new target - and these bonus episodes are \u003cstrong\u003epermanently \u003c/strong\u003eexclusive to any Patron contributing $2 or more. They allow us to go into a bit more detail on topics outside the main episodes, including some comics discussion. $2 backers also get early access to occasional \"regular\" bonus episodes that later show up on the main public feed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who really want to go above and beyond, we have a couple of higher tiers, too: at $10, we\u0027ll feed your vanity and give you a shoutout on every episode of the show; and at $20, you can also tell us if you want us to plug something in the \"This episode is brought to you by\" section of an ep, and we\u0027ll do that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support us already, at any level, then we\u0027re hugely grateful. Probably everyone says it, but it\u0027s backers like you that enables us to keep doing what we\u0027re doing - we enjoy it, and we hope you do too. And we want to keep doing it even better and better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers!\u003cbr\u003eJoe, Seb \u0026amp; James"
