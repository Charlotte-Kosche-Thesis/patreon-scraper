My name is Calvin Thomas and I am a singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist based in Maryland. I also produce and arrange music as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first started livestreaming almost 2 years ago, I didn\u0027t know the world that I had tapped into as well as how far my reach could be. And I\u0027ve met so many people not just on Periscope but in person as well. And I never thought I would do anything like that, AT ALL.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhen I do my broadcasts and I sing to all of my returning fans and friends, I come across moments where people say awesome things about my music and also say that it helped them get through the day. Or even, that it helped them get through dark days. And that really puts things in perspective for me. It made me say to myself, \"People REALLY believe in what I do. And, those same people really want to get behind anything that I do.\" This is one of the main reasons I showed up here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA handful of musicians I follow have been on Patreon for quite some time and the community they talk to and live for are behind them 100%. And now it\u0027s my turn to do the same for the community that supports me. As I move forward in my journey, I want to take them with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a great way to really connect with the awesome people who believe in your passion and will stand by you from beginning to end. You can support my content for as little as $1 a month and you get awesome rewards! At the same time, you can help me develop better content CONSISTENTLY. All of your funds are used for a variety of things, which include things like making high-quality singles and/or albums, getting better instruments, better music gear, video equipment (like lighting gear, a new PC, and/or a high-resolution camera), and studio equipment.\u00a0 It also helps me pay my bills.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou all challenge me. You all want me to shoot for greater things. And most importantly, you all want me to live the best that I can. Am I fortunate to have met all of you awesome people? I wanna say YES. Absolutely.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve got goals, we\u0027ve got rewards, we\u0027ve got content made only for you all. SO...let\u0027s get the ball rolling.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all very much for your support and I can\u0027t wait to see what the future holds!"

I am also a producer, writer, and composer, working with DAWs such as Reaper, Cubase 8, and Presonus Studio One to record demos for my own projects and my friends\u0027 projects as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began playing music at a young age. Although I played some piano and some drums as a kid (as well as a bit of singing), it was guitar (both acoustic and electric) that set the stage for my musical career. When I turned 13, my dad bought me my first guitar and the journey began.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am very active on all kinds of social media, including Youtube, Facebook, and Soundcloud; those places are great for releasing content. However it was Periscope that allowed me to do that as well as to\u00a0meet so many awesome people in New Jersey, New York City, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. In fact, it allowed me to interact with people across the world. And it gave me the fuel I needed to start recording tracks for an album (which is now titled October Sky), get my 1st ever photoshoot, and travel along the east coast to perform with super talented and super friendly musicians. And because of Periscope, that led me to Patreon, where I start the next phase of my musical journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t wait to see where my music career will take me next.
