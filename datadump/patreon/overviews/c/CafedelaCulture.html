I love creating\u00a0multi-sensory experiences that move people to action.\u00a0I believe that the world will be a better place with more women in leadership and in celebrating and embracing diversity of gender, culture and sexual orientation. I believe that it starts with poetry, art, conversation, common humanity, good food and wine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve created a new poetic, ensemble theater production called \u201cThe Alchemy of Imperfection,\u201d a poetic piece which explores and illuminates intersectional feminism and universal female experiences that defy cultural boundaries. This performance is part of my new event, \u201cThe Courageous Vulnerability #MeToo Tour\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCafe de la Culture is known for drawing an extraordinary blend of diverse participants socio-economically, culturally, and professionally. The most exciting thing to me is bringing a room full of people together of different ages, cultures and backgrounds who might not otherwise meet each other, to explore an important question that\u0027s difficult to answer and even talk about. When people come in the spirit of curiosity and discovery, that\u0027s the space in which vital ideas and new vision is born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am fundraising to create more events and bring my new project, \"\u003ca href=\"https://tinyurl.com/ybqvplx5\"\u003eThe Courageous Vulnerability #MeToo Tour\u003c/a\u003e\" to more cities and communities nation-wide.

Next, I aim to continue touring this maleand lgtb inclusive, community-building, world class, theater-for-social-change performances and conference panel discussions around the #MeToo movement to more cities and communities nation-wide. In each city, I curate a new group of local activists, artists, academics and luminaries from diverse backgrounds, ages and fields to join in the conversation. These events are also always Livestreamed from each location, to be inclusive of a global audience. I am now developing podcasts of conversations and round table discussions leading up to each event.
