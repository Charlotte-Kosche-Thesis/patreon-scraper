This is a place where you can see never before seen uncensored film images from my archives and my ongoing shoots.\u00a0 My Patreon babes will also have an exclusive look at projects where I am the subject, and get to know me and my work on a more personal level.\u00a0 Knowing who you are helps me feel comfortable sharing who I am, which is a wild, unfiltered woman.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u221e\u2248\u221eabout what drives me\u221e\u2248\u221e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe times where we are owning our bodies and lives are the times we are the most human. \u00a0When our image can coincide with what\u0027s happening inside of us and it\u0027s \u003cem\u003ejust for us\u003c/em\u003e, that\u0027s what I live for visually. \u00a0Sometimes my shoots are sexy, but it is never meant to illicit emotions from the audience. \u00a0The sexiness that you witness oozing from the people in my images belongs solely to them, it is a personal exploration of longing, sensuality, and the human desire to be recognized.\u00a0 I choose to shoot film because I love the way it accurately captures the moment. \u00a0No photoshop, no 1,000 images edited down to a single select. \u00a0Real, true, human moments, full of love, pain, sex, sleep, food, drugs, exhaustion and all the other juicy shit we live in. \u00a0These are the moments that I love to shoot.
