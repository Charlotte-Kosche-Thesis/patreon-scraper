    "summary": "Hi. I\u0027m Caelum. In a very distant past, I created two JKA clans and worked as JK3Files reviewer. I also created JKHub, and I created the popular server hosting business at \u003ca href=\"https://jka.io,\"\u003ehttps://jka.io\u003c/a\u003e, which is to say I host around 40 JKA servers and provide them with security updates, DDoS mitigation, and so forth. I also host a bunch of big clan websites, JKHub itself, and manage various misc projects like the JKHub master server.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike most people, I do need money to buy food, pay rent, and so forth. I\u0027m in my twenties, and not getting stinking rich any time soon. While JKA server hosting gives me some income, it\u0027s not near enough to live off exclusively. I have limited time and energy, and I\u0027d like to spend more of it working on cool JKA things. That\u0027s where this Patreon comes in; it enables me to spend more of my time doing that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past, this Patreon was used to let me return to JKHub staff - I just wouldn\u0027t have the ability to do it for free at this point in my life. Thanks to donators\u0027 support, I was able to come out of retirement and give JKHub a lot more love than it was getting, especially on a technical level. I continue to be an active JKHub staff member today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese days, this Patreon is mainly used to support me and my work on JKA: more donations let me buy more software and better servers for JKHub, and spend more of my time fixing bugs, working on new JKA projects, and generally making JKA better. To be clear though: this is not an official JKHub patreon, and proceeds don\u0027t go to JKHub exclusively, or to other staff members, all of whom are unpaid volunteers doing an amazing job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, I do pay for all of JKHub\u0027s expenses out of my own pocket now, and thus indirectly, this Patreon helps me keep doing that. Before this Patreon existed, JKHub would ask for yearly donations, but that\u0027s no longer necessary thanks to this.\u003cbr\u003e"
