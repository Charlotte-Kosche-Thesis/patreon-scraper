He studied philosophy at UC Davis and then got a Master\u2019s in Writing from CSULA. His first professional break came in 2010 when he sold a short prose story called \u201cTabula Rasa\u201d to Fox\u2019s Neopulp website (which, sadly, no longer exists.)\u003cbr\u003eSince then, Searnold has written for a wide variety of mediums, including theatre (\u201cA Fairly Obvious Parallel\u201d), webseries (\u201cTeacher\u2019s Lounge\u201d), movies (\u201cDon\u2019t Fall Asleep\u201d), and his most favoritest: comic books (\u201cBehind the Hero\u201d, \u201cLately Something\u2019s Changed\u201d).\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, Searnold resides in a cabin in the mountains outside of Los Angeles, serves as personal assistant to comics legend Scott Lobdell, and writes comics for CompletelyDifferentComics.com.\u003cbr\u003e",
