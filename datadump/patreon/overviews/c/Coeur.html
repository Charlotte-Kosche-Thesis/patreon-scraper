    "summary": "Hi, Coeur al\u0027Aran here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a writer based in the UK, and have been involved in the industry for nearly ten years now. I\u0027ve always been involved in journalism, editorial and freelance work - but recently took to fiction because it has always been a dream of mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this Patreon as a way to support this hobby, and perhaps turn it into something more. To enable me to write, but also to share my own expertise with writing to those who are interested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, we\u0027ve ballooned into a community of our own, and I\u0027m thankful to all who have joined or taken part. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write... I write fiction, I write Visual Novels, I write fan fiction and I also teach lessons on writing to students who wish to become writers of their own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find my work online, be it my fan fiction on fanfiction.net or, when it is released, the Visual Novel I am working on with TBG Productions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons can look forward to writing articles, where I delve into the intricacies of Plot Structure, Fight Scenes, Romance Stories - and so much more. I also offer personal 1-1 lessons, the details of which are included in the pledge sections. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing off-site will certainly continue, especially my fan fiction, which is a great hobby of mine and will always remain free of charge. Beyond that, however, I am working with a Visual Novel Dev Team, and I\u0027ll hopefully be able to bring you some exciting new content in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen those start to come to fruition, I will see about keys for supporters - and maybe some posts with images on how it is going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s to come?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTowards the latter half of 2017, the plan is also to begin work on a novel of our own, but it will come with a twist. I shall be painstakingly writing each chapter here on Patreon, in a way that will show you how I go about developing a story from scratch. We will look at what structure I use, how I write each and every scene, but you will also get to see a story in its rawest form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach change I make will be explained and discussed, and you\u0027ll even be able to see as I go over and edit it - because post-story editing is without a doubt the most complicated and important part of creating a story you actually wish to try and sell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd hey, maybe we\u0027ll send it off to a publisher afterwards to see what they think.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, and if you have any questions, don\u0027t hesitate to drop me a message!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCoeur al\u0027Aran\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
