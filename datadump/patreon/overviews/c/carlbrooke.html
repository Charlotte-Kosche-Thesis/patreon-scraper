    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eJacques\nCousteau once said \u201cpeople only protect what they love.\u201d I have taken this up\nas a challenge to get you to love the world\u2019s oceans, But how? How can I get\nyou to love the world oceans without being able to see below the surface? How\ndo I get you to love all the wonderful and beautiful creatures that call it\nhome? That\u2019s the trick. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo much\nmedia presents the worlds oceans as a scary place full for vicious sharks and\nother creatures like the \"Kracken\". Media has scared most folks out\nof the seas, as such they are now mostly afraid of what they do not know. Since\nfolks don\u0027t love what is in the oceans, they do not care what happens to it or\nhow their daily decisions affect it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nI am in the\nprocess of boat buying and I will be purchasing a good used sailboat. I will\nfix up the boat while sailing around the world. Filming and Vlogging about my\njourney, experiences and interactions. As a scuba diver, I will do my best to\nshow you why you should love the oceans and all that reside within them. That\nis my goal. That is my challenge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will be\nparticipating in and with, several citizen science projects and data collection\nefforts. We will be doing our own water tests while underway. Testing for PH.\nTDS. Salinity, Hardness and Temperature. Our starting list of organizations we\nare working with is: Reef.org and the ASC Micro Plastic Study. We hope to also\ncollect data for shark, whale, dolphin and turtle research, among others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhy a\nsailboat? Sailing is the eco-friendliest means of travel. Powered by the wind\nwith reserve diesel power. Our intent, is to have the smallest carbon footprint\npossible, while conducting a great amount of research and data collection. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWho are we?\nJust a grandfather and his dog, who is deeply concerned about our planet and\nespecially about the creatures in the world\u2019s oceans. I am a YouTuber, scuba\ndiver, sailor, storyteller and adventurer. We anticipate having visiting\nscientist on board from time to time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow at the request on our viewers we are setting up this Patreon page to allow our viewers to participate and support the hard work that goes into this effort. As you are reading this, you must be considering supporting what we are doing. Please do, We appreciate all that our viewers do for us and hope that we can continue to put up useful and motivational videos for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe funds raised thru Patreon will be used to purchase production equipment to help bring you more and better videos. It will also be used to support the costs associated in our citizen scientist projects. Items like postage, collection equipment, etc. We also have a long wish list of items that would help with our efforts, items such as a compressor to refill Scuba tanks, a ROV to get footage at deeper depths or in polluted or dangerous waters, like in oils spills, alge blooms, etc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please do support our efforts. It will be well spent and greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs this is a Vlog we produce a lot of videos. Sometimes every day. So when you consider how much to donate, just remember you can set a monthly max. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks Carl\u003cbr\u003e"
