    "summary": "I started the channel in what was one of the more challenging times in my life. I did the college thing, got a degree, traveled and found what some might call decent work, but it left me deeply unsatisfied. I wasn\u0027t really sure what I was going to do, so I just started taking things out of my life trying to figure out where this elusive happiness thing was that I\u0027d heard so much about, yet had been unable to find in my own life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI gave up pretty much everything... Music, TV, internet, family, drugs, friends, relationships. You name it, I\u0027ve quit it and sure at times it felt like it helped, but still I found myself at odds with the world. There was a void and I didn\u0027t know what to fill it with. Eventually it got to the point where that wasn\u0027t much left in there and it was around that time that I had to decide what I wanted to fill my life with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t say the decision to start making DJ mixes was a conscious one. At the time I was living in an empty apartment. I\u0027d thrown away most of my life, but my turntables and records were just that one part of me that I couldn\u0027t part with. So I made a mix and much to my surprise... It felt good. Not much in my life felt good at that point so when I found something that did, I ran with it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat was about three and a half years ago. My life has changed quite a bit since then. Making these mixes has reconnected me with a dream of myself that I had long ago, but lost due to circumstance and a series of pretty stupid choices. I can\u0027t say that I\u0027m still not angry, or confused or even bitter at times. The world isn\u0027t always a nice place, but the work that I have done here has shown me that I\u0027m not alone. That I have something of worth to offer the world and that no talent is worth anything unless it is brought into the world and shared.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou all have made this channel what is is. Your belief in me and my mixes has inspired me to take this weird little hobby of mine and take it as far as I possibly can. Just look at my mixes last year and compare them to what I release now. Or even the mixes from two years ago, if you dare... The growth, clarity of vision, feeling and power of the mixes just keeps growing. I have no idea how far I can take it and I find that exciting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough the creative process I\u0027ve found a way to challenge my own ideas of who I am which has led me to being able redefine them on my own terms. It\u0027s growth and power and a beautiful process and I can\u0027t thank you enough for joining me on this journey. It\u0027s going to be a good one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your continued support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Nick\u003cbr\u003e"
