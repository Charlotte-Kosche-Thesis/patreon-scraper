However, recent multiplayer titles are all online-only, which is all well and good; but doesn\u0027t it detract from the nature of playing games together? Seemingly gone are the days of split screen and LAN gaming, getting together for the sole purpose of enjoy good company and good games together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery month we get an increasingly large group of gamers together to play games and have a good time. Obviously, we put a heavy emphasis on Multiplayer games, so for at least 12 hours a month we play games from the likes of Quake, Star Wars Battlefront II and Halo to Overwatch, Super Smash Bros. and Rocket League, to name a few. We live-stream the whole thing, so you can watch the games from your own home, and the footage is later published to YouTube so we can all relive the good times and, of course, the madness.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nAll of the volunteers at CulLAN all students at the University of Lincoln, so while we would love to pour all of our time and resources into CulLAN, at this time we don\u0027t have that flexibility. Studies, work and life in general keep us otherwise occupied for most of the month, though we all keep counting the days to the next CulLAN. Patreon gives us the flexibility and extra funding we need to keep improving CulLANs every month. We\u0027re always looking for ways to make CulLAN better, such as with more \nhigh-quality equipment, more prize-filled tournaments or being able to \nhire larger spaces to accommodate our rapidly growing group of gamers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I get anything out of pledging?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eYes, your patronship grants you access to all kinds of great things; including a title and exclusive channels in our Discord server, access to the exclusive content posted below and the ability to join us in online games at future CulLANs if you can\u0027t be there in person!

With this goal achieved, we can start looking at building a dedicated streaming and recording PC, making CulLAN completely independent to my own PC (which I also use for work, games, etc.), meaning we don\u0027t need to rip apart my desk every month to stream and record! This will also mean we can put more time into editing videos to post onto YouTube, as well as more Patreon exclusives. Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e",
