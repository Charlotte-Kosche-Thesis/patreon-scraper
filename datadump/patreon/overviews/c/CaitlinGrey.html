It\u0027s taken me a while to get this going, but I\u0027m here now and I\u0027m going to do my very best to bring you some wonderful music. \u003cbr\u003eGot questions? :-) Okey dokey, here we go!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I doing here?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t already know, Patreon is a fantastic home for artists (that\u0027s me!) and their supporters (that\u0027s you...hopefully!) to get to know each other a bit better. A place to hang out and interact on a much more personal level. A place to share new music, ideas and songs that won\u0027t be available to view anywhere else online! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I support you on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell I\u0027m glad you asked. Patreon is a bit like Kickstarter crowdfunding, except that it allows a smaller ongoing pledge amount for\u00a0mini creations\u00a0rather than a larger one-off amount for a big project like an album or a film. This means that every time I post a song, you pledge an amount of your choice, from $1 upwards to whatever you feel you\u0027d like to pay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get for pledging my money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn return for pledging your hard-earned money to me for my music, I\u0027ll be offering lots of lovely goodies in the form of \u0027rewards\u0027. There are various levels of rewards for your pledge amount and you only pay what you can afford.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I pay per month?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo. On my page, you\u0027ll pay your pledge amount per song. That way, if I don\u0027t upload anything, you don\u0027t pay, rather than paying per month regardless. So, for example, every time I upload a song, you\u0027ll pay your pledge amount as ongoing support for me.\u00a0Also, you can set a cap on the amount you\u0027d like to pay so that you\u00a0never pay more than you want. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I cancel anytime?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, of course, you can cancel your pledge amount at any time you like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA bit more info!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo chums, I am hoping, with your help, to make upload two songs per month where I will sing a cover song, from requests sent in by you, and also an original song for you.\u00a0Most of \u00a0the songs will be acoustic. Yes, just me and Neil, my co-writer and guitarist. Very intimate and exclusive. We\u0027re going to do some lovely pared-down versions of our songs from the albums and some covers that you have asked me to sing. So, without further ado, I\u0027ve put up a selection of goodies/rewards for you to check out and if anything catches your eye and you\u0027d like to become a patron, well, that would be fantastic. I am so very grateful to anyone who buys a download or pledges to support me, I wouldn\u0027t be doing any of this without you, my wonderful music friends. If you don\u0027t want to become a patron, no problem at all, there\u0027ll still be plenty of songs for you to listen to. I\u0027m just happy to have you here sharing my music with me. I am honoured and humbled at the support I receive and\u00a0I can\u0027t tell you how much it means to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn a nutshell.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust to confirm, pledges are made per song and you can set a cap on how much you\u0027d like to pledge each month so you don\u0027t go over your own limit. I\u0027m hoping to put out at least two videos per month, so that should give you some idea of the cost to you, if you choose to pledge. Yay! I will also be posting some chatty videos but these will not be included in the pledges. I\u0027ll just want to catch up with you every now and again. I\u0027m new at this folks (the Patreon thingy, not the singing...eek!) so bear with me while I find my feet!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis is going to be awesome!!\u003cbr\u003eCheerio for now chums...see you on the inside. :-)) Much love, Caitlin xxx\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
