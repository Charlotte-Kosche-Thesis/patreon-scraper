I also do side projects like \u003ca href=\"http://klack.bandcamp.com\"\u003eKlack\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://beautyqueenautopsy.bandcamp.com\"\u003eBeauty Queen Autopsy\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://thecausticles.bandcamp.com\"\u003eThe Causticles\u003c/a\u003e. I create a ton of music and also things like the (currently sporadic) \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/causticmusic/videos/?ref=page_internal\"\u003eIndustrial Gossipz\u003c/a\u003e video series, where I do a tell all on all the dirt in the industrial music scene.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my music is released as pay what you want, which I prefer because I know a lot of people have tight budgets and can\u0027t necessarily afford to pay for music. I want the most people hearing this stuff as possible, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat doesn\u0027t mean this music is free for me to make though, as I have overhead like anyone else (and a limited budget, like everyone else:)), and on top of it I have a crazy amount of limited time as a dad with two jobby jobs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this Patreon in 2016 as a means to supplement my income and help pay for all things Caustic.  Your generous support means I may sleep less because I\u0027m writing cool music for you, but it also means you\u0027re improving my life, even if it\u0027s only for a buck a month. It all adds up.\u00a0 Honestly I just want people hearing this exclusive music, so jump on board with whatever you want, get a TON of exclusive music (two full albums so far-- 2016\u0027s ULTRASANE and 2017\u0027s NOT ANGRY, JUST DISAPPOINTED) and a lot of unreleased/exclusive old material as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2018\u0027s album is called GRIP, and it\u0027s going to be a banger. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and know that your support is helping me do what I love. It\u0027s win-win in my book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks.\u003cbr\u003e"
