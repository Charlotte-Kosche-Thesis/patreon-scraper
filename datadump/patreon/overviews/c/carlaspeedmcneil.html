    "summary": "\u00a0 My art already looks different because of your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 My watercolor skills are strictly first-year student at this point, but all of my friends and colleagues who have had to listen to me moan about how I wish I could find the time to learn to paint can tell you: it\u0027s practically a miracle that I got started at all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0But I HAVE started, thanks to you. So THANK YOU. I\u0027ll keep posting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Check out this one:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54af012ae4b016e812fff661/t/5940261017bffc3fb9fdd159/1497376299655/?format=1500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 This is ONEIRADORA, which means DREAM GIFTS. I think the logo needs a little tweaking. I was looking at BONE when I designed it. It is, or would be, a webcomic, ideally fifteen pages a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0ONEIRADORA is about a college kid named Nira. Nira is \"half magic,\" which means a lot of weird things are permanent parts of her life. She\u0027s a lucid dreamer, and her hair changes colors when she has a particularly vivid experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0Nira has a dream lover. She\u0027s always assumed that he\u0027s just part of the rest of the nonsense... it\u0027s just very nice nonsense. She\u0027s about to discover that he\u0027s a real person who lives far away in so many more ways than the obvious. It\u0027s a fantasy long-distance relationship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0There is SO MUCH to this story. I have been picking away at it for nearly ten years, and I know almost everything about it, but here\u0027s the thing: I will never, ever find time to work on this. It\u0027s a big story, I don\u0027t think of myself as a writer, and so far no publisher has gone for this, for one reason or another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0I\u0027d love to do this as a webcomic here on Patreon. It literally will never exist without your support. If you guys want to see more of this, and you don\u0027t mind throwing me some coin, I can make this happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0FINDER will wrap up here in October, but if folks are interested, I can start posting pages from ONEIRADORA. I really really really REALLY want to do this book. It\u0027s so much fun. I could start blathering about all the stuff I have crammed into it, but if I\u0027m actually gonna DO this book, they would be spoilers. I just want to do the book itself, and stop just thinking about it. So whattaya say, amazing Patrons? Get this horse over the jumps?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFINDER is a speculative fiction comic. That means I read all kinds of Science and speculate about how it might fit into the world I created, how it might change things and the people who have to live with it, and I\u0027m sure I get it all wrong, but that\u0027s why I write fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I think I am moving into a new phase of my career in large part because of support on Patreon. When you\u0027re starting out, there\u0027s a long period of experimentation, figuring out how to get good results out of various tools. You get some success with a nib, a brush, a stylus, you get into a groove, and the need to focus reduces time to experiment. Life intrudes. A time-turner can put more hours into a day, but not into your life. For years I\u0027ve been a dog between two bones: digital paint? Or watercolor? One requires a big outlay of cash. Both require a big outlay of time: time I didn\u0027t have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0I didn\u0027t have it because freelancing is great, but strongly inclines the freelancer to work constantly. My own strategy was always to find steps in my drawing process that could be streamlined or eliminated to make it faster, so I could have time to focus on improving my work. But it\u0027s always been like only wearing one shoe. I could work on one thing, tentatively try one new tool, and then only when I had to. Time to learn a whole new discipline like painting just wasn\u0027t in the cards. I\u0027m not a perfectionist, I\u0027d tell myself, just kick it out there and keep moving. But I spent last week really throwing myself into learning some things about watercolor in order to make the cover for my next FINDER paperback better. I posted loads of scans of the stages of the first version of the painting here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0Yeah, \"first version.\" I ended up doing three. I will post them here too. I can\u0027t say I\u0027m Sargent or Homer or any great master, but I\u0027m finally able to turn out a publishable painting, and I think this art phase of my career is partly due to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0They say you have to make your work your best, because in the end, it\u0027s the work that has a chance to last. That can paralyze you. You can\u0027t spend a year redrawing one page or repainting one cover. At the end of that year, it won\u0027t be \"perfect,\" it\u0027ll just be different. But the learning represented by the three versions of this cover, including the final, will show in my work going forward. I\u0027ve always done my best within the constraints of the time that I had, but support here on Patreon has already had an effect on my work. I can do more. I\u0027d like to know what you all would like to see me do for you. But your support so far has already enabled me to get the engine sloooowwwly turning over. Thank you all SO MUCH."
