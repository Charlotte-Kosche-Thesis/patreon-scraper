     "about": "Greetings, witchlings~ Thanks for checking out my Patreon!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy passion, I love to write and dig into the \"Why?\" of things. Sharing our thoughts, ideas, experiences, and the lens through which we view the world is necessary for answering big questions and shaping a future for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eBy life experience, I worked hard in high school. I completed about half of my Associate of Science during that time, in addition to completing a pharmacy technician training program. I passed the PTCB exam, and shortly thereafter I took a job in a retail pharmacy working as a tech. After several years of being harassed on the job (called gay, feminine, and so much more), having my life \u0026amp; limbs threatened one too many times, and a bunch of other ridiculous stuff.. I quit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was too much to handle, and then life became too much to handle. Having a major breakdown while studying and working can be quite unmanageable. I was studying at the University of Texas at Austin during this period, and my grades took a hit. During this period, though, I found myself. As a phoenix rises from its ashes, I found my flame. I began to trust myself more, listen a little longer to what my internal stream of consciousness had to say. I no longer wanted to travel against my own current, I fancied flowing with it. After twenty years of torture (from myself, mostly), I am awake \u0026amp; alive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI completed my Bachelor of Science in Radiation Physics resuscitated, but the plans that I had made previously no longer applied. My GPA was too low to be competitive within the programs that I could reasonably look towards given my circumstances, and most jobs that I might be compatible with generally require experience or credentials beyond what I have and can afford.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurther, after having experienced the \"older\" STEM culture, I realized that I probably would be unlikely to find employment as myself. I\u0027m a trans woman, not a rock. I know when I\u0027m going to face opposition. So, after watching so many people help others through YouTube, I decided to bring anything I can do to help to the table.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of that is in the form of love and acceptance, a message that says to unapologetically love who you are no matter the obstacles set in your path. In addition to that, though, fight for your right to exist and be as you are. If nothing else, do it to spite the people that oppose you, because things will get better if we collectively awaken and force it to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s make this world better together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eGwynevere~\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
