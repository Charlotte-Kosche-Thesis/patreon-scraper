    "summary": "Hey there! I\u0027m Colette Arrand, poet, essayist, critic, and all the other things a writer adds after their name to make them sound busy. If you know who I am, you\u0027ve maybe seen my work on the internet, in a literary magazine, or on Twitter. Or, more likely than not, you\u0027re my friend and you\u0027ve come to support me and you\u0027re the greatest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m taking a risk this year, leaving my PhD program and learning a new trade. The good news is that dropping out has significantly improved my mental health and physical well-being. The bad news is that I\u0027m no longer an employee at the University of Georgia, which is by far the largest employer where I live, and as such I am losing the majority of my monthly income. While I can replace some of that with my work as a transcriptionist and other odd-jobs I pick up around town, it would be great if I could turn the work I do as a writer into groceries or an electric bill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m on Patreon because the majority of the writing that I publish as a poet is unpaid, and most of the work I produce as a critic is subject to the whims and budgets of the few venues that have space for it.\u00a0Your support will enable me to create more, tour more, and exist independently in a field that doesn\u0027t exactly hold the doors open for impolite trans women. I\u0027ve done a good job of building a platform for myself. If you\u0027ve enjoyed any of the work that I\u0027ve done as a poet, as a podcaster, as a blogger, or as a critic, I hope you\u0027ll consider supporting that platform.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve tried to work the reward tiers in a way that will make me do more writing, and in a fashion that\u0027s a fair return on what you put in. Think of it as an ongoing commission, where you get to ask me to write something, and I, like Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel, try to fit as many dicks into your commission as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxoxo,\u003cbr\u003eColette\u003cbr\u003e"
