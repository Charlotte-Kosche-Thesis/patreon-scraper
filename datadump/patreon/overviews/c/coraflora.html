A few months ago my computer broke, and despite my manifestation efforts, I still don\u0027t have one of my own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy belief is that life is a perfect flow of energy, and when things seem to not be working out, there is a lesson to be learned. I\u0027ve done a lot of soul searching and realized that although what I was doing before was amazing, it\u0027s time to deeply devote myself to my deepest purpose of recording, touring, and making awesome music videos of the songs that pulsate passionately through me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe internet is amazing - it has allowed me to connect with a global audience and meet soul family around the world. I am so grateful that I\u0027ve had the opportunity to connect with beautiful souls who love my music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few months ago I decided to offer my music freely, by donation. It felt amazing and I trust that choice. My YouTube videos are all free to watch and because I love to have any choice of interesting music in them, I don\u0027t receive income from them. I\u0027m presently booking a tour across North America and Europe, but there are tools I need to make this happen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all had me wondering, how can I engage the magical powers and people of the internet to be supported financially as I create and share my music?\u00a0I\u0027m open to exploring the new - and Patreon offers a revolutionary new way to support the music you love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can this benefit you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a beloved benefactor or benefactress, you have a unique opportunity to be a part of the loving supportive energy that brings this music into the world. They say it takes a village to raise a child - in this case it takes a community to help a musician share her music with the world successfully. You can enjoy my songs, shows, and videos with the extra heart-warming feeling of knowing you truly, deeply, sincerely helped me share them with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis platform offers us a great are to connect. There will be patron-only livestream concerts every month, vlogs especially for you, and a special area where you can connect with me online.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is this Monthly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tried doing an Indiegogo (like Kickstarter) campaign a few years ago to record an album, but it didn\u0027t quite reach the amount I needed in the short time frame. A lot of energy was put into promoting it and then I ended up feeling deflated when my goal wasn\u0027t met. The flow of this inspired me to consider new ways of releasing music in more of a steady, easy, consistent flow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon has this option for people who make a lot of content. Since my creativity tends to come in inspired bursts, I would rather set this up as a monthly thing so that you can decide what works for you. If at any point, you decide to stop being my patron in this way, you can easily \u003cbr\u003ebe a part of the co-creative energy of music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHeartfelt Intention\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy soul is completely devoted to making music right now, and my intention is that every penny I receive from my patrons will be used with honour, integrity, and gratitude to record a new album of songs, share my live + online concerts, and create brilliant music videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S.\u00a0Note that this is completely voluntary, and I only request that you get involved if you feel it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
