For over 2 years, I\u0027ve been making videos on unsolved disappearances and homicides akin to Unsolved Mysteries and America\u0027s Most Wanted, to try and spread awareness of these cases. I also make videos sharing my subscriber\u0027s creepy experiences.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a one-woman show; I am the only researcher, writer, script editor, camera (wo)man, video editor, manager, and social media manager. With the help of my subscribers, and YouTuber Rob Dyke, I\u0027ve been able to turn this passion into a career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDue to the first YouTube Ad Boycott, my Adsense income dropped 70% from what it was a year ago. But even as advertisers return, many of my videos on unsolved disappearances and homicides are deemed \"not-suitable for all advertisers,\" meaning a large portion of advertisers won\u0027t run ads on my content, despite the respectful manner in which the cases are presented.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany subscribers are aware of the current YouTube climate and expressed wanting to help out.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your contribution, I can continue doing YouTube full time, focus on more research-heavy, longer unsolved cases, place quality over quantity, as well as start new endeavors to give you more content in different mediums (a podcast, a horror novel, a possible second channel).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eI WANT TO BECOME A PATRON\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you frequently enjoy the content I produce, and can think of no better way to spend some extra money, (there are plenty of charities out there), any amount contributed would be greatly appreciated. I\u0027ve recently added several new rewards. A monthly contribution of $1 or more gains you the following perks:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to patron-only content.
