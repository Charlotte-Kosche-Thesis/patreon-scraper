    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eHi everyone my name is Mark aka Cornshaq. I have been playing video games my entire life and been sharing my love of games through video for seven years now. Throughout these years I have made so many amazing friends and met a lot of people who have found enjoyment from the videos I have created. That feeling is something I never would have imagined existed and its one I never want to lose. Gaming is a passion, a true love, and there is nothing I would rather do on this planet then game and provide entertainment to others. I have always said whether you love or hate my videos, find them informative, helpful, boring, or even watch just to make fun of them it doesn\u0027t matter, it means I am providing entertainment in some form. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat this pateron is for is so I can continue to do these videos on a full time basis which i have been doing for a little while now and want to continue to do so for as long as possible and it won\u0027t require much to do so.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e"
