I was remarking to my hunny today how, even though some days I think I look totally\u00a0 normal, I just can\u0027t seem to \"pass\" at all. Not sure why....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.crowsonglodge.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20160912_145756-copy-copy.jpg\" style=\"width: 130px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI\u0027m a third generation metaphysician and I\u0027d say it\u0027s fair to conclude that with each generation, we\u0027re just getting more extreme. Where my mother would state specifically that she was a metaphysician and a psychic, she would steer clear of works like \"witchcraft\" and \"spell\" - and she would only use the ones she was comfortable with in safe places. And here I am, putting those words - and more! -\u00a0 up on the internet! Ah, the world has changed....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI probably began my \"psychic\" career with meditation and yoga, although it\u0027s so far back, I really just don\u0027t remember. These are the first things I specifically remember my mother teaching me, though, and I had just started kindergarten. So at this point, there\u0027s not a lot I HAVEN\u0027T done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been on the internet and posting articles and tutorials for about 6 years now (more or less) and have a good repository built up that I\u0027m pretty\u00a0 happy with - but I\u0027m always building more! And, until now, I had to sell services (readings, mostly) for people to be able to support me. I\u0027m so glad Patreon is here! I\u0027m SUPER happy to just be able to hand money to my favorite artists/creators WITHOUT obliging them to hand me something back and glad I can offer that to folks who support me, too. :D Which I hope you\u0027ll do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.crowsonglodge.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cocoparisienne.jpg\" style=\"width: 221px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I THINK I\u0027m going to do here, for now (and PLEASE tell me if you have other ideas!) is post my videos for professionals\u00a0 here a week before making them \"public\" on YouTube so you guys can have a sneak peek and implement it before it goes out to the rest of the world. The rest of my videos will go up normally.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, once I get my software figured out and start really designing my coursework, higher tiers will gain admission into the CrowSong Lodge Classroom hosted on my website, so YAY!
