Local radio in Columbia, \"Never spoke to me as a Clemson fan.\" Swann set out to create a show that would speak to Clemson Tiger fans around the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the time, podcasting was in its infancy and Lawton decided to give it a shot. In late 2004, Swann began researching podcasting and by August of 2005 he had partnered with a Clemson website and created his first podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward eight years and Swann was offered the chance to host Clemson Hotline for CRM Sports and this would eventually lead Swann to host a two-hour daily show, Y\u0027all Sports Daily. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eY\u0027all Sports Daily was heard in several different states and was Lawton Swann\u0027s first real opportunity to be on the radio regularly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually, Swann was contacted by L.J. Smith at iHeart Media and on July 15, 2013, Clemson Sports Talk, hit the airwaves on the largest AM signal in South Carolina.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn October of 2014, our station shifted from SportsRadio 560 The Team to Fox Sports Radio 1400 as iHeart Media rebranded our station on a new frequency where we continue to broadcast daily.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017, Clemson Sports Talk added an additional market in Myrtle Beach/Conway and we are continuing to expand our coverage moving to 4-6 PM.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though Swann\u0027s show was now on five days a week, he continued to embrace the podcast listeners. A daily podcast of Clemson Sports Talk has been available since day one. Through the years, the show has grown and now boasts over 17,500 followers on Twitter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been blessed to cover your Tigers for nearly 15 years.\u00a0Thank you for supporting\u00a0\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.ClemsonSportsTalk.com\u003c/a\u003e"
