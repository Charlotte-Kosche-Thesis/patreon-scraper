Largely because people keep suggesting\u003cem\u003e really awesome ideas for new stories. \u003c/em\u003eThe nice thing about writing longform works, I\u0027ve learnt, is people want to see more of the characters. It\u0027s\u003cem\u003e crazy. \u003c/em\u003eAnd I\u0027d love to write more about the worlds that I\u0027ve created except for that thing called time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have very much of it. What time I have I like using for things that make money. (I\u0027m a capitalist abomination. Sorry), or actually taking a break and recharging. Given the way my life is built, I can\u0027t justify writing shorts willy nilly. Not for a long while, and I \u003cem\u003emiss\u003c/em\u003e that. But that\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$300 is a reasonably generous amount of cash for a short story, and that is going to be a hell of a motivation to write. You\u0027ll get more fiction and I\u0027ll have an excuse to prod at word that exist outside of contracted work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSounds good? Great! Let\u0027s do this.\u003c/div\u003e"
