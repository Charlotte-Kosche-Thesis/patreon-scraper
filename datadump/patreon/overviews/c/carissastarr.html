    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThe world is filled with voices, why should you support mine?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause the world is also full of voices with very little to say, and those of us with stories to tell need someone willing to huddle at our fire willing to hear it through to the end. I have dozens of stories out there for you to read. That\u0027s the best sales pitch I can offer. Read those, find my voice. Is it one with even a hint of a siren song for your soul? I hope so, I truly do. The project I want to complete, the stories I have to tell are enormous and I am going to keep at them even if no one supports me. But I won\u0027t lie, having at least a few people standing around the fire leaning in, it definitely stokes that fire brighter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor decades I have been writing. Long before I was paid to do it, I wrote for the school newspapers, comic books, plays, film scripts, short stories, RPGs. Then as an adult, discovered people paid real money for those things. Great revelation, right? So I still did all those things plus added novels and web content to the list. Writing from gig to gig usurps a lot of time for very little pay and drains the energy away from my own creations. The larger their project, the more mine seemed to die. I simply refuse to sacrifice my work anymore. Like any hero\u0027s tale, however, if I am to triumph and rise from farm girl to squire to knight, I cannot do it alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2001, I went to college for filmmaking wanting to learn how to direct the films that I have been writing. So I learned how to be a better screenwriter, a cinematographer, photographer and a lighting guru. I graduated with top honors. With that degree, I still pursue my passion for film, but my path seems to be less straight-forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI discovered that video games have become so much more cinematic than they ever were when I was growing up. Games like BioShock, Dragon Age, Mass Effect, Deus Ex (and many others) ...there was so much more story to these. I was hired to write a portion of a game script for a small indie rpg/visual novel game. I gained a taste for it. How could I not? It was not so far aside from writing comics, closer to film, but so much more involved! I like involved. Then this lovely stranger online convinced me that \u201cJack of all Trades\u201d wasn\u0027t a curse. I have a talent, a skill... I am adaptable, love to learn and do it well and best of all, am passionate and take my work as a badge of honor. No matter what work I am doing, it represents me, and it will be the best I can make it. So why not take all of the ways I know how to write and combine it with all of the skills I have learned for visual media? Dive into the world that the Star Wars Universe has conquered masterfully, the artistic medium of the future-now...\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://henryjenkins.org/2007/03/transmedia_storytelling_101.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTransmedia\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m doing a who\u0027the\u0027what\u0027now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca class=\"hoverZoomLink\" href=\"http://www.nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Transmedia-storytelling-flow-chart.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTransmedia\u003c/a\u003e!

I spent over 6 months researching, which is a continuing process. I researched game development, projected and current science in environmental development and decline, as well as eco-architecture/farming.

This Twine-built game will have audio and visual media within it. I am also writing short films that can stand alone, but also be cut down into trailers.
