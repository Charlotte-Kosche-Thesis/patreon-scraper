    "summary": "Hi! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Catherine and I love to draw. Rumour has it that I was born holding a pencil ... whether or not that\u0027s true, I can certainly tell you that I have been drawing for as long as I can remember. I also love animals, which is why I studied an honours degree at uni, majoring in Zoology and Human biology. It was fun, but I realised my passion for animals and the natural world is best engaged through illustration rather than research. Which is where you guys come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot surprisingly, my favourite subjects to draw are animals, both living and extinct, real and fantasy. I do other things too - people, buildings, plants, anatomical illustrations. In a similar vein, I\u0027ve basically worked in pencils my whole life, but I\u0027d love to try other media as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my work, this is where you can give me a helping hand getting my illustrating career off the ground, and then keeping it up there! Your support helps me cover living expenses, as well as buy pencils, paper, and the other art supplies I need to create good quality artwork. In return, I\u0027ll be giving you fun goodies like exclusive artwork and helping me choose stuff to draw!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are interested in looking through my portfolio check out my website \u003ca href=\"http://csillustrator.com\"\u003ecsillustrator.com\u003c/a\u003e"

I have had a\n passion for animals since I was a little kid, and so now at the age of \n21 I find myself in my fourth year of my biological sciences degree. \nThough studying animals using the scientific method has only been \nsomething I\u0027ve started doing recently, one thing I\u0027ve always done - \nsince I was old enough to grasp a pencil - is express this obsession \nthrough illustration. As the years have passed, I\u0027ve found joy in \nillustrating subjects other than just animals, and I love taking on new \nchallenges in drawing. My dream is to pursue illustration after I have \ncompleted my degree.
