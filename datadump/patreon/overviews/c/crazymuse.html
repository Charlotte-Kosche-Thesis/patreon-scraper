    "summary": "Being a math fanboy, I love to relate with intuitions hidden deep down in the derivations. As a college student, I used to spend hours visualizing subjects like functional spaces, wavelets, Markov\u00a0random fields, etc. Especial my obsession with random numbers made me crazier\u00a0with each passing day. Questions like\u00a0 \"How patterns emerge out of randomness\" used to intrigue me a lot. That why the channel name is crazymuse, which means \"rhythm in madness: or \"music(muse) of randomness(crazy)\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut unfortunately,\u00a0 when I used to look around at other faces, I couldn\u0027t find a single smile or sparkly eyes. Its been 7 years since that day and the fire is still burning. I realize that the reason is that we are never interested in the beauty/art of math intuitions, we are only looking at the numerics of math.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy goal is\u003c/strong\u003e to make mathematical concepts in AI and other emerging fields as cool as sitcoms that we watch. I want to mildly alter the language of communicating intuitions by using jargons borrowed from relatable sitcoms, popular movies and day to day conversations. Because intuition by itself is not a bunch of equations. It is what is behind those symbols.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I am producing\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0atleast 1 videos per week.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e And am planning to do so for the next 2 years. I would be really grateful if you can contribute in whichever way possible. This will help me bring down the economic constraints that I have to face while making a video.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFuture Plans\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0027t want this to be a self-centric channel. I want to slowly open the gates for creative researchers to contribute.\u00a0 I want to give freedom to the creators, on the condition that they will maintain the quality of storytelling. I have detailed plans for enabling contribution from less committed researchers as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are these wonderful channels like \u003cstrong\u003eted-ed\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003e3blue1brown \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003emathematicalmonk\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eon youtube which deeply inspire me. The beauty of concept video is that the same concept can be reimagined in many different non-overlapping ways. Each video adding a new perspective. This way, I often feel, that making\u00a0videos on intuition is more collaborative than a competitive space.\u00a0 Especially if you are like a true artist, who pays attention to details about the quality. I would prefer to make 1 3min quality video on a single concept than make 10 1hr\u00a0recordings covering everything in a course. There are innumerable topics to be covered, but it takes an artist\u0027s eye to pick up one of them and transform it into a wonderfully woven imagination.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e About Me\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eJaley is an alumnus of Video Analytics Lab,CDS at IISc (Indian Institute of Science) and has extensively worked on Deep Learning applications. He had developed Expresso, a tool for Deep Learning, keeping in eye the problem faced by Deep Learning beginners in 2013-14, when there was no Tensorflow, DIGITS or Keras.\u003cbr\u003eHe has worked on Spark and Hadoop for predictive modeling and temporal aspects of recommender systems during his stay at Vizury, which is an ad re-targeting company. One of his significant contribution at Vizury was sustained improvement in the recommender systems on both web as well as app platform. He had also worked in Samsung-Harman as Senior Data-scientist in music domain and autonomous parking problem using deep reinforcement learning.
