     "description": "\u003cdiv\u003eEveryone who is a Patreon supporter of $2/month will have their name entered for a draw each month for one of the knives that I reviewed that month.\u003cbr\u003eThis is how I figure out which knife it will be: It will always be a knife that is worth the average amount (or MORE) of the knives that I reviewed. (meaning if I did 5 videos of $15 knives and 5 videos of $25knives and 5 videos of $40 knives that means the total value of the 10 videos is 75+125+200= 400 / 15 videos = $26.67 So the knife the winner will get will be one that has a value of at least $26.67.\u003cbr\u003eYOU MUST be 18 years old.\u00a0 You will have to confirm that the knife is legal to own where you live.\u00a0 If it isn\u0027t, then another knife will be selected - of same or higher value.\u003cbr\u003eI will do the draw on the first or second say of the month for the previous month.\u00a0 Example: On November 1st I will do a draw from all the people who contributed during October.\u003c/div\u003eI will either ship the knife I reviewed OR I may have a vendor drop ship a brand new knife to the winner!!",
