    "summary": "I\u0027m Greg, and I am a cello fanatic! I started playing classical cello at 2 1/2, began experimenting with modern styles in high school, and became the first cellist to graduate from the University of Miami\u0027s renowned Studio Music \u0026amp; Jazz department. Currently I am a professional musician, composer, producer, and educator living in the Twin Cities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe idea for this Patreon came out of my 14 years of teaching private lessons, ensembles, and workshops all over the country. My Patreon is distinguished from the myriad of Eclectic styles string methods in several key ways:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor cellists, by cellists: There are many method books and video lessons for eclectic styles cello out there, but the vast majority of them are not written by cellists! I have been playing cello for 28 years, and I am keenly aware of the unique issues of the instrument. Together we will discuss the hurdles involved in modern cello playing and clear them one by one.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAffordable: Not everyone has the budget to afford weekly private lessons, and I empathize with their situation. That\u0027s why there are multiple levels of patronage, so that anyone and everyone that has a passion for the cello can join.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eQuality: The merit of my pedagogy comes from more than my degrees, and more than my accolades. It is rooted in my memories of being confused and frustrated as a beginning jazz improviser. It is my ambition to clarify the learning process so that every student can quickly find the joy and freedom in modern music styles.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCommunity: Most cellists are an affable, kind-hearted lot. I truly desire to create a space for cellists to freely express themselves, both verbally and musically, so that others may encourage their musical journey. I chose to start a Patreon specifically because of its interactive nature, and I intend for every member of the community to be engaged with me and each other.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\nAs a full time musician, I rely on the generosity of students and music lovers to make a sustainable income, and joining my Patreon directly supports me and my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThanks, I hope you\u0027ll join me on our cello adventures!\u003cbr\u003e"
