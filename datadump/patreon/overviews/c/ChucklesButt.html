No, course not, but, depending on my finances, I may have to cut back on writing as much as I currently do heading into the later part of my studies, AND patrons will be able to commission me to write pieces of their choosing. That\u0027s right, I can cater to your specific tastes for a piece, no matter how untasteful, depraved or shameful they probably are.
