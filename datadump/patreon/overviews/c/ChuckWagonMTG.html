     "about": "A little about me. I started playing Magic the Gathering in 1994. I played with my circle of friends when we needed a break from Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons. We made terrible home brew decks that we some of the most fun decks I have ever played. I played religiously until 1999 when I left to explore the country. I started playing a bit in 2005 and in 2009 I started playing semi-casual events at my local gaming store. I enjoyed playing in Magic League, FNM, and Sealed Events. In 2015, I started to take my playing a bit more seriously and started to hone my skills and play in higher level events. And that is where I sit now. I am rather consistent an FNM and have made top 8 in the last 3 larger events I have attended. I am by no means a professional player, or even a semi-professional player. I\u0027m just someone who loves the game and have acquired enough skill over the years to get me by.",
