You may know me from DeviantArt, Etsy, Instagram, Facebook (MySpace?) or \"in real life.\" I work at a comic shop and on the side I cultivate my illustration career selling artwork and products I create from those pieces. Juggling work, school, and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eThe Dream\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e of being an artiste is pretty taxing... especially when I\u0027m only earning minimum wage.

Instead of having unlimited access as I do now, I would have to pay dues AND usage time\u003cem\u003e by the minute\u003c/em\u003e.

I would really hate to cut this out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter that? Basically, the more contributions I get will directly go towards me living \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eThe Dream\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (that\u0027s me creating things for everyone to enjoy instead of working for someone else and not creating on the clock) $480 each month means I can give up a day comfortably. $480x2=$960=2 days off work=2 days working on \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eThe Dream\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.
