    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Atticus, an insane despot who\u0027s soon going to rule over all that I survey! I can\u0027t do that until my kingdom is up and running however.\u00a0 My kingdom is a unique one though, and very special to me personally, and to hundreds of others. It\u0027s not a kingdom of land, but of CGL and DDLG lifestyle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor well over a decade, I struggled to find the right identity for my sexuality. I wasn\u0027t quite a dom, I wasn\u0027t quite a master, or any of the other common roles. I was a daddy. I knew it internally, even if I didn\u0027t know what to call it. When I first came into the kink scene, DDLG wasn\u0027t even a blip on the radar. There were a few small scattered ageplay communities, but ever since the explosion of Tumblr, DDLG / CGL has come to the forefront of the kink scene. Thousands of people began to identify as daddies, littles, middles, etc, and slowly the stigma within the kink community erroded as people begin to educate themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome wonderful communities have formed in the last few years, full of new faces, enthusiastic newbies, and old hands like myself. There are great chat rooms, forums, blogs, youtubers, etc, but still it\u0027s difficult to find answers to relatively common questions. Often you have to resort to reading lengthy forum posts, or digging through blogs to find the information you want, and half the time it conflicts with other articles you\u0027ve read! It\u0027s a situation that doesn\u0027t help our growing community. Even as we\u0027re trying to push away the stigmas and accusations that come with an ageplay heavy kink community, we\u0027re struggling to educate new members to the community, let alone the public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where CGL Kingdom comes in. Born as a passion project of my discord server, we have lots of great minds already on board and all the talent we need to finish the project! The website we\u0027re building hosts information for newcomers to the CGL and DDLG scene, detailed explanations of common terms, answers to common questions, etc, but that\u0027s only the start. We want to provide the community with a regular stream of high quality, well researched and edited articles, addressing tough, nuanced issues that right now are hard wrap your head around. How do you tell your spouse you\u0027re into CGL? What\u0027s the difference between ageplay and regression? Are there healthy and unhealthy ways to play? What are the red flags you should look out for? There are lots of great questions and they deserve great answers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to just providing information, we want to provide a creative outlet to the community. Users will be able to submit pictures, bedtime stories, audio recordings, videos, and much more. It\u0027s tough to find good information, but it\u0027s even tougher to find good audio recordings of your favorite bedtime stories, so you can listen to them as you fall asleep.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually we\u0027re hoping to launch a full-blown monthly podcast, hosting through CGL Kingdom as well, although that\u0027s more of a long term goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have the people, and the know-how, and the rest of it. We even have the funding to get it started. The purpose of this patreon, then, is to help cover the monthly bills, which are not insignificant, to commission professional quality artwork on an ongoing basis, to provide prizes for contests, and to keep the general lifeblood of our community flowing. Right now, nearly all of this project is being paid for out of pocket by myself, and while I\u0027m happy to do it, I\u0027m also keen on keeping a roof over my head. Any donations you make to this project will go towards offsetting the continuing costs of our website\u0027s development and maintenance, to increasing the quality of content offered, and to growing the community with cool events. Donations will also help to keep ads to a minimum, since nobody likes those ugly banner ads, and I\u0027m no exception.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to thank you in advance for helping to build the kingdom, and I\u0027m looking forward to what the future brings!\u003cbr\u003e"
