Adryenn Ashley and I met because I was watching her live broadcasts that day, that she and other state delegates were filming at the convention. Adryenn has a large following on \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AdryennAshley/\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/adryenn\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, and she shared her own (and everyone else\u0027s) livestreams to millions of people. She is a major reason that the rumors of violence and vandalism of that day did not take hold as strongly as they could have. She \u003ca href=\"https://business.facebook.com/AdryennAshley/videos/10153761902337695\"\u003efilmed the chair\u003c/a\u003e being lifted (it occurs at around 4min:30secs). It is her footage that John Ralston tried to twist into violence. Not only did she broadcast that day, she \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AdryennAshley/videos/10153768266537695/\"\u003econtinued reporting on the event\u003c/a\u003e, using the raw footage as evidence to tell the truth.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter witnessing how powerfully Adryenn used social media, I contacted her to see if we could take what she did that day to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Myself and a handful of other correspondents both in (Bernie Sanders delegates) and out (supporters and protestors) of the convention hall did the reporting with Facebook Live-streams, and she, from her home in Nevada, personally assisted all of us. She again used her reach to show the world what really happened, from \n\u003cem\u003eour\u003c/em\u003e points of view. Not the narrative. \u003ca href=\"https://proudberniesandersdemocrat.wordpress.com/category/jeffs-dnc/\"\u003eOur coverage\u003c/a\u003e reached 1.4 million people, including just under 400,000 direct views."
