I have dealt with both my entire life. When people see me, they see a successful author, but they don\u0027t see my bad days. My struggles. And I know there are a LOT of people out there struggling too. I want to help. I want to share my struggles and tips and ticks to help YOU manage your own depression and/or anxiety. I am extremely passionate about this work. I want you to know that you are NOT alone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I am going to have two tiers. Once I reach my goal of $200 in support per month, I will get a P.O. Box that will allow me to make self-care kits that I\u0027ll send out once a month. They\u0027ll have fun things in them like tea and motivational stickers, and I\u0027ll write a nice little quote and sign it as well.\u003cbr\u003e"
