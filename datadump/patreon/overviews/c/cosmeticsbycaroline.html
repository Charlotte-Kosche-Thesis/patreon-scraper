    "summary": "I have always loved beauty. You know it\u0027s bad when as an 11- year-old you are saving your allowance for a year to buy a Chanel eyeshadow (honestly both of my parents were terrified of what I would become). I started playing with makeup around 13, wearing all too much black eyeliner and then in high school wearing foundation that neither matched my neck nor any other part of my body. Despite this, I continued to practice my skills on friends and family and then something amazing happened, YouTube!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still reminder watching Pixiwoo and Lisa Eldridge thinking, \"if only that could be me!\". I learned and practiced their techniques watching their videos for hours! I continued to watch their videos through my young adult life, watching their followers grow into the millions right before my eyes! I always had a little voice in the back of my head nudging me to start my own channel, but I lacked the confidence and time to try it out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, as soon as I admitted that to myself, and decided to let that dream go, life handed me some very, very sour lemons. I was in a car accident and herniated a couple of discs in my back, developed migraines, was diagnosed with autoimmune diseases up the wazu and began to see my health decline both physically and mentally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomewhere in the midst of the biggest health crisis of my life, I thought, what the heck let\u0027s make some lemonade. I had to take a long pause from my real life so I attempted to make a new one only this one would be online: enter my YouTube channel \"Cosmetics by Caroline\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I am on the road to recovering my health, I am starting to make life choices that hopefully aid the process. I eat clean healthy foods, I try my best to exercise, I meditate, and I evaluate places in my life where there is room for improvement. I also have become aware of the world around me and what I surround myself with and what I use on a daily basis, especially self-care products.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am such a sucker for anything new at Sephora and it wasn\u0027t until I started looking more into what I was putting on my skin and allowing to absorb into my body that I took a pause once again to evaluate my choices. Over 70% of what we place on our skin is absorbed directly into our blood stream, so when I saw known carcinogens (cancer causing ingredients) in the products I love using, I knew I had to make a change. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this blog is meant to document that change! It will consist of reviews, videos, photos, fashion and ultimately a little slice of my world! I would so love for you to come on this journey with me and educate yourself on products you can be buying to keep your health and happiness in mind too!
