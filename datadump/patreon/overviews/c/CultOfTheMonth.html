    "summary": "Cult of the Month is a division of ShudderBooks Corporation Specific Benefit Corporation. A corporation whose reason for being is \"Illumination\".\u003cbr\u003eA Benefit Corporation is a new type of business entity you can form in the State of Minnesota (plus 29 other states and the District of Columbia) that exists to have a positive impact on society, workers, community and the environment as well as making a profit. Benefit corporations are different from tradition C corporations in purpose, accountability, transparency and general \"vibe\", but are the same in taxation.\u003cbr\u003eShudderBooks Corporation, being a corporate person, operates under \"Deeply Held Religious Beliefs\" (Like Hobby Lobby) and these beliefs also guide our operations. Those deeply held religious beliefs are in line with whatever happens to be the Cult of the Month at that time. Giving ShudderBooks a regularly scheduled pivot point for this Satire Powered Corporation.\u003cbr\u003eCult of the Month founds new religious sects every month under the banner of the tradition and religion of Discordianism. Cult of the Month also believes that religions should pay tax on all funds that are not being used for the benefit of the community, therefore Cult of the Month and it\u0027s parent corporation ShudderBooks Corp SBC, will pay tax appropriate to any other Corporation. In the United States, the only real limitation to founding a religious organization is that to be Tax Exempt you have to file with the IRS, since Cult of the Month will pay its tax, it does not have any limitation on it\u0027s ability to start new religions (See 1st Amendment).\u003cbr\u003eCult of the Month is sincere in its operation but for religious reasons it can not be serious. \u003cbr\u003eWe are in the process of making ShudderBooks and Cult of the Month into a better company with a greater effect on the world. Our priority is to make up for the shortcomings in our Cult of the Month Kickstarter. We are hiring someone to help get the things made, out the door and in people\u0027s mailboxes. When I created the Kickstarter I did not foresee the personal difficulties of work, health and most importantly child care would have on fulfilling our vision. Drastic changes have occurred and we are making a real \"Go\" of it. \u003cbr\u003eSoon there will be a new web show that was developed under the Cult of the Month \"WabiSabiDoEz\". The show is named \"Persephone\u0027s Pinball Parlor in Puppet Purgatory\" it takes place in the Ideaspace, in the puppet neighborhood of Interzone, it\u0027s where puppets go when they are not being used so they don\u0027t go mad staring at the same wall. This world operates under the beliefs and teachings of \"The 23rd Church of Pinbot the Redeemer\". The show has been described as \"MST3k but with pinball, so it\u0027s much shorter.\" \u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and support, we are off to do more weird things for the purposes of Illumination.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKnow that whatever you pledge to me will be put to maximum utility through the Way of Lo-Fi. That the Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu will be able to restore the Million Pounds Burnt. That the Bionic Pinball Millionaire through the power of PINCOMBO will bring along a new Renaissance of the Pinball Arts. Know that you helped the creation of Elvis Canaveral: Supercollider the Greatest Crossover The Omniverse\u0027s ever know. Illuminated Classics and ShudderBooks education and entertainment systems that deliver Illumination upon request.
