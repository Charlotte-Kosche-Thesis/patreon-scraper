There has never been a better time for me to really write as this year and last year (when I lived in Spain as a house spouse). Before this, I was a teacher in Indiana and could only dedicate a few hours of writing on Saturdays. Now, I finally can focus on my craft and it has been the best two years of my life. And: it has been more successful than I could have hoped. I have sold articles, gotten more readers for my blog, and finished the first draft of my novel. It is the first year that I have felt like a successful writer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have three blogs: my personal blog,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theworldforbeginners.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe World for Beginners\u003c/a\u003e, a blog on Christianity,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.pennytheologian.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Penny Theologian\u003c/a\u003e, and the travel blog I keep with my wife,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.oliverstravelsallover.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOlivers\u0027 Travels All Over\u003c/a\u003e. (This last one is being wrapped up and combined with my personal blog) I am working on my first novel and it hope to release it by the end of 2018 or 2019. I began my personal blog because, well, I\u0027m still trying to figure out the world. We started the travel blog mostly for our friends and family back home, but we\u0027ve been pleasantly surprised at the responses we\u0027ve gotten for others about our experience living in a country\u2014a country I didn\u2019t speak the main language of. This got very complicated and stressful for my wife and I, so we decided to end it with our time in Spain. The Penny Theologian is an experimental spiritual exercise as I explore my faith and share that journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll this is not to mention that I am a huge nerd and am actively creating material for the \u003cem\u003eDungeons and Dragons\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eDread\u003c/em\u003e role playing games. I absolutely love playing all kinds of games and love to share this passion with others as well, which is why I am just starting a new blog for the materials I create at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.legendsofmondiir.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Legends of Mondiir\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo, why start a Patreon?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThe dream of any creator is to be able to follow their passions and sustain themselves on their craft. I am no different. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u00a0want to be able to write with three fully-funded blogs, owning my own platforms. I want to start at least one podcast. I want to narrate books and voice act. I can\u0027t help but point out the obvious: I want to do a lot.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEspecially, I want to eat.
