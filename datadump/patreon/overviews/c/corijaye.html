It is also common for me to paint animals which hold particularly powerful spiritual meanings, such as lions or elephants that signify special strengths. My paintings are an expression of my yearning to share love and power in this reality and often reflect my connection to the non physical world. I feel I was born an artist, and that I did not choose this life - it chose me. Painting is what I\u0027m meant to be doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI primarily work with acrylic paint, however I also work in oil pastel and pencil crayon. I choose acrylic medium because I love to layer paint on the canvas, and the fast drying time makes for a more timely process. In addition, I paint with as much colour strength as possible, reflecting my passion to the viewer. I love to bounce colours off one another and make my subject matter pop. I would also describe myself as someone whose mind wanders, and working with acrylic paint keeps me engaged as I can constantly be working a different area of my canvas while I wait for other sections to dry. I find the colours available in acrylic paint to be vivid and exciting with metallic and florescent possibilities. The more powerful and strong I can make a piece, the more thrilling!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve studied at Ontario College of Art and Design in Toronto, Ontario, and I hold a Graphic Design Diploma from Red River College in Winnipeg, Manitoba. \u003cbr\u003e",
