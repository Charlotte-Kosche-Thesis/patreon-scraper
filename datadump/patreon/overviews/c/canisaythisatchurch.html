    "summary": "This Podcast started as a side project on a whim. If you\u0027re here know that this show\u00a0is self contained...you are reading the words of the scheduler, planner, interviewer, production-intern and all other things that need to go into making a quality show. The ultimate goal is to have the show be self sustaining. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny and all funds donated go directly to keeping the lights on, well the lights are the internet but you know what\u00a0I mean. But seriously your donations go directly to help support the show in research, website costs, software upgrades as needed, as well as storage for each episode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLooking forward, the plan is to have as many voices, hopefully those that can speak with experience or authority in relation to the church, be on as possible so that we can ask and probe the questions that, if we are honest, we all ask. Together as the Church we can all learn from each other. This will not be possible without your feedback. Please do let us know how we are doing, guests that we should look at, or that question that you\u0027ve been dying to know or discuss. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
