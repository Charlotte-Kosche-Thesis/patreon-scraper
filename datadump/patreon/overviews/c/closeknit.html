I\u0027m ani lee and I make the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://closeknit.com.au/podcast\"\u003eClose Knit Podcast\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e, a podcast that aims to hold space for conversation to be had about the ways we use fiber to process world and life events. I\u0027ve been working on this project since November of 2015, and finally launched it in late March 2016. Since then, I\u0027ve produced the entire project solo - from guest curation to editing and show note writing. This work is a joy for me. I love it, and I\u0027m thankful to have a space to put work into this world that I\u0027m proud of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the course of this project, and particularly over the last year, it has become increasingly important to me to center inclusivity as the core driver of the podcast. I aim to work with a diversity of podcast guests and discuss topics that aren\u0027t always talked about in this space - feminism, mental health, social justice, and small business ownership realities, to name a few.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so grateful for the response this podcast has received. The way that folks in the world engage with it makes me so thrilled to create more podcasts. You all are the reason that I keep creating this work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where patreon comes in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have done this work for over 2 years. I believe in paying people for their creative work, and it has taken me until now to really be comfortable with the idea of valuing my own work in the way I value others\u0027 work. To create a show I am proud of - take enough time to curate guests, sufficiently edit the podcast, add music, grow the podcast offering over time, and pay someone to edit the podcast and produce a better quality show, I need financial stability.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, as little as $1/month, I\u0027ll be able to sustain this podcast long term and keep providing quality content to our fiber arts community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI read every single kind word and comment that comes in about the podcast, and I so appreciate every single nice thing that\u0027s ever been said about my work. If you have the financial means to support the podcast, I am would be so grateful if you would consider contributing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
