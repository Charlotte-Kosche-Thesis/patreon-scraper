    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSup guys. For those who don\u0027t know me, my name is CollaredKid. You can call me CK for short. I\u0027ve been illustrating my own tickle art for years.\u00a0 Like this one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/480ede98471df0f84379fe9c98ce6088/tumblr_p72rlptwmR1smn3m2o1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested then consider donating to this here Patreon and keep this weird ball rolling. I\u0027ll make it worth every penny.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom my work you can expect \u003cbr\u003e*tickling\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e*tease and denial\u003cbr\u003e*femdom\u003cbr\u003e*and even some /f along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e*stories\u003cbr\u003e*commissions\u003cbr\u003e*A LOT OF CONTENT\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll this and more from an alarmingly fast artist with a lot of horrible ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings you should be aware of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first thing is that there will be no full images posted on the Patreon until further notice (I.e until upfront payment is accessible to me.) Just can\u2019t take the risk. Instead I\u2019ll be doing a more sketch/work in progress kind of thing. Inks, flats, teasers of what\u2019s to come, that will be available to ALL tiers (12 and 20 might get more and 20 will still be alerted to what comes next before anyone else) and there WILL be stuff coming, don\u2019t get me wrong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe finished pictures, your rewards. Will be sent on the 2th to the people who have paid. You all will be emailed a zip file of everything you payed for. (5 will get a zip of their tiers, 12 will get theirs, and 20 will get their, including their extra pictures)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are not registered as payed then you won\u2019t be sent anything so if your legit make sure you have your affairs in order. If you aren\u2019t sure your payment went threw then contact me before the email date. If it\u2019s after the date  then there really isn\u2019t anything I can do for you unless you\u2019d be willing to send me the money threw other means.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo basically my schedule is 3 free pictures every month. (I will of course try to post more, like my goal is a free picture a week but I don\u2019t want to over promise) They\u2019ll be posted on all sites with the work in progress of what\u2019s going to be sent at the 2nd of next month. Then for only those who have payed on the 1st get the big art dump emailed on the 2nd. Check your tiers if your not sure what you\u2019ll get. People who join on the 2th will not be sent the email.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you really like the art and would want your own then I also do commissions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much guys, for all you\u0027ve done and are doing. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
