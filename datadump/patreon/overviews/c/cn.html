I\u0027d love to be able to make bigger, and better things, and I believe that together we can make all of those things happen. From hiring a full-time editor, to having a fairly consistent income, I believe we can all work towards a bigger and better YouTube Channel than we already have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGaming has been my passion for a huge chunk of my life already, and I feel fortunate every day that it\u0027s become my career - however YouTube is becoming more and more unpredictable and that leads to a great deal of uncertainty as a creator. Every January the revenue per thousand views is cut in half, which in turn cuts your income from that month in half. This isn\u0027t something that happens in the majority of \"normal\" jobs. As well as that, YouTube is constantly tweaking algorithms to cater to different types of videos, yet they \u003cem\u003enever \u003c/em\u003etell their creators about these changes - and so we\u0027re all left in the dark.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I adore what I do, I\u0027d love to feel more secure in my career. I\u0027d also love to be able to take my job to the next level with a full-time editor, more livestreams, and more events attended across the UK and the world so I can bring you more of the greatest games and, more importantly, meet any and all of you that attend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I firmly believe we can achieve all of these goals and so much more. Since August 2012, the community surrounding my little space on the internet has shown itself to be absolutely incredible, and I\u0027m so excited to see what the future holds for all of us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you."

Thanks to that, I\u0027d be able to create and release more videos, better videos, and more varied videos too. Not only does this mean more Let\u0027s Play, but more Let\u0027s Build too, more collaborative content, and more time to livestream - which is always a bonus!",

With $7500 per month from Patreon, I\u0027d be able to put a lot of that in to action - including more marathon livestreams across both Twitch and YouTube. More trips to shows to check out games for all of you, as well as to meet some of you. And, most importantly, the introduction of live shows at various venues across the UK. Yes, that\u0027s right, one day I\u0027d like to bring gaming entertainment off of the screen and to a stage near you - but I need your help to do that.\u003cbr\u003e",
