In addition to reviewing each episode, we connect each episode\u0027s storyline to the tightly-woven metaplot, crack open Easter Eggs and shine a light on subtle foreshadowing, produce in-depth \"Secret Origins\" episodes for the show\u0027s characters, and analyze what storytellers of all kinds can learn about their craft from the show. We also invite creative professionals, production staff, and cast members on for Discussion Sessions about what they do, how they do it, and what it is about Young Justice and DC heroes that inspires them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOTE: We have completed reviewing all of Seasons 1 and 2, so while we wait for Season 3 we are releasing bonus content once a week!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhelmed is, and always will be, free to everyone with a podcatcher.
