I am current an art student in my 2nd year, hoping to work hard and graduate in illustration. I have been drawing all my life and have been very passionate about my lifestyle as an artist. I love to touch and inspire others with my work and it\u0027s my biggest dream to make a living off of what I love. My biggest goal is to become a graphic novelist and a freelance illustrator.\u003cbr\u003eAs for my style I like to label it as dark-grotesque surrealism with a dash of glitter on top! I am inspired by a lot of Gothic and surrealist artists, but I also embrace brighter cute sides as well. Nothing wrong with enjoying the best of both worlds right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Goals/why I need your help:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI have been apart of various online art communities since high school. Unfortunately due to my habit of jumping around from username to username, I lost a lot of my support so I\u0027m having to make up for it by starting fresh, as if it\u0027s the first time all over again. Not only that, due to financial issues, a lot of my free time when I\u0027m not in school goes to working to get me out of college debt.\u003cbr\u003e I have big goals and dreams, but as it stands I need to take baby steps in the right direction. And that starts with building a supportive audience so I can work less at a retail job and more towards art and comics that my fans would enjoy. This would also start on me  getting into a good pace of delivering fresh new art in a timely manner,I would be able to get feedback to know what my audience wants, getting the money and resources to finally sell at conventions, and finally, getting my big break towards my goal of being professionally published.\u003cbr\u003eI know all of this won\u0027t happen in one week, or even a year, but really want to see my dream a reality, so any contribution can go a long way. Even if you can\u0027t, spreading the word can be just as helpful too! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you get out of it:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI have made a list of awesome goodies that are strictly patreon exclusive.\u003cbr\u003eIf you become my patreon you will:\u003cbr\u003e+Get exclusive peeks at my work in progress on big projects and school related works\u003cbr\u003e+Get to see finished works before the general public, and if a series of characters, get to view the full nonscaled version of each.\u003cbr\u003e+ Private speedpaints that are not posted to the general public\u003cbr\u003e+Previews to upcoming comics, whether they are simple strips or full paged series\u003cbr\u003e+ (eventually if my patreon makes enough) NSFW material\u003cbr\u003e+Free to use backgrounds drawn by yours truly!\u003cbr\u003e+ Monthly suggestion polls, raffles for free sketches, commission and shop discounts and even get a chance to win a free request!\u003cbr\u003e"
