Our Video Blog covers the typical things we find ourselves doing as we build our life together living our life in the suburbs of Bangkok. My fianc\u00e9e is a post-op ladyboy and we have been together since 2009. I finally moved to Thailand in September 2016 because the 8 years of travelling to see her was taking its toll. We hope we will give you a unique perspective on Thailand life and lifestyle as we go about our daily life and sometimes explore the Land of Smiles.
