First off, THANK YOU FOR LISTENING!!!! We have setup this Patreon account to help build the show and community. Even just a dollar an episode goes a long way towards helping us keep the show going and growing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you looking to join the Country Squire Radio International Pipe Club, this is the place to do it! We\u0027ve got some great benefits for club members at both the Pilgrim ($3) and Squire ($5) level. Our goal is to increase benefits to club members as we grow support for the show. Be sure to check out our goals to see what\u0027s coming down the pipeline, and know that EVEN MORE benefits will be added along the way and gifted to all existing pipe club members.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: The \u0027per episode\u0027 refers to the primary Country Squire Radio episodes and not Shop Talks, Mini Series, or unique episodes outside of the normal release schedule. As such is the case, the per episode pledge would not exceed 52 episodes in a given year.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank you all so much for listening and loving the show. We hope to continue providing you with top-shelf quality content every week without fail! -- Thanks,"
