Though the experiences were fantastic, self-publishing has its down-sides, especially when you are just two dudes making a lot of content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need your support to help us make this dream a reality and push our comic creation to a full-time venture. Your money will be used to upgrade our equipment (Chris is drawing everything the old-school way and can\u0027t afford a digital drawing pad), help us fund our print runs, and attend more conventions to show the world our comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy showing your support, we will not only strive to create the best stories we can possibly tell, but reward you by sharing these stories. As of right now, we can only provide you with our comic books. As more pledges come in and as more time frees up, we will work to make how-to videos, podcasts, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe look forward to your companionship and we hope that you join us on our ongoing comic book adventure!\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Hi everyone,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are CEL Studios, and though the name sounds prestigious, we are just two dudes who met five years ago and dedicated our lives to our passion. We grew up on comics, anime, manga, and Saturday morning cartoons, and we just happened to have the skills and talent to pursue our dreams. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEthan Harmon is the writer for each comic, and he also handles the lettering duties. Chris Gooding, with his immense talent, tackles all of the art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have done our fair share of conventions - which we will continue to attend - and self-publishing, but we still have day-jobs. Our dream is to make this the full-time job. We want to spend all of our days making the comics that everyone reads and shares with friends. With your support, we can create amazing comics and focus on making this dream a reality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of setting up tiers of stuff, we are doing things a little differently. All of our comics are FREE to read, and we will post new sets of pages every other week. Instead of donating and getting a reward, we will post our work, you get to read it, and if you like what you see, you can donate. Think of it like PBS, or whatever public TV you have in your area. We give you content, and if you want to support it, you can give us a few bucks. Either way, we will continue to make comics, and we appreciate every single person who offers his/her support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for listening to us drone on. We hope you enjoy our work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eEthan Harmon, Chris Gooding,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-CEL Studios-",
