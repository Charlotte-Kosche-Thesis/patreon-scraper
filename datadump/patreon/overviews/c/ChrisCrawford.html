    "summary": "September 5th, 2017\u003cbr\u003eAfter spending six months struggling with a serious problem in Siboot, I realized that every solution that I had cooked up either wouldn\u0027t work or would take years to get working. I therefore set aside Siboot. This really hurts, but the most important decision an artist must make is when to murder their creative children.\u003cbr\u003eI decided to revive the storyworld I have been toying with for nearly 30 years: Le Morte D\u0027Arthur, about the Arthurian legends. I launched the entire interactive storytelling project with this design, but way back then, before the Internet, the only way to publish was through an established publisher. One of them told me, \"I really hope you find a publisher, because I want to play this, but I can\u0027t risk the company\u0027s money on something so radical.\" I have come back to the design several times, but I could never come up with a solution that was good enough. Perhaps I\u0027m too demanding.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo I set to work on Le Morte D\u0027Arthur in June. I seriously considered shutting down\u00a0this Patreon page, but my teammates urged me not to, and so I simply announced my intentions to the patrons and invited them to cancel their contributions if appropriate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to get a working prototype by January 1st, and I am pleased to write that I am well on the way to meeting this objective. It\u0027s a small subset of the main storyworld: the battle scene. This is a battle unlike anything you have ever seen. There are no maps, no 3D, no blood -- nothing you see in traditional games. Instead, the entire battle scene is a struggle with the morale of your subordinates. People start to panic under the stress of battle. The player must lead the group with due regard to their personalities. Some people respond to promises of rewards, others are more motivated by praise, and others by threats. You must manage your team as they fight the battle. If you manage them well, you will win the battle. If not, you will lose the battle.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it\u0027s all done in text! Talk about radical!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll keep you posted with reports at the end of each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is the original description of the project in 2015:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe aim to launch a revolution in game design by putting into the public domain an entire technology for interactive storytelling. This includes unique technologies for linguistic interaction, emotional facial display, a narrative engine, and \u003cstrong\u003ea complete development environment\u003c/strong\u003e for creating, editing, and fine-tuning storyworlds. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first step in this process will be to complete \u003cstrong\u003eSiboot\u003c/strong\u003e, the \u0027proof-of-concept\u0027 demonstration of the power of the technology. Then, we\u0027ll go to work cleaning up the toolkit software, to make it accessible to non-programmers. We\u0027re going to finish this one way or the other, but your help will speed up our work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the 30th of each month we will release something indicative of our progress. We are still working out the details, but we have decided that we will release the Encounter Tester on July 30th. This is the software that allows us to test the Encounters used in the Siboot game. The editing is done in XML, but we are looking into the prospect of improving it so that you can edit directly. If so, that will be released later.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollow our work at \u003ca href=\"http://www.siboot.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.siboot.org\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/siboot\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/siboot\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Sibootgame\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e@sibootgame\u003c/a\u003e."

     "about": "Chris Crawford has been designing computer games for 37\nyears. He sold his first game in 1978, and has created 14 published games and\nfour books on game design. He founded the Game Developers Conference, has\nlectured on game design all over the world, and has been the subject of\ncountless press stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe always dreamed to see games become an art form, and he\nknew that interactive storytelling was the way to make that happen. But he saw\nthat a change in the game design paradigm was necessary. He understood that\ngluing story onto game and simply alternating between the two would not be\nenough. He wanted to dig into the essence of storytelling, to make storytelling\nitself interactive. For twenty years he struggled with this idea, a revolution\nin game design, until it became his obsession. At last, all the pieces have\nstarted to come together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is thanks to a group of people from all over the world:\nFrance, Uruguay, Australia and USA, building on Chris\u0027 work to create something\nbigger, something truly revolutionary. They soon become a team: The Knights. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLed by Crawford, this team of volunteers is hard at work\nbuilding a game called SIBOOT and the technology behind it.\u003cbr\u003e",
