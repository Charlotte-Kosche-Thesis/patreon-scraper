I\u0027ve been producing web content for about 3 years including creating and running a nonbinary resource website at \u003ca href=\"http://lifeoutsidethebinary.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLife Outside the Binary\u003c/a\u003e, and my \u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/c/welkingender\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e where I talk about my own experiences as a transgender, nonbinary and intersex person as well as various queer and political topics. I also write and publish zines which are available on my \u003ca href=\"http://lanepatriquin.storenvy.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStorenvy\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to transgender activism I am also an anarchist involved in community organizing and I have recently taken on the project of producing a political YouTube series exploring various anti-fascist, anti-capitalist, anti-oppressive and anarchist ideas. I have gotten pretty good reception to these videos so far, and my hope is to turn what is currently a 3-video playlist into a much larger web project to make these ideas accessible to as many people as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to various health issues I am currently living on a fixed income occasionally supplemented by part-time employment, which has not been enough to cover my bills or basic living expenses. The overhead for the content I produce is paid for out of pocket including cost of video and computer equipment and software, web hosting, and costs associated with IRL community organizing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving a stable source of income would also alleviate much stress, financial and technical limitations and time constraints, which would allow me to produce videos more regularly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal through Patreon is to help cover my living expenses and hopefully begin to paying off student debt. If I find myself in a place with surplus income I hope to buy a new computer (currently working off an old half-dead Acer), upgrade my equipment to improve the quality of my videos, and put money into local community organizing in Toronto. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\n started writing and making videos I was really hoping that sharing my thoughts and experiences would help other people going through similar things, and I truly hope that I\u0027ve been able to do that for some people. I know all of you engage and relate to my content has been an extremely rewarding experience in and of itself which has helped me grow in ways I was not anticipating. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e"
