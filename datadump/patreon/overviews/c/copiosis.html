By becoming a monthly Patron of my work, you\u2019re making my dream of having a world that works way better for everyone, possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Copisois?\u003c/strong\u003e It\u2019s a socio-economic system that has everything we like about today\u2019s world, but none of the things we don\u2019t.\u00a0In Copiosis you\u2019re debt-free and never can get into debt and you can do whatever you want. Meanwhile all your necessities are provided at no cost to anyone, while those providing you those things get rich. Oh, and everyone enjoys environmental stability and unprecedented human prosperity. Sound like Utopia? It\u2019s not. But it\u2019s close.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eA basic Q\u0026amp;A\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u2019s wrong with today\u2019s society?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/strong\u003eNothing, really. But consider this: there are probably programs in your country providing \u201cwelfare\u201d and \u201caid\u201d. You know, a social safety net. But most of us must \u201cearn\u201d necessities, while at the same time bear the cost (through taxes) of these \u201cwelfare\u201d and \u201caid\u201d programs.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe provide luxuries (things we don\u2019t need but want) only to those who accumulate excess money beyond what is needed to afford necessities. We then artificially inflate luxury demand, driving ever-increasing consumption and production. This is how we create \u201cjobs\u201d, things people can do for money. But often those things people do aren\u2019t the things they would rather do, if they had more freedom.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSince most can\u2019t buy all the luxuries we want at once, our civilization extends \u201ccredit\u201d, thus creating debt. \u00a0Unquestioning belief in this debt-based monetary framework and the decision-making behaviors it causes creates nearly every single human and environmental challenge and risk we face today.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u2019s wrong with paying people to do things?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLots. But the biggest problem is every money existing today is amoral: it can be used for good or bad. Money amorality combined with the debt-based system above makes all our challenges and risks very hard to solve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u2019s the solution?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA legal transition process accomplishing three things:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake necessities (food, clothing, shelter, education, healthcare) available to all worldwide at no cost.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDefine, then measure and only reward \u201cbeneficial human actions\u201d creating a moral reward system.

In the end, \u003cem\u003eeverybody\u003c/em\u003e lives a fabulously prosperous life. \u003cem\u003eYou\u003c/em\u003e choose work matching \u003cem\u003eyour\u003c/em\u003e values, passions, aspirations and interests free from debt forever.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u2019s impossible.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur life today is \u003ca href=\"http://humanscience.wikia.com/wiki/Worst_Predictions\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efilled with\u003c/a\u003e things experts believed were impossible and ridiculous, but are commonplace or becoming so. So Copiosis is in good company. We\u2019ve already shown very good \u003ca href=\"https://copiosis.com/status-of-demonstration-projects\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eearly-stage evidence\u003c/a\u003e we can make Copiosis reality. This evidence has given hope to thousands of people around the world. Making Copiosis a global reality is simply a matter of continuing our work. That\u2019s going to take more patrons helping keep our work going. That\u2019s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo one will go for it\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI once thought that too. But today, more people are calling for fundamental change. Even \u003ca href=\"https://globalchallenges.org/en/about/about-us\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emultimillionaires and billionaires\u003c/a\u003e are not only looking for new systems to replace our current one, they\u2019re offering \u003ca href=\"https://globalchallenges.org/en\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehuge cash\u003c/a\u003e prizes for them. More proof: there are already patrons currently supporting Copiosis. Hope is a powerful thing!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe mainstream is catching up with what our current patrons already know: It\u2019s time for something better. Copiosis offers our best opportunity. Now\u2019s a great time to become a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are other people saying about Copiosis?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere area some of the multiple dozens of comments I\u2019ve gotten about Copiosis:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201c[It\u2019s] the most well thought out, detailed innovation I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cExtraordinary in its comprehensiveness.

A virtual reward called \u201cNet Benefit Rewards (NBR)\u201d replaces all these. NBR is not money. When you \u201cpay\u201d for something, your NBR is deducted from your account, but it will not go into someone else\u2019s account. Instead it disappears.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you get \u201cpaid\u201d for something, your \u201cpayment\u201d doesn\u2019t come from someone else\u2019s NBR account either. Instead, it\u2019s created specifically for you and comes from nowhere.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eA person\u2019s \u201cNet Benefit\u201d output determines one\u2019s \u201cpay\u201d. If you decide to do something that benefits someone or the environment, but also negatively effects someone or the environment, then your Net Benefit will be: the good you\u2019ve done minus the bad you\u2019ve done. It\u2019s in your \u201cfinancial interest\u201d then to be as ethical and environmentally-benign or regenerative as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eEveryone is free to pursue passions. That\u2019s the purpose of Copiosis. Freed to pursue passions results in very high quality decision making, resulting in high quality, productive human output. Pursuits generating Net Beneficial output are rewarded. Net Negative Beneficial output receives no reward.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThere are three product and service classifications in Copiosis: Necessities, Capital Goods and Luxuries. Necessities are basic housing, clothing, food, education and medical care. All the stuff you need to live. Necessities are provided at no cost for everyone in the world. No one should have to \u2018earn a living\u2019 doing what they hate, earning just enough money to stay alive so they can continue doing what they hate. Today\u2019s civilization can easily provide the basics of life to all. In Copiosis it does. Meanwhile, those making such goods and services are \u201cpaid\u201d handsomely for their work!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eCapital goods are things enterprises use to produce products and services. These things are provided to all at no cost as well. The only problem then is incentive to work and resource distribution. That\u2019s where Luxuries come in\u2026If you want anything beyond the semi-prosperous life Necessities allow \u2013 which for most people on the planet today would be a far cry better than what capitalism provides \u2013 you must decide to do something that allows you to receive NBR.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSay you decide you want a TV, car, designer clothes, musical instrument, nice furniture, cellphone, coffee maker, umbrella, whatever. Getting these things requires you do something that produces more positive effects in the world than negative ones. More Net Benefit in other words.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHow much NBR people get depends on how much Net Benefit they produce. How people get \u201cpaid\u201d is decided by a non-government, all volunteer, totally open institution called the Payer Organization. They use an algorithm which measures one\u2019s Net Benefit output and rewards the actor with calculated NBR. The Payer Organization\u2019s sole job is ensure everyone is fairly \u201cpaid\u201d through the algorithm.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe Payer Organization is open to anyone and is all-volunteer. It comprises tens of millions of people dispersed worldwide monitoring human activity. The algorithm they use includes all variables needed to reward people for any action taken. Payers collect data the algorithm needs to calculate individual rewards, administer the algorithm, the software and performs other functions as needed, but they all support this core function of rewarding people. Payers have no other function and no other authority. They create no laws and have no ability to tell people what to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eResources are distributed where the most Net Benefit is possible. Think about that. What activities would generate the most Net Benefit? It would be places where the most harm is currently happening. Environmental work, low income areas, places where civic unrest occurs, heavy industries that pollute and destroy the environment, the energy industry...all these areas would be transformed by peopled freed, and armed with resources to solve these challenge areas. But a whole lot of other areas would benefit too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWith Necessities provided to all and money, debt and capital (money) investment compensated for and thus eliminated via our transition plan, people are free to do what they believe is best. People know what decisions to make and what actions to take. But they often don\u2019t because the \u003cstrong\u003eprofit motive \u003c/strong\u003eis often in conflict with those actions.\u00a0In Copiosis, people are free to take those actions as they seek to maximize both Net Benefit and their personal NBR.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe only regulations needed to make Copiosis function are a law which legalizes Copiosis as the governance model, and an enshrinement (in Law) of the principles which make Copiosis work.\u00a0People then organize\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://georgiebc.wordpress.com/2012/12/24/stigmergy-2/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estigmergically\u003c/a\u003e around challenges and risks (in Copiosis these are called \u201cmarkets\u201d) the solving of which generates Net Benefit and individual NBR Maximization. Copiosis does not propose how to solve these challenges and risks. Instead, it creates the context in which solving them becomes eminently practical by eliminating barriers which make their solving impractical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIsn\u2019t NBR just another currency?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSome people think that. But it\u2019s not.\u00a0There are a lot more reasons why NBR is not money. I go into pretty detailed explanation about this in this \u003ca href=\"https://copiosis.com/why-copiosis-is-more-than-just-another-monetary-system/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epost\u003c/a\u003e. Here\u2019s a summary:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor one, it is a moral form of reward. All forms of money are a-moral. Second, it is rewarded only after the effects of an action are known, and the reward is only made for actions that benefit the planet and or people. Negative or harmful results are not rewarded. Money doesn\u2019t work that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThird, NBR is non-transferrable. When a consumer wants a product, she doesn\u2019t hand her NBR over to the producer of the product. The producer offers the good, the consumer accepts it, and gives up her NBR. Her NBR goes out of existence. Once the effects of consuming that good show up in the real world, i.e the consumer uses the product and sees some results from using it, the NBR algorithm (via the Payer Organization) rewards the producer with NBR based on several inputs used in the algorithm. These inputs measure the results and measure how \u201cbeneficial\u201d the results are to the consumer, to society, and to the planet. Assuming the \u201cnet\u201d benefit is positive, the producer is rewarded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis three-way transaction is unique to NBR. It replaces the two-party transaction dilemma that naturally exists between buyers and sellers, where one party is always advantaged with more information and therefore more power in the exchange.\u00a0The NBR algorithm also is unique.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMoney is a store of value. There is no concept of inherent value in NBR. Value is measured in results, not through finance. Net Benefit is what NBR measures, not value.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNBR is not backed by debt, gold, or other standard, not even a fiat, really. It is simply a measure of and a reward for how well a producer\u2019s action benefits consumers and the planet. Money does not act that way either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOther critical differences include the following: no one is forced to earn NBR to afford necessities. You can\u2019t get into NBR debt. Your NBR can\u2019t be taken from you (they\u2019re non transferrable, remember?) so you are far more free in Copiosis to choose what you do with your time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you were free to do whatever you wanted with your time, if you had no debt, and you can\u2019t get into debt, if all your necessities were provided to you at no cost to you (including education and medical care), what would you do with your time?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy guess is most people (far more than not) would do things that benefit others or the planet. Money doesn\u2019t inspire the majority of us this way. Does it for you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will you make this happen?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur transition plan has produced early-stage results proving we\u2019re using our patron funding responsibly.

     "about": "I really like making the world a better place than it already is and my career demonstrates that. My first company, as an entrepreneur was my personal brand in which I delivered motivational \u00a0speeches to corporate customers.  NedWater, my second startup, delivered mineral water from a 10,000 year old aquifer to companies via bicycle donating 20% of its revenues to Portland non-profits. Portland startup Journey Gym hired me in 2010 as its COO, a title I held for three years. We helped get people fit! The rest of my working life includes an eight-year stint at Intel, nine years at Bonneville Power Administration, and nine years as a US Marine combat correspondent. I have an MBA from a small private school, but who cares about that? What really matters is what I\u2019m doing right \u003cem\u003enow.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spend most of my personal life living happily, thinking about the future, manifesting my dreams and loving people.
