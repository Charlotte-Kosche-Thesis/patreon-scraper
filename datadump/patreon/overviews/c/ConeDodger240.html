Road racing and Autocross are my passion, and that carries over into the gaming content I primarily enjoy. 5 years ago I started making YouTube videos showcasing some of my favorite racing simulations, and over time picked up doing other fun or interesting \u00a0games to cover.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1000\u0027s of videos later I am having more fun with doing YT videos than ever, I have a great fan base that is always supportive and interactive in my endeavors in sim racing, fictional car company building and anything else I might do on a whim.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy start a Patreon Fundraiser?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWithout a doubt, my biggest passion is in creating video content. Whether that be gaming series, like F1 or Automation or in real life endeavors like Cone\u0027s Garage, I want to be able to share my perspective on the things I am passionate about. Unfortunately the landscape of YouTube is not what it once was, and there is not yet a perfect replacement either for the service, or the income it provided. Support here gives me the chance to keep working at bringing you the content I love making, without compromise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you, the Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of the start of the campaign, the main goal is to provide for you quality video of interesting content I previously wouldn\u0027t have been able to provide. There are different levels of patronage to start with, but these will be adjusted with time to give you more options, with more physical rewards depending on the success of the campaign. The largest perk of being a Patron is the \u003cstrong\u003eDiscord \u003c/strong\u003eserver, where I interact on a daily basis and hold a variety of patron-exclusive game nights!"
