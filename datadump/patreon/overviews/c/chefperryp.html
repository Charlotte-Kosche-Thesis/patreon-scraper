    "summary": "My name is Perry P. Perkins, I\u0027m a third generation professional chef, and my mission is helping and supporting our community, and those who need us most, by doing what I love\u2026 feeding hungry kids, and teaching them to feed themselves and others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013, along with two friends, I founded the MY KITCHEN Outreach Program, a free hands-on learning program of basic nutrition, planning, shopping, and cooking classes for at-risk youth, special needs, and under-served kids and families, working primarily out of my garage, with my own cooking gear. Three years later, we incorporated as a 501(c)3 Non-Profit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have partnered with organizations like Impact Northwest, Kings for the Kids, The Amy Roloff Charity Foundation, and public schools, to offer hands on, \u201creal food\u201d cooking classes at no cost. Think of it as \u201cHome Ec.\u201d for kids who may have never had a stable home environment in which to learn these essential skills. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work with children in sexual-abuse suvivor camps, local foster-care groups, and learning-challenged public school classes, to teach these valueable life skills, as well as address desperately needed self-esteem and self worth issues in the most fragile sectors of today\u0027s children. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that the ability to cook for oneself is a basic skill needed by everyone, and that the confidence and independence that comes along with these skills will transfer into all other areas of these kid\u2019s lives. In other words, if they can cook for themselves, they learn that they can do anything else they want to do. I also send out a free weekly newsletter of healthy, affordable, and simple to prepare weekly dinner recipes along with itemized shopping lists to make it easier for working folks and families to cook for themselves. The menus are available in standard, diabetic friendly, and gluten free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to use my experience and passion to help these kids get beyond just surviving, and into a bright, thriving, valuable future, that give them the ability to pay it forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for helping me help them.\u003cbr\u003e"
