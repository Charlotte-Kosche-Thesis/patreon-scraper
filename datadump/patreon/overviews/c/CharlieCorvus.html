    "summary": "In February 2018, with 3/4 of an Associates degree, I dropped out of art school. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe grant funding my degree ran out of money, and with it went my time in school. This leaves me...up in the air. I know that I want to create stories for people to enjoy, but I also know that I need to spend more time learning before I take on any sort of massive projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon creates a compromise for both. Here I have the chance to share what I\u0027m learning \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e develop story concepts that I can flesh out as I build my skills. My grant for school was my only source of income and I\u0027ve got multiple permanent injuries that prevent me from being physically able to work. Other than self-employment, I don\u0027t have any options.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming my patron helps support my growth while you get to watch as my stories develop. I get the support I need to continue writing; you get stories and notes you can use for your own exploration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what kinds of stories will this Patreon feature?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFairytales. Big, queer fairytales. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFantasy writing drew my attention even as a child. Especially adaptations of well-known fairytales like Sleeping Beauty or Cinderella. As I\u0027ve gotten older and explored my own identity, my taste has evolved. A majority of my stories now involve a queer cast, murder, and sexual situations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis isn\u0027t only \"what if Cinderella met a girl at the ball\". Cinderella might be an assassin sent to seduce the prince destabilize the monarchy. Red Riding Hood might be a forest vigilante dating a trans werewolf.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, these exist as concepts with no solid plot. With the support of my patrons I can turn these into an illustrated series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about notes?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn addition to sharing my writing and art inspired by these concepts, monthly updates will also include information and sketches as I try to develop my abilities. This includes things like media studies, fiction writing techniques, and concept development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I learn, the ratio of studies-to-stories will probably evolve with me. Because there\u0027s still a lot I want to refresh on before beginning any serious world-building, a majority of my posts will be about the things I\u0027m studying. The stories themselves will be less prominent aside from monthly rewards, but the part they play will grow bigger as I develop the proper tools to tell the stories I want.\u003cbr\u003e"
