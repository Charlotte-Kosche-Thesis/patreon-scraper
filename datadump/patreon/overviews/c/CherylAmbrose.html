    "summary": "Writing. It\u2019s the hardest job in the world\nbecause your boss is the nagging voice in your head telling you that you\u2019re not\ngood enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eImagine if you could get rid of that voice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine the words to\nyour novel or short stories flowing effortlessly onto the page until you reach\nthe magic words, The End. Imagine. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe solution\u003c/h4\u003e\n\nI have been a writer for over 20 years. But\nI kept hearing that voice until I started working on the idea of creating a\ntool to banish writer\u2019s block. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNobody waved a magic wand but I started to write\nconsistently. Every aspect of writing from outlining, plotting and the actual\nputting down of words onto the page became a joyful process. I no longer ended\nthe day in a tired old heap of doubt and guilt. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf it worked for me, I figure\nit\u2019ll work for all writers. Your stories are needed to make this world a\nhappier place. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eIt\u2019s in the cards\u003c/h4\u003e\n\nI am creating The Ultimate Writer\u2019s Toolkit\nto Banish Writer\u2019s Block. It is a deck of cards featuring some of world\u2019s\ngreatest writers and their works. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach card is a prompt of the subconscious\nblock preventing you from writing that novel/poem/short story. Every day before\nyou begin writing, you\u2019ll shuffle the deck and randomly select a card. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\naccompanying book will explain why you\u2019re struggling to write (your\nsubconscious battle) and offer writing prompts to breakthrough that struggle.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt sounds a little woo hoo, but hey, so does Harry Potter. Magic or not, the\ncards work.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eShow your support to end writer\u2019s block\u003c/h4\u003e\n\nThis is a massive project that I expect\nwill take at least 18 months to complete. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat means stealing time from my day job\nto research, analyse, liaise with the artist who will be designing the cards,\nand writing the book that will accompany the deck. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will keep the\ninspiration flowing and ensure that writers everywhere will soon hold in their\nhands The Ultimate Writer\u2019s Toolkit to Banish Writer\u2019s Block.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $1 a month (a grand total of $18 for the entire project) you\u0027ll get random quotes. Use them wisely.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $2 a month (I think that makes $36 in all) you\u0027ll get writing prompts. Do with them as you wish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $5 a month (what is 5 times 18?) you\u0027ll get to write! And see your stuff published. Perhaps.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $50 a month (not even going to bother doing the math) you get undying gratitude plus your name incorporated in one of the 54 cards that make up this deck. Oh, and I\u0027ll send you a signed copy of the deck as soon as it is published.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e"
