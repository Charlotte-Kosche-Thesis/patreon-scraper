We do Actual Plays, Let\u0027s Plays, and original content, such as our How Not to Series (there\u0027s a hundred YouTube channels that want to show you how to play a fighter or a rogue; we want to show you funny it is to do it wrong) and the RPG Imaginarium\u0027s, where we do dramatic readings of /tg/ greentexts and other stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re here because we seriously want to up the quality of the content we give to our viewers, as well as expand the content we produce.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Does This Patreon Cover?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis Patreon is for what we refer to internally as our \"Original Content.\" That\u0027s both of our \"How Not To\" series, the RPG Imaginarium, (the stories may belong to others, but the production of the show is all ours) and the upcoming rebirth of the Dungeon Dweebus podcast. We\u0027ve got plans for other new shows we\u0027re excited to bring to our audience as well, and when they launch, this Patreon will cover them too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Only One Reward Tier?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSimply put, we\u0027re not interested in gating our content behind a paywall. Everything Caffeinated Conquests produces is 100% free for everyone to enjoy. We want you to support us because you enjoy and believe in our product and because you \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to support us, not because we\u0027re extorting money from you or you\u0027re afraid of missing something if you don\u0027t.\u00a0Our viewers come first, and we would rather not make a dime from someone than bilk them out of their hard-earned cash.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re one of our fans, we just want to thank you for tuning in and enjoying our content, and if you\u0027re one of our patrons, we sincerely thank you for helping this channel grow. Patron or not, without you, there would be no Caffeinated Conquests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTransparency:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe do have other avenues through which we attempt to raise money for production. Though none of them are particularly strong sounces of income on their own (which is why we\u0027re turning to Patreon in the first place) you deserve to know about them before you pledge in case you decide to support us another way, or not at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe do run ads on our videos. It has so far afforded us a small trickle of income in case we need to make an emergency replacement of a piece of equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChaz sells original fiction on the Amazon Kindle store, the proceeds of which usually go into the emergency fund.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have an Amazon affilliate link on our SoundCloud. Honestly, I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve made a dime from this so far.\u003cbr\u003e"
