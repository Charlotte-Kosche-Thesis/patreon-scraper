Spares don\u0027t cost that much (depending on what you\u0027re trying to get hold of) but when you add into that, postage costs, paints, paintbrushes, tools, glues, other resource building materials...well it starts to add up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThats where you guys come in, by supporting my Patreon you will be helping me pay for all these things and in doing so ensuring that I will always have new things to make and new content for my channel, and this will also help me towards larger projects in future, such as my plans to build a full size TARDIS, and may even help contribute to fan films I hope to produce in the hopefully not to distant future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut as well as that by supporting my Patreon, it helps support not just my channel, but me as well, because the more support my Patreon gets, the more support my channel gets, and the more support my channel gets, the higher chance I may be able to take it on as a full time job in the years to come, and if that happens, then it makes the idea of me taking customs commissions, is not just more possible but potentially more cheaper as I will be able to help use my Patreon to fund this venture meaning that the buyers don\u0027t have to pay as much for materials costs...but we are getting way ahead of ourselves there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany people often view Patreon as people asking for money for nothing, and whilst I am currently offering and planning exclusive content and rewards for the future, I will make one thing clear...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou don\u0027t HAVE to support my Patreon...would I like people to support it? Of course! But that doesn\u0027t give me the right tell them they HAVE to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll I\u0027m asking is that if you like my channel and want to see me continuing to create the content that I make then it would be greatly appreciated by me if you would support my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow much do I want from you? $10,000, $1000, $500....none of that, all I\u0027m asking for is $1 a month, just $1 from every person who supports my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow of course if you want to support me with more than $1 I will be only too grateful, not to mention donating more also entitles you my exclusive content and also the rewards, but the main reason I only want to ask people for $1 is to prove I\u0027m not just in this for the money, what I need is your support, and if just 500 people pledge just $1 a month then not only would I hit my first goal but also that\u0027s $500 more to my customs budget than when I started!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I said before I\u0027m not going to tell you that you HAVE to support my Patreon, but it would mean alot to me if you did, to be a full time YouTuber is my dream but being a YouTuber means having the support of your subscribers, so if I\u0027m asking for anything from you, it\u0027s that....your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- CJP\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBefore donating to my page please read the following legal information regarding terms and conditions and copyright\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS :\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePosts made to my Patreon will be set accordingly to their donation amounts, providing you meet the minimum donation amount you will be able to view the post i.e. those donating to the $10 tier will also be able to see all $1-$5 posts as well at no extra cost.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn regards to the $15 tier, single donations WILL NOT entitle you to the reward, there are 5 open spots for this tier and to qualify for a spot the donation MUST be on-going.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is to deter people from donating once, simply to claim the rewards and then lowering their donation.\u003cbr\u003e\nOnly those who have consistently donated to the $15 will be eligible for the reward, this also means those who donate at the last minute simply to try and claim the reward will also not be eligible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003ePatreon provides me with a monthly invoice allowing me to see who has donated what per month, and whether the donation has indeed been paid or declined.\u003cbr\u003e\nI will be able to use this to confirm peoples donations and the length of time they have donated for.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eAside from any Rewards listed, supporting my Patreon does not entitle anyone to any free custom commissions, or any other personalised or general incentive, material or otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\nI do not currently nor do I have plans to start taking commissions for customs.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eAny donations made to this page are contributing to nothing more or less than the creation of my own content, and the time and resources I spend making it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy donating to my Patreon you understand and agree to these terms and conditions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eRegarding video/custom content and copyright :\u003cbr\u003e\nAll copyright of music/soundtrack(s)/registered trademarks \u0026amp; icons belongs to the respective companies and/or persons, I do not own copyright on any outside/existing material.\u003cbr\u003e\nItems of my own creation/modifications are considered fan-made and therefore exempt from copyright unless stated otherwise, any copyright on existing material used in any creations/modifications belongs to the respective companies and/or persons.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll Doctor Who and associated registered trademarks/copyrights, music and other assorted materials are property of the BBC and respective parties.\u003c/p\u003e"
