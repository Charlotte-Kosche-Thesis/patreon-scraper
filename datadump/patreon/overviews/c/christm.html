I\u0027d love to do more, but its expensive and it takes its toll. I have a day job to support this, but its always a stretch and I guess my biggest dream would be to do this full-time, all the time, but reality being as it is, that\u0027s just not possible for me right now. So that\u0027s why I\u0027m here; to cover some of the burden, to make sure I can continue paying models, paying for locations and being able to travel to shoot. Its never been about profit for me; its always been a labour of love. I love seeing fellow artists be successful, and contributing to their success through our work together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I do what I do\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI rarely shoot anything/anyone but models. I tried many other genres: street, landscapes, live music, weddings, etc., and was never happy. The list is almost unending. Ten years ago, I shot my first nude model and haven\u0027t looked back since. I can wax poetic about the beauty and go on endlessly about the energy and soulful expression, but I think you get it by me just saying that. Its just beautiful life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love seeing you here and can\u0027t wait to start posting on December 1 :)\u003c/strong\u003e"
