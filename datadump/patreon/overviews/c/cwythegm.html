    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your interest in my project!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027ve played Dungeons and Dragons for decades, and while I loved being a Gamemaster (hereafter, GM), I always looked to technology to take on many of the aspects that I found tedious. From using word processors in the 80\u0027s, to writing my own campaign tracking system in C++, I continually sought to streamline the GM experience so that I could focus on the creative aspects and give my players a better-run game. In 2017, while running several different groups through my campaign world, I created a spreadsheet to track combats, including initiatives, hit points, monster attack rolls and saving throws. As the macros grew more complex, and the history keeping pages got more sophisticated, I was inspired to revive my old campaign system. This was the genesis of \u003cstrong\u003eGMCampaigner\u003c/strong\u003e, the (not-very-imaginatively-named) comprehensive system for Gamemasters to create, manage and track their 5e Dungeons and Dragons campaigns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, What Is It?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, let\u0027s get a few things out of the way about what it is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e. GMCampaigner is strictly for the GM -- it doesn\u0027t do player rolls, or track character hit points or anything beyond initiative and surprise status. It is also not intended to facilitate online games (specifically), and it\u0027s not intended to supplant platforms such as Roll20.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat it does do is help you, the GM, manage your campaign, adventures and encounters. It is (currently) a Windows native application. It does not use a database -- all data is stored in human-readable JSON-format files, and can be edited (within reason) by hand if necessary. All content provided is from the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.5thsrd.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e5e Dungeons and Dragons SRD (version 5.1)\u003c/a\u003e. So, creatures, spells and magic items are limited to those available under the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.5thsrd.org/license/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSRD license\u003c/a\u003e, and mechanics like treasure generation and encounter building are my own, not those from the official books. Of course, you can create your own creatures, spells and magic items in GMCampaigner, including ones out of published sources that you own. Data can be stored either in local files or on Google Drive so that it\u0027s easier to use it from multiple places.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Cool Stuff Does It Have?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt features the ability to track multiple campaigns, with multiple player parties in each.\u00a0Each campaign has it\u0027s own calendars, currency, images/ documents/ misc. files, rule variation settings and non-player characters. Within each campaign, you can create adventures that have their own subsets of campaign resources, as well as pre-built and (coming soon) random encounters. The encounter builder will rate the difficulty based on existing parties (so that you can judge the lethality before throwing your players into the deep end...). You can also assign individual, randomly generated treasures for one or more creatures in an encounter, as well as a randomly generated hoard treasure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/WDI2OHj\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHere is a gallery of random screen shots from version 0.7.5\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Support Me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, there\u0027s lots more than I\u0027ve touched on here. If GMCampaigner is something that interests you, supporting me will allow me to polish for other people to use, write some documentation, and begin to add features that I think would be helpful. I want to properly implement random encounters, explore creating Android and iOS apps for use at the game table, and do some exhaustive testing.\u003cbr\u003e"
