    "summary": "Hey, thanks for supporting!.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a young musician and Founder of BASS CLEFFED, a brand devoted to inspiring the next generation through the playing of music. Music is a language and should be available to everyone! I\u0027m looking to provide contemporary music education and need your help to make this happen!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince\u00a0graduating from my degree in professional music performance at ACM Guildford at 19 years old, I have recorded for Incognito\u0027s Chris Ballin, worked with Idris Elba, BBC and Children\u0027s TV star, Justin Fletcher. Yet this means nothing if I do not leave a legacy in helping others get into music!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy? Supporting The Strings movement on Patreon will allow me to do cool stuff like getting help with building online courses, recording new videos or even assistance with editing! This would be a huge help to make widely available complete courses and packages and aid me in moving forward in my mission!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow? Several cool reward levels allow you to tailor your subscription.  I would like to convince you to choose one, even at \u00a33, so you have access to the feed here on Patreon.  Sometimes YouTube\u0027s subscription methods are unreliable, and if you sign up via Patreon you\u0027ll be notified directly when I post an update, which is pretty awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat? If you\u0027d like to go above and beyond to help me do things like travel for recordings, invest in equipment, collaborate with other musicians and artists, and \u00a0help pay my student fees.... picking any of the larger support levels will certainly help do these things! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe it goes without saying that I greatly appreciate your financial support. I\u0027ll say it anyways though. Thank you. I really do appreciate it. The Patreon model has us place rewards here to entice you to donate, but if we\u0027re both honest... you\u0027re here because you understand what I\u0027m trying to do with BASS CLEFFED, providing music education in an innovative, effective way and you think the 1000+ hours I put into exploring the realms of music is worth it! You \"get it\". You\u0027re a fellow thinker and doer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCaleb Wilson\u003cbr\u003eBASS CLEFFED\u003cbr\u003etl;dr\u003cbr\u003e- Pledges are per month\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e- Thank you so much for stopping by, every little bit is appreciated!\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
