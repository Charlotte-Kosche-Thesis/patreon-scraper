     "about": "Animation is something I can talk about for days.\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s because the medium is just a great mixture of all the arts. From film to illustration, animation, I believe, is the best medium for storytelling.\u003cbr\u003eI love telling stories through animation because you\u2019re breathing life into drawings. In character design, you\u0027re telling their back story through how they look. In animation, you tell their personality by how they act through multiple drawings being shot at 24 frames a second.\u003cbr\u003eHow awesome is that!\u003cbr\u003eWhenever I tell friends about an idea I have for a next project, they tell me that I light up. I get so passionate with an idea that it helps me stay motivated.\u003cbr\u003eEven when a client tells me their idea, I build upon it. Brainstorming with them so that it can be the best it can be! So that they feel comfortable that their idea is in good hands.\u003cbr\u003eWhen I am not doing client work, I hire myself and work on my own ideas.\u003cbr\u003eCurrently the two big projects I am working on is my animated web series \u003cem\u003eMolly\u2019s Follies\u003c/em\u003e. I also host a Youtube channel and blog discussing my love for animation, helpful tutorials and present my work in progress for all to see. If you want to learn more check out my website at www.chrisjaserart.com.  Don\u2019t forget to subscribe to get the latest updates from me through your favorite social media site.\u003cbr\u003e",
