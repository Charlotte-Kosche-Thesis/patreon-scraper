    "summary": "Hi peeps.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eMy channel recieved a lot of appreciation from you guys over the last one and a half years and it was growing fairly consistently. Thanks to every single one of you for that. Believe me, it means everything to me. Because of you guys, I was able to do youtube part-time at some point and due to that i was also able to dedicate more time into it. \u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately the recent advertisement and monetization changes on YouTube lowered my earnings so significantly that soon enough, I will no longer be able to do YouTube part-time anymore and I will be forced into a full-time job again.  The problem with a full-time job in regards to my youtube channel is, that each day only has 24 hours. Let\u0027s take 8 hours away for sleep, 10 hours away for a full-time job and everything that is associated with it and additional 3 hours for necessary activities. This would leave me with approximately 3 hours left on each and every day that I could spend on creating videos. As hard as I would try, that wouldn\u0027t work. The only time I could work on videos effectively would be on weekends. Unfortunately, even a whole weekend of doing nothing but working on a video during every spare minute I would have wouldn\u0027t be enough to get a video even halfway done. It\u0027s not simply the workload alone like recording, editing, uploading etc. that is associated with these kind of videos, especially in 4k/60Fps, takes a lot of \ntime. All these thoughts that goes into the planning of my videos is just as time consuming, probably even more time consuming than just the workload itself. It\u0027s absolutely necessary though in order to keep my videos as unique, original and as high quality as possible.\u003cbr\u003eI think you guys get the idea; with a full-time job, I simply wouldn\u0027t have enough time available to create the content you know me for.\u003cbr\u003eGiving up my channel after all this time would be heartbreaking for me to say the least. Not only because i would have to give up a huge passion, also because i would miss interacting with the mainly great people that have gathered around my channel after all this time.\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to, you can support my channel further and in addition to YouTube here on Patreon. You can do so by monthly pledging/donating any amount that you think is appropriate. Feel free to pledge/donate as little or as much as you want. Every one of those is greatly appreciated and helps me a lot. Please don\u0027t worry if you can\u0027t support me on Patreon though! Since you found your way here I\u0027m sure that you supported my channel by viewing, liking, sharing, interacting and/or subscribing already anyway, which is a great deal as well and also very highly appreciated, of course. \u003cbr\u003eI think with Patreon we actually have a solid chance of reaching more independency for my channel by getting away from YouTube\u0027s fairly inconsistent advertisement and monetization system. That means even if things don\u0027t go back to normal on YouTube, which I believe won\u0027t happen anytime soon, if at all, I would be covered and can continue creating high level gameplay videos for you guys - no matter what. \u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking your time to stop by. And again, such a massive thanks for all the support you guys have given me over the last years. It\u0027s been an incredible journey with you guys and I hope for many more years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest regards, Clockner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
