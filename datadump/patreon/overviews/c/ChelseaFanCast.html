    "summary": "The Chelsea FanCast is a weekly live internet radio show and podcast broadcasting every Monday night for two hours between 19.00 and 21.00 GMT on \u003ca href=\"http://mixlr.com/chelsea-fancast\"\u003eMixlr.com\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://chelseafancast.com/\"\u003echelseafancast.com\u003c/a\u003e with the podcast being available to download from the website and \u003ca href=\"https://www.acast.com/chelseafancast\"\u003eAcast\u003c/a\u003e,  \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/chelsea-football-fancast/id220201865\"\u003eITunes\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/chelseafancast\"\u003eSoundcloud\u003c/a\u003e and various other podcast distributors. The Monday show is supplemented by \u0027The Kerry Dixon Show\u0027 on Thursday\u0027s where Chelsea legend, Kerry Dixon previews the weekend game and picks up on any other Chelsea related issues during the week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started podcasting in 2008, just before the ill-fated Champions\u0027 League final in Moscow - 4 mates, one pub and a lot of Guinness!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePresented by  \u0027Stamford Chidge\u0027, the show discusses the latest Chelsea issues from the fans perspective. Chidge is joined by Jonathan Kydd, Dan Silver, Clayton Beerman, Tony Glover, Alex Churchill (The Girl Who Likes Balls) and Mark Worrall and a host of other well known Chelsea faces to carry on the pub chat on the show. We are home and away season ticket holders and most important, all mates who go to the games together and drink in the local pubs before and after. In addition, when they can be begged, borrowed or stolen, some of the Football Pundits, Journalists, ex-Players and legends, Chelsea authors and Celebs and downright nutters we know make guest appearances on the show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ethos remains to produce a show with good friends who share a love of talking about the game and the club we all love - calling it as we see it; taking the mick out of each other and sharing the experience we are lucky enough to have in going to the games and enjoying the match day atmosphere.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a nutshell the Chelsea FanCast is about authentic match going football fan opinion, focusing on the personalities and humour of match going supporters to provide the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u2018this is what it was like to be there\u2019\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e experience appealing to football supporters whether they were there or not!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as the football chat and inherent humour in the show, the Chelsea FanCast has always had a strong campaigning and a serious edge, tackling issues important to both Chelsea supporters and the wider football community such as ticket pricing; safe standing; the Chelsea Pitch Owners, atmosphere and racism head on. We back this up with representation on the Official Chelsea FC Fans Forum and the Chelsea Supporters\u0027 Trust.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the things we have cherished most in 10 years of Chelsea FanCast is the sense of community we have discovered. We have been privileged to hear from and meet many listeners from the UK and all over the world on their visits to Stamford Bridge. Many have become firm friends. Many have asked how they can support us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoining the Patreon platform provides a more concrete way for our listeners to show their support and enables us to cover the costs of running two shows a week and continue to produce what we believe is a unique podcast on all things Chelsea, whilst offering some rewards to our listeners by way of a thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts early days for us on Patreon but as we go on we\u0027ll come up with some suitable rewards such as participation in shows, questions to Kerry Dixon, meet and greets at the local pubs, exclusive Fancast parties and access to additional content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime join the Chelsea FanCast family and feel free to donate whatever you want per show or per month...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo pressure mind!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
