    "summary": "So, here\u0027s the thing: I write obsessively. On any given day, I have two to three large-scale projects going, plus maybe another smaller project or two. My interests run the gamut from urban fantasy to paranormal romance; contemporary romance to science fiction. Poetry! Comics! I want to do it all, but, as just about anyone knows, there\u0027s just not enough time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course... it\u0027s also true that we tend to make time for those things we value, right? I don\u0027t release many of my side projects because they don\u0027t fit into my general publishing plans or I\u0027m not sure how interested people will be. But I also recognize that I am EXTREMELY lucky in that I have an awesome group of readers who tell me (often!) that they\u0027d like to read more from me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u0027m on Patreon! And this will give me that little extra push to finish all of those side projects, to release more fun stuff into the world, and to just. keep. writing! I adore my readers, and one of the great joys of my life is interacting with you, and this gives us a chance to chat more and get to know each other better, in addition to that whole \"Colleen will write more stuff\" thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support. It seriously means the world to me!\u00a0"
