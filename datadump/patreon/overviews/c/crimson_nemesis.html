    "summary": "Hello, \u003cbr\u003emy name is Claudia, though most people know me either as crimson-nemesis or crimsonBunny117 around the webs. I\u0027ve finished my BA in Social pedagogy and now live and work in Munich. While I enjoy to work with people I have always been one to name drawing and painting to be my number one hobby. Since I bought my first tablet in 2009 the time I create artwork of any sort has increased a lot and I have ventured into sites like \u003ca href=\"http://crimson-nemesis.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://crimson-nemesis.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e - I met many amazing people during this journey and I was able to pick up more and more knowledge about digital art and even managed to improve my skills. Ever since digital drawings and paintings are what I enjoy the most and what earns me a bit of extra pocket-money once in a while. But I am solely a self-taught hobbyist, so my arting time is limited - but I enjoy sharing what I create. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI originally created this Patreon time ago to support my finances during my studies - now I do not depend on money through art anymore, luckily, with my degree and a permanent employment, which makes creating art even more liberating. Now this Patreon will serve to earn a bit of side money I will use to save up for little dreams and to support other people as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will Patrons get when they support me? Well, first of, my most sincerest thanks and as time progresses I will upload some of my favourite finished works and selected exclusive content - like step-by-step illustrations on how I created certain pictures, WIPs, sketches and some speed paint videos once in a while. I like to share my art and my knowledge, so my general tutorials and most videos I create will be available for free through my YouTube and DA accounts. So supporting me here will not get you limitless exclusive content no one else will ever see, most of what I create is simply free for everyone to watch and enjoy. But it will get you an insight on what I work on these days before anyone else will see it, including in work adoptables and a breakdown behind the creation of some of my works. Supporting me here is more a thing of supporting me as an artist and what I do instead of getting lots of exclusive content - be aware :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now I thank those who read all this and took the time to check out my profile - whether you decide to support me or not, I thank you for your time :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Claudia \u003cbr\u003e"
