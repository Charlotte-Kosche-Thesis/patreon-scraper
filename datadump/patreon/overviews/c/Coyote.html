    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWar and Humor\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2003, I received deployment orders to Iraq, courtesy of the US Army. After \"desert\" training in freezing Fort McCoy, Wisconsin from November to March, I was posted to Camp Victory North, near the Baghdad International Airport, or BIAP, with the 1st Cavalry Division. While there, I drew and posted a daily pen-and-paper series called \"BOHICA Blues\" to help alleviate some of the tension and share a laugh with my fellow deployed soldiers. When I came home, I thought about doing \"a webcomic or something\" but the project languished. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013, during the ten-year anniversary cycle of the war, most of the coverage I saw focused on the typical grim and dark \"haunted veteran.\" I wanted to share stories about the Iraq experience that approached the subject with some humor. Not because war is funny, but because 90% of one\u0027s time during war is sitting around waiting for the other 10% to be over with. The combination of boredom and tension leads to absurdity, and expressing that absurdity through humor invites candor. Using the classic TV show \"M*A*S*H\" as a guide, I resurrected \"BOHICA Blues\" for the web on Veteran\u0027s Day, 2013.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBOHICA Anyone?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBOHICA Blues is a humorous, slice-of-military-life webcomic about an Army Reserve unit from Boise, Idaho, that is sent to Iraq in 2004. After two years in Iraq, the unit returns home to deal with the results of their deployment. While the unit, the fictional \"213th Combat Engineer Battalion\", is based in Boise, Idaho, it is filled with Reservists from across the United States; representing the broad spectrum of people who served their country in this conflict. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the comic is inspired by some of my personal experiences, it is not autobiographical. Instead, it is a reflection of the stories of the thousands of Reserve and National Guard soldiers who faced hardships during their deployment, both physical and emotional. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBe a PATRON!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome a \"\u003cem\u003ePatron of the Arts\u003c/em\u003e\" and help make BOHICA Blues a voice for Reserve and Guard veterans! What\u0027s in it for you? \u003cem\u003eLots\u003c/em\u003e\n of cool stuff! Get sneak peeks at episodes in progress; take a look at \nthe scores of doodles and sketches I do almost daily; see background \nbiographical information on characters (stuff that just doesn\u0027t make it \ninto the comic); and see historical comics such as the original \"BOHICA \nBlues downrange\" version from 2004-2005. Higher ranks of Patronage\n will have access to historical old comics that formed the early stages of\n my comic-making career as well as future or concurrent projects that \nhave nothing to do with BOHICA Blues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the casual visitor who isn\u0027t sure about what they would be getting with Patronage, I will \n(around once a month or so) release some of this exclusive content to \npublic viewing as a sort of \"appetizer.\" Almost every Patron-only post \ncontains at least two images, and frequently more than that (four images\n per post is fairly typical).  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour financial support helps to put BOHICA Blues on firmer ground.

     "about": "I\u0027ve been doing art, especially comics, for as long as I can remember. \u00a0In my early years I was influenced by MAD Magazine as well as Cracked and CARtoons, and later by things like Judge Dredd and Redfox from the U.K. I also had a creative streak fueled by Star Wars and the drawings of Ralph McQuarrie, from which I also developed a healthy appetite for world-building.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started making my own comics in the 1980, as a kid in school, just mechanical pencil drawings hastily scrawled into spiral-bound sketch pads; my audience was maybe a dozen people at most, passing around these unique gems among groups of friends. Most of the time my comics were satires of movies or TV shows I liked watching at the time, especially the typical \u002780\u0027s action schlock. I also made my own over-the-top spy adventure, an original creation that I enjoyed more than anything else.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually I went on to make other graphic novels --amateur productions all-- with Xeroxed-copy fanzines, enlarging my potential audiences out to about a few thousand people at most in the 1990\u0027s. \u00a0Then, after a 2004-2005 tour in Iraq, I decided to start BOHICA Blues.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I live in Boise, Idaho, with a small family that consists of myself, my wife, and a menagerie of animals. I hope to expand BOHICA Blues and also engage in other projects ranging from science-fiction to high fantasy to alternate-history adventures. BOHICA Blues is but one of my many words to explore, and there will be more to come. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
