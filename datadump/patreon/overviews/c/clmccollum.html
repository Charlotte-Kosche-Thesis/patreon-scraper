    "summary": "Welcome to my little SFF corner of Patreon! I\u0027m thrilled you\u0027re considering becoming a patron of mine - I can\u0027t wait to share my stories will you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, a little about me: I am a 30-something bisexual writer and freelance editor who can be found online at \u003ca href=\"http://www.clmccollum.com.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.clmccollum.com.\u003c/a\u003e I currently live in Austin with the love of my life, three large dogs which equal about a dog-and-a-half too many for our little house, and one skitten who causes more trouble than all three dogs combined. I\u2019ve been writing pretty much as long as I can remember, but it\u2019s been a long road to admit to myself that I actually want to write professionally. It\u2019ll be an even longer road getting to the point that I can write even part time and still pay bills, but I know deep down that it is what I want, hell \u003cem\u003eneed\u003c/em\u003e, to do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon account is just one way I\u0027m hoping to earn my way to that full time writing gig!\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWord wise, I\u0027m a fan of the fantastical and far out there. Science fiction and fantasy have always littered my bookshelves, so it\u2019s probably not a surprise that ended up being the genre I write in most often. I\u2019ve dabbled in steampunk and post-apocalypse, fairy tale retellings, classical literature retellings, and there\u2019s even magical realism and urban fantasy tales in the works, too. Basically, all of the stories and sneak peeks I share with you will be in the SFF genre somewhere. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am already published in several anthologies, as well as our own Herding Cats Press\u0027s Clich\u00e9s for a Cause charity anthology series which I co-edit and contribute to. Also under the Herding Cats umbrella, I\u0027m part of the #MimosaThurday writerly podcast. If you want to hear some slightly tipsy writers talk at length about writing, fandom, and who knows what else (we take road trips down tangents), this is definitely the podcast for you. ;) Aside from that, I\u0027m currently working on a YA magical realism novel I hope to query in late-2017, and I have several short stories in the works that I\u0027d love to get to share for backers at that level, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always up for feedback and ways to make this page and your rewards better, so feel free to drop me a line if you have any suggestions on ways I can improve your patron experience. Thanks again for all of your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
