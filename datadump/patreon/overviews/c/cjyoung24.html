Most of you probably know me from my username cjyoung24 on \u003ca href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/user/cjyoung24,\"\u003ehttps://www.wattpad.com/user/cjyoung24\u003c/a\u003e or as C.J. Young on Tapas.io\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tapas.io/cjyoung\"\u003ehttps://tapas.io/cjyoung\u003c/a\u003e Either way, thanks for stopping by to check out my Patreon page! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jessica, but you can call me Jess, or even by my pen-name C.J. I am a 27 year old Wattpad writer with over 70k followers, 2 million reads on my most popular story The Dragon Prince\u0027s Bride, and over 3 million reads on all my stories collectively. I am the oldest of four siblings, and live at home with my amazing mom. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy life has been pretty hectic overall. I\u0027ve been working to support my family since about 2010. I\u0027ve done some jobs that I didn\u0027t like, and some that were totally miserable. But I have obligations and people to care for, so I don\u0027t give up and I don\u0027t let myself get too down about life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016 I started writing on Wattpad, a free reading site and app, as a side hobby. However, in less than a year I gained a pretty big following that supported almost every story I came up with. Then, in 2017 I joined Tapas.io, a place where I could earn money for my creative works. Over the last year I have gained tremendous support, both from the great team at Tapas and from all of my new fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon site is being created so that those who wish to can support me a bit further. Because of my work schedule, it can be hard to have the energy needed in order to write as much as I\u0027d like. Lately, I have cut down on the amount of updates I am able to do for Tapas.io, to the dismay of many fans. BUT, if you would like to aid in this new support network, I would greatly appreciate it, and work hard to bring you Patreon exclusive rewards! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Of course, even those who do not donate are always appreciated by me. BUT, the more patrons I have donating even just one dollar to me monthly is one more dollar I don\u0027t have to worry about. I have a ton of great rewards set up for any donators, so check them out! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, The Dragon Prince\u0027s Bride has t-shirts too! Buying one of these also supports me!\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075K5ZTMK?ref_=pe_2196150_146773810\"\u003e https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075K5ZTMK?ref_=pe_2196150_146773810\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eANNNND THERE YOU HAVE IT!
