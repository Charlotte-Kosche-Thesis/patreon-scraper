     "about": "Hello! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Lyssa, known as Lullabie on the cosplay \u0027world\u0027. I am into cosplay since 2013, or maybe a bit sooner... but I was a little lonely bird not knowing was I was going into haha!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first cosplay I made was Growlight, human version of it, and everything was handsew. EEK! That was horrible to do! But I had a lot of fun walking around with this first cosplay and I do not regret it today. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI improved my skills until I was able to create Jinx, from the online game League of Legend, and this character is my favourite. It will stay as one of the cosplays that I will always wear not matter what. :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJinx took me nearly 1 year and half in time crafting : starting from the fabric costume, the fake-leather belts, casting the resin bullets, styling the wig, crafting both fishbone and powpow... and one of her grenade! Oh, and doing the boots which took me soooo long to find somes, then modifying them. But she\u0027s my baby in cosplays choice \u0026lt;3\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, Widowmaker is a cosplay that taught me new crafting methods : Armor, leds, bodysuit sewing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonnestly, cosplay is time consuming, but so much fun to craft! With patreon, the funds would help me continuing in the cosplay community and getting more and more professionnal as, people know, costumes materials cost a lot... from a range of 250 euro to 500 euro even 800 euro if it\u0027s made of worbla (armor), I can\u0027t do as much a I would like to each year. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, higher the patron will help me, they will receive from time to time little goodies/gifts from me as a thank you! Being prints or handcrafte stuffs... I would thank them! \u0026lt;3 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will, too, post tips and load more pictures in here than on my cosplay Facebook page, as being a patron would allow people to see more and more of my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
