    "summary": "Hi! I\u0026#8217;m Casey, probably more well known to you as Casey the\nCanadian Lesbrarian. I\u0026#8217;ve been running my queer Canadian book blog since 2012.\nOn \u003ca href=\"https://caseythecanadianlesbrarian.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCasey the Canadian Lesbrarian\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e you\ncan find reviews of Canadian and/or Indigenous LGBTQ2IA+ books, news about\nqueer Canadian authors, and themed lists like queer women\u0026#8217;s Halloween reads, best\nbisexual women\u0026#8217;s literature, five queer women of colour you should read, and\nlots more! I also write about bookish stuff for \u003ca href=\"http://bookriot.com/author/casey-stepaniuk/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBook Riot\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.autostraddle.com/tag/ask-your-friendly-neighbourhood-lesbrarian/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAutostraddle\u003c/a\u003e,\nwhere I recently launched \u003cem\u003eAsk Your\nFriendly Neighbourhood Lesbrarian\u003c/em\u003e, a book advice column where readers write\nin for help finding their next favourite LGBTQ2IA+ books. I spend lots of time\ntalking about books on \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/canlesbrarian\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e,\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/caseythecanadianlesbrarian/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10463035-caseythecanadianlesbrarian\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGoodreads\u003c/a\u003e,\nand Litsy too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs you can probably tell, I\u0026#8217;m super passionate about books,\nand LGBTQ2IA+ (and Canadian) books especially. It is sincerely one of my life\u0026#8217;s\njoys matching books and people! In fact, I\u0026#8217;m so keen on books I went back to\nschool to become a librarian, a program that I\u0026#8217;m halfway through right now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI would LOVE to be able to keep up more with my blog and in\nfact increase the number of reviews and special content like lists and news on\nthere. My goal after hitting the $25 a month mark is to have at least eight\nposts (reviews, lists, and news articles) up on the blog a month. On\nmy website there\u0026#8217;s also a list of queer Canadian lit resources like authors,\nother book blogs, bookstores, presses, etc. that is in dire need of being\nupdated. Lastly, I have a dream about starting a queer book blog with a fellow\nqueer book blogger, so that\u0026#8217;s a future plan for 2017. Can you believe that\nthere is no queer book podcast running right now? I\u0026#8217;d love to fix that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt would mean to much to me to have a bit of support so I\ncould really dedicate time to the blog\u0026#8212;like a real job!\u0026#8212;instead of cramming in\ntime for writing in the wee hours between school and part-time work. That\u0026#8217;s\nwhere YOU come in! What would you get out of it, you ask? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe three things I\u0026#8217;m most excited about offering are: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA guaranteed spot to be interviewed in my\nupcoming \"Interview with a Queer Reader\" series for patrons of all\nlevels. I\u0026#8217;ve been thinking about doing this for a while, and it seemed like\na great place to start by talking to my patrons (via email, Skype, or in person\nif you\u0026#8217;re in Vancouver!) about their experiences as LGBTQ2IA+ readers. We could\ntalk about stuff like the first queer book you read, which books you\u0026#8217;ve read\nthat have really reflected your experiences, which queer book you want to read\nthat doesn\u0026#8217;t exist yet, and more!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMonthly entries in a draw to win a free queer\nbook for patrons contributing $3 or more a month (2 entries for folks giving $9\nor more). I get a ton of free queer books for review, so what better thing to\ndo with them than to pass them on to other readers? Every month I\u0026#8217;ll draw a\nname and give that person a choice from about 5-7 books and I\u0026#8217;ll mail the book\nto them. (Canada and US!). This reward will start when I hit the $25 a month\nmark, so I have enough to cover shipping costs. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMonthly entries in a draw to have a postcard\nwith a personalized book recommendation mailed to you. (Canada and the US as\nwell, and other countries if anyone is interested!). I love giving book\nrecommendations, and I thought it\u0026#8217;d be fun to get one in the mail. Real mail is\nthe best! I\u0026#8217;ll ask you a few questions about what you like to read via email/Skype and then send you the\nrecommendation. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the pledge levels on\nthe right for more details about the rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNEW!! (A few people have asked me about making one-time donations. \nPatreon isn\u0027t set up for that, although their website does suggest you \ncan make a monthly pledge and then just cancel after one month. I know \nthat isn\u0027t a great option. I also have a Paypal account and could do \nemail money transfers with my email address stepaniukcasey [at] \ngmail.com. Let me know if you\u0027re interested in that and thanks again for\n your interest!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks so much for your support\nof \u003cem\u003eCasey the Canadian Lesbrarian\u003c/em\u003e\u0026#8212;whether\nthat\u0026#8217;s through Patreon or by reading, sharing, liking, and commenting on my posts. It\u0027s so, so appreciated! And thanks for being excited about Canadian and/or Indigenous LGBTQ2IA+ books and authors!"
