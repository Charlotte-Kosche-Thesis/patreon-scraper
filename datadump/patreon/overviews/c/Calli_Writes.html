    "summary": "First, thank you for even coming here. My top priority with my original work has always been that it is freely accessible to people who want it. That priority has not changed for me. The removal of the Life With Chrissy works off of AO3, to me personally, was hard, but has presented me with an opportunity. To provide early release content and downloadable content, for those who choose to pledge.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLet me stress, you do not need to pledge to read my work. All of my work, including future Chrissy books, \n\u003cstrong\u003ewill remain free to read\u003c/strong\u003e. The only thing that is changing is, new works will be uploaded to the public as an entire piece instead of chapter by chapter.\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the moment, I have two tiers for patron rewards.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eTier one\u003c/strong\u003e is the preview tier. As completed chapters become available, this tier of 1$ a month will give you read-only access to new work well before it is published for the public. For this tier to be worth your dollar, I\u0027ll be holding onto public release for a month after a new work is complete. I\u0027ll send out public notifications to inform you of new chapters as they become available and I\u0027m looking into a batch email system that I can push out to the people who choose this tier.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eTier two\u003c/strong\u003e is the DLC tier. This tier allows you unlimited downloadable access to PDF, Epub and Mobi files for all finished work.\n\u003c/div\u003e\nI considered long and hard before implementing this plan, alternatives would have limited the community\u0027s access, and that just didn\u0027t sit right with me. I think this is a fair way to let people who feel Chrissy\u0027s worth to show it, even in a small way, and let her still be available for those who don\u0027t have the means.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
