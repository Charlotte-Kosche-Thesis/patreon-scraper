Making the show for listener consumption is a lot of fun and something that Veronica, Staci, Mike and Hiroshi all love to do. However, with the growing popularity of the show come additional costs and we set up this account to help offset some of those costs for us. \u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to slowly work up to point where we can reimburse our cast and crew not just for their expenses but also their time and we\u2019re going to take our time to do this. You will see that our Patreon does not offer you additional content, prizes, or perks beyond the occasional digital update, this is our intent. Keeping up with physical rewards is a daunting task that no one on our crew can undertake but we hope to get to a point in the future where we can offer fun perks to patrons and consistently fulfill those perks.\u003cbr\u003eAs we swim into the open waters of 2018, our goal is consistency and quality content. We hope that you will make a financial contribution to that cause but if you\u2019re unable to do that, please be sure to recommend our podcast to your friends\u2026after all, we\u2019re Cthulhu \u0026amp; FRIENDS. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove and Tentacles, \u003cbr\u003eVeronica\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
