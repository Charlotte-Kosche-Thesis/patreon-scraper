    "summary": "Thank You for checking out our page. My name is Carlos Candido. I\u2019m a singer songwriter, producer, artist and podcaster. In the past, I have used other crowdfunding platforms to produce music. Some of you may have already contributed to those campaigns. Successful or not, I appreciate your support and the trust you\u2019ve given me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve moved over to Patreon for 2 reasons. The first reason is:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Running a Kickstarter (or other crowdfunding platform) is time sensitive and has an anxiety (for me) to the whole procedure. If successful, the anxiety drops down, as does the energy. Once all the rewards and creations are shipped out, it\u2019s over. Everyone goes their separate ways. If the campaign isn\u2019t successful, well, yeah, there\u2019s that. #sadpanda\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Patreon allows creators to build a community with their Patrons by keeping them involved daily with what\u2019s being created. The fluid nature of being able to adapt to changes in what the Patrons like, or in what I might want to create, is very attractive to me. It\u2019s also motivating knowing that Patrons like and believe in what I\u2019m creating daily and enjoy it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo start, I decided to go with 2 goals and 4 different pledge tiers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003cu\u003efirst goal\u003c/u\u003e is to make everything I do already, viable. Covering costs, for my podcasting host, my website, Skype call recorder and Live streaming software etc. The \u003cu\u003esecond goal\u003c/u\u003e will allow us to expand our productions, new video hardware, studio improvements, music and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003cu\u003efirst tier\u003c/u\u003e is for those who aren\u2019t really connected to social media. They may want to support me as a creator but aren\u2019t looking to be involved in the process. The tier starts at 2$ and can be increased to whatever level you\u2019re comfortable with. One time donations are available as well. One time here, or with the PayPal Donate button on the home page of \u003cu\u003eCarlosCandidoMusic.com\u003c/u\u003e. \u003cbr\u003eAnything is very much appreciated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe details for the other tier levels are in the \u003cu\u003eRewards section\u003c/u\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo take a look around, choose a support tier, and let\u2019s get to it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, thanks for checking out the page, and have a great day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eCarlos"
