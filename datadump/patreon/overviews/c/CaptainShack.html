    "summary": "It\u2019s hard to believe the channel has been around just over two years now. I started it with the goal of building a place that would help spotlight and bring attention to some of the extremely talented mod authors and mods out in the community. The more videos I made, the more I wanted to make. Entertaining and informative videos have been my goal. One, I hope you all agree, I\u2019ve been meeting consistently. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I\u2019ve found my passion, the work I love doing and will fight tooth and nail to continue to make videos that are different, fun and hopefully informative. The challenge is being able to make ends meet and support my family on what little YouTube ad revenue actually pulls in. Combine the seasonal shift in payouts with the flaky nature of Youtube and you get a very scary combination that directly controls the income that pays the rent, and puts food on the table. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach video can take between 6 to 20 hours of production time before it ever gets released. Research, recording footage, audio, editing, asset gathering, tags, thumbnails, render time, and uploading, uploading again because youtube exploded, and release. It\u2019s quite abit of work. But what I\u2019ve gained from TheXpGamers has been well worth it.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe this little channel has had a positive effect on the gaming community, it has exposed newcomers to the modding scene. It lets mod authors know their work is appreciated and enjoyed! On the flip side of that coin the audience for mods is small, and growing a channel on content that is lesser known is a challenge. So I need help.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs unfortunate as it may be, money is necessary for survival. Any donations received will be used to support my family, as well as build out the channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You for making this Community a great place to work and play,\u003cbr\u003e-CaptainShack"
