    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eYou\u0027re here!\u003c/h3\u003eThanks so much for visiting my Patreon page. It takes a ton of work putting out quality content and your contribution will go a long way in helping me produce more and better content on a regular basis! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe majority of my content is free for everyone and always has been. So why would you want to kick in a couple bucks a month when you can see nearly everything for free anyway? Great question! Aside from helping to ensure great content on a regular basis, there are some pretty cool incentives for the varying levels of contribution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the best perks is access to \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive online bow building course\u003c/strong\u003e materials! I\u0027ve been working to develop the most comprehensive bow building course ever. Bar none. And you\u0027ll have access to it. This course will cover everything I know about building bows. From whitewood flatbows to osage recurves, sinew backing, addressing common problems, design, and on and on. This course will have it all. I\u0027ll be uploading one new exclusive bow building video around the \u003cstrong\u003efirst of each month\u003c/strong\u003e. Additionally, I\u2019ll be posting behind the scenes clips, weekly Vlogs (more on this below), and other exclusive content here. Plus, you\u0027ll be entered to win a custom made selfbow made to your specifications!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what\u0027s your money helping with? Another great question. As of now I\u0027m a one man show. With rare exception I do all the filming, editing, music selection, etc. On of the biggest challenges in producing hunting films is self filming. I can\u0027t tell you how many opportunities I\u0027ve missed due to fiddling with cameras. In addition to covering the basic operational costs, reaching my goals will help me actually pay a cameraman instead of trying to con my hunting buddies into following me around with a camera!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, camera gear is ridiculously expensive and the conditions I film in are hard on equipment. I just dropped $150 on a mic the size of my pinky nail! Could I use a gopro? Sure, but the quality wouldn\u0027t be nearly what I can get on a DLSR and, honestly, it\u0027d be a hell of a lot more difficult to make a quality film with very limited equipment.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough a monthly contribution really helps budget things out, I understand if everyone doesn\u0027t want to go that route. With that said, I wan\u0027t you to know \u003cstrong\u003ey\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eou are NOT locked into anything! \u003c/strong\u003eYou can sign up as a patron and cancel payments at any time. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you for taking the initiative. I hope you\u0027ll sign up and help promote the traditional values, woodsmanship, and outdoor skills that my videos are all about!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAbout Me\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.twistedstave.com/wp-content/uploads/andy_deer.jpg\" style=\"width: 268px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eMy name is Clay Hayes and I am a hunter. There\u0027s no other way to really describe myself\u00a0without mentioning that fact. Hunting, and more specifically bowhunting, has influenced nearly every major decision I\u0027ve ever made in my life. When I was a kid I dreamed about stalking elk in the high mountain meadows and drifting a dry fly to rising trout. I always new the west was where I was meant to be so I set out looking for a way to make that happen.\u00a0\u003cdiv style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up on a ranch in the Florida panhandle. Although I\u0027d been in the saddle since I was an infant and even competed in the high school rodeo, placing in the top 10 at nationals each year, I always wanted to be in the woods rather than dealing with horses. Most of my summer days were spent fishing in the creeks and sluggish backwaters of the Florida panhandle, or practicing primitive skills under the liveoaks. In the fall and winter I hunted and trapped.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoon after graduating from high school I entered into the Natural Resource Conservation program at the University of Florida which led to a bachelors degree and not much else. I soon learned that if you wanted a career in wildlife, you\u0027d need a masters degree. So, after a short stent as a wildlife technician in south Texas, I moved to Starkville Mississippi to start my masters research. To earn a Master\u0027s of Science degree, you develop a research project and write a thesis. My project was to investigate the home range and habitat use of feral hogs in the Mississippi River delta.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.twistedstave.com/wp-content/uploads/Image-19.jpg\" style=\"width: 310px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eI trapped about 40 wild hogs and fitted them with radio collars before following them around the southern swamps day and night for a year.\u00a0Good times! After writing up my findings and sitting through a thesis defense (not fun), my wife and I moved west, to Idaho and a job with the Idaho Fish \u0026amp; Game. We\u0027ve been here ever sense and now have two very energetic boys, Coye and Fen, that are keeping us busy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started making videos for YouTube in about 2009 and started my website in 2010. Since then I\u0027ve written two books, published many articles in Traditional Bowhunter Magazine and others, been a guest on quite a few podcasts, talked at quite a few banquets, and produced over 150 videos on traditional archery, bow building, survival, and other outdoor skills! In November of 2017 I decided to follow a dream and make this my full time gig!\u00a0It wasn\u0027t an easy decision to leave a steady paycheck and a great career as a wildlife biologist but I knew where my heart was so that\u0027s where I went. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.twistedstave.com/wp-content/uploads/fam_florida.jpg\" style=\"width: 253px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eSo here we are, on a new and exciting path. Our ultimate goal is to build Twisted Stave into something that can both support our simple lifestyle and continue to give back to the traditional archery and bow hunting community. It\u0027s been a learning experience, talking to potential sponsors, learning about marketing, thinking hard about what I\u0027m comfortable endorsing and what I\u0027m not. It\u0027s a long road but we\u0027ll get there. So in\u00a0addition to all the behind the scenes type stuff, much of the exclusive content I\u0027ll be posting here is going to be about this new journey. Although I\u0027ve got a good idea what direction we\u0027re heading, it\u0027s anything but certain. The traditional archery community is amazing but it\u0027s a very small niche to try to make a living within. But, life\u0027s an adventure and, so far as I know, we get one time around. You may as well do what makes you happy. I hope you\u0027ll join us on our journey and share in our adventures!\u003c/div\u003e"

     "about": "Clay Hayes is a professional wildlife biologist, primitive bowyer \u0026amp; bowhunter, wildlife film maker, and writer. Growing up on his family\u0027s farm in the Florida panhandle, he spent his boyhood summers among the cypress swamps and Spanish moss. But, as alluring as southern woodlands are, the Rocky Mountains always called. After graduating from Mississippi State University with a masters in wildlife ecology he headed west with his wife to settle among the aspen and endless conifers stretching across the west slope of the continental divide in central Idaho. A lifelong learner, he has always been fascinated with wildlife and has spent the better part of his life studying the ecology of the natural world around him. This fascination, in combination with a love of hunting, eventually led him to the world of traditional and primitive archery. Limiting the effectiveness of his weapons allows him to gain an intimate knowledge of the game he pursues, and the myriad other creatures encountered along the way. Clay lives in central Idaho with his wife Liz and two boys, Coye and Fen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2012, in an attempt to preserve and promote woodsmanship and traditional skills, Clay started twistedstave.com. On his website, you\u0027ll find the best video instructions on building archery equipment anywhere, and it\u0027s absolutely free. There is also a link to his youtube channel where you\u0027ll find more how-to outdoor videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
