We love sharing our knowledge of irrelevant trivia, obscure history, and Five Legged Goats with the world. We love doing the show, and we love our fans. That\u0027s part of the reason why Season 4 is \u003cem\u003e\"Year of a Million or So Limited Time Cadets!\"\u003c/em\u003e We want to celebrate YOU guys for inviting us into your ears week in, week out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love the show, and have never made a dime off of it in our time doing it. In fact, we\u0027ve both spent a bit of coin making sure it\u0027s the best show possible; from our recording equipment, to the pins, and even the Cadet Membership cards. Everything we have sold, from t-shirts to the Musical, has all gone back into trying to break even. Patreon is just a way for you guys to help show your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust to be clear, we are \u003cem\u003enot \u003c/em\u003echarging for \u003cstrong\u003eANYTHING\u003c/strong\u003e. We\u0027d never, ever restrict our regular content or alienate our audience by asking for something in return. We\u0027re not requiring you to participate. We\u0027re still going to be doing the same great show every week, free of charge, from now until the Darkest Timeline takes over. That\u0027s never going to change. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if you\u0027d like to show your support and pledge something, we\u0027d be eternally grateful. And for those of you who \u003cstrong\u003edo \u003c/strong\u003epledge, you\u0027ll be getting a little extra something in return every month. Maybe it\u0027ll be an extra episode, or a bonus interview, or a Google Hangout, or a custom song from the Communicore Weekly Orchestra. Who knows what we\u0027ll come up with! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut here is how it works: \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou pledge whatever you want.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e \nYou pay whatever amount you are willing to pay on a monthly basis, whether it\u0027s $1, $5, $6.23, $10.82, $101.34! Whatever you want! Pledge whatever you think is fair to gain access to the behind the scenes goodies. You are then charged that amount at \nthe end of each month. You can change the amount of your donation or \ncancel your support at any time.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut pledge as \u003cem\u003emuch \u003c/em\u003eor as \u003cem\u003elittle \u003c/em\u003eas you want. Or \u003cem\u003enothing \u003c/em\u003eat all. Either way, we\u0027re \u003cstrong\u003estill \u003c/strong\u003egoing to do the show! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you want to help support the show, great! Thank you, we appreciate it! And if you don\u0027t, that\u0027s totally fine, too! We\u0027re still going to invade your podcast / vidcast feed every week. We\u0027re still going to be sending out weekly prizes during our \"Year of a Million or So Limited Time Cadets\" campaign. We\u0027re still going to do \u003cstrong\u003eALL \u003c/strong\u003eof that, regardless if you pledge or not. We love you, and appreciate you, every single one of you, no matter what. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for being loyal Cadets,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJeff \u0026amp; George\u003cbr\u003e"
