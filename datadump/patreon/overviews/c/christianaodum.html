I\u0027m Christiana! I\u0027m an artist based in Nashville, TN. I work in a lot of different mediums and switch up my subject matter pretty often, but lately I\u0027ve been painting a lot with acrylics. I like to mix up realistic/representational artwork with elements of abstraction, and really love expressive brushstrokes and tons of texture! My current passion project is a series I\u0027ve begun working on, exploring the connection between creativity and mental health. I have a TON of ideas for this series, but currently have limited time I can dedicate to painting. (Darn day jobs!!) THANK YOU to everyone who has supported my work through Patreon!! You guys seriously make me feel so loved and hopeful about making this little daydream of mine a reality. The funds generated from Patreon are currently being added to a special savings account I like to call my \"daydream fund\". My goal is to save enough money and build enough sustainable income through Patreon, so that I can reduce the hours I work at a day job, and create more time for working on the art I love. Beyond that, the big picture goal is to eventually work as a full time artist, dedicating more time to creating exclusive content for my lovely patrons.\u003cbr\u003e"
