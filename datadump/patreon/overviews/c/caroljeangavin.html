    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eHello! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, thank you so much for being here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been struggling with writing for a long time. Struggling because writing is hard. Struggling because of a family to support on a barista\u0027s wage. Struggling because I like to spend time with my family, and they like me too. Struggling because getting published is a long, difficult, incomprehensible process. Struggling because it takes struggle to put all your heart and skill into a piece of writing. Struggle, because it\u0027s hard to work so hard on something and fail to set it off flying in the world, fail to see it waving as it soars over the skyscrapers shining.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLiterary magazines and publishers big and small receive thousands upon thousands of submissions from talented writers. They have to sift and pick through them to find the best pieces of amazing writing that fit their aesthetic, their needs, and the needs of their audience. They get to pluck a couple of pebbles from a mountain. It\u0027s a hard, under-appreciated job. I am not coming down on the people who reject my work. I love them. They keep words alive. I would bake them all cookies if I could. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing is, right now, that traditional method of sending a crap-load of stories out to various lit mags is not working for my life or for my writing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to give something else a try. And that\u0027s where you, dear reader, come in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making up stories and playing with words since I was a child, and then when I went off to college, I devoted myself to it. My writing has taken many forms: poetry, fairy tales, children\u0027s stories, plays, essays, memoir, attempts at novels. My focus has long been on short fiction, specifically on strange stories narrated by broken, smart-assy girls. I tend towards magical realism, surrealism, the off-beat, and off-kilter, the voice driven, the musical and bright. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I\u0027ve been working on a novel and short story collection for over ten years, what I would really like to do with Patreon, and with you, to is work on a bunch of different projects. I just want to unleash my creativity really, not excluding any genre. The sky\u0027s the limit. The idea is that rather than asking for a monthly patronage, I will be basing donations/patronage on a per project basis. Each project with result in a 30-40 page book of words. Don\u0027t worry, I will let you know way ahead of time what the upcoming project will be. If you don\u0027t want to back a book of poetry, weird essays on craft, or a post-apocalyptic novella, you don\u0027t have to. Right now, I\u0027m anticipating each project to take about 2-3 months. You\u0027ll have plenty of time to back out, or you know, recommend my Patreon to your friends who love post-apocalyptic novellas, or whatever. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage will buy me time to work on these crazy projects, and it will allow me to turn them into real books, and to offer other fun, yet-to-be-determined goodies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your time, your consideration, and your love of words...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to read the rest of \"Larry\u0027s Story\" you can!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.essaysandfictions.com/vol_3/LarrysStory.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.essaysandfictions.com/vol_3/LarrysStory.pdf\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eYou can also find links to more of my work over here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://caroljeangavin.wordpress.com/publications/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://caroljeangavin.wordpress.com/publications/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://caroljeangavin.wordpress.com/publications/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
