While they are Canadian and we proudly call Canada \u0027home\u0027, our kitchen is very representative of the Caribbean, where I grew up. I wanted my girls to be able to recreate the dishes they grew up enjoying, wherever in the world education took them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://caribbeanpot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chris-2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we have a very rich and diverse culinary history in the Caribbean, at that time there wasn\u0027t any \"Caribbean\" cookbooks on shelves for me to simply give to Kieana, Tehya and India to take with them. Our traditions were \u003cem\u003e(and still today)\u003c/em\u003e passed on to others verbally and only today are we seeing people like myself document and curate our culinary culture. In less than 3 months after launching we started seeing \u00a0people from all over the world flock to CaribbeanPot.com for their jerk chicken, curry goat and roti fix . We now connect with millions of fans of Caribbean cuisine globally. With precise measurements, full lists of ingredients, easy to follow instructions, step by step images and a full demo video for each recipe shared, people fell in love with what I was doing. \u003cstrong\u003eBasically, I made cooking simple, fun and fool-proof!\u003c/strong\u003e PLUS, it was the first time a global audience was able to get a true taste of the \"Caribbean\" from the comfort of their own kitchen.
