I\u0027m Tianna, and JK Rowling blocked me on Twitter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust kidding...\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAf8DXK4iTI\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNo, really though - she did.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that that\u0027s out of the way - I\u0027m Tianna Mignogna (tee-ANN-uhh mig-NAHG-nuh) and I\u0027m a creator at heart. I make YouTube videos, front the one woman nerd rock band \"Tianna and the Cliffhangers\", create art, and write songs, fan fiction, blog posts, poems, nonfiction, and YA novels. To me, it\u0027s the highest honor in life to be able to share those creations with others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI graduated with a Bachelors of Arts in English Creative Writing and Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. Every day I apply social and literary concepts from my studies to my life, but so far I\u0027ve had a rough time finding a job suitable to my skills. I work part time at both a home improvement store and a library, but it\u0027s not enough to fund sending a book out for publishing and creating merchandise and CDs and art, as well as moving to another state with my partner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2015\u0027s diagnoses of anxiety, depression, and OCD also came as a heavy blow to little old me, who had spent 21 years convincing myself she was Just Fine. Those parts of me really got me down on myself, but now I know I have so much to offer. These internal struggles, coupled with the inconsistent income I earn from art, makes me realize I don\u0027t want to have to give up on my creative talents, or let them fall by the wayside, and that\u0027s where you wonderful people come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will always be a creative person, but my work is fueled by presenting those projects to people - it\u0027s how I empower myself and others. When you make a donation each month, I will provide you with art that is specifically made for you. Even if you can\u0027t donate now to become my patron, sharing my work is also fantastic and much appreciated. If you do decide to become a patron, I have handfuls of rewards up my sleeves for you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love, love, love to continue doing what makes me happiest, and receiving a consistent income for my efforts would be a dream. I will be creating things monthly here, so go check out my rewards and see if anything interests you. Much love to y\u0027all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDetails about what I create:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYouTube videos: \u003c/strong\u003eAs often as I can, I create videos that feature my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SQNcvYrlI4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eoriginal songs\u003c/a\u003e and cover songs, as well as impeccable rants on current events, inspirational videos, and discussions about the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZiUOUB5zQk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eimportance of queer representation\u003c/a\u003e.
