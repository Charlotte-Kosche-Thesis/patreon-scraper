    "summary": "We are the Coast Family 5! About 3 years ago, we decided to sell our house and 10 acres in Oklahoma and live full time on the road in an RV. In the beginning, people thought we were just plain crazy. But now, people are genuinely interested in what we\u0027re doing and want to hear the stories of our journey! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter much debating and deciding (and maybe a little threatening from smart people we know), we have created a Patreon as a way of inviting you to share in our adventures! Now that we\u0027ve got a few years of travel under our belt, and know we want to keep going, we\u0027re ready to invite all of you along on a more personal level. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, Why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur biggest WHY in starting this Patreon is to share with you one of our biggest and most life-changing discoveries we\u0027ve made thus far: THE WORLD ISN\u0027T AS SCARY AS YOU THINK! It\u0027s true! We have met so many wonderful, sweet, kind, and compassionate people and it\u0027s made us fall in love with travel even more. We want to give you the chance to see the world through our eyes and find out that you, too, can take a big sigh of relief and realize that the world is pretty awesome after all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are giving you, our patrons, a much more intimate, \"inside\" view of what goes on in our day to day lives traveling the country full-time. We\u0027ll also be using our Patreon\u00a0support and your input to do some amazing things for others, which will be added to our goals in the near future. And of course, we\u0027re offering you some very cool rewards as a thank you for supporting us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome! We\u0027re glad you\u0027re here. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
