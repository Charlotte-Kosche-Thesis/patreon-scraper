Ours is a feminist vision of the beloved community where patriarchy is radically challenged through the collective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the Continuum Collective?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThe Continuum Collective is our tribe of creators, connectors, provocateurs, raconteurs, intellectuals, and activists that drive the movement. They are question askers, boundary pushers, name takers, and social changers.\u00a0Our movement is co-created by the global community via Continuum\u0027s live and virtual events, deep-dive dialogues, and in our \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/feministdialog/\"\u003evibrant online forum\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Continuum Collective conjures magic through authentic connection and richly vibrant and intentionally diverse kinship.

And collective action means collective contribution. Time, talents, and resources. Patreon is one way to contribute your resources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContinuum grew out of our collective need to pause, breathe, listen, connect, and move forward, together. Continuum feeds your feminist mind, body, and soul. Our message is simple: Here, you matter. Here, you are important. \u0003Here, you belong. And here, you must take action. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThe straight truth is that everything costs money and we need your support to kick this movement up a notch. We\u0027re all in this together. The Continuum movement literally depends on your contribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Contributions are monthly and start at as little as $1 - YES, 1 DOLLAR! There are several fancy reward levels to your right so you can tailor your contribution. At $1 per person, we\u0027ve got a good footing. At $5 per person, we\u0027re stable. And at $15 per person, we\u0027re kicking ass. Check out the rewards and help us grow this movement for an authentic, radical, interconnected feminism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We\u0027ll Use the Money For:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur initial goal is $6,000/month. That money take Continuum from a one-woman show to a vibrant, alive, sustainable feminist movement. Here are Continuum\u0027s costs:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWebsite Hosting. We need a robust enough site to support our growing traffic and so we don\u0027t crash during spikes in traffic and ruin happiness. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMailChimp. The service we use to email posts out to the subscription list. This fee grows as the email list grows.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOngoing web development. There are always upsetting glitches coming out of nowhere and occasionally, we add a new site feature. Jillian does not have fancy programming skills, so we need to pay someone for this.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFacebook post \"boosts\". When we announce a new post on Facebook, this makes sure that the announcement gets onto 1/3 or 1/2 of our Facebook followers\u0027 News Feeds.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOne Assistant. She needs to eat and food costs money. The Continuum Assistant will work a lean schedule from home, so the costs are minimal. She will\u00a0handle things like event logistics, social media and Continuum Collective Forum moderation, Expert-in-Residence content posting, store upkeep, customer service, and a bunch of other little jobs. These things end up adding up to a few hours every day, and without this employee, Jillian ends up doing it all and then she has no time to plan our cool events or host the R\u0026amp;R Lab podcast.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRadicals \u0026amp; Revolutionaries Podcast. Our podcast has been in the works for quite some time. We need your support to launch this baby into the world. Editing, hosting, publicizing, not to mention equipment costs and travel expenses all need to be covered.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the basics. With those pieces covered, Continuum can support itself. \u003cbr\u003e"
