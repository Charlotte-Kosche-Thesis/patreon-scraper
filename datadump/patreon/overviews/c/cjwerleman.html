    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m CJ, a journalist, published author, political commentator, and activist who provides insights into the Israel-Palestinian conflict, injustices carried out against Muslims under the guise of the US\u0027 global war on terrorism, and rising anti-Muslim discrimination. Insights the mainstream media too often ignores.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom Palestine to Kashmir; from Burma to Syria; from India to Chechnyna; from refugee camps in Germany to those in the South Pacific; Muslims are being occupied, oppressed, bombed, and vilified.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs has becomes the norm, however, crimes and injustices carried out against Muslims are too often overlooked by the Western media, while crimes carried out by Muslims are exaggerated and overrepresented in the media by 449% (LexusNexus Academic, 2017).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWherever you look, the mainstream Western media sympathies with those who oppress Muslim majority nation states and communities. These sympathies provide the political cover for anti-Muslim discrimination and injustice. For instance, Western media\u0027s sympathetic stance towards Israel\u0027s brutal military occupation and apartheid provides the political space for the US to continue underwriting Israel\u0027s international law and human rights violations; the media\u0027s refusal to cover India\u0027s violence against Muslims in Kashmir; while anti-Muslim tropes and stereotypes disseminated unchallenged into the media serve to only encourage hate crimes and discriminatory government policy against Muslims in the West.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s journalism\u0027s responsibility to reveal these injustices. Sadly, criticism of Israeli policy and defence of Muslim civil rights has long been considered a career killer in the US, and thus far too many journalists choose to turn a blind eye to Israel\u0027s crimes and anti-Muslim discrimination in order to maintain their access and profile. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI, like many of my colleagues who expose injustices in the Muslim or Arab world, refuse to trade justice for mainstream punditry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut activist\u00a0journalism requires funding, especially in a democratised, free media environment. While I am paid for my column at Middle East Eye, I seek your assistance to help me travel further, investigate deeper, and expose the injustices carried out against Muslims - in an effort to reveal to US audiences and policy makers who it is who\u0027s really the aggressor,and who it is who\u0027s actually the victim.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly then will US political leaders lose the political cover for supporting Israeli apartheid and occupation, the self-defeating \"war no terrorism,\" and domestic policies that strip away the civil rights and dignity of Muslim citizens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, I am currently engaged in academic studies into terrorism and counterterrorism - aiming to complete a Masters degree and then doctorate. Given that four million Muslims have been killed in US led wars since 1990, my academic work aims towards helping to bring an end to what promises to be an inter-generational transnational catastrophe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Now\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery donation, no matter how big or small, helps us take the fight to those who profit from institutionalized injustice and oppression. For as little as $1 per month, you can help me reveal to US and Western audiences the level of violence that is carried out in their name in Muslim lands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom personal interviews, I have published stories on aid workers trapped in the Syrian conflict; tortured Guantanamo Bay detainees; civilians who have been targeted by Israeli settlers and occupation forces; former and current jihadists; those falsely accused of terrorism; and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom travels, observations, and research I have published stories on misguided US foreign policy in the Middle East; Israel\u0027s war crimes; misguided counter radicalisation programs that unfairly target Muslim communities; and the latest academic research into transnational terrorist groups.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMiddle East Eye:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.middleeasteye.net/users/cj-werleman\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.middleeasteye.net/users/cj-werleman\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHerald Tribune:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ahtribune.com/author.html?id=905\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://ahtribune.com/author.html?id=905\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMedium:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@cjwerleman\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/@cjwerleman\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMondoweiss:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mondoweiss.net/author/cj-werleman/\"\u003ehttp://mondoweiss.net/author/cj-werleman/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy published books include \u003cem\u003eThe New Atheist Threat: the Dangerous Rise of Secular Extremists\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eCrucifying America: the Unholy Alliance Between Wall Street and the Christian Right.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI host the popular podcast \u0027Channel the Rage,\u0027 which gives a voice to the voiceless, Muslim victims of the US War on Terror, and in their own words - for the purpose of softening Western hearts and broadening Western minds with the aim these stories will effect positive change in policies and attitudes:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://directory.libsyn.com/shows/view/id/channeltherage\"\u003ehttp://directory.libsyn.com/shows/view/id/channelt...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease go ahead and make a pledge now.
