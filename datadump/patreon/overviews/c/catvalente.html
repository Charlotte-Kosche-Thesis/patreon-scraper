    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/GEpDj0u.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreetings,\nfellow humans! My name is Catherynne M. Valente and I am an untamed, unreformed,\nunstoppable perpetrator of fiction. For thirteen years I have published in every\nimaginable venue and style, from self-publishing to major New York and\ninternational presses, from science fiction to fantasy to horror to realism,\nnovels, short fiction, blogging, podcasting and poetry. I\u0027m a New York Times bestseller and have been nominated for\nevery award in my field, and have won the Hugo, Tiptree, Andre Norton, Lambda,\nLocus, and Mythopoeic Awards. And I kill at karaoke.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also have\nthree cats, two dogs, six chickens, and a very grouchy boiler who all have this\nweird thing where they insist on eating canned food and joint supplements and\nheating oil every day. The nerve! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd because life is strange and combustibl\u00a0and never did run smooth, I am also\ngoing through a divorce, and things are financially rather difficult right now. Being a full-time writer and being responsible for a mortgage, lawyers, and health care for my family is a volatile experiment with uncertain results at best.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/gSNL9Qq.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to stop stress-grinding my teeth at night and I want to put more fiction into the world. And I don\u2019t just mean my own fiction. I want to help\nyou guys write awesome books and stunning stories! (It\u2019s very selfish,\nhonestly. I just want more awesome things to read.) The world \u003cem\u003eneeds\u003c/em\u003e stories. Without stories, it\u2019s\nnothing but Terms of Service and 24 Hour Winter Storm Coverage and What Did You\nKnow Who Say On Twitter\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThus the Mad\nFiction Laboratory was born--or will be with your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/KDakSsh.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003every\nmonth, I will conduct the MAD EXPERIMENT: a comedic essay addressing some aspect\nof the writing world: characterization, dialogue, worldbuilding, marketing,\ngetting an agent, how to be a good panelist at conventions, representation, writing\nsex/fight/battle/exposition/extended dance sequences, experimental and\ntraditional structure, organizational tools, avoiding and/or embracing clich\u00e9,\nthat sort of thing. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn addition\nto the Monthly Experiment, you can sign up to receive an exclusive look at the\nproject I\u2019m working on that month, as well as access to Google Hangouts, Skype\ncalls, video Q \u0026amp; As, Tuckerizations, acknowledgements, and the chance to\nhave me critique your work. You can also suggest topics for further Experiments\nor schedule a writing date with me. Anything I can do to help you develop as an\nartist, learn to complain more thoroughly and deeply about books and movies at\nyour next family gathering\u2014or at least give you a bit of a laugh.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOr if you\njust want to throw a couple of bucks in the jar to keep the boiler from\ndevouring us all, that\u2019s great, too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd who\nknows\u2014if the stars align and the colliders collide and Megatastic Laser\nExposition Ray gets off the ground, the Laboratory might be able to bang\ntogether a podcast or a video series out of whatever is lying around when we\nfinish with the lizard trials.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u2019s all\nabout madness and the science of fiction. Let\u2019s make stuff up together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/IEEsrQ9.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
