    "summary": "Coverkiller Nation is a youtube channel at its core, but there\u0027s SO much content, its crazy. Album reviews, top 10 lists, culture commentary and reaction, 7+ series, and more is being added every day. Its a haven for heavy music fans, but music fans in general can find something that\u0027s right up their alley.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd this is all a one-man operation, and that\u0027s where you come in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor almost 6 years, the channel has been a love affair of sorts. Done primarily in my spare time and on days off from working in a music store, the channel has since grown much larger than I ever imagined that it would. If you\u0027re reading this, you\u0027ve been a part of that exponential growth and I am thankful. Its now requiring of much more time to keep up with everything and keep everything up and running. Any channel that has a dedicated team based around it would have such problems covered through delegation of duty and the benefit of multiple hands, but running solo also means the duties of research, shooting, performing, editing, distribution, social media upkeep and other minor jobs have all been mine. So better or worse, what you see is one man\u0027s absolute obsession with music and his fanbase.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hate asking for help. I\u0027ve never been good at it, and feel like its means I\u0027ve failed. But for the content to continue to flow, for everything to keep going, I am certainly in need of your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from the obvious cost of time spent, there are costs associated with the upkeep of equipment, or the sore need for some upgrades to improve quality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of all, I guess I am just very hopeful that I\u0027ve delivered a show for you guys that\u0027s worthy of a few bucks a month. The editing may not always be smooth, but hopefully its worth at least $1. A real fear of mine is that I\u0027m wasting your time with the content and that would be true failure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim will be to give patrons access to critical components of content creation from time to time. Higher level patrons may also get the option to get in on the action and be featured in some of the content. I\u0027d also be open to giving advice or aide to those attempting their own endeavors. I\u0027m really at a loss as to what else I could offer, but if something else comes to mind, I\u0027ll post an update.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor 24 Hours of CKN events, patrons would be able to post their ideas for content and have them made. If there are too many, and time doesn\u0027t allow for them to happen during the event, they\u0027ll be released at a later point. Nothing will be ignored if you\u0027re a patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any sort of unique theme week or weekend is run, Patrons will be in the drivers seat through polling as to what should be done.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, being a patron puts you in control more than ever before!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you for your contribution, and will see you around!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-CKN-"
