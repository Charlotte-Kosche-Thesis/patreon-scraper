Even though it\u0027s gotten harder and harder to release records, we try to keep up with industry trends, \u003cbr\u003eand even create a few of our own! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2018 is a big year for us, as we work on a series of four \u003cbr\u003especial projects from cities around North America.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlyssa Allgood (Chicago) \u003cbr\u003eLarry McKenna \u0026amp; Bootsie Barnes (Philadelphia) \u003cbr\u003eStephen Riley \u0026amp; Ernest Turner (North Carolina) \u003cbr\u003eArtist: TBA (New York City) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese four records feature musicians who have made or are making significant impacts on their respective jazz scene whether up and coming artists such as Alyssa Allgood in Chicago or legendary figures such as Bootsie Barnes and Larry McKenna in Philadelphia. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe would like to invite you, our enthusiastic listeners and fans, \u003cbr\u003eto be part of the season.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is similar to a crowd-sourced fundraiser, except that I want to forge long-term relationships with our valued partners in Jazz.   To entice you, we have some really exclusive rewards and perks for our \u003cstrong\u003eJazz Scene\u003c/strong\u003e patrons.  Come on board for an entire season!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the spirit of inclusiveness and community, we\u0027ve put together a bunch of great rewards that I think our regular patrons will enjoy. Have a look on the right, and step up to join us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve been so fortunate to have enthusiastic people behind us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease keep in mind that that what every level you contribute at, it gets charged four times (once for each project) so if you would like to for example contribute a total of $1000, you\u0027d pledge the $250 level,not the $1000 level.  If you\u0027re not  in a position to contribute financially you can still help us out by telling you friends about it, sharing this page and drumming up some support for us! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your time and for your support!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"height: 0;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
