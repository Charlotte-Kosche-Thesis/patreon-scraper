    "summary": "Hello! and welcome to my Patreon!! My name is Kayla, I live in California and am 20 years old. I started modeling when I was 18 and instantly fell in love with the process, the photos and the people. I love to create images that highlight the elegance of the female form and celebrate its beauty, rather than sexualizing the women\u0027s body, my goal is to find a balance between art and sex appeal. on my patreon you can expect to view sets of photos from my earliest days as a model, all the way through to present day, as well as many more future shoots. A little bit about me is that I have been in a committed relationship for two years, I am a vegan/animal rights activists and live on a property with 5 goats, three ducks, three dogs and one cat. I am a dance major at my community college and hope to become a certified yoga instructor after I graduate, in the meantime I am gymnastics coach and am enjoying my job immensely! I love to create art, be out in nature and listen to audio books(I am a big Harry Potter fan). I am so thankful for any support you may be able to give so that I can continue to dedicate my time more seriously to photography and modeling!\u00a0"

I love to create sensual pictures that emphasize on elegance and class. On my Patreon you can expect to find sets from almost every photo shoot that I have collaborated on in the last two years, plus new sets that I am creating every day! A few things about me are: I am a loyal Harry Pottery fan and love to be out in nature, I am a dance major and hope to become a certified yoga instructor, I am also a vegan and hope to create positive change in this world for everyone. I hope you enjoy my photos enough to become a sustaining patron and help support me on this crazy journey that is life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eP.S.
