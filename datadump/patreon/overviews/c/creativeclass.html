For two decades \u003cstrong\u003eShane \u0026amp; Amy Bugbee\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0(speaking in the third person is so weird) have built a huge body of work - Nearly 300 short videos, more than 200 podcasts (including the first ever 24 hour long live broadcast on the internet), numerous websites, countless blogs, built on a rich history of actually printed free comix, newspapers, zines, and magazines! \u00a0We give freely to the world, and that is just the tip of the iceberg of projects that \u003cstrong\u003eShane and Amy Bugbee\u003c/strong\u003e have created!  Our work has caught the attention of director \u003cstrong\u003ePeter Jackson -\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0who used our footage is a recent film, brought us a speaking engagement from \u003cstrong\u003eHarvard University,\u003c/strong\u003e and most recently our collection of video interviews from our year long road trip was accepted for permanent housing at the \u003cstrong\u003eInternet Archive\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003ca href=\"https://archive.org/details/culturalandacademicfilms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003earchive.org\u003c/a\u003e) the world\u0027s largest library!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen you support us, you aren\u0027t just helping us, you are helping a world of artists, intellectuals, and those curious and seeking knowledge for generations to come who access our books and creative offerings, along with 100% of our audio and video footage, footage we are offering up for all to use as they want, whenever they want, to not only watch, but to edit and borrow for their own projects. We are talking about hundreds of interviews over 20 years of Shane \u0026amp; Amy curiously seeking out occult knowledge from some of the most original and outspoken characters of our time! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are asking for support to keep our work pure, and to move ahead with the many ideas and projects we have a desire to complete. To try to monetize what we do perverts it, we know, we have tried. It makes our art false, flat and untrue, it forces subjects for commercial gain rather than keeping to those that have a real story to tell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Is This All About?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nA creative team for nearly twenty years, Shane and Amy Bugbee have organized art\u00a0festivals and huge public art shows, published books and CDs, and been on the forefront of new media.  From November 2007 to November 2008, we embarked on a journey of discovery, spending a year traveling the United States gathering stories from the people and creating a \"Litmus Test of America\". During this time we produced nearly 200 videos, dozens of audio files, some 10,000 photos, and over a hundred blogs. In 2012, we released a 534 page book and a full length movie chronicling the experience. We should mention, we began this epic journey with $180 in our pockets, no bank account, no grants, no sponsors, not even a credit card! It was grueling, it was terrifying, and it was the most amazing experience ever!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn April 2014, \u003cstrong\u003eThe\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eInternet Archive\u003c/strong\u003e agreed to accept all of the materials from our \u0027A Year At The Wheel\u0027 project. Thus far we have uploaded over 160 sets of raw footage for anyone to use, we also added our book and movie in their entirety, and we continue to add footage, audio and other materials. It is a daunting task, and we are doing this without any support. There is no doubt that it is a great honor to have a \u003cstrong\u003e\"featured collection\"\u003c/strong\u003e in The Internet Archive\u0027s \u003cem\u003e\"Cultural and Academic Films\" \u003c/em\u003esection, in the company of such historic figures as \u003cstrong\u003eBuckminster Fuller, Timothy Leary,\u003c/strong\u003e and entities like \u003cstrong\u003eTED Talks\u003c/strong\u003e, but organizing, uploading, and labeling our subjects and subject matter in a cohesive manner for others to use and understand has proven a far bigger task than we ever imagined. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho Are these People?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt has been said about us many times, that we offer a point of view that is not readily available online - We are working class, or upper low-class, we are self-educated, and have an \"in\" to places and people others cannot crack. Shane is a high school drop out, scofflaw, former ticket scalper, and teenage runaway. Amy is a former factory worker from a rust belt town who never thought she\u0027d ever get out. We were both saved by the act of art. We offer a view of the world that is seldom represented in the media beyond mere mockery. We document our surroundings with video, audio, photography and writing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince we are from the underground, some of our work is raw, and maybe even ugly, but we have a gentler side too. Read Shane\u0027s \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Bugbee\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewikipedia page\u003c/a\u003e, look at some of the varied stuff we have done - we started a festival for \u003cstrong\u003eJean Shepherd (A Christmas Story)\u003c/strong\u003e in his hometown, we started a gourmet sodapop company, AND we brought the first \u003cstrong\u003eBlack Metal \u003c/strong\u003ebands to American shores to perform! You can see we are prolific, and if you don\u0027t like one thing we do, you might like another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe have never put advertising on our websites. YouTube has asked to monetize our footage plenty, as our \u0027A Year At The Wheel\u0027 channel has received well over a million views, but we choose to keep it all ad-free because we cannot stand the possibility of corporations we do not agree with being plastered over our work. Perhaps that is foolish, but we view it as selling out or compromising, and we aren\u0027t so good at either of those things. We just want to keep our work pure, unadulterated, and rolling along. \u00a0Some of our current websites include: \u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://creativeclasstrumpsrulingclass.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreativeclasstrumpsrulingclass.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e, \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.astoriatv.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eastoriatv.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e, \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/AYearAtTheWheel/featured\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eayearatthewheel.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e, \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.usaodd.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUSAodd.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e,\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.worldsgreatestvanilla.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eworldsgreatestvanilla.com\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eand \u003ca href=\"http://ninedaysofpie.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eninedaysofpie.com\u003c/a\u003e (a website full of personal and free recipes sandwiched in between a personal celebration and our favorite holiday).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe continue to observe, report, and create video profiles of people, conduct interviews with scholars and creatives of all types, seek out knowledge and communicate with our expressions. Once our road trip project materials are completely housed on archive.org, we will start putting up all of the books, podcasts, and other projects we have released and continue to release. We ask for your patronage in continuing with this great work, it helps not only the two of us, but all of the people represented in these projects, and all of the people who might use our materials for their own projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\nShane \u0026amp; Amy Bugbee\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Shane and Amy Bugbee have been a creative team for nearly twenty years. We are artists and nerds of the self taught variety.  Shane began publishing a ZIne as a teenager, and by the time we met the hobby had turned into a full blown publishing company. We began building our own websites in 2000, and we were podcasting and streaming live internet radio in 2003. Shane moved into editing video in 2005.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve also produced art prints, newspapers and magazines, we have hosted events and founded festivals, built countless websites, and released hours of video and podcasts.  We have published books and comics deemed obscene by courts in the USA. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe don\u0027t have smiles big enough for Hollywood, we don\u0027t have a degree from an ivy league school, and we didn\u0027t have parents that cared.  Our work is unique in that we represent a class of people that are not well represented online, we have a window into the underground and into the working class, that is where we come from. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOver two decades we have flown by the seat of our pants, underfunded and underdogs, but almost always succeeding, while enduring death threats, police raids, website hacks, tabloid reporters digging through our trash, and the shunning of an entire town!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
