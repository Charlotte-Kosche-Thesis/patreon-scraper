    "summary": "Once upon a time, there was a podcast. Three delightful humans gathered every week to chat about video games, movies, and pop culture. They offered insightful and irreverent commentary on current events and deep dives on topics they were passionate about. One of them sung slow jams every week, and, dammit, he had the voice of an angel. Unfortunately, the podcast ended way before we could find out if Anthony had to eat a hat made out of butts for betting on Xenoblade Chronicles 2 missing its release window. (\u003cem\u003eUpdate: Xenoblade Chronicles 2\u0027s official release date is December 1st, 2017 so he has to eat one now.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut like that garbled, virtually unintelligible voice sample from Altered Beast once said, it\u0027s time to rise from our grave. We\u0027re back, baby. It\u0027s time to Continue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://continuepod.com\"\u003eContinue Podcast\u003c/a\u003e is made up of three video game media industry veterans, with more years of experience between them than there are versions of Doom:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/susanarendt\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSusan Arendt\u003c/a\u003e (The Escapist, Joystiq, GamesRadar+)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/ajohnagnello\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAnthony John Agnello\u003c/a\u003e (The AV Club, Joystiq, GamesRadar+)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/davidrobots\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDavid Roberts\u003c/a\u003e (GamesRadar+)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur mission is simple: provide smart, incisive commentary on the games we\u0027re playing and the TV shows and movies we\u0027re watching, record it all on a \u003cstrong\u003ebi-weekly podcast\u003c/strong\u003e, and be very silly while doing it. Podcast segments each episode will typically include discussions on the games we\u0027re playing and the news currently making waves in the industry, along with a deeper discussion on important topics related to the larger pop culture landscape. Sometimes a new Zelda game comes out, giving us an opportunity to discuss whether or not the series needs a proper timeline. Sometimes things will get way, way weirder.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe firmly believe that there is an audience hungry for an alternative to the infantilization or negativity of modern pop culture coverage, a podcast that offers intense and thought-provoking discussion on their favorite topics, without nearly as much airhorn (but still a greater-than-zero amount of airhorn). We believe that Continue can be that podcast, and so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you lovely folk come in. This is very much a passion project for all of us, and your support will ensure that we can devote more time and effort to it. Web hosting and podcast equipment ain\u0027t cheap, and \u003cstrong\u003ewe\u0027d also like to be able to\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eprovide live streams\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003erecord our show weekly\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003ebring on a producer to make sure we sound crystal clear, and create additional content especially for our fans\u003c/strong\u003e. Want to hang out with us while we play obscure Sega Saturn games, or listen as we torture Susan with our hour-long Kingdom Hearts screeds? You can help make that happen. Your patronage ensures that we can keep this show going on our own terms, and we wouldn\u0027t have it any other way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you\u0027re a backer or simply a fan, we\u0027re more than happy to have you along for this wild ride. Strap in, because we\u0027re heading for the EEEEEND OF THE ROAD. STILL I CAN\u0027T LET GO. IT\u0027S UNNATURAL. YOU BELONG TO ME. I BELONG TO YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAhem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContinue Podcast: Video games. Topical references. Slow jams.
