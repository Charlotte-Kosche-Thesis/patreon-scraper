My current project is Commander Canine, a comic book comedy about an unlikely superhero joining the police force. I\u0027ve been working on it for over a year and am close to releasing the final, full colour edition. I also pen and draw the webcomic R\u0026amp;D, a strip about a ragtag group of oddballs.\u00a0Other fun facts about me: I\u0027m a Copic Lifetime Ambassador and founder of Melbourne festival Indie Comic Con.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, where is your hard-earned cash going? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a freelance illustrator in addition to juggling several other jobs. Freelance work is very\u00a0up and down and doesn\u0027t provide a steady income for me yet. Your patronage allows me to create new comics \u0026amp; illustrations by keeping a roof over my head and food on the table, while getting closer to making this my main gig instead of a side hustle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron you\u0027ll get special access to my creative projects and can feel good knowing you\u0027re supporting the arts! You will be motivating me to keep creating regularly and become part of the exclusive community that I share and discuss my work with!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve made sure to put lots of value into each reward tier so that your investment in me is worthwhile. I hope you\u0027ll consider becoming a Crispy Cola patron and thank you to everyone who has already taken the plunge! You guys are awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.crispycola.com/_images/CC_BW_COV.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Commander Canine\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a world full of weirdos, super villains and alien invasions, the city of Meadowlark is eager to have a super hero on their side, their very own weirdo! Enter Commander Canine, a pancake loving, bikini brief wearing, dog-man. His reluctant partner on the police force, Rosa Espinoza is an exceptional officer whose career is being stifled by a system of discrimination.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
