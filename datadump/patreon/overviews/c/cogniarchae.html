    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a 37-year-old guy from Serbia, passionate about all things ancient for as long as I can remember.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo years ago I started to publish my ideas in the form of the free WordPress blog. Back then, my goal was to connect with a few like-minded individuals and move from forums to my own space, where I can simply elaborate my\u00a0ideas in greater detail.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the public interest was far greater than I expected. I got over 100.000 organic visits and over three million social interactions. My articles were published in various newspapers and translated into many different languages. (see the Media page). I also got a book deal from a local publisher and published my first book in October last year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI realized that I need to move my blogging to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently I moved to a self-hosted website, which obviously resulted in additional costs. Not to mention the countless hours spent on writing, photo editing, and the website maintenance, while balancing it all with my regular day-job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I believe in free information\u00a0and have no plans of making an exclusive, member-only content. I would like to see this website grow and become more than a website - a community of a sort. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, the plan is to start a YouTube channel with a unique video content. This content would be related to the articles, but also travel-logs from museums and archaeological sites, as well as interviews with interesting guests.\u00a0 - A three-year experience of a producer in the movie industry had me set for that journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am doing this because this is my passion, and I will keep doing it no matter what.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore you decide to support this project you should read a few articles on cogniarchae.com\u003cbr\u003eIf you still decide to get involved you will become a part of this journey, and perhaps we will even meet somewhere along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
