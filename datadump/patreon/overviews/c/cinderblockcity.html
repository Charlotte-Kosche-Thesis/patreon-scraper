Hasn\u2019t changed a bit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo dig a butt out of the ashtray and split a 40 with your Ma because in this dystopian future\u2026 Cinderblock City is probably as good as it\u2019s gonna get.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57e91401d482e9a8f5987cd0/590c9a2e5016e1ca29e39c6d/590cce7ee6f2e13e840b6c1d/1494011520982/Screen+Shot+2017-05-05+at+3.08.02+PM.png?format=1000w\"\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, I\u0027m illustrator\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.cinderblockcity.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRyan Sullivan\u003c/a\u003e. Cinderblock City is a spiritual successor for the comic I made in the late 2000s, Moonshine Mountain. That comic was a gag-of-the week type until I ultimately tried to use the characters for a more overarching story, but they weren\u0027t quite built for that and then the comic imploded on itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57e91401d482e9a8f5987cd0/590c9a2e5016e1ca29e39c6d/590c9e794402434f1d023bc9/1493999227131/eye-of-the-crow.jpg?format=1000w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then I\u0027ve been creating and designing tons of \u003cstrong\u003estrange characters\u003c/strong\u003e itching to claw their way out of my sketchbook. This project is an opportunity to release them into the wild, as I create a world that\u2019s strange and malleable enough to house them. So join the adventure at \u003ca href=\"https://cinderblockcity.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecinderblockcity.wordpress.com\u003c/a\u003e to see these characters living their lives!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57e91401d482e9a8f5987cd0/590c9a2e5016e1ca29e39c6d/591d19ea46c3c42b078fb608/1495079403739/character+lineup.jpg?format=1000w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe setting is one that wads up all my strongest influences: the greater Boston area and its unique array of urban development and decay. Pulpy post apocalyptic fiction. Fantasy, science fiction, and all their friggin\u0027 offshoots. Oh, and every scrap of comedy and satire I could get my hands on for the past 30 years. All filtered through my poor deteriorating mind and painstakingly rendered with ink and pixels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, my plan is to post \u003cstrong\u003eone page a week\u003c/strong\u003e. It\u2019s tight though, currently I drive an UBER to make ends meet. But I\u2019d love to do this as my \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFULL TIME JOB!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e and if enough of you like my work and are willing to pitch in to the cause, then I can! So check out the patron rewards to the right and my monthly earnings goals to the left. This project is truly a labor of love, which is why the individual pages will always be available for free.\u00a0But with \u003cstrong\u003eYOUR contribution, \u003c/strong\u003eyou could reap rewards such as\u00a0high resolution files for each page, access to my process blog where I will share tons of tips and tricks for crafting images, monthly illustrations exclusive to this community, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd hey, if you aren\u0027t in a position to donate, I totally get that. Sometimes times are tight, and trust me I\u0027m right there with ya. But your support still means the world to me, even if it\u0027s just to say \"Hey Sully, I loved your latest comic, bro!\" But the absolute BEST thing you can do to support me is to \u003cstrong\u003espread the word!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0That\u0027s right, crowd sourcing doesn\u0027t do jack-diddly without a crowd, so let your friends know about my work, recommend it to ANYONE you think might like it, get the word out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd most importantly, THANK YOU for taking the time to check out my work and support an independent artist!"
