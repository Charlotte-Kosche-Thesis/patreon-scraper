I sure do!\" to any of these questions, then how about considering becoming one of my patrons?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll get access to each page of my latest comic \"Chino and the Tall Towering Tree\" as they release, and a bunch of other cool stuff in the Chinoverse!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho is Chino, you wonder? Chino is purple cat in love with sushi, who will do anything for his beloved favourite food. He is a character that I created in 2014 as part of a student comic project, in which he finds himself travelling through a mystical mountain in search for sushi. This year he\u0027s been given a revamp, and now he has to climb the tallest tree around for his sweet, delectable noms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSounds just like the wacky kind of story you love to read about? Or maybe a kid you know would think it\u0027s cool? Then hit that become a patron button and subscribe to me as I churn out pages twice a month for your reading pleasure!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwice a month?! Yes! Twice a month! Sadly, I do have other commitments in my life... But not too worry! I will also be releasing other cool stuff alongside. You will only be charged for each comic page I release, and they will be released on the 1st and the 15th of each month. Chino and the Tall Towering Tree has 19 pages, and the first four are free for you to read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you immensely if you do decide to become a patron of mine, it helps me in so many various ways."
