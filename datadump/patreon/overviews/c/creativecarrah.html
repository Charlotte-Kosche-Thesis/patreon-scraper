    "summary": "Hello, My name is Carrah-Anne Aldridge and I am a 22 year old artist located in Ohio, USA. My popularity is growing on social media sites including Instagram and Musically where you can find my illustrations, realistic portraits and Starbucks Cup Designs.\u003cbr\u003eDuring the fall of 2015, my Starbuck cup designs went viral. They were featured on Huffington Post, Mashable, Yahoo News UK, BoredPanda, and many other sites. They were also published in a book titled, \u201cRipley\u0027s Believe It Or Not - Wild and Whacky 2017.\u201d Since then, my page has grown with several aspiring artists who want to know how I create my art. \u003cbr\u003eThe materials I use vary from Crayola\u00ae supplies, to Sharpies\u00ae, to Prismacolor Pencils and Copic Markers\u2014which is what I use the most. if you can\u0027t afford Copic Markers or Prismacolors, please consider becoming a patron to help support my YouTube, to be able to make videos on these topics, and to learn about less expensive supplies that are nice to use. I\u2019ve learned several tricks, since I have not always been able to afford the name brand products, and I would be happy to share that information with you.\u003cbr\u003eSo, you are probably wondering why you should support me.\u003cbr\u003eBesides information about less expensive art supplies, I will also make videos reviewing popular art products, that you all suggest. In addition, Patrons will have access to original, hand-drawn coloring pages that I post, at least twice a month if not more, for just $5.\u003cbr\u003eI am about to be a full time college student, so my funds for art supplies will be tight and may halt my creating new art. Support from patrons will help to keep me drawing.\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon site is to help me enhance the art experience for my viewers, fans and friends so that they can get the best possible quality out of me. Please consider supporting me and my growing art career. I would appreciate it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove you bunches!\u003cbr\u003eCarrah\u003cbr\u003e"
