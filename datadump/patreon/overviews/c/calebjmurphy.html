Welcome to my Patreon page.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re new here, the best way to explain what\u0027s going on is this:\u003cstrong\u003e Patreon is kinda like Kickstarter, but on an ongoing basis.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e(I understand it\u0027s more of a commitment, so I know it\u0027s not for everybody). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI give away all of my music for free and I have for a long time. My thinking is that if money is the only thing keeping you from enjoying my music, then I want to take down that barrier. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d rather you just enjoy my music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut because my music is free, I have to rely on blogging (yes, blogging) to provide for me and my family. And that\u0027s cool. I don\u0027t mind it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing is, what I \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003elove\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e doing is songwriting, recording, and playing music live. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if\u00a0you become a patron, you\u0027ll be helping me do those things even more. You\u0027ll be supporting me as a musician, which means I can make more and more music to give away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I be sharing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be posting unreleased songs along with the story behind each one. You\u0027ll get updates on the behind-the-scenes stuff of my music before anyone else. And other cool, exclusive things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did I start a Patreon page?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my pursuit of full-time musicianship, this page is a cool way for me to share my music in between recording albums. Because albums only come out every couple years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFriendly PSA:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tier your choose is a PER CREATION amount. So if you choose the $1 tier, that means you\u0027ll support me at $1 per new song I post. And I will never post more than FOUR of these PER MONTH (but you can also set a monthly cap for your contributions).\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThanks!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Caleb\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.calebjmurphy.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
