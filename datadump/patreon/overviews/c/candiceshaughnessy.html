For those of you who don\u0027t know me I am an opera singer and voice teacher living and working in New York City.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that music is the greatest tool humans have to foster connection with themselves and humanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe love of my life is vocal music and vocal art. I love making vocal art. I love collaborating with friends on vocal art. I love planning recitals and cabarets. I love collaborating with other artists, and I love teaching people about music and expressing what it means to me as a performer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also love teaching people how to sing and make music of their own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to build a platform where people can learn about the art of singing and further their art form. Singing is one of the most vulnerable, complicated art-forms in the world. My goal is to open a forum for this, and offer helpful advice. Whether you are a professional musician looking for concrete career advice or you are a beginning vocalist this is the place for you to get information.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, I plan to use this platform to fund any other recitals or projects I may be involved in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHappy Singing!\u003cbr\u003e-Candice\u003cbr\u003e"
