    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHi There! My name is\nCindy. Welcome. Thank you for showing an interest in what I do!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to invite you to join me on my Patreon page. To share\nin my journey. If you can and/or want to pledge, GREAT! In return I will allow you access to my\nwriting as I go along, and to my paintings. And I will come up with\nmore/different rewards for different levels. But you don\u2019t have to pledge, you\ncan just follow me and share in the updates and in some of the conversations. I\napologize in advance, the wine reviews are on hold. I need to rework the whole\nwine thing, as I haven\u2019t been drinking wine, due to allergies. But I will be\nsharing the progress of my paintings as well as my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ABOUT ME\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSome days it seems like all I do is struggle with the\nconcept of \u2018what I want to be\u2019 when I grow up. My boyfriend recently described\nme as \u2018someone who just got out of college and doesn\u2019t know what they want to\ndo with their lives yet.\u00a0 I\u2019m 50. I won\u2019t lie, it kind of hurt because\nwell\u2026it\u2019s true. And I felt, for a moment\n(or maybe the last month) like I SHOULD know what I wanted to do by now. That I\nSHOULD be doing it by now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy life has been a roller coaster ride for sure. I don\u2019t\nregret it. Not one bit. I have had some AMAZING experiences. What I need to\nrelease (being a Law of Attraction\nbeliever and all) is the idea that it matters that I know what I want to do.\nThat there is some sort of pre set, programmed path I am supposed to be\non\u2026usually according to someone else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat I do know is that, I know HOW I WANT TO FEEL! And I know some of you will pooh pooh that\nand say it doesn\u2019t matter how you feel. But of course it does! It matters how I\nfeel. It matters how you feel. The WHOLE REASON anyone wants ANYTHING in their\nlives, is because of how they believe they will feel when they have it. Think\nabout it! You may be wallowing in ideas\nand concepts of a self sacrificing life and how \u2018it\u2019s not about you\u2019, but even\nthat concept IS \u2018about you\u2019. Everything in your life is absolutely \u2018about you\u2019.\nIt can\u2019t not be. You are the only constant in your whole entire life. So if you\nare living a self sacrificing life, putting your life on hold for someone else\nor some other ideal, or to follow some sort of pre laid cultural or parental\nprogramming, it\u2019s time to ask yourself, why.\nWhat do you hope to gain by it? Because there IS absolutely a gain for you, or\nyou wouldn\u2019t be doing it. It\u2019s okay to do it that way. To devote your life to\nsomething out side of yourself, but just keep in mind, you are doing it for a\nreason that is valid to you, not to anyone else. Anyways, that\u2019s another\nsubject for another time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAbout a year ago, I\nwrote a couple of pages that stated \u2018what I wanted\u2019 with my life. What I wanted\nto be doing based on how I wanted my life to feel. And I wrote that I wanted to\nwrite, paint, dance, do yoga, meditate, have fun and adventures. Have a\nfantastic relationship and fantastic fulfilling social life. And obviously be\nfinancially abundant, so that I\u2019d have the freedom to do all of those things. SO that is where I am going with this here. Why I am taking this step.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI now do yoga most mornings and I meditate every day. And I\nlove the way those things feel. I dance, but I\u2019d like to dance more. I have a\ngreat relationship that is building all the time. I don\u2019t have much of a social\nlife anymore but that is out of choice for the time being. The people that tell you that you can\u2019t do it\nyour way, or who look down at you, because you haven\u2019t achieved your goals, or\nwho look down on you because you have and they haven\u2019t, do so out of\nbitterness. They do it out of comparisons. Judgement. I know, because sometimes I AM that person.\nAlthough mostly to myself lol. And sometimes I am the person on the receiving\nend. However, you absolutely CAN do it your way! And everyone\u2019s way is different.\nWe don\u2019t all want to create art, whether its visual or with the written word.\nWe don\u2019t all want to be mechanics, or doctors, or sales people, or actors, or\nscientists, or pizza makers.. But some do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat is weird about\nall of the things on my list is that I don\u2019t paint. I never painted. I have\nalways described myself as super UN artistic. But\u2026 I LIKE THE WAY PAINTING\nFEELS. In a different way than I like the way writing feels. I like them\nboth!!! And I just realized today that I\nhave been painting. I mean, I wasn\u2019t unaware that I had been painting, but I\nhad forgotten it was on my list. And lately I\u2019ve had a weird drive to just keep\npainting.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe other thing: I told my boyfriend the other day that when\nI wanted something SO MUCH, was when I seemed to fail at it the most. The more\nI wanted it, the harder it was. Now, I know that I have to work on eliminating\nthat false belief. I know that that belief causes resistance to what I want.\nBut one of the things I never really thought about was HOW MUCH of the reason\nthat I do this Law of Attraction thing, and share it with others, is because I have this STRONG need to prove to\npeople it works. I don\u2019t know why. I know it works, I know it without a doubt.\nBut I want to \u2018show\u2019 it working in such a way that I can prove to others why it\nworks. Why? Because I want them to be able to work it for themselves. But also,\nperhaps\u2026I still don\u2019t feel like people give me any credit. And that affects my\nself worth. Perhaps I feel like\u2026if I\ncould prove to people that I could change everything, just because I want too,\nthen they would actually \u2018see\u2019 me, instead of looking down at me for all of the\nthings I \u2018fail at\u0027. I always say its because I want them to be happy too,\nwhich is absolutely TRUE! But part of it, the part that is holding me back from\nactually achieving my goals, is the part that says, \u2018if you want to \u2018get\nthere\u2019, you have to prove this to others. It shouldn\u2019t matter, I shouldn\u2019t concern\nmyself with how other people think. Wolves and sheep and all those things. But\nagain, if I am attracting those kinds of reactions, it is because I am putting\nthat out there, it is not because they think them. I will tell you right now, I don\u2019t owe anyone\nanything. Every single person on this planet makes their own happiness\u2026or doesn\u2019t\u2026makes\ntheir own decisions on who they will be and how they will treat others. Chooses\nwhat they look at in others, usually based on their own fears and limiting\nbeliefs. Or they choose to see the greatness in others without having to\ncompare it to themselves\u2026.. we are all in this together. There is no separation. When one of us fails,\nwe all fail, when one of us reaches greatness, we all reach greatness. And\nthis, my dears, is going to be the inspiration for one of my upcoming\npaintings! And is also the basis for every story in this collection that I am\nwriting.\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MY WHY\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee above\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eWHY PATREON\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee above.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAlso, where your money will go: It will go, first of all, to\nhelping me buy supplies, printer ink, coffee (of course), stamps,paint, brushes, canvases, and after that, it\nwill go to helping me buy time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MY PLAN\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRight now, I have an anthology of \u2018Flash Fiction Faerie Tales\u2019 on Amazon. The set is called \u2018Happily\nEver After\u2019. Happily\nEver After is a collection of short faerie tales. At aproximately 1000\nwords each; the five stories are a little longer than regular flash fiction and\na little shorter than short stories, just long enough for one story to pull you\nin before it ends and the next one begins. Happily Ever After is: A lost\nprincess, a prince who wishes to be king, a lonely daemon, a seemingly\ndisfigured king who has given up on love, and a werewolf trying to save his\nmate. I want to take these short stories, one by one, and turn them into\nnovels. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy painting plan, is just to follow my heart and paint.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 WHAT\u2019S IN IT FOR YOU\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs one of my Patreons, depending on which\ntier you join, there are many rewards.
