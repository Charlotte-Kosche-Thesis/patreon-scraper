    "summary": "Hey everyone! Welcome to Copper\u0027s Cat Commune! To quote from our website,\u00a0Copper\u0027s Cat Commune is a nonprofit cat sanctuary dedicated to the lifetime care of a limited population of ill, disabled, or otherwise adoption challenged cats as well as the promotion of TNR programs and feline behavioral therapy.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWho we ARE is a bit more complicated.\u00a0 A couple who have a passion for all life, with a focus on cats. I (Mimi) am a former veterinary technician with pretty extensive knowledge in feline treatments and handling, cat behavior, and nutrition. He (Matt) is a former IT guy who works his tail off doing whatever needs to be done around here.\u00a0 With our staff of caregivers we manage from 75 to 90 cats at any given time, and there is another population of just over 30 ferals on the property that is managed by their caregiver.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe used to be your average slightly crazy cat household with 7 cats of our own and a rotating door of fosters.\u00a0 I came into the relationship with one special needs girl named Scarlett who ignited my desire to help those cats others didn\u0027t want. She had been adopted and returned to the shelter not once, but TWICE.\u00a0 That second trip back to the shelter absolutely broke her heart.\u00a0 I swore I would never let her down.\u00a0 You see, Scarlett had Feline Leukemia. She lived to be 14 years old though, and had a wonderful 12 years of life with us.\u00a0 Through our fosters we also ended up with another Feluke baby named Sable.\u00a0 She stayed and made it to 8. We lost both of them within 2 months of each other. By then we had stopped fostering and had been taking in cats with \"issues\" on our own.\u00a0 Eventually I decided I had to pursue a 501(c)(3) and Copper\u0027s Cat Commune was born! Copper himself was not special needs, but he was my heart and soul for 17 years, so his name is on our door.\u003cbr\u003eCats with health issues, mobility issues, behavioral issues, and occasionally one that is just \"too old,\" - they find us.\u00a0 They\u00a0are our world, our life, and our love. We eat, sleep, and breathe cats (and cat hair!). 99% of everything we do is for these wonderful souls who rely on us so very much.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you for coming along on this wild ride! We are striving to give them their best possible lives while still allowing them to live on their terms. We can\u0027t do that without you! If you like what we do, please become a patron.\u00a0 The cats (and the people of course) appreciate anything you can do! Thank MEW!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://copperscatcommune.org\"\u003eCoppersCatCommune.org\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/copperscatcommune\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/copperscatcommune\"\u003eInstagram\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.copperscatcommune.org/residents\"\u003eSponsor a cat\u003c/a\u003e"
