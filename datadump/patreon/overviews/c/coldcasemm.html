    "summary": "Hey, everybody. Welcome to the Patreon page for Cold Case Murder Mysteries, a podcast dedicated to analyzing true crime and horror through a lens of psychology, sociology, and evolution, where the weird and wacky brain of host Ryan Kraus makes regular trips down the rabbit hole of strange and enlightening insights for the purpose of bringing fresh perspective to high-profile cases that remain unsolved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a 1-person operation, the research, writing, producing, and editing involved in maintaining the podcast is very time-consuming, and leads to associated costs, such as equipment, books, and hosting fees, among others, that are sometimes difficult to accommodate. In light of this, I\u0027ve created a Patreon campaign in hopes you\u0027ll join me in my effort to help the show reach its full potential. If you\u0027re able to donate, you have my greatest appreciation, and, if not, having you as a listener is still 100% my pleasure. The support I\u0027ve received has been nothing less than amazing, and I\u0027m so thankful for the opportunity to be heard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I work on designing some really cool merch for the show, I\u0027m going to offer rewards that are more so geared toward content and things of that nature, but I\u0027ll be adding more options soon. So, please take a moment to check out the page, and maybe you\u0027ll see a reward that catches your eye. As always, thanks for listening to Cold Case Murder Mysteries!\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 Ryan\u003cbr\u003e"
