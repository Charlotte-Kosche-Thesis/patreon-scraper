We also host an annual retreat and meditation flash mob dance parties in the summer. We try to do all of this in a way that\u0027s irreverent and fun and stupidly accessible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat does this look like? Actually, it looks a bit different every time. Mostly it looks like us empowering people to come up with their own insights, life strategies, and service missions, so we can laugh uproariously at them, together, in a spirit of dumbfounded incredulity. We sit. We dance. We act. We fall asleep during long lectures. We wake up refreshed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Consciousness Explorers Club (CEC) is a registered not-for-profit organization. We work hard to keep our events affordable; all event fees go towards basic costs like paying teachers and renting space. But there\u0027s more that goes into creating weekly original programming, updating the website, writing the newsletter, and buying all these amazing shoes! To keep the CEC running smoothly - and to expand our offerings so we can confuse even more people - please give us some money. You can read more about our values and our flaws and our dubious human experiments\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.cecmeditate.com\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.
