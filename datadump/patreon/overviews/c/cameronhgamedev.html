I\u0027m Cameron and I\u0027m an indie narrative game developer/writer!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I am working as a software tester at a company, I\u0027ve got a passion for writing and creating little games and interactive fictions so I decided I\u0027d have this on the side for extra support! So what am I specifically doing/planning on doing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, in 2018, I want to try and create at least one narrative-driven game a month and build a big collection both to improve my writing and portfolio, and to also have just a big catalogue of fun, strange little interactive fictions (IFs), visual novels, etc. I\u0027ll be uploading them on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://cameronhgamedev.itch.io/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eitch.io\u003c/a\u003e, where they\u0027ll be free to play like my previous projects have been. Originally I was focused exclusively on Twine and IFs, but I\u0027m trying to expand right now into other narrative driven games media!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo how does this Patreon help me? Well, this 1) works as an incentive for me to actually keep up my targeted pace and B) I moved at the end of 2017 and while I know I can guaranteed pay my rent and bills for a good chunk of the year, the rest of the year is an unknown so I thought that maybe this would be able to help! Finally, it\u0027ll help support my passion while I\u0027m working and just ensure I can definitely manage to pay my bills and stay pretty comfortable!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, nice to meet you all and thanks if you help me out! Have a lovely day my friends. \u0026lt;3"
