Your adventure will take you \u003cstrong\u003ethrough time and space\u003c/strong\u003e in a 1950\u0027s fridge, all on a quest to to undo Clive\u0027s cousin Nancy\u0027s mistake and ultimately thwart the tyrannical Dr Daucus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/1/501/500221/profile/Dr_Daucus_Box_Art.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhat can you expect from the game?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClive \u0027N\u0027 Wrench features \u003cstrong\u003e11 distinct levels\u003c/strong\u003e as well as boss battles and a hub world.

Personally, I think the single most important part of a 3D platformer in this vein is control, as such a huge amount of time and effort has been put into both the feel as well as the animation of each move.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r-j7N-Rtn-Y\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eClive \u0027N\u0027 Wrench also features a colourful cast of characters, both from the modern day and throughout time.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://media.indiedb.com/images/games/1/15/14340/CnW_BoxartV2Small.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJlPRc2tpQ4\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eSo who am I?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHello, I\u0027m Rob Wass \u003c/strong\u003ecreator and lead developer on the game.

However I am under no illusions, as such even without reaching the ultimate goal, your generous support will all be used to fund the continued development.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGame development is an expensive journey, \u003c/strong\u003eeven in a modest game like this there are all manner of assets that cost. From character designs/artwork to audio, music, voices etc, all the way to more technical things like additional programming and shaders. So rest assured, \u003cstrong\u003eany patronage will go a long way!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/26Ff6Llkf8TlQYmWs\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
