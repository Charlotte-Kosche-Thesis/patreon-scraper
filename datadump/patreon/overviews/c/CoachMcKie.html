    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWhat is Patreon and why do you use it?\u003c/h3\u003eThis place is for those of you who want to help support what I\u2019m doing in ways that allow me to continue to support what you\u2019re doing: Mastering the Spread, Scoring Points, and Having Fun! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not familiar with Patreon, the concept is that you support a creator financially for each piece of valuable content they create for you. In my case, it\u0027s YouTube videos, Live Streams, and Live Coaching Clinics on how to Master the Spread Offense. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI believe in this concept with all my heart. It\u0027s helping coaches - like you and me both - bring more value to the world of coaching. Please consider supporting my work with a dollar (or however much you like) per YouTube video that I create. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/h3\u003eEvery month I tend to publish about 4 football videos to my YouTube channel, as well as a few Live Streams and/or Live Coaching Clinics. Each time I do so, I share that YouTube video here and mark it as a piece of content that you\u0027re supporting. The number of YouTube videos I publish that month determines how much you contribute. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFor example, \u003cstrong\u003eif you pledge $1 per YouTube video and that month I publish 4 videos and 2 Live Streams, then you\u0027ll contribute $6 for that month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, you can easily set a monthly contribution limit when you\u0027re entering your payment info. That way there\u0027s no surprises at the end of the month. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFor example, you can pledge $10 per YouTube video, get access to the rewards at that tier, but cap your monthly contribution limit to $10, thus supporting 1 YouTube video that month. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd don\u0027t worry about missing out on any content either. You will still continue to get my YouTube videos, Live Streams, and Live Clinics even if I publish additional YouTube videos that go beyond your maximum contribution limit for the month. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhere does my money go?\u003c/h3\u003eYour support enables me to invest into producing free YouTube football videos, Live Streams, and Live Coaching Clinics for the football coaching community who want to cause defensive coordinators to lose their hair and sleep. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs you know,\u00a0producing these YouTube videos, Live Streams, and Live Coaching Clinics does not come without a cost, and although it\u0027s not incredibly high, it\u0027s still money out of my pocket. The money you donate will go towards improving the quality of the videos and Live Streams. It will also go to traveling to different states to interview amazing coaches and produce great Live Coaching Clinics. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCrap, I don\u0027t have money to support this.\u003c/h3\u003eNo problem at all! Please don\u0027t become a patron if you\u0027re low on money or are struggling financially. I know what that feels like - I am a teacher and coach - \u00a0and want you to take care of your more important priorities first. I will continue to make videos and doing Live Streams and Live Coaching Clinics that I hope will help you become a better football coach and make this game better for your players. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
