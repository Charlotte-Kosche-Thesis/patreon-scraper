    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my Patreon page! I appreciate your interest in supporting me. I love playing music for you all, you\u0027re so fun and encouraging and keep challenging me to learn new music. Allow me to explain the purpose of this page...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a working musician, I\u0027ve found \u003cstrong\u003enothing makes me happier than playing requests for you guys and gals over the internet.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0It\u0027s weird, cuz I love my jobs playing piano and producing around town, but I think I have more of a musical connection to gamers and internet-dwellers than I do with the local music scene here in Nashville. I love Nashville, but there\u0027s not much love for video game music here! I\u0027ve been obsessed with video game music since I was 12, when I learned the Zelda Overworld theme. Since then, I\u0027ve committed several hundreds game tunes to memory, and have thousands left I want to learn!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to keep learning new music, and your requests are just what I need!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I set this Patreon for a win-win cause:\u003cbr\u003e1) \u003cstrong\u003eYou guys get a high-quality piano album full of your very own requests (free for public download)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) I get my piano back in tune!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy piano was wrecked by the temperature drop last month, it happens every December. Tuning a piano costs a pretty penny. My budget allows for 2 tunings a year, usually...my last tuning was in November for a session, so I\u0027m stuck with what I\u0027ve got until April.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the various milestones for details, but in a nutshell, \u003cstrong\u003e$5 will guarantee your request makes it on the album as its own ~2 minute track!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s absolutely\u00a0no pressure from me on my stream to donate, as I don\u0027t want to focus on it while playing music. However, for those of you who are able to make a request and tune the piano: I am so humbled by your support, and would like to express my gratitude personally. I would love nothing more than to do just play requests and video game music all day. This is me taking the first step towards supporting myself more through streaming, so I can commit more time to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers! -Will / chipboy\u003cbr\u003e"
