My name is Ciara Barsotti and I make art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCURRENT PROJECT: \"Space Cowgirls\"\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m working on a series that I call a study in anachronistic dreamscapes. The series juxtaposes the old west and outer space... New frontiers! Exploration! Crazy space colors! I have always loved sci-fi and western genres and I\u0027m thoroughly enjoying getting to play with the two together. Your support helps me pay for supplies and framing as well as marketing materials to promote the three shows I have lined up for summer, and Patrons get a special look at each piece no matter where they are in the world! \ud83d\udcab\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been drawing animals real and imagined since I was very small, but for almost an entire decade since childhood I\u0027ve fought against my desire to make a career out of my art-making. I used all the usual excuses: Can I really make a living? Isn\u0027t there something more meaningful I could do with my life? How is this helping anybody?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd after a decade of soul-searching, I\u0027ve realized that this is an abundant world and there is plenty of room for another working artist. There is nothing more meaningful I can do with my life than to do what I was made to do. Taking good care of myself by making and sharing my work means that I can take better care of the people in my life, and hopefully inspire them along the way with what I make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/577dc22f29687fd477a58f87/t/593aa5ed3a04117d543a30e9/1497015902098/?format=1000w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m building a tribe of other curious and creative people who also believe that one of the best things we can each do for the world is to be fully alive. I would love for you to join us! There are a lot of ways to get involved with my work, and one of them is by becoming a patron here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy patrons enjoy access to more behind-the-scenes materials, works in progress, sketches, regular shop discounts, sneak previews on future projects, and more... just take a look at the rewards I have cooked up for you on the right-side bar!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing I love about Patreon is that it fosters a close-knit community between creators and their fans. I really enjoy getting feedback from my patrons and regularly ask for their input.\u00a0I look forward to hearing your thoughts and perspective on my work, on the world, on life! Let\u0027s make something together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support,\u003cbr\u003e\u2665 Ciara\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/577dc22f29687fd477a58f87/58f2acb1893fc0b6e55411a7/5929a6cd59cc6892f6f472f1/1499904395128/SuperstitionMountains_small.jpg?format=1500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
