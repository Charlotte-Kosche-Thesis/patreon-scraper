And I cartoon in a variety of ways. The one that\u0027s relevant here is my strip, Nickyitis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLife\u0027s full of things to do and there\u0027s only a limited amount time to do them all. And what helps is when a work of love is also a work of income. Nickyitis satisfies half of that. My readers tell me they love reading it and I love putting them out there. But I also love eating and to do that I\u0027ve gotta work on stuff that brings in a few bucks. And that\u0027s why I\u0027m taking a dip in the Patreon pool. There\u0027s a lot of content up on Nickyitis.com at this point. More than enough for you, gentle reader, to decide if you like it so much you\u0027d like to help ensure it keeps on coming. And that\u0027s what your pledging will do. Keep the Nicky fun flowing. If Patreon brings in enough revenue, I\u0027ll continue to post two Nickys a week. If not, well then, since I truly enjoy both my gag cartooning and Nickyitis cartooning \u00a0(and the gag cartooning is a proven source of income), I\u0027ll redirect my energies towards the single panel gag cartoon arena.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the initial phase of seeing how it plays out, I\u0027ll reduce the Nickyitis posts to once per week, on Mondays. If the first stretch goal is reached, then back to the two per week it currently displays. And, if the response is so insane that further stretch goals are attained, then three or five times a week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I\u0027m using Patreon as a cross between the classical Patreon and a Kickstarter (essentially asking for a minimum level of support to \"kickstart\" a supported Nickyitis), you should view your patronage at the start (of a dollar or whatever you choose to donate) as both patronage for those existing Nickys you\u0027ve already enjoyed as well as implicit support for the future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that\u0027s about all. I hope you\u0027ll consider becoming a patron!"
