    "summary": "I\u0027m an aspiring author. I feel the need to express myself through stories or novels. I have all these ideas and I want to let them out. Thank you for supporting me and my writing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be writing in a variety of areas, including Fantasy, Sci-Fi, and sometimes mixing it up. Right now I\u0027m working on two projects:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/claudeeliska/posts?tag=rayton\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Town of Rayton\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e - A fantasy novel following the strange events in a remote mountain town in a world of Magik.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/claudeeliska/posts?tag=isv%20onyx\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eISV Onyx\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e - A sci-fi novel following the crew of an Imperial Space Vessel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy more than one project? To help me fight writers block. I find that if I get stuck on one project I can work on another for a bit, and then come back to the project I got stuck on refreshed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI strive to publish content (a chapter or short story) every week on Fridays. Sometimes real life will interfere with this plan, but I guarantee I will publish content at least once a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon? I like writing, and can do so for free, but I have to maintain a steady job to support my family and I. This means I can\u0027t write full time, instead having to do work, watch kids, etc. Writing is something I get to do in my spare time. There are also other things that I feel will make my stories better for readers, such as artwork (which I\u0027m not good at) or working with editors, which cost money. I intend for a good portion of my Patreon funds to be directed towards things that will help improve my work, such as hiring an artist or editor. However, long term I hope to make enough to switch to writing full time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne last note: I\u0027m super open to feedback! I want your feedback! I need your feedback! Let me have it! Even if you\u0027re not a Patron, if you have feedback for me on any of the posts that are publicly available let me know! Feedback from you is how I improve my work!\u003cbr\u003e"
