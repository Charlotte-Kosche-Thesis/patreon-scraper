The goal is to create engaging stories of adventure and danger in worlds that can be explored both through reading and playing games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I? - \u003c/strong\u003eCard Forge Games was created by me - Tyler Kalarchian. I\u0027m a writer who began writing a novel back in 2008. I set out with hopes of creating an exciting Fantasy story. That goal has changed over the years as I\u0027ve grown as an individual. I still want to release a great story, but now I want to release more then just a single novel. Going through multitudes of rough drafts, I\u0027ve now released \u0027Rucaern Orb\u0027 the first book in the \u0027Gray Sphere Saga\u0027. I\u0027m currently working on the sequel as well as two ongoing novels, \u0027Perpetual War\u0027 and \u0027Behemoth\u0027 as well as writing short stories and designing board games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon? - \u003c/strong\u003eI have known about Patreon for quite some time now. However, I did not plan on taking my writing seriously. I realized though after years of treating it as a hobby that I do want to make it my eventual career. With this in mind, I want to use Patreon as a way of supporting myself and my work while providing you all with lots of content to read and enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will content release? - \u003c/strong\u003eEvery Wednesday I will releasing updates on Patreon, which will release a month later on the website for free. These updates can be short stories, print-and-play games, and chapters of the novels I am currently working on. There will be the occasional exclusive chapter, short story, game, etc. that I will release sporadically. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting me in this ride to worlds of imagination and beyond, I appreciate it greatly!\u003cbr\u003e"
