I have created this Patreon page for \nthose who want to contribute to my videos.  Any money obtained here will\n be used to pay for gas and travel expenses.  I will continue making \nvideos regardless of how much money is collected here, but donations \nwill allow me to travel further and explore things I may not otherwise \nbe able to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I as I go on roadtrips and travel I will be sending Patrons postcards from the places I visit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease visit my Youtube page at \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/carpetbaggerorg\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/carpetbaggerorg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for anything you can give\u003cbr\u003eJacob - The Carpetbagger\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.thecarpetbagger.org\"\u003ewww.thecarpetbagger.org\u003c/a\u003e",
