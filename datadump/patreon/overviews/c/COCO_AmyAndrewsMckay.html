Animals have been my\nbest friends and inspiration from a very young age.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy formal schooling is in the arts,. I studied and worked\nhands on at the Sheridan College School of Design in metal, photography and a\ndabble in woodwork, clay and glass. Cupid\u2019s arrow struck and I left the college\nto have my first child and eventually juggled work, single parenting and university, earning my\nBA and Masters. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have spent my life raising my family, teaching,\nexperiencing art and creativity in any form I could find, or that found me. I have not spent my life in the professional pursuit\nof a place in the art world however; it has always been a part of my life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have enjoyed and experimented in many mediums. From ice\nsculpture and what you would call butter sculpture for prestigious hotels and\nin competition earning myself several silver and gold medals in showpiece\ndesign in the Maritime Food Industry (APEX ) showcases, as well in the\nprestigious \u201cCanadian Escoffier Society\u201d. I dabbled in computer animation for which\nI was nominated and became a finalist in the Halifax Women of Excellence \u201c awards\nas an innovator/entrepreneur. All of this time raising three small children and\ngenerally working late at night, while illustrating or painting and writing for\ncommissioned income.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI became very involved with all things animals and kindness.\nInvolvement with the local SPCA, Zoo, and wildlife rehab led me to put my artistic\nskills to use more times than not while creating a series of drawings, all\nanimals which I had met along the way. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThree-dimensional design is my great love and my life has\nbeen peppered with smaller scale clay sculpting, folksy garden oddities and\nlandscape design, and building, re-purposing old architectural pieces.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy happy life suddenly fell into a sinkhole so deep that\nrock bottom was something I could barely see above me. Now, I have climbed and\nfallen, repeatedly. I have throughout the plunge turned to art, at this stage,\nprimarily watercolour, pen and ink, to pay my bills, more importantly, express\nand experiment with expression to inspire myself and, surprisingly, sometimes\nothers. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I find most interesting is that my intention of expressing\nsomething, is often interpreted differently by someone viewing the work. This\nis exciting. This truly exemplifies art is what you make it. It is in the eye\nof the beholder. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am reaching out to Patrons to help me take those steps in\na positive way to make rock bottom, a place in my past. I continue to paint\nwith what I have and along with small commission work, I hope to start a\nbusiness and share the eclectic mix of artwork I have and continue to create. Some\ninspired by day-to-day life, many by the colours I see in the creatures around\nme, and some expressions I have created specifically toward an expression of my\nexperiences and support of Victims of Violence and the Mental Health community.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
