    "summary": "I like to remember how Cultivating the Lovely started- with a handful of gals, meeting together every morning on Periscope, sipping coffee and talking about Jesus and motherhood. Those mornings were life-giving as we openly shared our victories and struggles together, all while trying to make our lives even just a little bit lovelier in the midst of the everyday chaos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom there we expanded to the Podcast, a Facebook Community and even a few products now and then. It has been a fun ride, but we\u0027ve all known that there \u003cem\u003ecould\u003c/em\u003e be so much more! There could be \u003cstrong\u003emore content\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eincreased encouragement\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003edeeper community\u003c/strong\u003e, if only we had the resources. And now, with Patreon and the support of all you amazing lovelies, we are gaining those resources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePersonally, I think that the CTL community is the most supportive community on the internet- you ladies have poured out to me, personally, in ways that I cannot even fathom!
