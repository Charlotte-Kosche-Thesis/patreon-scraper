If you don\u0027t already know, I\u0027m the vocalist in a band called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/sq11w8CRYC4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDEADTHRONE\u003c/a\u003e. That\u0027s great, but it isn\u0027t what this Patreon is about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s it all about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m constantly writing music that I can\u0027t use in my band, whether that\u0027s because it\u0027s the wrong genre or for some other reason. Over the years I\u0027ve released lots of stuff under different names - most of which I\u0027ve never told anybody about. I want to change that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to release my music - all of it, whatever shape it takes - in one place. I don\u0027t see any reason for individual musicians to confine themselves to one genre, even if they are primarily known for one band or project. I\u0027ve always found it frustrating trying to track down the so-called side projects of artists whose work I like, and Patreon feels like the perfect place for a musician to collect all of their work together and make it available to people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat should you expect?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChilled, ambient soundscapes, glitchy chiptune, soaring post-rock epics, smash-your-face-in hardcore, twinkly acoustic ballads, or some weird combination of any of those things and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is an experiment, an attempt to see if listeners are willing to trust a musician to make the music they \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to make rather than the music they are expected to make. It may not work; you may love a song, decide to support me, and then hate everything else I release and withdraw your pledge. That\u0027s fine, and I totally understand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo try and assuage some of the doubts that such a broad - or vague, if you prefer - description of the music I\u0027ll be making, I\u0027ve decided to primarily focus on two projects (incidentally, the two projects pictured in my banner, and the music you\u0027ll hear in my intro video when I finally finish it).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSKYSHAPER\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is the name I\u0027m giving to my post-rock tracks. I love bands like 65daysofstatic, This Will Destroy You, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Isis, Sigur Ros... you get the idea. I expect the music I release under this name to sound like you\u0027d expect a band influenced by that list to sound. That said, I also really love bands like Pianos Become The Teeth and Being As An Ocean - bands that take some of those post-rock ideas and incorporate them into a heavier, more vocally-driven sound. I expect that some of that will creep in to this project as well.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCONQUESTS \u003c/strong\u003eis my straight-up hardcore project. Think Sick Of It All, Comeback Kid, Cancer Bats. There won\u0027t be any nice singing or string sections here - just big riffs and lots of aggression.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I paying for, and what is it being used for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI put most of my music online for free, on Soundcloud and Bandcamp and now on Patreon. The tracks I write, for the most part, will be available for anybody to listen to and put on Bandcamp as Pay What You Want tracks. The majority of my updates on Patreon will also be available to anybody who comes along.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI you\u0027ve chosen to support me by becoming a patron, either or instead of or as well as listening to, buying or sharing my music on other sites, then you\u0027re a great person. And great people deserve rewards. I\u0027m going to try to put at least one Patron-only track up per month. That will be a free update made available to patrons only. You won\u0027t pay for that song - which means that if it\u0027s the only track I upload that month, you\u0027ll get a song nobody who isn\u0027t a patron has heard, and you won\u0027t have to pay for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also promise that at most I will only ever mark 3 songs per month as an official \u003cem\u003ething\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0that you pay for, and that all of those tracks will be either SKYSHAPER or CONQUESTS songs. Anything that isn\u0027t one of those projects will be available completely for free. And if I only release one track in a month and it happens to be a SKYSHAPER or CONQUESTS track, you\u0027ll get it for free anyway as the monthly Patron Exclusive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for what I\u0027ll be using the money for? That\u0027s simple.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, it will go towards helping me eat and pay bills. For that, from the bottom of my heart, I thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, if at all possible it will go towards slowly upgrading my gear so that I can keep producing better quality music. Whether that\u0027s new mics, preamps, plugins... I don\u0027t know. You\u0027ll know about anything I buy with the money you give, and you\u0027ll have my gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe last thing to say is that deciding to support me does not obligate you in any way to continue supporting me, and that you should only decide to support me if you can afford to. This is only for your most disposable of income, the money that you wouldn\u0027t miss if you accidentally left it in the pocket of your jeans when you washed them. If at any point you find that your support for me is negatively impacting you financially, please stop supporting me. I\u0027ve been there - I live there - and I totally understand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003cem\u003ereally \u003c/em\u003elast thing is simple - \u003cstrong\u003ethank you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Thank you for taking the time to read this, even if you decide not to support me. And if you do decide to support me? You\u0027ll probably get sick of hearing me thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChris\u003c/div\u003e"
