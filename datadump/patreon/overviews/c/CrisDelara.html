So, patrons will only be charged when a bundle is released.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3- I want to release 1 creation\u0027s pack per month. But as my schedule is very busy, I decided to make it very flexible to everybody. So, if in a specific month I have no chance to release the reward pack, I will make an announcement in advance and my patrons will not be charged.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4- However, if in a month I get more time and inspiration to create and release more than 1 pack, the pledge amount will be charged twice ( and so on). Patrons can set a monthly spending limit for pledges on the system. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am super excited  about this new \"Cosplayer\u0027s Project\" and very inspired to create all these new Rewards to you all! \u003cbr\u003eThank you very much :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCris Delara.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
