    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello! And thank you for looking in :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs I come into the final stages of earning my Bachelors\ndegree, I find that I am more inspired than ever to share my work with my\ncommunity. I am a senior at Naropa University studying in the discipline of Art\nTherapy. I am an artist and I am needing to fundraise for art materials so I\ncan create a body of work for my senior thesis. The work that I will create in\nmy last two semesters will be displayed in an exhibition at my school sometime\nin December of 2018 when I graduate. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy thesis research is based around body image and forming a\nhealthy relationship with my own changing body. This topic has been of great\ninterest to me over the years, but has shifted drastically in my own life as I\nam currently pregnant and due to have a baby girl in May of 2018. As I have\nembarked on this mind boggling journey of growing life inside me \u2013 the ever\nchanging physical aspect of my body has brought me into new relationship with\nself-consciousness, self-esteem, and fear around body image. I am using my own\nexperience to tap into the creative and therapeutic modality of Art Therapy to\nreestablish a healthy, loving, and empowered relationship with my body, the\nhealthy growth of my baby, and the radical life change I am about to embark on.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe vision for this project is two fold: \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.I will be creating a body of work based on my\njourney through pregnancy, birth, and postpartum \u2013 to be displayed in a gallery\nas my senior thesis.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.I will be creating in this work a portfolio of\n20 pieces so that I can be prepared to apply for graduate school in the next\ncouple years.*\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n*I need 4 pieces, in 5 different mediums for the required\nportfolio for Grad School. This is a great opportunity for me to explore my\nsenior thesis with a variety of materials and products. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy wish is that I can fundraise for my art supplies through\nmy community so that I can focus deeply on creating this work as I\nsimultaneously create, birth, and meet my daughter. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn the last few months my life has taken some interesting\nand tough turns. I have made the decision to quit my job at the end of March\n(2018) so that I can turn my energy towards school and preparation for my\ndaughter. Although I am a very optimistic and energetic person, this pregnancy\nhas taken a lot of my physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual energy \u2013\nleaving me with deep exhaustion at the end of the day. It is with this that I\nam choosing to prioritize what energy I have left in to finishing this\nBachelor\u2019s degree. I will also utilize some of the funding to help me pay for\npersonal life expenses such as car insurance, rent, groceries, and health\nappointments. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI do foresee a level of sharing my art and creations with contributors as I start to produce more pieces. There will be prints and t-shirts\nand other trinkets that I will be sending as personal notes of gratitude to\nthose who are able to contribute to my project. Thank you for your time and\nconsideration. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn deep appreciation, \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCaroline\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
