It means a lot to all of us who make Changing Denver a reality that you are interested in supporting the show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI -- this is Paul speaking, by the way -- started this show back in 2015. I had some spare time and a few interesting ideas, and I thought, \"Why not do?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlmost three years later, we\u0027ve released more than 30 sound-rich audio documentaries chock full of reporting, analysis, and storytelling about all of Denver\u2019s most important people and places.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://changingdenver.com/?episode=colfax-stories\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egrit of Colfax\u003c/a\u003e and the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://changingdenver.com/?episode=the-zoo-and-you\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edesign of the Denver Zoo\u003c/a\u003e to more serious topics like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://changingdenver.com/?episode=the-five-points-and-the-six\"\u003egentrification in Five Points\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://changingdenver.com/?episode=stapletons-promise\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe KKK connection\u003c/a\u003e to the neighborhood at the site of the former airport, we\u2019ve always tried to bring you fresh perspectives and unheard voices.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve also picked up some accolades along the way. \u003cem\u003eWestword \u003c/em\u003enamed Changing Denver the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.westword.com/best-of/2017/shopping-and-services/best-denver-podcast-8917448\"\u003ebest Denver podcast of 2017\u003c/a\u003e and recently called it \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.westword.com/arts/paul-karolyi-of-changing-denver-talks-hyperlocal-podcasting-9554005\"\u003ethe crown jewel\u003c/a\u003e\" of Denver\u0027s podcast scene.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn April, we launched\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://changingdenver.com/?episode=rocky-flats-unclear-danger-project-apple-wind\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUnclear\u00a0Danger: The Colorado Story of Rocky Flats\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. It\u2019s a massive, sprawling story that we\u2019re telling over the course of our fourth season, and in many ways, it is the culmination of Changing Denver. This project has been almost two years in the making, and we\u0027ve got plenty of surprises in store.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this is to say, Changing Denver has taken a lot of work -- brain power, energy, time, money. Just take a listen to \"Project Apple and the Wind\" and think about all the little pieces that went into just that first chapter of Unclear Danger. Almost all of that was just me, doing the research, writing the script, designing the soundscapes and much more all on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s always been a labor of love, but at a certain point love just isn\u2019t enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy life has changed a lot since I started making this show back in 2015. There are appealing podcast projects all around. I honestly don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to carve out the time to make any more episodes of Changing Denver after this Rocky Flats series. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...unless \u003cem\u003esomething \u003c/em\u003echanges the equation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE ASK\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re here. At this point, you get it. We\u0027re asking for money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut our goal here is different from what you\u0027d\u00a0expect. We don\u0027t aim for this to be some kind of ongoing income stream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Instead, we\u0027re asking for limited-time\u00a0commitment to support Changing Denver, to recognize the value of our body of work, and to demonstrate \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eto us\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e that this is a podcast our city needs. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking a little more money off Changing Denver would be nice, of course, but realistically this campaign will likely refund only a fraction of the costs incurred from acquiring the necessary recording equipment, paying all of our talented contributors, and driving out to Arvada, Broomfield, and Boulder countless times over the past year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e THE REWARDS\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery episode we make will always be free -- \u003cstrong\u003ethis is no paywall \u003c/strong\u003e--\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ebut we want to give a little more to the people who give us a little more. So if you pledge at least $3 per month, we\u2019ll send you 3 Changing Denver stickers and the transcript of each episode in the Rocky Flats series as they are released. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat includes the main episodes, but also the short, supplemental pieces we\u2019re planning to deliver in the interim.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re feeling especially supportive, you can pledge at the $10-per-month Super Agent level. If you do that, we\u2019ll thank you by name in the credits of every episode in the Rocky Flats series. And maybe some other stuff too. I don\u2019t know. You never know what crazy idea will occur to me in a month. \u003cbr\u003e"
