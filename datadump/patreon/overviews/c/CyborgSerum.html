    "summary": "Welcome to Cyborg Serum.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 First of all, thank you to anyone who even bothered to stumble your way here. Cyborg Serum has been a seed of an idea, sitting in the confines of my mind for years, without the intention of bringing it to life. Yet, here we are. We\u0027re starting at the gateway to Dreams, and somewhere beyond lies Success. I have a full-time job and do everything outside of that, after making time for family. Becoming a Patron will make room for more Cyborg Serum in my life, and yours!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Cyborg Serum is made up, as of now, solely by me, William Bickford. I wanted to create something I could call my own and put it out there. I came up with Cyborg Serum many, many years ago as an idea for a comic strip, but have since begun to also transition it into animation. All self-taught. Maybe that\u0027s obvious, maybe it\u0027s not, but I wanted to see what I could do with making a video, and it worked.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 In fact, it worked even better than I would have dared dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 What can you expect from becoming a Patron? I\u0027m glad I asked for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 On Monday and Wednesday I will be uploading Comics. On Friday, (or over the weekend), I will be uploading a 1-2 minute video comic, thus dubbed Video Friday. Every week. (Short of unforeseeable events, seeing as it\u0027s a one-man show.)\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 And that\u0027s just to start! Become a Patron for $1/month and get access to all the Comic Strips. Become a Patron for $5/month and get access to Video Friday. Become a Patron for $10/month and get access to everything Cyborg Serum, including Behind-the-Scenes videos and more. There\u0027s more in store, and I\u0027ve got big ideas, but Patreon is where it starts.\u003cbr\u003e"

Cyborg Serum is pretty cool.\u003cbr\u003e  It could be great. Incredible, even.\u003cbr\u003e  So with this Goal, I intend to add that polish called \"time\" and make it shine. What is Full-Episodic Content, you ask? Simple.\u003cbr\u003e  Mini-Episodes are about 3-5 minutes in length. Short skits, you might say. With Full-Episodes, we\u0027re talking around 10 minute episodes once a month, at least. The Episodes will have some form of a story or linear segmentation, hopefully from Episode to Episode.\u003cbr\u003e  What could the next step possibly be?

That\u0027s definitely subject to change. I don\u0027t expect it to take that many Patrons to start up work on a movie, but I did want to get let everyone know that that will be the next goal after the Episodic content goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy a movie short?\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s a very good question. As of now, all of this is me, William Bickford. I write, draw, animate, voice and run the entirety of Cyborg Serum alone. Honestly, I prefer it that way, but I\u0027m not sure that it will stay that way forever. Making a Movie Short will definitely give me a good challenge to see if I really can do it all. I\u0027m talking full quality for a Movie Short.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat really is a Movie Short?\u003cbr\u003eA short movie. A 45-minute animated film, if you want to make it sound better and all technical. This means, a great story, (yes, written by me), and everything that comes along with making a movie feel like a movie. Protagonists, antagonists, characters and character development, a great story, comedy, tragedy, you name it. Music, sound effects, setting and a mood? Yup!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt won\u0027t take 5,000 Patrons to work on this goal. The goal is to be working on Cyborg Serum full-time. Once that can happen, this will be the first thing I begin work on. And then, maybe another? Or, if all goes well, a Full-Length Movie. That, for sure, will stay in the clouds as a dream, or in the ground as a seed. For now, let\u0027s water that seed.\u003cbr\u003e",
