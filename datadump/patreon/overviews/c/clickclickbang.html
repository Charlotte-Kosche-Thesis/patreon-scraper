    "summary": "It all started with a status.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/OREuHem.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom\nthis, a friend inboxed me and mentioned Patreon, and the beginnings of an idea\nformed in my mind.\u00a0I want to provide the gift of beautiful photography to the families of children\nthat have life-changing conditions, or who are in long term foster care, or other similar situations, free of charge. And I think it is possible! But I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello! I am Donna. \u00a0I am a mum of two beautiful children (yes, I have too many photographs of them) and wife to a gorgeous Irishman. \u00a0I listen to many kinds of music, from brutal death metal through to rap and hip-hop. \u00a0I have too many tattoos but always planning more! \u00a0If you\u0027re the nosy type (just like me!) feel free to go and look around my personal facebook page\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dcraddock79\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0don\u0027t be shy! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also known around the internet as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/clickclickbang/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eClickClickBang Photography.\u003c/a\u003e I shoot all sorts of things, from weddings and babies right through to fine art and horror. Heres a little collage of some of my favourite images from the past few years so you can get a feel for what I\u0027m about!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/SPKthLc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a sometimes full-time sometimes part-time photographer as my own health isn\u0027t brilliant, so if I\u0027m not being a photographer, or being a mum and wife, I\u0027m generally being ill (and sometimes feeling sorry for myself!). \u00a0Fibromyalgia, chronic migraine and bouts of depression all take their toll, I manage well but it means I have very little spare time, and what little spare time I have I try to put to good use by looking for paying clients. This means that the free sessions are few and far between as I don\u0027t have enough spare time or money to do them, and I want to change that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what I am proposing is this; \u00a0If I can get enough support, I can stop searching for paying clients, and instead I can concentrate my time on providing photography for people that deserve it, both in and around Lancashire (where I live) and, depending on how successful my pledge is, throughout the UK. \u00a0For example, If 1000 people pledged \u00a31 a month, that would still work out less than full-time minimum wage here in the UK but it would enable me to stop searching for paying portrait clients and to be able to photograph 1 session a week at my current portrait session rates. \u00a0I honestly think thats doable. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLets put it this way:\u00a0Peter Wanless, CEO of the NSPCC, earns \u00a3162,000\u00a0per year.\u003cbr\u003eNine executives at Cancer Research UK earn more than the Prime Minister, including chief executive Harpal Kumar, who pockets up to \u00a3240,000 a year. \u00a0Amnesty International\u0027s Salil Shetty, pockets a salary of up to \u00a3210,000, and Tom Wright of Age UK, earns up to \u00a3190,000 a year. \u00a0I\u0027m aiming to get \u00a312,000, which (along with my wedding work) will pay my bills, feed my kids and keep my photography equipment in good repair. \u00a0I\u0027m not in this for the money, or the fame. \u00a0I\u0027m in this to do something with this small talent I\u0027ve been given, this pretty minor ability in knowing how and when to press the shutter button, to give these families something they can treasure forever, at no cost to themselves.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOK, I\u0027m not trying to cure cancer. \u00a0But I think I\u0027m doing something tangible, something worthwhile, and I guarantee the parents of the children I photograph will agree with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach family will also have the opportunity to share their story with their images on my blog and established facebook page (if they want to of course) to raise awareness for their situation or the illness that their little one suffers from, alongside blog posts from myself about my journey with Fibromyalgia and brutal honesty about being a Mum with severe, recurring depression. \u00a0I want to bring these things out to light, so others can see they aren\u0027t alone and that there are other people out there dealing with the same issues. \u00a0I honestly believe that being open about such things can make a real difference to someone elses life, in fact I don\u0027t believe it, I KNOW it. \u00a0So tying my own story in with the stories of others seems like the right thing to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou in this with me?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
