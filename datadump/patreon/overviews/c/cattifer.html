You might have seen my work in \u003cstrong\u003eEmil\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ey and the Strangers: Breaking The Record\u003c/strong\u003e,\u00a0published by \u003cem\u003eDark Horse Comics\u003c/em\u003e. Or maybe you\u0027ve seen my \u003cstrong\u003eFlaccid Badger\u003c/strong\u003e mini comics at a con!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast year, as a birthday present to myself/motivation to draw for something other than work, I created my webcomic,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thelastdiplomat.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Last Diplomat\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. I wanted to tell a story that revolved around stuff I like to draw, which turned out to be a butt-kicking girl, and adorable monsters. I love illustrating Samma and Tark\u0027s adventures together and sharing them with the world, and a year on the job has only strengthened that feeling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, doing a full-color page of comics each week, on top of all the other work I have, can be a bit trying sometimes. It takes a lot to put those pages together, and sometimes I have to put them aside in order to take more work that helps pay rent and bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy goal for this Patreon\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eis to earn enough to help me stay focused on The Last Diplomat, so I don\u0027t always have to put aside my pages to take on other work. The money I receive through this Patreon account will go towards bills and rent, and also towards new merchandise at shows. It might even help me be able to travel to more conventions outside of the Northwest, so I can share The Last Diplomat with as many people as possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, The Last Diplomat will remain a free webcomic! But if you\u0027d like to become a patron and support me while I do it, you\u0027ll get some fun extras in return. Also, I will be super honored and will love you forever."
