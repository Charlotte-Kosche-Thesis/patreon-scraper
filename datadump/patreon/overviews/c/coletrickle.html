Coletrickle is a daily lifestyle newsletter focused on music, photography, travel, and generally cool sh*t. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut don\u0027t listen to me. As one reader put it, \"Coletrickle is the perfectly curated mix of images, music, and personalities with a dash of news.

Aggregating content, preparing the newsletter, and the interactions with the readers on a daily basis are incredibly enjoyable, but they are also time-consuming and ultimately expensive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to turn this dream project into an enriched and dynamic business that can benefits both readers and brands.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUse of Funds\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMailChimp:\u003c/strong\u003e The service we use to email posts out to the subscription list.
