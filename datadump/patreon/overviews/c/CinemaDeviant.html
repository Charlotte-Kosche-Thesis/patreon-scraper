My name is David and I\u0027ve been running \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://CinemaDeviant.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCinemaDeviant.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e for a few years now which is a full Entertainment site with Movie Reviews, Video Game Reviews and all sorts of Entertainment News. It started as a hobby and then from there it became such a big part of my life and has taken off in an insane way. I usually churn out about almost 10 reviews per week on average which is a pretty hefty amount for one person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOn top of that I also run a \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://Youtube.com/CinemaDeviant\"\u003eYouTube Channel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e where I post weekly videos that feature Blu-ray Unboxings, Movie Reviews, Podcasts as well as Blu-ray Buyer\u0027s Guides where I help and inform the Blu-ray Community about various versions of certain movies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s a lot I know and I am basically a one man show that produces and edits all of this content. When do I sleep you ask? Well that\u0027s besides the point at the moment. All I really want to do is continue to create entertaining content for everyone and that\u0027s where your support comes in. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will DIRECTLY help me to create more for YOU as well as maybe helping with a Red Bull or 2 to keep me awake while I make more content...Haha! In all seriousness though, I appreciate each and every one of you and if you can throw something my way then \"Hell Yeah!\" and if not that\u0027s perfectly fine too you\u0027re all still my best friends! \u003cbr\u003e"
