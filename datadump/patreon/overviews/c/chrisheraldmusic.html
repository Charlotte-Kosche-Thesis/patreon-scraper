    "summary": "Welcome! My name is Chris Herald, and I am a professional saxophonist and educator currently living in Tucson, Arizona. I recently finished up my Doctorate in Saxophone performance, and now that I\u0027m finished, I am so excited to have the time to devote myself to my musical projects. My background is mostly in jazz and classical music, but my personal compositions tend to cross genres and be pretty eclectic. I love to find new ways to create music--combining old ideas in different ways, creating new sounds and concepts, and always moving forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eResurrecting Id and Other Projects\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main project right now is a jazz-metal band called \u003ca href=\"http://resurrectingid.bandcamp.com\"\u003eResurrecting Id\u003c/a\u003e. RID was strictly a studio project while I was touring with another group, and then back in school from 2014 to 2017. But now I am fortunate to be working with three other killer musicians on this very hard music, and we\u0027re booking our first gigs for the coming weeks! Oh, and there\u0027s another studio EP coming your way in the next couple months too! The thing that makes RID really special is that, I believe we are combining jazz and metal in a very genuine way. It\u0027s not just \"jazzy\" metal or heavy jazz, but it really takes jazz improvisation and melodic concepts and combines it with rhythmic concepts from metal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a few other projects in the pipeline too. . . I\u0027m working on recording my solo saxophone project, which is the result of my doctoral research at the University of Arizona. This research was based on the \"post-avant garde\" solo saxophone music of primarily Evan Parker (UK) and Colin Stetson (Canada). You can check out some of my solo music \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/yEHejY2JKTE\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/npw8HJlsBLQ\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. Other projects I\u0027m working on include a pretty esoteric saxophone/piano duo, and a jazz big band project of originals and arrangements. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my biggest motivators in playing music is for somebody to come up to me and tell me what an emotional impact the music had on them. Art is so human: while it is sometimes hard for us to explain why, it can stir our emotions and make us think in new and exciting ways. We reflect on our humanity through music and the arts, and we come out the other side: changed, and hopefully understanding life and ourselves a little bit better. Music has had such a profound effect on who I am. As both a listener and performer, music has changed the way I approach life, and made me a better person in a huge way. If the music that I make speaks to you, I would be grateful for your support. \u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s work together to create cool music!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003eChris\u003cbr\u003e"
