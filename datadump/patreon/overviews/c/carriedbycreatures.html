    "summary": "I\u0027m Nicholas Cloister and I draw\nmonsters. I design the creatures, I paint them, and I write about\nthem. I enjoy taking my time with them, and to give them that extra\ntouch. Sadly I can rarely find the chance to do so when I work for\nthe companies. There is always the pressure of making the hours\ncount. Few clients respect creatures enough to really make them\nmatter. Numbers, budgets and goals are more important to them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why my own creature-making is so\nmuch more satisfying to me. There is no fixed budget, and there is no\ndead-line. I can spend as many hours as I like bringing them to life.\nSupport me in this and I will happily share them with you. You can\ngive me the space I require to bring new and beautiful beasts into\nthis world, unfettered, and relieved from the chains of commerce. I\nwill give you quality \u2013 creatures brought out from the heart.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are a few examples of my work.

I enjoy all high-quality fantasy expressions, like LotR, Game of Thrones, Legend, Conan The Barbarian, Skyrim etc. I also have a great interest in medieval mysticism, and practise Zazen meditation. The best thing I know is to walk slowly through nature, simply enjoying the scenery. I also like making abstract art, and consuming obscure ale.
