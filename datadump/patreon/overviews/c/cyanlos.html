The fact that you\u0027re here on this page gives me the warm fuzzies, and being an introvert I have no idea how to express that \u2014 except by drawing a mustache on a picture of your favourite idol. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDo you like stuff that I like? How about paintings of anime waifus on the the ceiling of Sistine Chapel? Okay, perhaps not literally, but since this is the internet where imagination can run around without pants on, so we might as well sing with its unbridled muse.\n\u003cspan style=\"color: #e6461a;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"What do you draw?\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA six-shooter at high-noon in case somebody has any funny ideas.\u003cspan style=\"color: #e6461a;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"What do you animate?\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe dead.\u003cspan style=\"color: #e6461a;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"What is this and why should I care?\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ll explain. I want to build an empire of art built entirely on free software. I know it\u0027s doable, because I\u0027ve done it commercially before. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven so, doodles are cheap. But \u003cem\u003egood art\u003c/em\u003e? It\u0027s still a labour of love. Drawing takes me less than a day, painting sometimes more, small animations can take a week, large animations take my wallet, and a long-running comic-series takes time to believe whether or not it should be framed on a wall as a masterpiece or sent to a gulag for crimes against humanity. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith every penny that is dropped into my hat, I gain the confidence to strut across this landscape of creation with absolute impunity and do as I please. If you\u0027re in on the deal, you get exclusive access to my inner-most secrets at every step as I achieve world domination. All you have to do is think of it as an investment towards a front-row seat to witness breath-taking vistas such as Batman taking on the unbeatable Bugs Bunny. In a thumb-war.\n\u003cspan style=\"color: #e6461a;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Okay, but what do I get in return?\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLike I said \u2014 my inner-most secrets, and front-row seats to all sorts of entertainment. Plus, every time I put something up on sale in the future, you get limited edition discount coupons (and sometimes, get stuff absolutely free). You get to decide which part of Idea-land is ours for the taking, whose next king will be the highest bidder (only 100% OC, guys). The more you pitch, the more you get to loot.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will also affectionately call you John. Kapish?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: #e6461a;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn short, being a Patron gets you:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eSecret meetings with the (introverted) boss,\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eUpdates to what\u0027s being made and how,\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eA voice in how this fine business is run and what gets made,\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eThe finest loot, high-res or vectored, free or discounted before anyone else.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThink about the offer, it ain\u0027t too shabby.
