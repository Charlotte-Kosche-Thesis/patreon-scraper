    "summary": "The Cloudbase Mayhem podcast is where you will find fascinating and educational interviews with the best free-flight pilots in the world. If you fly a hanglider or paraglider, if you fly acro or cross country, the Cloudbase Mayhem podcast is where we glean how the great pilots of the world get there. Hosted by Red Bull X-Alps pilot, National Geographic Adventurer of the Year and current holder of the North American foot launch record, Gavin McClurg. We\u0027d be thrilled to have you join us on Patreon and reap the benefits of being part of the crew!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have started this Patreon campaign because we want to take the Cloudbase Mayhem to the next level! If you help us make this possible, here is what we can do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWE CAN PRODUCE BETTER CONTENT!

Support staff for editing and keeping the effort going at top quality on a regular basis. We aim to put out a new episode every other Wednesday, year round.

It\u0027s time I love to spend and I think it\u0027s worth it. And if you think it\u0027s also worth listening to and you\u0027re getting something out of it, all we ask is a \u003cstrong\u003ebuck a show\u003c/strong\u003e. And if you\u0027ve got a few extra coins in the pocket, well I\u0027ll give you some more radness in return if you want to ante up to a little more. Personally I\u0027m a podcast addict, but there\u0027s nothing more frustrating than listening to the same stupid advertisement over and over again and I trust you agree.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany Cloudbase Mayhem listeners requested that I create a page here. Unlike one-time or monthly donations made through\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.cloudbasemayhem.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e, Patreon allows you to give a specified amount whenever I release a new episode of the podcast, or bonus material (it also lets you cap your totals). This seems like a great way to sponsor work we care about, and I\u0027m very happy to join the many content creators who are now using this service. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0026#8217;m tremendously honored to have a community of people who value what I do.

The CONTENT goes out to the public, you guys are the backstage. You don\u0027t lose access to ANYTHING when you hit your cap. you\u0027ll still get EVERYTHING emailed to you if you\u0027re backing at the email level, and access to all streams even if your cap is $1 a month. You don\u0027t get punished for capping. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: \"I want to join your Patreon, but I don\u0027t have any idea how much to donate. I want to do it for about $25-35/month. You say it\u0027s donating \"per thing\" - how often do you do those \"things\" - so I can get an idea how much to donate per thing. For example, if you do a \"thing\" every 3 months, I will donate $100 per thing. Guidelines on \"thing\" timetables... at least roughly?\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA:\u003cbr\u003eWell...that\u0027s really generous. Right now you have two options: you could just back me at $10/thing, which is the closest denomination (in general I put out about two things a month) and I\u0027d cap your donation at $30, or $60, or $60....so you never pay more than you\u0027re happy with. OR if you\u0027re feeling more generous, you can actually \"write in\" a higher amount per thing (i.e. you can write in $20/$30/$50 at the $10 level) and that extra dough per thing, until you hit your monthly cap, is just considered generous gravy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: \"Um....what if i want to just donate money to you once? this is weird.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Um.
