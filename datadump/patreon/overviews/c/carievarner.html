I graduated from the American Academy of Art in Chicago IL with a BFA in Life drawing and a minor in sculpture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt and I have a on again, off again love affair, but this latest roump has been 7 + years and I have not wanted to put down the paint brush yet. Everything changed after having my daughter, and I want to bring as much creativity and joy into the world as I can. And to do that, I make art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs any artist can tell you, having a defined place to create freely is a blessing. I have found a studio that my patrons here help me rent. I am forever grateful for the help I am receiving, and can\u0027t wait to further my art career!\u003cbr\u003e"
