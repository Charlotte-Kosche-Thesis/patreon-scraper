    "summary": "PLEASE READ BEFORE BECOMING A PATRON\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUm, hi! I\u0027m Lucy and I make videos on YouTube, mostly about Pokemon. But you probably already know that so I\u0027ll tell you what this page is all about!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a nosy thing and LOVE looking at behind the scenes stuff of my favourite creators and I thought... I wonder if people might be interested in my behind the scenes stuff too? I\u0027ve been working\u00a0hard on making my videos more creative recently so I have quite a bit to share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make it clear that I am NOT in need of financial support so if you\u0027d want to support me for that reason then please don\u0027t. Really. I\u0027m fine. Please only pledge if you want the rewards! That\u0027s the whole reason for this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you might be looking at the \"per video\" thingy and might be thinking I\u0027m trying to pull a fast one on you but please let me explain. While it\u0027s true I have hundreds of videos on my channel and if I planned to do daily (or even weekly) uploads, then charging per video would be pretty ridiculous. However, after some much needed reflection I\u0027ve decided to make the switch to more or less 100% high effort videos. This includes stuff like my Version Differences series or any other video that takes me A LOT of time to make. I\u0027m lucky if I get a couple of these videos out a month because I don\u0027t have anyone helping me edit stuff. (That\u0027s a pretty big can of worms though, tldr I\u0027d be open to help in the future, but I have a lot I still want to learn myself so it\u0027s best this way for now)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think this is the best way to do it because that way if I have to take a break for a long period of time then you all won\u0027t just get billed regardless, like if it was set up on a monthly bill basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cool perks include~~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022Monthy Newsletter - updates and babble about what\u0027s going on with the channel and such.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022Discord Server Invite!! So here it finally is. Let\u0027s all chat about stupid stuff to our heart\u0027s content together. You guys can also help me come up with video ideas too because I\u0027m not too good at that. (If you can\u0027t access the server/didn\u0027t receive an invite, please contact me and I\u0027ll sort it out.)\u003cbr\u003e\u2022WIPS of Drawings and Finished Drawings in Full Resolution.\u00a0Oh yeah, I draw stuff now. This grants you access to all of my drawings in their ORIGINAL quality (not available anywhere else) I can remove my signature too upon request.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022See Progress on my upcoming videos! (Screenshots \u0026amp; Clips)\u003cbr\u003e\u2022Entry into a monthly raffle for a free drawing slot of whatever you want! (There are rules)\u003cbr\u003e\u2022Signed Card from me! (requires address) Alternatively you can send your own in for me to sign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e($100 joke tier)\u003cbr\u003eExclusive cat pictures for your eyes only DAILY. If more than one person actually does this, then they will be sent different pictures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m thinking of adding even more perks in the future as well - Patrons can help me come up with them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for all the support over the past few years \u2665 This is a pretty big turning point for me, so I hope you\u0027ll continue to support me during this new step in my creative career!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
