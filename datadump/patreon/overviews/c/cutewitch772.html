This Patreon account will allow me to continue and expand what I do online. Through sustaining the public content that I\u0027ve been putting out into the world for years now, my Patrons help to support the time it takes to do this, ensuring that I am able to keep up with the demand without having to reduce my involvement. Not only that, but your support will enable me to begin offering more in depth work to those who desire it, in my role not only as Teacher, but as Priestess.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is also to be able to travel to do some of what I do--attending events and meeting and collaborating with more of you!

She is the co-founder and Tuesday host of the Pagan Perspective, a collaborative channel for Pagans of all sorts. On her personal channel, she creates vlogs about her daily life, occasionally makes t-shirt reconstruction tutorials, and talks about various things that interest her including but not limited to Paganism, spirituality, sexuality, books, theatre, art, and cats. She was one of two featured guests at the inaugural Conway Pagan Pride Day in Conway, Arkansas in 2014, along with musician/singer/songwriter S. J. Tucker. Sheldon Slinkard, President of Pentacles of Pride, International, enjoys referring to Cara as a \"YouTube sensation,\" which is a title she doesn\u0027t feel she deserves, but maybe you can help her achieve.",

     "description": "Something that doesn\u0027t cost much but makes a HUGE difference is a business card. I used to make my own Etsy business cards, printing and cutting them myself, and I love them and the way they look, but it did take a lot of time and effort (and I so rarely buy ink since I so rarely print anything at home!). I\u0027d like to create a new business card that will have my YouTube and other online information on it, as well as my Etsy shop specifically, maybe one side for each. This would be kind of an all-purpose card for my \"Witchy Stuff\" and would be handed out at events and shops, included with Etsy orders, and so on.",
