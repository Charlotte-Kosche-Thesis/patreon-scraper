    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWELCOME TO CHINESE COOKING DEMYSTIFIED!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been sharing authentic Chinese recipes with an emphasis on the techniques behind the dishes.These days, cookbooks that focus on cuisines outside of Europe tend to read more like travelogues than textbooks... we feel that in order to properly teach Chinese cooking, a more educational approach is needed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT THE PROJECT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to deliver quality, real deal recipes that can teach people how to cook proper Chinese. We take inspiration from the quality resources we used when learning Western cooking - Alton Brown, J. Kenji Lopez Alt, etc. - and try to discuss the \u0027why\u0027 behind the techniques.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome people learn best from video, some from writing, some from a combination of the two. Because of this, together with a video we\u0027re committed to putting out a detailed, in-depth written recipe that\u0027s more \u0027article\u0027 than a \u0027list of steps\u0027.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVIDEO DETAILS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach video is a recipe video in the narrative style (about 4-8 minutes long). We believe this format is the best way to learn how to execute a dish: while the focus is on the food and the steps, a voiceover allows us to discuss what\u0027s actually going on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWRITTEN RECIPE DETAILS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideo is excellent for communicating a basic understanding, but there\u0027s no substitute for the depth you can cover with the written word. Each written recipe is roughly 2000-4000 words and in it we\u0027re able to delve into the ingredients and why they\u0027re used, the cultural background of the dish, and a bit more about the process.\u00a0A good example for what we\u0027re trying to do would be the post for \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/6y7dkr/recipe_how_to_make_sichuan_dan_dan_noodles_%E6%8B%85%E6%8B%85%E9%9D%A2/\"\u003eHow to Make Dan Dan Noodles and Homemade Chili Oil\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese written recipes are posted to the /r/cooking community on Reddit, not a blog. This project actually began as a way to share Chinese recipes to /r/cooking (the video simply being something to accompany the recipe), with only the vaguest idea that it could grow into a YouTube channel. We continue with it not just because we want to keep on contributing to the community there, but also because there\u0027s simply nothing else like the depth of discussion you can get on Reddit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT US\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo who are we? \u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe\u0027re basically just\u00a0a food-obsessed couple that lives in Shenzhen, China! Stephanie Li is basically the brains here, she\u0027s from Guangzhou and was raised in a family that\u0027s incredibly passionate about Cantonese food. A free-lance translator/editor by trade, she\u0027d bounce around China staying in different cities and began to try to replicate what she ate. Steph focuses on researching and testing the recipes, and does more of the on-camera cooking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI (the writer) am Chris Thomas, I\u0027m from the United States and\u0027ve been living in China for the last ten years... basically my adult life. I love living here, and one of the things that\u0027s consistently blown me away\u0027s been the food - the depth and variety\u0027s just incredible. While you\u0027ll find me behind the wok on some videos, I mostly focus on the recipe writing, the video editing, and the narration.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFUNDING\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLike most creators, our ultimate goal is to be able to work on this project full time.\u00a0 This would not only make things more sustainable, but also allow us to put more time into other facets of project. We chose the format we did to most efficiently teach cooking... but in addition we\u0027d also like to produce step-by-step picture recipes, shortened printable recipe cards for use in the kitchen, and even some quick gif recipes to augment what we have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong term, we\u0027d also like to produce a cookbook that is organized by the 16 main techniques is Chinese cooking. Delve into the technique itself, give a few basic recipes with many variations branching off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBECOMING A PATRON\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe wanna deeply thank you for helping get this project where it is today - whether you\u0027ve watched the videos, read the posts, shared with your friends, recommended us online, or shared your two cents in the Reddit or YouTube comments. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to support the project further, that\u0027s incredible. By becoming a Patron, you\u0027ll get access to a Discord server and a Wechat group to let us all communicate better, as well as some of my musings here. We can also think about what recipes you\u0027d like to see!"
