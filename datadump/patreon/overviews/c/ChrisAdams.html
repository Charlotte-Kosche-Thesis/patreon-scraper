    "summary": "Welcome! As a musician, I endeavour to create quality productions for people to enjoy. Being creative is about the only asset I have, and about the only desire I wish to fulfil. I have been known to work on a commission basis, but it is incredibly unreliable and I often go for weeks and months without any income, wondering if I might have to sell my equipment and move on to less desirable endeavours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon, you will be helping me continue along this path and assure that I remain able to share my talent with the world and give people what they often ask for creatively. While I am known mostly for my Doctor Who renditions, and it is doubtless that many of my original patrons will be from that following, I am always keen to produce my own material and push myself to take on a variety of genres and move outside of the box so to speak, so by becoming a patron you will also be supporting me in other endeavours!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate hope is that I will be able to quit looking into other ways to make money and focus on music full time. I will be able to put money back into maintaining the equipment I do have, and hopefully be able to buy better equipment and expand into areas previously out of reach to me, such as obtaining more copyright in order to expand my versatility, and even make videos and hire proper studio facilities down the line. The sky is the limit!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading and I hope you consider becoming a patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the best,\u003cbr\u003eChris Adams"
