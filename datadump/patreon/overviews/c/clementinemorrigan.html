    "summary": "I am a writer, artist, rebel scholar, and working witch who dives deep into trauma magic. My writing grapples with issues that are often silenced and shamed such as surviving child abuse and sexual violence, living with and recovering from trauma, sex and sexuality, polyamory, kink, queerness, alcoholism and addiction. I start with the assumption that we are fucking magic, that our very existence is a fucking miracle, and that we are powerful and good just as we are. My work explores the things I have been told never to talk about and in doing so I hope to extend a profound permission to all of us to heal on our own terms and tell our truths in ways that feel good to us. My intention is to obliterate shame in all its forms. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write a zine called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://clementinemorrigan.com/fucking-magic\"\u003eFucking Magic\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eand have written two books, \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://brunswickbooks.ca/Rupture/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRupture\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003e(2012) and \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.inanna.ca/index.php/catalog/size-bird/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Size of a Bird\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003e(2017). I have three book projects in the works right now, as well as always working on the next issue of \u003cem\u003eFucking Magic\u003c/em\u003e. I also\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://clementinemorrigan.com/tarot\"\u003eread tarot professionally\u003c/a\u003e and use the cards the way I use my writing, to inspire, empower, bear witness, encourage, and uplift. I have been writing and making magic for years and I am finally at a place where I recognize that I need to be paid for my work. I used to post so much of my writing on my blog for free, and while I know my writing was doing important work in the world, I was broke and often struggling. In order for me to continue to do my work, it has to be sustainable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are lots of ways to support my work. You can buy my \u003ca href=\"http://clementinemorrigan.com/fucking-magic\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ezines\u003c/a\u003e or my \u003ca href=\"http://clementinemorrigan.com/books\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebooks\u003c/a\u003e. You can \u003ca href=\"https://calendly.com/clementinemorrigan/60min/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eget your cards read\u003c/a\u003e by me. You can also become a patron here, by contributing a set amount per month, starting at $5. Patrons will gain exclusive access to writing that can\u0027t be found elsewhere online. You will have access to popular articles which used to exist on my blog, previews of the three book projects I am working on, and reflections on my process. You will have access to tons of new writing on kink, polyamory, and other topics that are close to my heart these days, which isn\u0027t available anywhere else. You will read about polyamory, sexuality, overcoming shame, femme, queerness, kink, tarot, trauma magic, sobriety, addiction, healing, and all the themes you expect to find in my work. You will have access to my works in progress as they develop and also to older work that is no longer available elsewhere. You will have access to magic spells, tarot spreads, and other trauma magic. Your support means the world to me and makes it possible for me to continue the work that I do. Thank you thank you thank you from the bottom of my heart. \u003cbr\u003e"
