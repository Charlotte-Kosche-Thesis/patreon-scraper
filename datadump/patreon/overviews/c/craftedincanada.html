My husband and I were working on another film project that took us across the country and we were fortunate to be able to shoot episodes for Crafted in Canada at the same time. The most surprising thing that I found out on this journey was the impact that these brewers have in their communities. They are making great beer and building cool businesses at the same time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m excited to visit more craft breweries and share more of these amazing stories. By becoming a patron you are helping me continue this journey to find more great Canadian Craft beer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love these shows and want to see more, please consider being a patron. With your help I will be able to continue to produce episodes of Crafted in Canada. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you love Canadian Craft beer as much as I do? Then I invite you to come on this journey with me to tell these amazing stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers!"
