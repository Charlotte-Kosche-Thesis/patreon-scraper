    "summary": "I write stories about humans. They\u0027re unsettling, they\u0027re bittersweet, and they stick with you.\u00a0I explore those gray areas that most people don\u0027t like to think about, but they are the gray areas of our everyday lives. My writing has been described as intense, unflinching, and disturbing---something often referred to as grit lit (although my Southern roots don\u0027t shine through as strongly as they could). You won\u0027t find romantic ideals or fake nostalgia in my writing. You\u0027ll find gritty, raw real life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIs my writing everyone\u0027s cup of tea? Not by a long shot. But I firmly believe these stories need to be told. They are about people facing everyday challenges and making not-so-everyday choices. We make thousands of seemingly insignificant decisions every day, but what happens when an innocent decision takes us down an overgrown path?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy supporting me\u003c/strong\u003e, you are enabling me to write more, plain and simple. If I can spend less time trying to find people to buy my collections, then I can write more flash fiction, short stories, and (gulp!) perhaps a novel or two (or ten!). You\u0027re also ensuring that I can continue to explore new ways to deliver content (I already have plans for audiobooks and podcasts, but what other trouble can I get into?! psst....send me your ideas!). And you\u0027re supporting small coffee shops, cafes, and other independent retailers of caffeine bursts in rural America. I live in an area where mom and pop shops still exist, and I am determined to help them survive and thrive. Becoming my patron means I can leave bigger tips for the awesome service I receive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook, I get it. Starting a new relationship can be scary. Take a moment to peruse\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.cjaiferry.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e, where you can learn more about me and my writing. I\u0027ve got a few stories available for free, plus my blog includes quite a few examples of microfiction. If you sign up for my newsletter, you can get a free ebook with a handful of short stories and poems (yes, I\u0027ve been known to dabble in poetry). If you\u0027re intrigued, come join my patron community and share my work with others you think might be interested. If you still have questions or concerns,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:cjaiferry@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edrop me a line\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m always happy to chat...although I\u0027ve been known to talk people\u0027s ears off. Don\u0027t say you haven\u0027t been warned ;)\u00a0"
