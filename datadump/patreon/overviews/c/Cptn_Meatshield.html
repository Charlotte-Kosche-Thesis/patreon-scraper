Gaming and music have been two of my biggest passions for the majority of my life, and to turn these passions into a career would be a dream come true!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI upload a Let\u0027s Play video every day of the week, and I upload a new music cover every month.\u003cbr\u003eI understand that a lot of people these days use Adblockers online. Ads are a nuisance, and I totally get why you might choose to use a blocker. However if you do enjoy the content I create, and would like to support me, outside of ad revenue, then it would appear that you are in the right place!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me through Patreon, your pledges would be put towards maintaining, and upgrading my computer, recording hardware, and software, along with little things like replacing guitar strings and picks (those things disappear quicker than odd socks!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to my uploading videos throughout the week, I am only requesting pledges from Patrons on a monthly basis. I don\u0027t want to be draining your wallets for the work that I am doing. This does mean, however, that you can support my workload of 30+ videos per month for as little as a single dollar!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA quick side note: For Patrons pledging $5+ dollars per month, you will need access to Dropbox in order to receive your rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
