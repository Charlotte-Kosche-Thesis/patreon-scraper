     "about": "Hey guys, welcome to my patreon page! I am an entertainment enthusiast as well as musical composer/writer/character designer. I love all forms of entertainment, of which I myself am best at mostly western anime and it\u0027s been a long time coming but I finally decided my writing and artwork should finally reach these pages. Seeing as how popular anime has become as of late, I thought I\u0027d give it a more serious try. I won\u0027t go out of my way to say this is going to stand out from the rest, but if you have the time to read or even browse through the character designs and illustrations, you might find something you enjoy in it :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, this is very early in development and now that introductions are out of the way, my end goal is to create my own string of anime shows whether full scale media or even use the internet as the medium. Naturally any support is more than appreciated and I will do my best to keep getting better. I am currently working on season two in written format and I am happy to say I\u0027m planning on it being even bigger than the first. My goal here is to make my work a profession with no limitation of artistic freedom. If that can be achieved, I would gladly do my best to make sure no one regrets it. Because at the end of the day, artists, creators, commenters, critics, we all want to entertain while leaving something to think about regardless what form that takes. If I can do that for a living? You bet I would work 110 percent to make sure that nature is preserved. So to keep with that mentality, this being my first day and all, I\u0027ll keep my eyes on ways to make sure pledges will be recognized and appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLink to my deviantart site is here where you can look at my work free to read. If it looks like something you want to see as a manga or even as a full length anime series, don\u0027t be afraid to support in any way you feel necessary, it goes a long way with me, happy browsing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://rexholyblade.deviantart.com/\"\u003ehttps://rexholyblade.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
