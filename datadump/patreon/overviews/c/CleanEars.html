The other two podcasts didn\u0027t represent the voice of young people. We saw filling that void as our responsibility. I love listening to sermons from churches and but sometimes,I want something light and fun without having to compromise. I find that when I want something fun there was nothing I felt that I could relate to. My options were to either listen to alternative podcasts and feel SUPER convicted, listen to a sermon, or get frustrated and just listen to nothing. I didn\u0027t like those options. We are providing a much needed source of clean entertainment through a medium  in which we hope will also enrich people\u0027s walks with Christ and start conversations about what that looks like.",
