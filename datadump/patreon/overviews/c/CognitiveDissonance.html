Ultimately only you and I can decide what is truth, or even if truth exists.\u00a0 :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlucked from the anonymous peanut gallery of Zero Hedge more than seven years ago and handed a clean palette as a contributing editor with no restrictions or editorial interference, I began speaking about my experiences exploring the collective insane asylum located between our ears and deep within our soul. What could possibly go wrong with someone waxing philosophically, with no filters or adult supervision, about the inner madness found buried deeply within \u0027\u003cem\u003eus\u003c/em\u003e\u0027 on an extremely popular alternative non-mainstream financial blog?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCognitive Dissonance was the result!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe recipe was simple. Look deeply within the collective \u0027\u003cem\u003ewe\u003c/em\u003e\u0027 and record what I see, feel and sense. And more importantly, what we all intuitively know is truth once the inner lies and self deceit are slowly peeled away. Pushing aside as best I can my deep cultural conditioning, questioning \u0027\u003cem\u003esettled\u003c/em\u003e\u0027 truth, authority and propaganda and the self realizations this uncovers, gazing into the cognitive nooks and crannies we dare not examine and asking (hopefully) better questions, first of myself and then of the collective, I regularly report back to my fellow travelers and wait for the chaos to commence. To my everlasting surprise, my greatest learning comes from listening to those who wish to share after hearing what I have to say.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last seven years one thing has remained constant in my life....the incredible support and encouragement I\u0027ve received from you, my loyal readers and followers. Whether it arrives in the form of comments left under my articles posted on Zero Hedge and Two Ice Floes, my Twitter feed, Facebook, many personal encounters over the years or the emails arriving on a daily basis, my reader interactions have always been personally rewarding to me in every way possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond only to Mrs. Cog, \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e are the inspiration in my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy wish, my sincere desire, is to be able to devote more of my time and energy to exploring the depths of our Cognitive Dissonance. The rabbit hole runs deep and I would love nothing more than to attempt to pursue it to the end. Any Patreon support you wish to provide in \u003cstrong\u003eany\u003c/strong\u003e denomination you are inclined to offer will be most welcome and gratefully accepted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there is a particular donation level and reward you wish to see added, please contact me and I\u0027ll do everything in my power to accommodate you.

But reaching this level of support means I can drastically reduce the time I devote to actually earning money to support the household and direct that time towards what I love the most, writing about life, inflaming the world\u0027s Cognitive Dissonance and contributing in the insane asylum we call modern society.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider helping me reach this goal.\u003cbr\u003e",

The ultimate result of hitting this support level would be a more fair and equitable balance of Cognitive Dissonance in our lives to the assumed mutual benefit of all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI say assumed.
