I\u0027ve been doing this since I was very little, all my movies are driven by stories build on and engineered by a certain feeling that when the movie ends, the audience is left with the feeling I intended to give them. My stories are poems made into a video. I intend to show the world how to do so and why It\u0027s important to remember a good moral."

     "description": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eI\u0027m a young movie/short film director who recently got into animation because I want to accomplish some of my goals and films in any way shape or form. I\u0027ve done so by manipulating the free software known as Mine-imator to make short animations, and potentially a full length movie. The way I work, is I won\u0027t make a big project that doesn\u0027t have a good story. I keep going over my stories so that way they are driven, built on, and engineered by a emotion, or a feeling. I do this so that way the audience will watch this with a series of emotions that they can relate to so that by the end of the video, they are left with the feeling I intended to give them. It\u0027s important to remember morals when making huge projects. Think not about you\u0027re reward, but the audience\u0027s reward. I\u0027ve been working a short series that I will later turn into a full length animation called \"Reality\" a story about a young boy who looses his two friends, and is so hurt that he cowers into his dreams because he can\u0027t accept reality any longer. When doing this, he hurts his remaining friends who try and fetch him from the dream. His darker side of his personality controls everything in the dream from this point on and will slowly, but surely leak into his reality. But since it\u0027s his dream, he can be as powerful as he wants. His friends however are limited, and in order to get their friend back, they need to defeat him in the dream and, \u003cstrong\u003e\"Wake up to Reality\".\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is the First episode or \"concept\". There\u0027s a few more on my channel!\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3l3cp_unzVU\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have also been working on a large animated movie that\u0027s been in the making for about 3 years now. It\u0027s called True Love. A minecraft story of 5 beta testers on a minecraft server that is built strictly for the AI in the game. These characters are not controlled by human players. However, when the Server is threatened by a monster known as a wither boss, the entire server, and minecraft itself is at jeopardy. The 5 beta testers must group together to stop this monster, or else minecraft will forever be a forgotten memory.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis 23 minute clip of True Love is very old and is being remastered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_aYjLaXm77M\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is what I do. This is what my short film and animations are like, they deliver powerful messages and morals to ensure that the audience will benefit from the story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to be a movie director some day, you have no idea how many stories I\u0027m saving for the future. Thanks for your time!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eCade Beebe\u003cbr\u003e",
