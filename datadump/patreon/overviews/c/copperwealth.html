While a series of this quality requires all sorts of amazing talent to help, it all stems from one lonely, overworked individual who funds this with his limited savings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe needs help and this is your opportunity to \u003cstrong\u003ebe his hero\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron of Copperwealth, you are directly paying for that amazing talent he hires. You are paying the editor, the composer, the voice talent. You are also helping to pay for online storage fees and other overhead required to keep this thing afloat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s false to say that donors help keep Copperwealth free. No - \u003cstrong\u003eCopperwealth will always be free\u003c/strong\u003e.

I love making this thing but it\u0027s not cheap. I tried to make it affordable - I even tried to do ALL the voices on my own to cut down costs but it sounded, er, less than good. Maybe I\u0027ll share that version of the pilot episode with you in the future (but it\u0027s quite embarrassing).\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eEven after doing as much as I can to make this show as affordable as possible, it still costs more than $1500 per episode to make. I\u0027d have to work about 7 months in order to save up enough money to pay for one episode (and that\u0027s a heck of a long time for listeners to wait between episodes).\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I appreciate you donating your money to help pay for this series.
