Despite having the incredible power to bring paintings to life, his powers nearly set him on fire, brings him no friends, and results in him getting humiliated on a daily basis. Life doesn\u0027t seem to be able to get any worse than this.\u003cbr\u003eWell- until the zombie outbreak overruns his home. Life then consists of using his scrawny legs to try to outrun zombies, smugglers, black market dealers, cannibals, all that fun jazz. At least the handsome gunslinger Lillium White is here to help! ...hopefully.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCountdown to Countdown is a post-apocalypse story with video game elements, utilizing game elements like \"game over resets\", \"checkpoints\", \"choice systems\", \"inventories\", and so much more! Our story follows Iris Black, a teenager with the mysterious power to bring pieces of art to life and a fear of fire as he finds his way in a seemingly unforgiving America. \"Glitchy\" Zombies are dying to get a taste of him and \"Spawncamper\" hunters are willing to go the extra mile to murder him for his powers.
