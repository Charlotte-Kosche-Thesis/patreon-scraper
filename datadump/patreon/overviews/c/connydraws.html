This is all about my journey and my support-page for this passion to get closer to that one day ... and 5% of your support will go to Rheumastim research.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://connyemmerstedt.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/screenshot-2017-04-29-22-54-33.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nStarting of with a little back story how I have got in this position I\u0027m in today:\u003cbr\u003e\nI have always from a little child had a side passion for drawing, to draw down the pictures that\u0027s popping up in the mind and losing the surrounding, the time and everything.\u003cbr\u003e\nDuring the grown up stage I never imagined it would be possible it would exist the way for me to work with art, so I never putted my mind in that stage to search after that kind of way to succeed with this. I only saw art like a hobby, not a life style.\u003cbr\u003e\nDuring the years in school I loved and spended the time to draw and paint, every time I had a little extra time I took a pen and a blank paper and made some drawings. Later in time when I started to work with a normal daily work, the art passion was put aside more and more when I only saw drawing like a hobby.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://connyemmerstedt.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/screenshot-2017-04-29-21-41-26.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eShowing this for fun, feels nice to have a old memory like this.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy life changed during the summer of 2016!\u003cbr\u003e\nUnder the last years I worked as a baker and I was preparing myself to compete in classic bodybuilding. Everything was planned and I didn\u0027t see anything else than to succeed with my dream to be on stage. But then during summer of 2015 my dream got a little bump, an inflammation ocurred in the left foot. It became worse and through time it spread to the other foot, I took pain killers daily cause the only thing I had in mind like I mentioned was to be on the stage no matter what. I struggled with the pain from summer of 2015 to 2016, it only got worse and 2-3 months from the competition I couldn\u0027t walk anymore without extremely pain and it even spread to the right hand. My body was so in stress and the only option I got when I really understood my situation was to leave my dream for now and starting repairing my body. I couldn\u0027t work or go to gym or anything anymore.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe first month I was desperate and I didn\u0027t know what to do, but I knew .. I needed to do something.\u003cbr\u003e\nI got the idea to pick up the pen again and there it was ... the new spark was up and burning!\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m left handed with drawing and writing, the only body part that was in good condition was my left hand and from that day I decide to spend at least 1 hour each and every day on drawing like I almost have 100%.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnder this time I started to grow new future visions and goals and my thoughts from my childhood working with drawing was grown once again... the vision, the goal and my imagination is to become a character artist one day!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://connyemmerstedt.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/screenshot-2017-04-29-22-02-51.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSO here we are, in the start position of everything!\u003cbr\u003e\nDuring this half year I has spended time on different kind of styles to try out a little of everything, with manga drawing, animations, 3D sculpting, 3D animation, illustration art and a little more.\u003cbr\u003e\nI have now started to settle everything and I\u0027ve got to a point now to master 1 - 2 styles instead of doing a little of everything. \u003cbr\u003e\nThat what made the hours mostly fly away was my love and fantasy for illustrations, paintings of fantasy character designs (monsters and humans), either 2D or 3D modeling in photoshop and Zbrush. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThen next question.. how can I afford a way to help my day now.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have looked around for ways, ways that could support my art drawing, my vision, my passion and even my daily life.\u003cbr\u003e\nI got in contact with Patreon, read about it and I\u0027ve seen it\u0027s great supporting page for whatever you want to do and share to others. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m going to this page to share to you:\u003cbr\u003e\n- The process of paintings either way in step by step pictures or speedpaint videos of the result, that may help you to get some ideas from the way I am building up my paintings.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e- \u003c/strong\u003eOriginal imagine in jpg and pdf files.\u003cbr\u003e\n- Random weekly sketches.\u003cbr\u003e\n- Monthly contact through skype, a little chat about anything using text or speech.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://connyemmerstedt.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/screenshot-2017-04-29-21-48-37.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is not something I\u0027m forcing you or anything, this is all up to you if you\u0027re feeling like you would like to help me to get there!\u003cbr\u003e\nBut all I can say, either way, if you\u0027re supporting just to support or to get access to the rewards, you have my heart even if you\u0027re supporting just even the smallest way that will take me a step closer to that one day. either way and I will make sure to succeed with struggle and practice.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you want to support but cannot, it\u0027s okay, my friend, cause you have my heart either way.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe monthly skype chat is a way for me to thank you personally and we have the opportunity to learn to know each other if you want and spend a little time to share words, feelings, thoughts about anything what we want to get out or just to say hi and see how it goes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo all I can say now is ... thank you and let the journey begin.\u003cbr\u003e\nYou\u0027re going to see me, the newbie, and my skills from the start, maybe not the most pleasant to get access to the rewards, all the fails and ups and downs .. BUT through this you will see me grow and through time you will get better quality of characters, detailed, cooler and more advanced paintings."
