    "summary": "My name is Jules Blok and for the past year I\u0027ve worked on Revive in my spare time next to my full-time job. I quit my job over a year ago to focus on VR development, using the Patreon funds I can work part-time on Revive without needing to take another full-time job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Revive?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/LibreVR/Revive\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRevive brings Oculus-exclusive VR games to the HTC Vive.\u003c/a\u003e Over the past year Revive has achieved compatibility with most Oculus games, in some cases bringing nearly native quality support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon I can get a monthly income without having to spend time looking for freelancing jobs. But the main goal is to just cover the costs of developing Revive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will also earn rewards. I\u0027ll write monthly progress reports full of technical details on the latest challenges facing Revive for Patrons. And you can also join Discord to chat with me and other Patrons. If you donate more than $10 a month you can also join me on the voice channels every month to discuss the latest progress or just talk about VR in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you use the money for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first priority is to ensure good compatibility for the latest games, so far I\u0027ve spent more than $500 on Oculus Home to test games on Revive. Your money would go towards buying new releases every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe performance of Revive varies from one game to the other, mainly due to each\n game using the Oculus Runtime in slightly different ways. \nPerfecting this part of a compatibility layer like Revive is the most \ndifficult part and requires a lot of research.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far I\u0027ve done all research into the Oculus Runtime on an Oculus Rift DK2 that is literally falling apart. So the money that is left every month from buying games would go towards buying an Oculus Rift CV1 headset.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, if we reach the last milestone on Patreon I will invest $3,500 to join the Khronos Group as an Associate Member and help shape the \u003ca href=\"https://www.khronos.org/openxr\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOpenXR standard\u003c/a\u003e. By joining the Khronos Group I can represent your interests to help ensure that the next generation of VR headsets will have a truly open standard. However, since this standard is being developed behind closed doors; progress on OpenXR cannot be discussed in the monthly progress report.\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat other side projects are you working on?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy working on computer graphics related projects: In my spare time I work on projects such as the Dolphin Emulator and the engine behind the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game series. To keep myself motivated I will also be spending some time on these projects instead of Revive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, it will take a while before these projects will see a VR version. For the Dolphin Emulator we need to wait until OpenXR has been released. For S.T.A.L.K.E.R. I will first work on implementing an optimized Vulkan backend before attempting to add VR to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I make no promises regarding these projects and they are specifically not what you\u0027re pledging for.\u003cbr\u003e"
