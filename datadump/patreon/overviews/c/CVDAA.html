    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat is CVDAA?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCastro Valley Dramatic Arts Academy is a non-profit theatre academy dedicated to bringing performance based dramatic arts to local youth. The mission of the Academy is\u00a0to use the study and practice of dramatic theater, film, and television as an opportunity to encourage and promote the development of creative thinking in young people. In doing so we hope to transform the way students think about themselves and the world. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the years we have worked with classes of elementary through college students, and currently have four workshops going for middle schoolers and high schoolers. We hope to bring back our elementary programs, expand the reach of our middle school and high school programs, and develop additional specialized classes for all ages, such as improv, film, dance, etc.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince our inception it has been our policy that we have never, and will never refuse a student based on financial need, as it is important to us that all members of the community have easy access to quality theatrical exposure and education. This policy is at the core of our organization\u0027s mission to maintain an accessible creative outlet for youth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eOur Goals\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, CVDAA has 2 big goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOur main goal is acquiring our own theatre. CVDAA is currently without a resident home, and as room rental for our current working spaces are rising. As we expand and more and more students find us, it is becoming apparent to us that we are outgrowing the location. As such, we are in the process of finding a bigger and better space to call our own.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnother goal of ours is to hire on a full theatrical staff. Currently, our teachers are responsible for organizing costumes, props, backstage management, production management, administrative duties, and lighting and sound design. These duties are usually individually paid positions within a production company and, while the director will have input in all aspects of a production, it is highly uncommon for all of these roles to be placed upon the director. Hiring a full staff would allow for a more immersive experience for our students, putting them in an environment more similar to what they would find in the professional stage theatre world. It would also move much of the technical production burden off of our teachers so they can take more time to work with the students on technique and artistic direction.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere You Come In\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a non-profit, we are highly dependent on individual contributions to survive and flourish. Unfortunately, in order to run an organization with non-conditional financial aid, it is essential that we make money elsewhere. The good news is that, by supporting us through our Patreon page, you get a behind-the-scenes look at all the goings-on with every production. In addition, at higher donation levels, we offer some incredible benefits including season passes and reserved seating at our shows, personal thank you notes from students, and even dinner with CVDAA President and Director Michael Lushington. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour donations are essential in providing scholarships to those students in need and allowing the program to develop through program expansion (like allowing us to hire more teachers).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
