Fighting alongside those who are underserved, and nurturing our future human rights advocates with the tools they need to be the best they can be, is what I have been doing in various ways for as long as I can remember.\u00a0I have over 20 years worth of hands-on experience in championing and transforming the rights and lives of courageous individuals and communities, via NGOs, non-profits and community-based organisations, academia, the private sector, international organisations such as the UN, social entrepreneurship, and independent consulting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have worked for non-governmental organisations like Amnesty International, the International Commission of Jurists, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions, the International Service for Human Rights, and others. These days I run my own social enterprise focused on human rights, called the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://globalhumanrightsgroup.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGlobal Human Rights Group\u003c/a\u003e (more on that below) where we run pro-bono and not-just-for-profit projects to help grassroots human rights activists take their issues to the UN in a way that achieves real change, and we create an experiential learning environment for up-and-coming human rights advocates to hone their skills so as to enhance their impact in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an admitted and practising lawyer, with a law degree (with honours) from Australia, and graduate degrees in international law and human rights from the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. I also have an undergraduate degree in International Relations and Development Studies, and have studied numerous diploma-style courses along the way (including in human rights, advocacy, litigation, and human resources). I am also an authorised coach and facilitator, which supports my work in mentoring and nurturing advocates, change-makers and leaders. And, I used to work in academia as a lecturer, clinical law professor, and research fellow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have published widely on international human rights law, including a book on the impact the Olympic Games has on housing rights, another book on the Right to Health, a book about the Right to Food, and numerous journal articles. I have worked for many years as an expert consultant for the United Nations, in particular doing investigative human rights field missions and training governments and civil society about human rights and the UN. I\u0027ve done this work in over 35 countries. I\u0027ve won awards for my human rights work (for example from the Law Institute of Victoria, in Australia, and the French Government). Before I started my own organisation I was the Special Advisor to the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (and former President of Ireland), the Hon. Mary Robinson. I\u0027ve also spent years working as the legal advisor to the former UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, writing his reports to the General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council, and going on missions around the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I have the human rights credentials and legitimacy! I do good work, and I work hard. The work I do makes a difference to the lives of real people and real communities. Now to explain what this work is ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2012 I set up a non-profit organisation called the Global Human Rights Clinic. It\u0027s now part of a social enterprise called the Global Human Rights Group, along with the not-just-for-profit consulting firm, the Global Human Rights Consultants. Due to health issues, I\u0027ve not been able to build the consulting work much over the last couple of years, but nonetheless have a long-track record with clients ranging from national and international NGOs, National Human Rights Institutions, UN experts, and multilateral organisations including parts of the United Nations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027m most proud of is the work we have been doing in the Global Human Rights Clinic. There we\u00a0aim to provide opportunities for students, recent graduates and new practitioners to gain hands-on practical experience in real human rights work, while we work with grassroots human rights defenders to help them access the United Nations human rights mechanisms and get real impactful outcomes for their issues of concern. This has a dual track effect -- we are able to help build capacity and the impact of the human rights work that others are doing, and we are developing the next generation of human rights leaders, both at the same time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI talk in the video about some examples of projects we\u0027ve been working on lately. It\u0027s real stuff, impacting real people. We\u00a0work with world leaders and grassroots activists to progress social justice issues that end up impacting on your local community. Sometimes we work behind-the-scenes more hush-hush ways to ensure some of the most important human rights issues get addressed at the top levels in the UN. Something I don\u0027t mention in the video is the fact that to-date I have taken on over 20 interns as \u0026#8220;apprentices\u0026#8221; to train into awesome world-changing human rights advocates (at a personal cost of about USD$50K over a period of 18 months). They are now out in the world expanding this impact through well-placed jobs in decision-making capacities, impacting change that has been informed through their real work with us. In my work I\u0026#8217;m always mentoring and coaching these existing and future leaders and change-makers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy I need your help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me be really honest - right now, things are really really tight. I know some of you are in a similar situation. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy work as a human rights advocate has not been paying well for the last few years. Honestly, it\u0026#8217;s not been paying anything and I\u0026#8217;ve been going backwards fast. While you\u0026#8217;ve been thinking about whether you can afford to save for your next holiday, I\u0026#8217;ve been stressing about how to keep the electricity on and when I can next buy basic groceries. I know the work I do can earn money, and I am working on building up those income streams. It has earned good money in the past. Right now, I need your help to get back to a place where I can earn money on my own doing this work, because the time it takes to build an income needs to be funded! For the last few years I\u0026#8217;ve been struggling with illness + too many unexpected hiccups to make headway, but now I finally feel like I\u0026#8217;m on track, ready and able to continue my work in the world and make a huge difference. I just need your helping hand to pull me up and keep pushing me along, to help me see the sunshine!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI need help paying rent, keeping the electricity on, buying basic groceries, and paying for the internet connection. I need help to pay for our website hosting, to ensure I have clean and presentable clothes to wear, to buy paper for the printer, and to pay stipends for interns. I need to be supported during the time it takes me to write funding proposals, and I need help to pay Geneva\u0026#8217;s insane taxes, and to pay the fines on the overdue bills I\u0026#8217;ve not yet paid. Honestly, right now I need your help to feed, clothe and house myself. This is not a situation I want to be in, but it is the truth. I know I can turn this around, with your help. The need and desire to keep doing this is still just as strong as ever, and I know that I am uniquely placed to do this work - nurturing amazing human rights advocates through mentoring, teaching, training, advising, and helping others to access the corridors of power where their issues need to be heard. I want to give you the opportunity to come along for the ride and do this work with me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy plan is that as I dig myself out of this funding and income slump, I will be able to expand my work and your support will no longer go into sustaining my ability to live, but will be channelled into expanding the work of the Global Human Rights Clinic \u0026#8212; paying stipends to interns to have the opportunity to learn and develop the amazing work they do in their home countries, offering our pro-bono and subsidised legal services to those in need, and producing information and resources that will shape policies and change hearts and minds. I want to take your support and multiply it by sharing it with others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI will regularly update you about how I\u0026#8217;m going, what I\u0026#8217;m doing, and how your contribution is helping. You can stop your support at any time, but hopefully after you see the difference it is making in my life and the lives I\u0026#8217;m able to affect, you will feel confident continuing your support. Once my basic daily needs are met, I will be using your support to expand my work in the world exponentially, through involving others and through growing my non-profit. You can be involved at all stages as much or as little as you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy support me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that many of you look at the news and read your newsfeeds wondering what you can do to make things better -- there are so many bad and distressing news stories it seems like a neverending task, where do you even start? People have been asking me, \u0026#8220;how can I contribute to being the change I want to see in the world?\u0026#8221; And of course the subtext often is (no judgment on my part) \u0026#8220;how do I do this without radically altering my life in too many ways?\u0026#8221; I believe that everyone has their own contribution to make in their own way - some work hard and earn money and love their families and have the financial freedom to support others doing the groundwork, some work hard and don\u0026#8217;t earn much money and have traded having children for the freedom to treat the world as their family and give up financial stability to do the rarely-rewarded groundwork, and others fall somewhere on the spectrum in-between. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy plan to make 2017 better for all of us includes expanding the number of people I help to follow their dreams of contributing to the world, especially those that otherwise would not have such opportunities.\u00a0I want to help you make your 2017 a great year by giving you a chance to share this journey, and make your own contribution (whatever the size or the shape) to improving the world around you. I\u0026#8217;m asking for your support so that together we can make a difference. This is a simple way you can make a really important contribution, get feedback on what\u0026#8217;s happening, and see real results. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSponsoring me through becoming a Patron is a way for you to show your support for me and the work I do in the world, and for you to follow along and share in the successes as they happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the most most important aspects of this is \u003cem\u003ecommunity\u003c/em\u003e \u0026#8212; I can\u0026#8217;t do it alone, and I know so many people want to be a part of changing the world in their own way.

However much you feel comfortable with pledging! Honestly, I will appreciate any and every bit of support you can give. I have a regular donation to Kiva (micro-loans) set up where I give $25 per month and I find that even when the budget is super tight, this is do-able. I think of it as one meal out a month which I\u0027m happy to sacrifice for the change that it can bring to others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrankly speaking, monthly donations of $20-30 or more are going to be the most helpful for me. That\u0027s not to say that the smaller amounts are not going to help, but the larger amounts will allow me to spend more time working on human rights and less time trying to get more and more patrons to help pay my daily expenses! That said, if you can only afford $1-15 \u003cem\u003eplease please please\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0still pledge this and I will love you forever! It will all add up, of that I am sure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e200 pledges of $20 per month will bring $4,000 -- this is my goal and what would enable me to live, pay the rent (office and home), cover the basic overheads, and pay an intern a small stipend. This would have me 100% full-time focused on human rights and changing the world, and not losing sleep about how to pay the next small bill. I\u0027d still be worried about the big bills, but hey, aren\u0027t we all?!

Quick answer, no. Longer answer, but maybe it could be but probably unlikely. Full answer ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour sponsorship / pledge / patronage / donation (whatever you want to call it) through this page is \u003cem\u003enot \u003c/em\u003etax deductible, sorry. But what it will do is give me the freedom to work on things like getting our application for charity status and tax deductibility filed for the Global Human Rights Clinic! So you\u0027re getting us one step closer. If, once we\u0027ve got that tax deductible status, you want to stop giving to me and start giving to the tax deductible charity, that would be awesome! I\u0027ll be updating all my Patreon supporters about my progress on this front.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, keep in mind, when we do get tax deductible status in Swissyland, where our organisation is based, that will only be relevant for those who pay taxes in this jurisdiction. Unfortunately, that won\u0027t help a lot of you. So we will be setting up the NGO in other countries also - Australia and New Zealand are first on our list as we\u0027ve been doing a lot of work with people in these countries. Obviously, the US also makes sense ... but to do all of this I need time to work on it, which means, you guessed it, money to allow me to do this. So, support me now, keep in the know via my updates, and as soon as you can switch your support to a tax deductible way that helps you out a little while helping me, I\u0027ll be the first to encourage you to do so!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eI would really appreciate it if you could share this page. \u003cbr\u003eEvery little bit helps!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
