Creating these artifacts, jewelry, and goods that adorn your persons and energize your spaces is perhaps the most rewarding \"job\" I\u0027ve ever had. It\u0027s what I \u003cem\u003eshould \u003c/em\u003ebe doing every day and I\u0027m going to make it happen, and you can help! By just pitching in a couple bucks a month you can help me cover the costs of running my sites and buying materials which helps me stress less and create more things! Patreon helps mitigate the risk of starting up a small business full time and help stay above water when sales may be sluggish. The more stable support from patreon each month the more time I can spend making backer content and experimental media.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow I\u0027ve broken down (in descending order) where patreon funds will go each month as well as goals for 2018.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u0027ll join me on this adventure and thank you for everyone past, present, and future, who\u0027ve given support to myself and Galdrecraft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://cmgaldre.com/images/Projects%202018-01.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://galdregrim.com/images/FundsBreakdown-01.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eOh and if Patreon isn\u0027t your thing you can always buy my wares on\u00a0\u003ca target=\"_blank\"\u003egaldrecraft.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethrow me a few bucks via\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://ko-fi.com/cmgaldre\"\u003ehttps://ko-fi.com/cmgaldre\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eor send shop supplies via my wishlist\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://a.co/10PgnyN\"\u003ehttp://a.co/10PgnyN\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr just simply help spread the word via RT and sending friends my way!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
