My current comic is-\u003ca href=\"http://starcrossedcomic.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStar Crossed\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0Creating comics has been a passion of mine since I was very young. I have been doing anime illustration since I was about eight years old. I would draw constantly in class and at recess! I even began my comic creations in the fifth grade where my classmates would pass them around to read. So, it has been a long journey for me with trying to balance life and create more comic stories. I have so many great stories I wish to share. The first one I completed and posted was- \u003ca href=\"http://porcelaindoll.smackjeeves.com/comics/1352108/porcelain-doll/\"\u003ePorcelain Doll\u003c/a\u003e\u2013 through a different website that hosts online comics, Smackjeeves.com. Well, this time around I wanted to create my own comic page after learning how to make my own blog webpage. So, here we are! A little bit more about me- I am engaged to the love of my life, Samuel. We are both juggling school and full-time work while planning our wedding. I am really obsessed with our cats, the ocean, the idea of traveling (because I don\u2019t think I actually travel well\u2026), and other forms of art. I am majoring in Nursing because I am passionate about people\u2026 and I learned I don\u2019t want to do my hobby as my career because I am a brat about doing art for others. That is all folks! If you have any other questions, let me know. thanks!"
