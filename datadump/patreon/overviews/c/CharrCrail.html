    "summary": "Thank you so much for finding your way to my Patreon page.  I\u2019m up to a lot of stuff in the world of art and photography. \u00a0I think I\u0027m a hybrid of sorts. \u00a0:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all started in second grade with Show \u0026amp; Tell.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOn one particular day I walked shyly up to the front of the class holding the big beautiful starfish my parents had given me. It was a pivotal moment I think because I never forgot the richness of sharing something I thought was beautiful and hearing the appreciative ahhhh\u0027s and seeing the fascinated faces of my classmates.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMy love for Show \u0026amp; Tell never dissipated. \u00a0In fact I\u2019ve made a career of it as a photographer-- photojournalist to be more precise\u2014 getting work published and seen in all manner of publications worldwide.  It\u2019s been a wonderful career too but things change. \u00a0I\u0027m making more art and shifting deeper more into the digital realm, working with mobile devices.\u003cbr\u003eFrom photography to line drawings for coloring I\u2019m having a creative expansion unparalleled thanks to the tools devices like my iPhone and iPad offer.   I have become \"creatively insatiable\" (I even registered the hashtag #). Using extraordinary apps I shoot or import photos from my vast collection.  I shoot photos of people, places and things.  I use apps to edit them, alter them, draw, create hybrids and make videos including the process.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAs a constant experimenter I\u0027m always finding and trying out new apps. \u00a0I\u0027m often astonished by apps I discover and experiment with, always searching for the next great one. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOn the side I teach Adobe Photoshop and content development using mobile devices. I love to teach and inspire people around accessing their own profound creativity. Here on my Patreon feed I\u0027ll show you my works, give you insight in how I created them as well as my thought process going through the experience. You\u0027ll get a true insight into an artists mind and maybe it will inspire you to play and try new things too. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAs things are shifting in my life I\u2019m grateful for Patreon and the people who are here and supporting artists.  One of my goals here is to keep expanding what I do and the tools I do it with.  Technology is moving so fast and keeping up is challenging!\u003cbr\u003eI hope to have the opportunity to share my voice through sharing art, photography and more with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
