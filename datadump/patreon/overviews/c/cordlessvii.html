    "summary": "My channel, CordlessVII, fully consists of Fallout 4 videos and is centered around a settlement building community that I have been creating which I\u0027m truly proud of. I post videos of my own settlement tours, build tutorials, tips and tricks, mod reviews, and also reviews of settlement builds submitted to me by my viewers. The community is one of the most important aspects to me which is why I created a Discord server called Vault VII. It\u0027s a place where Fallout gamers, settlement builders, YouTubers, and mod creators can all interact with each other, show-off their creations, swap ideas, and most importantly become apart of a community of great people who all share a common ground.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have created this Patreon for a couple of reasons. The main one being the amount of requests I\u0027ve had for it which I\u0027m truly grateful for. I cannot express the amount of appreciation I have for those of you who have been wanting to support me and my content. It\u0027s unreal. The other reason is because I\u0027ve found true passion in what I\u0027m doing and want to see how far I can take it. CordlessVII wouldn\u0027t be what it is without the support I\u0027ve gotten from the community so far and broadening that support will allow it to grow even further with more videos, more content, more giving back to the community, and more time and energy put into it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am going to be creating a second channel very soon that will be a platform for me to branch out into other types of videos such as: different video games, playing with a group, maybe some live streaming, and really anything that happens in my life that I want to make a video on even if it doesn\u0027t pertain to video games. I have endless ideas for videos that I would like to explore, but I don\u0027t want to take away from my current channel. All of my videos with CordlessVII have been of Fallout 4 and I understand that most of my viewers have subscribed to me because of that which is why I do not want to overwhelm my current channel with videos that do not relate. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I am still going to put the same amount of energy and effort into CordlessVII. The community has finally grown to where I\u0027ve wanted it to be and I finally feel comfortable with the style of videos I\u0027ve been creating. So, CordlessVII isn\u0027t slowing down or going anywhere. It\u0027s just beginning!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to everyone who has been following me thus far and thank you to everyone who supports everything I\u0027m doing. You all have added a huge sense of purpose in my life which I\u0027ll never forget.\u003cbr\u003e"
