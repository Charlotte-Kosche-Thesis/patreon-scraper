    "summary": "Hi I\u0027m Cait and I\u0027m your mom now. I may already be your mom if you are my gecko or if you are like... most of Twitter. I post a lot of selfies and make A LOT of snarky jokes about the guys who hit on me on dating apps but I am also very proud of you and hope you\u0027re having a great day.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am going through a lot of changes in my life right now: I\u0027m single for the first time in years, I quit my job, I\u0027m getting ready to move to Austin and eventually Los Angeles. It\u0027s wild waking up in the morning and realizing your entire life is something different than it was just a few months ago. It\u0027s scary as hell, but also freeing. And exciting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe one thing that\u0027s always been a constant for me is Twitter. I love getting to know people personally or anonymously on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://curiouscat.me/Chaeronaea/post/188974515\"\u003eCuriousCat\u003c/a\u003e, talking honestly about my mental illnesses, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/chaeronaea/status/893298242024333312\"\u003esharing my online dating experiences\u003c/a\u003e with my followers. It\u0027s honestly amazing to me to have so many people who genuinely care about me, that I can care about in return.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA bunch of yall have asked me to start a Patreon, and it\u0027s been hard because I don\u0027t really think of myself as someone who \u003cem\u003emakes\u003c/em\u003e stuff? So I asked myself - if I had more money, and more time, how would I want to spend that time?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027d want to spend it with you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy contributing to my monthly Patreon, you\u0027re not just supporting me as I build a new life for myself. You\u0027re also funding more dating adventure (and disaster) stories, more Disney Princess photo shoots, more regular photo shoots, more CuriousCat advice for you and more access to me. I might blog a little bit on Patreon, I might set up a Google Voice number so I can text you and tell you you\u0027re doing a great job, WHICH YOU ARE. I\u0027ll definitely share dating stories that are too rowdy for Twitter. If I make enough to start being able to spend even more time on this, I\u0027ll livestream CuriousCat questions, makeup lessons, video games, comforting Mom ASMR, whatever the people want.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut mostly, like, what I do with this is up to you. You asked for this: what should we do? I came up with some backer levels, but if there\u0027s something you\u0027d like to see that\u0027s not on here, I\u0027m going to have special discussion threads with my backers so we can all figure this out together.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks, I love you all. (Maybe not level 8 orgasm guy though)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI love you and make sure you eat a good breakfast,\u003cbr\u003e\nMom\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
