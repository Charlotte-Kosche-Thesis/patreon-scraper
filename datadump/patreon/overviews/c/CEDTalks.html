I\u0027m the president of CAP Media Group, Voice of the SCG Tour, host of the #CEDTalks podcast, and lover of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eBut Really...Who Are You?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Cedric Phillips! I\u0027m a 31 year old from Strongsville, Ohio who loves Magic: The Gathering, professional wrestling, NBA basketball, and listening to pop punk loudly. So let\u0027s break those down since they\u0027re all very different!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Magic, I have a Pro Tour Top 8 (PT Kyoto \u002709), two Grand Prix Top 8s (GP Columbus \u002704 and GP Boston-Worcester \u002712), two State championships victories , one Regional championship victory, ninth place at US Nationals, and twelve PTQ victories. I was a Gold level pro for a little under two years before I willingly took myself off of the Pro Tour to pursue other goals in life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been watching professional wrestling weekly for over fifteen years. I find it to be one of the purest forms of entertainment when done well. My favorite wrestlers are AJ Styles, CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, Kevin Owens, The New Day, and The Revival (trust me when I say there are many more). More than anything, professional wrestling allows me to remember my childhood and how I once broke my bed by performing a delayed vertical suplex on a pillow. Yeah...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNBA basketball is my favorite sport by a wide margin. My favorite teams are the Cleveland Cavaliers, Golden State Warriors, and Sacramento Kings, in that order. My favorite basketball players currently are Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, and Kevin Love, again, in that order. My favorite basketball player of all time is Chris Webber, who, oddly enough, played his last game on my birthday. I read about the NBA daily, probably know every player on every roster, and am a successful NBA Daily Fantasy Sports player.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy favorite genre of music is pop-punk and has been since I was sixteen years old. My friend in high school gave me Leaving Through The Window by Something Corporate and One For The Kids by Yellowcard and the rest is history. My favorite bands are New Found Glory, Paramore, and Yellowcard, in that order (I\u0027ve used that phrase a lot).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere. Now you actually know who I am. Happy?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat Is CEDTalks?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCEDTalks is the podcast I do with my friends to maintain my sanity. Sometimes I talk about Magic with Patrick Sullivan. Sometimes I talk about professional wresting with Joey Bags. Sometimes I talk about the NBA with Patrick Sullivan and Joey Bags. Most recently, I talk to myself about whatever is on my mind so that I can listen to it years from now and remember what my life was like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhy Should I Become A Patron Of CEDTalks?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of people asked me if I\u0027m ever going to have a Patreon so I made one. If you like what I do, I appreciate it more than I can type in this box. If you want to become a Patron (branding!), I appreciate it even more. At the end of the day, I do CEDTalks so I can get out what I\u0027m feeling on a daily/weekly basis. If I didn\u0027t, I\u0027d probably go insane!\u003cbr\u003e"
