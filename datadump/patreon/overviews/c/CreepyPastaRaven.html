    "summary": "Hey there, I see you found your way to my patreon page. First allow me to say thank you for taking the time to take a look at my page, I greatly appreciate it. Secondly if you are new here let me introduce myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Creepy Raven you may also know me as Creepypasta Raven, I\u0027m a teller of scary stories on Youtube and in the past five years I have had the absolute pleasure of getting to meet many many awe inspiring people. I\u0027ve worked with talented voice actors, creators, musicians and more importantly fans. People who have continued to show great and ever growing amounts of support for what I do and love, but the best thing out of all of this is I get to create something for people to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube has been both a hobby,a job, and a passion for me over the years and it\u0027s something I don\u0027t particularly wish to have to stop doing but sadly with the current state that YouTube is in I feel that one day I will have to make the tough decision to call it quits, but it\u0027s because of YouTube that I have been able to meet so many awesome people, I\u0027ve been able to learn and grow with the help of people like you guys. I\u0027ve been able to break out of my shell and stop being this extremely shy person, who was to afraid to even post his first video that it took him over a month to upload it. I love creating for you guys and would honestly never want to take anything away from you and I\u0027m not about to hold my content hostage. That\u0027s not the kind of person I am nor wish to be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe past few years have been a wild ride, that you all have been a part of you\u0027ve seen my ups and downs. You\u0027ve seen me at my best and at my worst. I want to continue this wonderful journey with you guys but with YouTube\u0027s changes this is making things very difficult, Ads aren\u0027t being placed on videos that are deemed inappropriate and as you can guess horror themed content is being targeted heavily. I rely on YouTube for even that small amount of income so I can do things where I get to meet not only you guys but also friends of old and friends that will soon be new.\u00a0I debated for a long while about if this should be made or not because I like to feel that I\u0027m doing this for you and I want this to always be for free. I don\u0027t like making people feel like they need to pay me for doing something I enjoy, if anything it honestly feels like I owe you guys for all the wonderful memories you\u0027ve given me over the years, however in regards to YouTube\u0027s changes this has become a bit more challenging and a small degree of help is needed. But rest assured even if I struggle even if all seems like it will fall through I\u0027m still going to try my best to entertain you guys, because if it wasn\u0027t for you I wouldn\u0027t be where nor who I am today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for you help and your time.\u003cbr\u003eAnd as always guys\u003cbr\u003eStay safe and Take care.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
