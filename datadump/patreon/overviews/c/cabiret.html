    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS CABIRET\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eCaBiRet is a bisexual cabaret night performed by members of the bisexual community in London, UK. It bills itself as \"an evening of the bisexual variety\", currently runs twice a year (we\u0027re hoping your help will change that) and was created in 2016 by long-time bisexual activist Marcus Morgan. It\u0027s a unique chance for bisexual people to see acts drawn from the community, tackling themes that address their own lives and struggles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far we\u0027ve had poets, comedians, musicians, spoken-word readings, and the host is also a magician. And all of them put their bisexuality at the heart of their work on our stage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWAIT? BISEXUAL? IS THIS A KINKY THING?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eN..no, no. Why would you? Uh, okay. Bisexuality is often misunderstood - it\u0027s not about sex. The definition most of the UK bi community uses is the Bisexual Index Definition: \"bisexuality is attraction to more than one gender\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe evening is not a sex performance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIT\u0027S NOT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, capital letters. It\u0027s not. That said, ahem, it is likely that some of the performance will be frankly discussing sexuality. And the language is certainly adult at times. See, we\u0027re not just celebrating how great it is to be bisexual - some of the time we\u0027re venting our bi-furious sides too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY DO YOU NEED BACKERS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCaBiRet was set up to run for no profit. It\u0027s a free event. We have a collection each time which is split between bisexual community causes, but none of the money raised is used for producing the event. Costs like advertising and materials for the night have so far been covered by Marcus. And the acts are not paid to perform.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://mischiefmental.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/march2017stars.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s a bad idea though. People \u003cem\u003eshould \u003c/em\u003ebe paid for their time, effort, rehearsal, travel, costumes, props, and so on. Currently if  one of our performers has to drop out we\u0027d struggle to find a replacement short notice as we couldn\u0027t even afford to pay bus fare.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe want to keep the evening free to attend.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe want 100% of the collection to go to the community.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSo we need backers to pay the performers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY MONTHLY AND NOT PER SHOW?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently we run two shows per year. If we ask for \u0027per show\u0027 that means you could pledge now, feeling flush, and not see any deduction for up to six months. Who knows how affordable that\u0027d be when the show rolled around?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what if we \u003cem\u003e*whisper it*\u003c/em\u003e went to 3x, or more?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA monthly pledge allows us to keep a better track of our predicted income, reduces bounced payments, and lets you keep on top of how much you\u0027re helping us.\u00a0Move your pledge up or down, that\u0027s cool too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd come to CaBiRet, it\u0027s free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOKAY - WHEN IS IT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next is in March 2018, just in time for Marcus\u0027s birthday. It\u0027s on Sunday the 4th:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/events/752748044921459\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO I GET FOR BACKING YOU?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone who backed us in the time since the last show gets listed on the Patreon poster at our shows, regardless of amount pledged. As the amount you can contribute grows, so does our thanks and your rewards. Membership cards, input into the shows, discounted merch, and even shout-outs from on stage!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe haven\u0027t finished deciding what all the rewards will be, this is a new area for us. Once you\u0027ve pledged you can join in the discussion to shape what we offer.
