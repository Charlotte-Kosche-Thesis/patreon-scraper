Something amazing happens when you make traditional art work, there\u0027s a level of intimacy and permanence. The cuts from carving a block, the stains on your jeans from inks, the lingering chemical taste from when you drink paint water instead of tea, there\u0027s something special about having made something with your own hands, about the lingering physical evidence that you created something.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I can keep working on traditional woodblocks and watercolors, in an increasingly digital world. You support means I can spend more and more time making art, own a dedicated studio space (instead of trying to use my bathroom as a dark room for screen printing), and one day, not need a day job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what\u0027s in it for you?

I have ideas, and an awesome writer who\u0027s always wanted to write a comic, the issues is time. Retail jobs have a habit of adding a lot of stress, and eating up a lot of time what with having to show up to them and stand there being a cashier.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStretch goals are awesome dreams to work toward in the long run, but I can\u0027t thank the folks who contribute to my Patreon, the folks who buy a think or two from my shop, and even you! Yes you! For taking sometime to read about me, it means so much to have your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Alex D.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
