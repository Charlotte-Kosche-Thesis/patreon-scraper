    "summary": "Hi, everyone. If you\u2019re here\nat all, you probably already know me pretty well; for those who don\u2019t, you can\ncall me either Carolly or Don. I\u2019m a\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003egenderfluid trans queer feminist activist\u003c/strong\u003e, which right away, sort of limits my job\nprospects, whatever they tell you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m also a Type 1 Diabetic and a\nmoderate-to-severe sufferer of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, on top of mild\nTourette\u2019s and a few other things; we\u2019d be here a while if I actually listed\nall of my issues in detail. Suffice to say, all taken together, it makes me\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003emore or less\nconventionally-unemployable, but not so much that I can collect disability\u003c/strong\u003e; our society still isn\u2019t really great at defining\nthat.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt also means that\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003emy medical expenses\nare pretty extensive\u003c/strong\u003e, and\nthat\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI can\u2019t really afford insurance;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ethe words\n\u201cpre-existing medical condition\u201d\u003c/strong\u003etend\nto come up at this point.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course, that\u2019s not to say that I\u2019m unemployed.\nAs many of you are aware, I work as a freelance journalist under contract\n(which means\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI can\u2019t get insured that way\u003c/strong\u003e, either.) While the way I\u2019m compensated for that is both\nrelatively complicated and not my place to divulge, in broad strokes, I\u2019m paid\nfor the number of views my work receives divided by the number of articles I\u2019ve\nwritten in a given week. Given that I\u2019m not really an established name or\nworking for a major publication,\u003cstrong\u003ethat\u2019s not usually a very high number\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course, I could increase it by writing more of\nwhat we call \u201cbuzz-worthy\u201d articles and less of what we might call \u201cactual\nnews\u201d \u2013 I could probably increase it significantly by working for one of those\nsites that pumps out mindless, bare-bones, un-fact-checked content; writing\nso-called \u201cthinkpieces\u201d is relatively simple for me.\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u2019s not how I\nwant to earn a living, though\u003c/strong\u003e; and it means less time for my activism, on Twitter and\nelsewhere, as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOh, and I get some donations from amazing folks like you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here today; right now, I\u2019m barely\nmanaging month-to-month with help from friends and family, and I\u2019m living in a\nroom smaller than some closets I\u2019ve owned to do it. I don\u2019t want to compromise\nmy own sense of ethics, but ethics and eating have to meet somewhere in the\nmiddle, and\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI can\u2019t keep on like this forever\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo here\u2019s the plea\u003c/strong\u003e. If you like what I do, if you want me to keep doing it and\nexpand my efforts,\u003cstrong\u003eI kind of need your help\u003c/strong\u003e; help to pay medical bills, to buy food, to get myself\nliving somewhere better for my mental health. Some days my mental and emotional\nstate keeps me from doing much of anything, and not having a place of my own is\na big factor in that;\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI need a space to myself\u003c/strong\u003e, to be myself in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo,\u003cstrong\u003eif you have the ability and would like to\nhelp me keep doing what I\u2019m doing\u003c/strong\u003e, please do so; every little bit counts for a lot, and quite\nlikely, extends my lifespan;\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ebeing forced to cut back on medical supplies for lack of funds\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eisn\u2019t\nexactly healthy. When and if I\u2019m able, I\u2019ll pay it forward, to others who need\nhelp too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd yeah, I\u0027ll try to find ways to give back to my supporters too, above and beyond what I usually do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo. No matter what, I\u2019m going to keep doing my\nvery best, for myself and for all of you. If I can, I\u2019m going to keep expanding\nmy efforts as much as possible. I was, quite honestly, given a gift, and\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI want to use it to\nmake a difference in the world!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFor that, I need your help.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
