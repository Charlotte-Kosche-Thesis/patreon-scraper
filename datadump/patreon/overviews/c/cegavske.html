I\u0027m so excited that you\u0027ve found my Patreon page and are interested joining this community of fans. With your pledge, you will be getting an exclusive, behind the scenes look at production and access to film clips that are for your eyes only!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love animating and making puppets and sets. Your pledges, so far, pay for a lot of the supplies for the sets and puppets. While I am able to do much of the work on this film myself, I do need to hire some talented people to help me with the animation and live action scenes and create things like sound and music. When we get the monthly pledges over the $2000 mark, I will be able to do that. Thank you to all of my patrons for your interest in my project! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo learn more about this project, please visit \u003ca href=\"http://christianecegavske.com/seedinthesand.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://christianecegavske.com/seedinthesand.html\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
