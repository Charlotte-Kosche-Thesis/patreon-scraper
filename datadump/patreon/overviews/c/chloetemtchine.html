For example, if you wanted to contribute a dollar per video and I release three videos a month, then you\u2019d be spending three dollars a month. Participating in Patreon is a way for Patrons, such as yourselves, to support artists. You basically give me money so that I can create more content for YOU! YOU are technically my record company. Your contributions can range anywhere from a dollar to a million dollars! He he he :-) Don\u2019t worry because if I have a very productive and creative month\u00a0 you can always set a monthly cap so that you\u2019ll never be paying more than the amount you\u0027re comfortable with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I will be doing with your contributions: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Creating more music videos/ content for you.\u003cbr\u003e- Using the proceeds for touring so that I can come see you!\u003cbr\u003e- Financing the production, mixing and mastering of my original music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you will get:\u003cbr\u003e-access to my Patreon-only feed\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-free downloads/ mp3s of my original music and covers\u003cbr\u003e-private videos for your eyes only\u003cbr\u003e-a free copy of my book (coming soon)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can cancel anytime!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether or not you decide to contribute financially, I am truly appreciative of all of your support. Thank you so much for being part of my universe!"

     "about": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eTo paraphrase what Amy Carlberg wrote in Bust Magazine, Chloe Temtchine, with supermodel looks, intoxicating sex appeal, and a sultry, soulful voice, would not look out of place on the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine, with the possible exception of the breathing tubes that she must use, even while performing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChloe Temtchine was rushed to the emergency room due to congestive right-heart failure on March 4, 2013. After having been misdiagnosed for five years by some of the most respected and acclaimed medical practitioners and institutions in NYC, she was finally diagnosed with severe Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). Misdiagnosis did not simply alter her life; it shook it to its core. However, the real story is not what happened as a result of the diagnosis; it\u0027s what happened afterwards. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust over a year after being handed a devastating diagnosis, Chloe debuted her song, \u201cBe Brave,\u201d which she wrote shortly after being released from the critical care unit, about making the choice to live despite life\u2019s challenges. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cBe Brave,\u201d available on iTunes, has been adopted by the PH community as its anthem, and pharmaceutical companies have shipped in excess of 120,000 copies to their clients. Chloe donates 50% of the song\u2019s proceeds to support the Pulmonary Hypertension Association (PHA) and its mission of finding a cure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmy Carlberg of BUST Magazine noted: \u201cThe title of the song reminds us of the splendid courage it takes to live day to day with a disease or a disability. The song is twangy and energetic, and springboards off the bluegrass and banjo-laden sounds that have been ruling the pop charts. Chloe Temtchine is a role model for all women, but especially those with severe illnesses, showing that it\u0027s still possible to go after the life you love.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJeffrey Hayzlett, primetime TV host and star of Bloomberg\u2019s C Suite, said: \u201cChloe Temtchine\u2019s story is so moving, and her talent in the face of all obstacles is nothing short of amazing.\u201d \u003cbr\u003eYouTube sensation, award-winning singer/songwriter, recipient of the PHA inaugural 2014 Chloe Temtchine Be Brave Award and the Tom Lantos Innovation in Community Service Award, and a passionate advocate of the Pulmonary Hypertension Research and Diagnosis Act of 2014, NYC-based Chloe Temtchine is fiercely committed to bringing awareness to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) via entertainment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe has collaborated with an illustrious group of top songwriters/producers, including Grammy nominee Greg Camp (Smash Mouth), Guy Roche (Christina Aguilera), Toby Gad (Fergie, John Legend), Sasha Skarbek (James Blunt), Duncan Sheik, Marc Nelkin (Corinne Bailey Rae), David Gamson (Meshell Ndegeocello), Andy Marvel (Jessica Simpson), YouTube phenomenons David Choi and Tay Zonday, Maia Sharp (Bonnie Raitt), Pam Sheyne (Christina Aguilera), Richard Harris, Ben Romans (Click Five), Andrew Williams, Michelle Featherstone, Felix McTeigue, Jim Marr and Wendy Page (Hilary Duff), Tim Gordine, Scott Simons\u2026. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMs. Temtchine was recently featured in the Huffington Post; she has performed on \u201cLate Night with David Letterman\u201d alongside recording artist Ne-Yo; she is the voice behind the national commercial celebrating the 100th anniversary of American Express; she has been featured on NY-1 news with \u201cWhere in The Truck is Chloe\"; and she has been on The Nate Berkus Show (NBC). Additionally, she has performed on \u201cFearless Music\u201d (FOX 5), her song \u201cBrand New Day\u201d has been featured on \u201cThe Early Morning Show\u201d (CNN), and she has had songs placed in various TV series and films. Some of her songs are in French and Spanish, as she is tri-lingual. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from raising general public awareness, Chloe\u0027s videos and press reach millions of people, raising funds. Download sales of her single, \"Be Brave,\" resulted in $12,500 in revenue for the PHA within the first 90 days of its release, her \"Chloe PHriendraisers\" have resulted in thousands upon thousands of dollars in donations, including a significant six-figure grantor\u0027s trust for the PHA and a grant for the PHA from the world\u0027s largest and privately-owned rental-car company, Enterprise. She is a fierce advocate and an inspiration to the PH community. \n\u003c/div\u003e",
