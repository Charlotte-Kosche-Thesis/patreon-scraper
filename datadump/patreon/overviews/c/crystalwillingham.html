    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMany thanks and much appreciation to you for visiting my page and supporting my work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll heroes come from someplace, from humble beginnings, from hardship. We watch our favorite heroes overcome desperate circumstances to become stronger, better, faster. Every good hero story tells a little (or a lot) about the hero\u0027s backstory, and riveted, we watch because we know that no matter how bad it is...it WILL get better...and in the end, it\u0027s gonna be GOOD! The backstory - AKA the Origin Story is the nugget of truth we can all relate to. It\u0027s the humanity, the common nature of the struggle that leads to overcoming and eventually to greatness! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it isn\u0027t fiction. We are all the hero in our own life story...even if we don\u0027t realize we are. We all have an Origin Story to tell. We are all on the Hero\u0027s Journey. Still, we are drawn to root for each other in the midst of the struggle, to be inspired by stories of overcoming odds. What the Origin Stories - True Tales of Healing Transformation Series aims to do is reveal that Inner Hero to all of us, to inspire us to become that by simply listening to the stories of others who may be just a few steps ahead of us on the journey (or miles ahead).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach episode of Origin Stories will hopefully inspire you to know that you are more powerful than you ever may have imagined. That you have the stuff to make the changes necessary to heal your life. How will we do this? By sharing the stories of those regular, everyday people who have done it themselves, by sharing their struggles and their triumphs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe guest co-hosts on each episode of Origin Stories are people I admire for their tenacity and commitment to their own healing journey. We are all perpetually on this journey, however, all of my guests have reached a place of triumph over their painful pasts. Many have achieved a superhero quality to their lives as they have awakened their gifts of healing, coaching, being authentic and showing up generally awesome in the world as a lightworker, someone who serves with their unique gifts and talents for the benefit of All. With courage and vulnerability, an open heart and a clear mind, they show up to share their own unique AHA moments along with their transformational wisdom in this funny, crazy, mystical and magical thing we call life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow to participate?\u003cbr\u003eOrigin Stories is currently live streaming on Facebook in The Healer\u0027s Toolkit Group.\u003cbr\u003eThe official Podcast will be launched on SoundCloud and Patreon in 2018\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you feeling the pull to share your Origin Story (all superheroes have one), your Healers Journey, or Your Transformational Wisdom? If you are, shoot me a private message or email for details on how you can join me in this honest heart-centered sharing of each others healing gifts to reach people seeking change, inspiring them to dive deeper into their own healing journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout me:\u003cbr\u003eCrystal is a Whole Life Wellness and Business Consultant, Reiki Master and Bio-Energetic Health Practitioner\u003cbr\u003eShe offers her services at Stellar You Wellness Center in Richland, WA\u003cbr\u003eCrystal loves working with people to assist them in transforming their lives through the consistent daily practice of various bio-energy related habits, thought processes and healing tools.
