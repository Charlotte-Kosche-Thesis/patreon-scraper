    "summary": "The Cult Basilisk project was started to make the public\naware of the possibilities of the future through art. As a child in the 1980\u2019s,\nI assumed I would one day have a robot body. The origins of this conclusion are\nlost to me, but the general idea was I would live forever and eventually deal\nwith non-conventional problems such as the sun blowing up. As I grew up, I put\nthe idea behind me. In 2006 I read Ray Kurzweil\u2019s book \u201cThe Singularity Is\nNear\u201d and it changed my life. My childhood imaginations suddenly seemed within\nreach during my lifetime. All I had to do was wait it out and survive while the\ntechnology improved. However, as time passed I began to consider that the future\nwould not be as pleasant as Kurzweil\u2019s predictions suggested. I then became\naware of Roko\u2019s Basilisk theory, which most arguments against it was why would\na super powerful AI go through all that trouble to make humans immortal and\ntorture them for all eternity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe answer is simple: a human made a machine specifically for\nthis task. It became apparent to me that this AI could be created not only a\npowerful group of elites, but if technology became powerful enough, eventually anyone\nwith a hatred of humanity could build the AI in their garage.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs I lay awake at night with insomnia, I realized the future\nholds many possible outcomes which I feel compelled to share. Whether this was\nreal now, it could be made real.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThough not a visual artist myself I write profusely, filling\nnotebooks with the many ideas that come to me. After some experimentation, I\ndecided comics are the best medium for sharing my stories and searched out and\ncommissioned comic artists to assist.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt this stage, I have plans to publish two unique comics concurrently,\nwith at least one page published every 2-4 weeks. Each title features unique\ncharacters, storylines, and artists, but all three relate to creating hell\nthrough technology. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI believe I could do more but\nthe primary limitation is funding. With support, I can make more people aware\nof the heavens and hells that technology could bring.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you,\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJames Felty\u003cbr\u003e"
