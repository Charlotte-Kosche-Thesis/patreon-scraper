I\u2019ve got all sorts of projects and plans cooking, and Patreon is a great place to get\u00a0a sneak peek at the things brewing in my artistic tea pot, follow along my path, help me continue to do what I love doing, and get some neat rewards along the way. Art isn\u2019t made in a vacuum, and artists can\u2019t (or shouldn\u0027t) survive in one either. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eA little bit about my art:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRecent projects\u003c/strong\u003e: I recently created a series of illustrations for an upcoming poetry collection published by Dover Publications, coming out in February of 2018. And for an entire year straddling 2016 and 2017, I worked on CC:Otherworlds, a cooperative project also hosted on Patreon where the lovely and talented Cislyn Smith and I pulled a prompt from a silly hat and created worlds, stories, and images to each one every fortnight. We then shared (via snail mail and email) those creations to our patrons on our two week schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jDRc7PU.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUpcoming projects\u003c/strong\u003e: I\u2019m currently working on Boneflower, a short fantasy comic about two women and sacrifice--at the time I\u2019m writing this, I have the whole thing scripted and storyboarded, and am inking page 3. My other project is The Dreambook, a surreal visual and poetic exploration of the nighttime cinema of my mind. I\u2019m also always fiddling with other ideas, and delight in following the weird paths my brain leads me on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yn7qGRPl.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see more of my work on my website: clairewhitmore.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to subscribe to my patreon at any of the support levels listed to the side, know that you have my deep, sincere thanks for helping make this possible (I\u2019m currently working part-time at my day job, and income from Patreon helps fund my art supply habit and keep my time available for creating things), and also my deep, sincere excitement that I get to share some of what I do with you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
