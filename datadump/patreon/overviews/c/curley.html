Currently I can be found streaming on Twitch.tv as \"drunkkidsgaming\"\u00a05 nights a week and that is mostly likely how you came to find this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese gaming streaming focus heavily on viewer interaction and I like to boast that we have created the most fun community I\u0027ve ever been a part of. This patreon page was created because I think we can do much much more awesome together. The pie in the sky idea would be to justify spending mostly all my waking hours dedicated to providing entertainment as well as an ecosystem for this sexy little community of nerds to spend all their time and proudly call it their home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you feel like you\u0027ve derived some entertainment, laughs, or companionship within our little slice of the internet (and you have the means) please consider tossing a couple duckets my way to help support my silly dream of making a living creating videos and live streaming video game content.\u00a0Currently all I have time for is the twitch streaming but would love to trade time at my job to time creating polished and edited videos for youtube, running community game nights, setting up servers, organizing livestream events like tournaments and marathon streams, and BEYOND.\u00a0As you\u0027ll see in the milestones, each little bit counts towards allowing me to dedicate more and more time to enhancing our fun together!"
