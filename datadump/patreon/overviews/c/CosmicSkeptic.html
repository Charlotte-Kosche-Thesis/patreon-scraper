It\u0027s very difficult to ensure that I haven\u0027t missed anything of anybody out, and some people have said they do not want me to send anything. (This doesn\u0027t include the book draw, which is still done automatically.)*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho Am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHello to everyone! If you\u0027re here, you probably already know who I am and what I do. My name is Alex J. O\u0027Connor (a.k.a. Cosmic Skeptic) and I regularly create YouTube videos which are dedicated to promoting healthy philosophical, scientific and cultural debate, as well as an online Blog which serves much the same purpose. I am a strong believer in secularism, egalitarianism and educational rights, and I use my online platforms to promote these worldviews. I currently find that many opinionated voices online are often unwilling to respect and consider the arguments of those who disagree with them, so I am determined to create an online space where any opinion is welcome, provided that whoever makes it heard welcomes criticism and contrasting arguments. Click the links on the left hand side of the page to learn more about what I get up to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter much consideration I have decided to become a member of the Patreon community. All of the online content which I make is (and always will be) free to consume, which has the natural benefit of keeping everything I do accessible, but unfortunately is rather unsustainable from an economic perspective. Patreon offers an opportunity for kind individuals to help support content-creators in a purely voluntary format; there is absolutely no obligation for anybody to take part, and any monetary transfers on Patreon are far more organic than the acutely impersonal traditional forms of Google AdSense and the like. If you wish to help me improve both the quality and quantity of my content, you can become a patron and directly influence the evolution of its value. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Your Money Goes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhilst the focus of my content is primarily on the discussive aspect, there are significant costs to consider with regards to production. My hope is to one day own a camera (I currently film using my smartphone), lighting, and editing software (plus a computer to run it!), as well as to be in a position where I can more easily and freely obtain research materials and have more time in which to study them. I am currently in full time education and have a part time job, which require commitment of my money and time respectively, so by choosing to become a patron you will be allowing me to spend less time working in retail and more time creating content, as well as directly assisting me in my goals to make videos of a higher quality. Production value may seem an unwarranted, materialistic consideration, but I have come to realise that increasing the quality of my videos will cause more people to watch them, helping me to spread my promotion of secularism and egalitarianism to a much wider audience. Having said that, I am privileged to own any production equipment at all, and I would continue to create videos even if I had the most unimpressive setup imaginable, and so any pledges made at all are instantly deserving of my sincerest gratitude, and are not in any way expected.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s worth briefly noting that I produce videos at an average rate of once per week, and due to this flexibility you may wish to set a limit regarding your maximum monthly contribution (see step 4 of \u0027How To Pledge\u0027). For example, if you wish to pledge $1 per video but do not wish to support more than one video per week, you can set a limit of 4 transactions per month, meaning that you will never contribute more than $4 per month. If, however, you do not mind the flexibility, you can also choose not to set a limit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow To Pledge\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo if you\u2019d like to become a patron, first and foremost, thank you! People like you are the reason I am able to continue doing what I love, and I am immensely appreciative of your support. In order to pledge, you will firstly need to create an account. If you haven\u2019t done so already, you will prompted to do so during the following steps:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eClick \u2018Become a patron\u2019.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eChoose the amount you wish to pledge. (Pledges are on a \u2018per video\u2019 basis, so if you would like to set a limit to your monthly contributions, you can do at the confirmation stage.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAt this point you will be prompted to sign up if you are not already logged in. You can do so via Facebook or by entering your email address.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will land on the confirmation page, where you can set monthly limits to your contribution and review your pledge. (If you wish to use PayPal instead of a credit card, this is also where you can connect your account.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eClick \u2018Confirm and Pledge\u2019 - a box will appear on the screen where you can enter your card information (if you have not connected a PayPal account). Click \u2018Pledge\u2019 and you are now officially a patron of CosmicSkeptic!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eNotes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen you pledge, you will receive the rewards from every tier up to and including the one you have selected. (e.g. if you pledge $10, you will receive the $1, $5 and $10 rewards.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you pledge $10 or higher, (thank you!) you will be asked to provide a delivery address, this is purely for the purpose of mailing rewards.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve loved creating content ever since I gained a small following, as I have since been presented in the comments with a wide range of ideas and beliefs, all of which have expanded my knowledge and understanding of the world profusely. My ultimate goal is to obtain higher quality videos, both in terms of physical quality (cameras, lighting, sound etc.), and quality of content (research, presentational skills, more time dedicated to production, etc.). The content I make online will always be free, but if you\u0027d like to support its evolution, I would be endlessly grateful. I am of course greatly thankful for any donation you may be willing to make, no matter how small, but if you do not wish to or can\u0027t make a pledge, I hope that you enjoy my content regardless and that you instead help the growth of my content by joining the discussions over on the YouTube channel or blog. Thank you for reading, and have a great day!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e-Alex\u003cbr\u003e"
