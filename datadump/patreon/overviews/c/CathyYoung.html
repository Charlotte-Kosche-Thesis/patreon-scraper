    "summary": "Many of you know me from my writings for a wide range of publications, from \u003ca href=\"https://reason.com/people/cathy-young/all\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eReason\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"http://www.newsday.com/opinion/columnists/cathy-young\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNewsday\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"http://time.com/author/cathy-young/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTime\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/cathy-young.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Daily Beast\u003c/a\u003e. But sometimes, there are things I want to write that don\u0027t really fit anywhere and would work best as a blogpost (with a repost on The Medium). Plus, there are great sites that I\u0027d like to contribute to (such as \u003ca href=\"http://spiked-online.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSpiked\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://huffingtonpost.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHuffington Post\u003c/a\u003e) that don\u0027t pay, and unfortunately I\u0027m not in a position where I can regularly write for free. I\u0027ve also been toying with the idea of starting a video blog. Crowdfunding sounds like a pretty good option. Since I\u0027m not sure at this point how often I\u0027ll be creating content outside my usual paid work, I\u0027m going to do this on a per-item basis so far ... possibly to be upgraded to monthly later on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little more about me. I was born in Russia and came to the United States in 1980. (Here\u0027s my \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Young\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWikipedia bio\u003c/a\u003e.)\u00a0 At the moment, much of my writing focuses on gender issues, where my outlook is either \"equity feminist\" or \"egalitarian\": against gender antagonism, for equal rights and responsibilities and for treating people as individuals first. (I am No. 2 on \u003ca href=\"http://www.salon.com/2014/09/13/7_women_working_tirelessly_to_attack_equal_rights_for_women_partner/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmanda Marcotte\u0027s list\u003c/a\u003e of \"women who work tirelessly to undermine equal rights for women,\" which translates as \"women who have a different view of gender issues than Amanda Marcotte.\") I also write about larger culture-war issues, the \"social justice\" movement, and identity politics. My other frequent topics include Russia and \nforeign policy in general.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my goals in my writing is to cut \nthrough left/right stereotypes and focus on the issues from an \nindependent perspective. My politics can be described as \nlibertarian/conservative, leaning more libertarian on some issues and \nmore conservative on others, but I\u0027ve been described as everything from a neocon to a radical feminist. ;-) I believe in judging people as \nindividuals, not on the basis of membership in a group. I believe that \nreality trumps ideology, left or right. Perhaps most important, I \nbelieve that it should be possible for honest and intelligent people to \ndisagree on political issues and respect each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.newsday.com/opinion/columnists/cathy-young\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
