    "summary": "I am so thankful to my fans and followers: For 24 years you have supported my research and writing about Chicago\u0027s rich ghostlore, enjoying my books and lectures, watching \"The Hauntings of Chicago\" which I hosted for PBS, and attending our Chicago Ghost Conferences and other events.\u00a0 Our Chicago Hauntings Tours, now in our 17th year of operation, have provided low cost haunted history tours to low income kids and seniors throughout our many years, and your support of the Chicago Hauntings Ghostlore Video Series will not only help us create the series but also help us continue to teach Chicago history to as many kids and seniors as possible, despite rising costs of bus rentals and decreasing funds available to schools.\u00a0 \u00a0As a patron of this series you will travel with me via video to some of my favorite and most compelling haunted locations. At higher levels of patronage you can also join me on paranormal outings and investigations, receive a \"Haunted T-Shirt of the Month\" designed by myself and inspired by Chicago ghosts, or be part of choosing our video locations.\u00a0 Chicago Hauntings has been a labor of love for me for the past 24 years, with little monetary gain but so much quality material and history made from the effort.\u00a0 I am so proud of the work I have done, alone and with our other guides, researchers and colleagues.\u00a0 I am excited about the future and thrilled to be starting this new chapter with your help! Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
