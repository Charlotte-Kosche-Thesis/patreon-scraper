Not only do we want to finish Death Note, we want to start a brand new series, and go back and forth between it and Death Note as it finishes up. We don\u0027t have nearly enough free time to work on two series, but with Patreon we may be able to fairly compensate editors to devote some of their time to helping us out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf only 2.5% of our subscribers donated $1, we could afford to produce a new video every 4-6 weeks. Seriously. We understand money is tight for a lot of people (ourselves included since we can\u0027t pay editors out of pocket any longer), but even just one dollar would mean the world to us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
