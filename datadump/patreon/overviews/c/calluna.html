    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSo, who am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey everyone, my name is Calluna, and I create several video series on YouTube. You may have also seen my work on such sites as Channel Awesome, GeekVision, or Circle Plus. My main review series is Screen Shots, where I take a look at anime, television, video games, and movies. I like a lot of different types of media, and this series allows me to talk about them without burning myself out on just one thing over and over. I also have a let\u2019s play series called Backlog Heroes, where my friends and I, well, play a bunch of video games and commentate. Pretty self explanatory, really. I have a more in-depth analysis series called I See What You Did There, where I delve deep in a series\u2019 history or background, themes and concepts, or even just cool things like Easter Eggs. Finally I also have my passion project: Make Up! A Sailor Moon Retrospective, where I explore all the different facets of the series history, from the manga to the anime and even a live action series. So yeah, i have a lot of material to work with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, why Patreon? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I put out at least one video a week, while also working full time. At times this can be very tiring, not to mention that it can get a bit expensive from time to time. That\u2019s where you guys come in. I\u2019ve created this Patreon so that awesome people like you guys can help support me a little more directly by contributing a little bit of money per month. Anything you can offer makes a real difference and is really appreciated, but I\u2019m also setting up sweet rewards that you\u2019ll get access to depending on the amount you contribute, which you can check out on the Patreon page. Every little bit helps, guys. Props, equipment, and even the different things I review cost money, and that stuff adds up. With your help, I\u2019ll be able to make my videos even better and grow my channel into something that you guys will really be proud of. I\u2019ve even set up some milestone goals that, if your contributions reach them, will let me expand my capabilities and start up some cool new features that should be really great. I\u2019ve been running my channel for about a year, and I\u2019m really happy with what I\u2019ve managed to do so far, but with your help I think I can take the channel to another level. Take a look around this page at the rewards and goals, and maybe you\u2019ll kick a few dollars my way. I want to thank you all for all of your support so far, and I\u2019m excited for what the future holds. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Calluna"
