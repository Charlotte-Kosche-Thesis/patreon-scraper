So, here we are!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo get right to the point - my life \u0026amp; perspective as an artist/songwriter/poet/human is extremely different than it was a few years ago. \u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019m not so much worried about EVERYONE seeing what I\u2019m making, but I do really want the people who \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e care to actually see it.\u003c/strong\u003e And maybe even more importantly, I need to feel as if I\u2019m creating something with a purpose artistically, and that it\u0027s worth my time and effort (especially since I have kid to raise + full-time career apart from all this).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon will really serve as a community, my (or our, rather) little corner of the internet. Where if you like my music, my writing, my videos, etc, you can come see what I\u2019m doing in all the time between my releases, and even play a big part in even allowing me to create these things with your support. Because the truth is, while the space between my new album or book releases has grown, the amount that I put into them hasn\u2019t changed. \u003cstrong\u003eI have less time to create, \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003ebut I am still creating\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis community/club/whatever you want to call it will span across everything I create: from my solo music (\u003cstrong\u003eChad Sugg\u003c/strong\u003e), to my other solo music project (\u003cstrong\u003eBackseat Goodbye\u003c/strong\u003e), my poetry/books, my merch brand (\u003cstrong\u003eGood Ghosts Co.\u003c/strong\u003e), literally just everything I do. I\u0027ve kept the reward tiers specific and pretty low on purpose (with the exception of the one giant tier that I can hardly even imagine being chosen), because I really do want this to be special \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e accessible. So that\u0027s enough blabbering, let\u0027s get on with this, shall we?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYours,\u003cbr\u003eChad\u003cbr\u003e"
