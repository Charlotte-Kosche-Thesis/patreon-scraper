This event was centered upon a simple concept\u2014one enormous map approximating the geography of Earth, and 42 \u003cstrong\u003eAI civilizations\u003c/strong\u003e located in their respective historical starting locations. There are \u003cstrong\u003eno human agents\u003c/strong\u003e influencing the events of this game; the host, and the audience, are only spectators to series of events that unfolded before them as the 42 computer AI systems consistently calculated what the optimal moves were available before them. The only victory condition for the Battle Royale was one of \u003cstrong\u003etotal domination\u003c/strong\u003e, as per Firaxis\u2019 programmed ruleset. One civilization needed to capture every other opposing starting capital city to win the game.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis was not the first instance of such a simulation; however, the Battle Royale was the first of its grand scale, the first to rally the audience of r/civ, and the first to feature an expansive list of modded civilizations to its roster of competitors. All civilizations were chosen by the members of /r/civ through \u003cstrong\u003epopular vote\u003c/strong\u003e, and the finalists included both \u003cstrong\u003emodded\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003evanilla\u003c/strong\u003e (game developer  included) civilizations alike.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe current iteration of the CBR (Mk 2.1) is the rebirth of the MK II, a 61 AI tournament featuring additional gameplay mods, new Civs, and a rebalanced map. The Mk2.1 is a rebuild of the map as accurately as is possible after the game crashed and was unrecoverable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRead more about us here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://civbattleroyale.tv/royale/what-is-the-cbr/\"\u003ehttp://civbattleroyale.tv/royale/what-is-the-cbr/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
