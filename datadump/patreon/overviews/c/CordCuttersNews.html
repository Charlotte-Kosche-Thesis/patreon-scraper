    "summary": "Do you Have a Minute to Support Cord Cutters News?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCord Cutters News is growing as we do\nmore than ever before and with growth means more costs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTwo years ago I left my job and started\nworking full time on Cord Cutters News. I dothis to help millions of people save money and break free\nfrom high monthly bills, yet I still have monthly bills and need to support my\nfamily.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo to help cover this cost and more\nimportant help the site grow we have been looking at adding new revenue\noptions. Every week I get messages from ad companies asking to put more ads on\nmy site and often the more annoying ads like popup ads. That is definitely not\nwhat I want to do. Sadly ads don\u2019t bring in revenue like they use to as more\nand more people use ad blockers. (I don\u2019t think people know the damage they do\nto small sites with ad blockers.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEven more painful Amazon\u2019s Affiliate\nprogram recently announced that they are cutting what they pay sites like CCN.\n(This was not aimed at us they just redid the payouts for everyone and unfortunately\nit will lower what we get.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo after many readers have suggested it,\nwe are looking at taking donations. Now Cord Cutters News will always be 100%\nFREE. Even though CCN is free if you enjoy out and are willing to tip $1 we\nwould greatly appreciate it. So we will be using Patreon to allow our readers\nto support CCN for as little as $1 a month or more if the want. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWant to support CCN click HERE to find\nout about Patreon. Or send us a onetime donation to our PayPal account. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is all this money going to? Well here is a short list: (I\u2019m\nsure I am missing something)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe now post 3 to 5 stories a day 365 days\na year on average all about Cord Cutting.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA weekly newsletter on all things cord\ncutting.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI run and manage the Cord Cutting Tech\nSupport Facebook page. (This takes a lot of hours to keep spam out and keep it\non topic.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRunning our social media on Facebook,\nTwitter, Flipboard, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWeekly Facebook Live and YouTube Live Q\u0026amp;A\nto answer your cord cutting questions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReading/Answering thousands of emails\nevery week.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTravel to conventions like CES, SXSW,\nAEB, etc to cover all things cord cutting. (This easily costs a $1,000 per trip\nfor food, hotel, flight, etc.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLets not forget the fact that I work as a\nsole proprietor meaning I pay crazy high taxes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWe also have monthly costs like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWebsite Hosting (We get a lot of traffic\nand this is not cheap. Yes I did just shop around for the cheapest/best option\nout there.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEditor I pay a free-lance editor to help edit\nposts to help bring high quality posts.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWebsite Help (We have a free-lance\nwebsite guy who helps improve the website and fix issues from time to time.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMisc expenses like buying review units,\nbuying equipment like cameras and memory cards etc.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBussiness Class Internet for unlimited\ndata and more consistent performance. (When you are trying to break news you\nneed to make sure the internet works.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePO Box (This one is required by law as we\nneed an address on our newsletter.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere are many other random costs like\ngetting my work PC power supply fixed last year when it went out. You never\nknow when a cost will popup.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLet us not forget finding money to\nsupport my family.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThey will also be used to help grow the\nsite and if we get enough donations maybe hire more people to help with the\nsite. These donations will also be used to support my family, allowing me to\nkeep running the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo what will you get from these donations:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell we have a few things we want to do\nto help grow the site but they all cost money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirst we would like to do a daily\nnewsletter about cord cutting. Some members have used Wordpress email\nnotifications but as we post more some are getting annoyed by getting 5 or 6\nemails a day. We want to offer a daily email newsletter with the previous days\nstories sent every morning Tuesday through Saturday. (Monday will still be the\nbig weekly newsletter.) If we can hit $2,000 a month in donations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSecond I would like to hire some full\ntime help on the site. Just running the social media and keeping it free from\nspam and trouble makes takes 3 or so hours a day. Sometimes more\u2026 Writing posts\ntakes a lot of effort. Not just the time writing the posts but digging up the\nstories, contacting the companies, and doing our very best to make sure it is\naccurate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI would love to help create a job for\nsomeone and in turn get help so I can do even more to help people break free\nfrom high cable TV bills. Yet this costs money and with the new higher costs\nand lower payouts from places like Amazon is something I don\u2019t think I can do\nyet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLastly the more we get the more time I\ncan put to CCN as it will free me up from having to find revenue to support the\nsite. I would also like to someday redo the website to load faster and offer\nnew features. This all costs money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo what do you think- would you donate a\n$1 or more a month to support CCN? Even if you don\u2019t want to donate maybe\nconsider turning off your ad blocker.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
