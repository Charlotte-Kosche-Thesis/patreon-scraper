I began writing music when I was 13, using the program \"Vocaloid\" to create the vocals for my songs. I\u0027m self taught, and ever since I started writing I\u0027ve been working super hard to improve!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is a Vocaloid?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\nVocaloid is a program that let\u0027s you create a vocal for a song by inputting lyrics to a melody. It\u0027s really great if you can\u0027t find a vocalist or if you require a really specific vocal, because you have full customization of the voice! An example of Vocaloid voices are Hatsune Miku, Megpoid Gumi, Ia -aria on the planetes, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are vocaloids in a wide variety of languages, like Japanese, spanish, english, and more! I focus mainly on the English vocaloids, though.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\nWhen I first started writing music, I would post all my music as I wrote it. So when I felt like it was time to create an album, a few of my posted songs didn\u0027t make it on the album because of quality issues, and a lot of the songs that were on it had already been posted. This made me feel like I didn\u0027t really create a \u0027new album,\u0027 so ever since then I\u0027ve been very strict with keeping music to myself, and only posting songs when I know that they\u0027re 100% done and will be used in a project or album. However, the problem with that is that a lot of songs that I really want to show people get lost somewhere along the way. That\u0027s why I thought Patreon would be a good idea!\u003cbr\u003e\nWith Patreon, I\u0027ll be able to post songs and WiPs that, normally I wouldn\u0027t show anyone. I\u0027ll be able to bring you guys along with projects and albums that I\u0027ve been working on, or just show you something I made randomly that normally wouldn\u0027t have seen the light of day. This way, I can share my work with people, but also keep it somewhat a secret!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\nThank you!\u003c/h1\u003e\nThank you so much for checking out my Patreon!"
