    "summary": "Hello, thanks for visiting my Patreon page. Get a cup of coffee or tasty beverage of your choice before you sit down. I want you to be comfortable while we take a little time to get to know each other. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, you\u0027re probably asking yourself: \"What is this Patreon thing and how does it work?\" Great question! Nobody explains it better than Patreon themselves. So, give this a go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rwvUjAv6pxg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow, let\u0027s learn a little bit about me!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a published, award winning photographer, artist and filmmaker. I\u0027ve been cultivating a life long love affair with one of the most beautiful things in nature - light. When I was young my obsession with representing light started with pencil and paper. Drawing consumed me and it flowed out onto everything, and I do mean everything. Paper, books, walls - everything! I quickly graduated to chalk and charcoal and worked to produce the most detailed drawings that I could. Let\u0027s be honest, most of them sucked; but that didn\u0027t stop me, in fact it didn\u0027t even slow me down.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Jr. High my obsession moved to colored pencils and illustration board. I had some great teachers in the Young Masters Art Program at school and they taught me to not only see light but to see tone and value. I learned to blend colors and create rich tones with colored pencils, but they were boring and didn\u0027t hold my attention for very long. In fact, now that I think about it, I hated them. So I moved to technical pens where the stipple technique TOOK OVER MY LIFE. It wasn\u0027t a very productive period of time from an artistic standpoint. It took months to complete one piece (I think I did about 5 pieces in 3 years)\u00a0and, because they took so long, I couldn\u0027t part with them when they were finished. In fact I still have two of them. They\u0027re framed and on the wall in my basement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn High School I was introduced to the greatest tool of my life; the airbrush. I fell in love with this tool and began painting on canvas, textiles and even cars. I failed and learned so much with every piece. I even decided to make art, more specifically illustration, my career because of the airbrush. I worked in many different \"creative\" professions - signs, graphic design, airbrushing cars and motorcycles, while I attended college to get my illustration degree. It was there that my love affair with light progressed into an absolute obsession with photography and filmmaking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter college I started working as a fulltime freelance illustrator and it was good, in fact it was great... for a while. I had a few corporate clients that kept me busy and I was airbrushing commissions in my spare time. But there was a problem, creating full time \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003ekilled\u003c/span\u003e my passion for art. KILLED IT and unceremoniously dumped it on the side of a gravel road and sped away. I put away all tools of the artistic trade and became a web developer and part time photographer. I didn\u0027t draw for five long years. Nothing. Not even a doodle.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve read this far congratulations, it\u0027s kind of a boring story. I\u0027m here at Patreon because I\u0027m rekindling my love of art. My love for creating, drawing and painting. I don\u0027t know where this is all going to lead but I\u0027m having a blast and I invite you to support me and come along for the ride. Your support means that I can afford to continue to explore my art (wherever it may take me), purchase new tools, and allow me the freedom to create more elaborate work. I can\u0027t guarantee that my original art will come on a regular basis because inspiration comes when it comes, but it\u0027s important to me that I share my art so that others may enjoy what I create. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003eCameron"
