I am roughly thirty\nyears of age, I have an extensive background in religion and food service, and\nI know what it\u2019s like to grow up gay in a community which doesn\u2019t understand\nwhat that means. I am human, I am passionate, and I am driven.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eMY MISSION\u003c/u\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy number one goal is to help create a world which\ncelebrates diversity instead of stifling it. I\u2019ve always believed in the\nphilosophy of \u2018becoming the change you wish to see in the world\u2019, and I try to\nlive my life in accordance with my belief that the world is better off with\nmore diversity. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen I was young, I found it difficult to find\nrelatable protagonists in the stories I read. It wasn\u2019t the authors\u2019 fault by\nany means\u2014I\u2019m a unique person, relating to people isn\u2019t always my strong\nsuit\u2014but I always felt a little left out when I read fiction. Don\u2019t get me\nwrong, there were some wonderful stories which really connected with me. Some\nnotable characters I connected with are Andrew \u201cEnder\u201d Wiggin from Ender\u2019s\nGame, Jarlaxle Baenre from R.A. Salvatore\u2019s Drizzt Do\u2019Urden series, and Simon from\nLord of the Flies. They certainly existed, but I found them few and far\nbetween, and with the only exception of Ender, they rarely featured front and\ncenter in the stories.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecause I\u2019ve always felt like an outsider, and I\nconnect with outsiders, my mission is to create protagonists for people like\nme: those who live outside the mainstream. I want to tell the stories which are\noften neglected, pushed aside in the name of either principle or profit. The\ngoal isn\u2019t to get rich, it\u2019s to make good art.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut I do want to dedicate my life to it, and for\nthat there are costs. I want to be making art all the time, and I believe my\nmessage is important enough to give my constant devotion to it. The reason this\nPatreon exists is to accomplish that goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eHOW YOU CAN HELP\u003c/u\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon provides a platform for me to make a\nliving while spreading my message. If you\u2019re not familiar with the service,\nthis is how it works:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatreon\nis a crowdfunding service. It allows a creator to be funded by a large number\nof people rather than relying solely on the generosity of a single benefactor\n(as opposed to say, traditional publishing or a record deal)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003ePatrons\npledge a small amount of money either per creation or per month (I run mine\nthrough the \u2018per creation\u2019 model). This can be as little as $1, and as much as\nthe patron would like to donate.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eYou\ncan select a monthly maximum so that you won\u2019t be charged more than a certain\namount. Say you pledged $10 per creation, but you set your monthly maximum at\n$20. That means even if I create three or more items in a month, you\u2019ll never\nbe charged more than $20 in a month.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003ePatreon\ncharges a small fee which is withdrawn from your pledge. This is a much smaller\nfee than other crowdfunding sites, and is used to keep Patreon up and running.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve enjoyed Patreon so far, and I think it\u2019s one\nof the best services out there to help artists break into the market. It\u2019s even\ngiven me the courage to break away from my 9-5 and write full-time, even though\nI\u2019m not quite able to subsist on Patreon alone as of yet. To give you an idea\nof how Patreon can help me do that, here\u2019s a few examples of what your pledge\nwill do for me:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA\npledge of $1 allows me to get a cup of coffee at 7-11. Writers need their\nstimulants!\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eA\npledge of $5 allows me to buy bread and some bananas. Just need some\npeanut-butter and I\u2019ve got sandwiches for days!\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eA\npledge of $10 allows me to make a batch of chili, and I make some damn good\nchili. That\u2019s lunch for a week if I do it right.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eA\npledge of $20 allows me to pay for gas for most of the month. That\u2019s right,\nthis writer gets to be mobile!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\nAll of these pledges\nadd up. First it\u2019s just a few little things, but eventually I can pay the\ninternet bill, then I can pay for food, then I can actually make my rent\npayment! I don\u2019t care about making much more than what it takes to survive.\nAgain, it\u2019s not about the money, it\u2019s about the ability to make good art. As\nlong as my basic needs are taken care of, I\u2019ll be happy eating nothing but soup\nfor the rest of my life if it means I can devote my full energy to writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCLICK THIS LINK TO LEARN WHAT\u0027S CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR ALL PATRONS: https://www.patreon.com/posts/16121665\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eIN CONCLUSION\u003c/u\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u2019ll\nconsider supporting me and my art.
