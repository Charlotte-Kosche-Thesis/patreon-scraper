We want to make these conversations accessible and to also expand them.  We\u2019re in this together and we think we should be talking together.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut in order to for us to devote the time required to produce this show long term, we need reliable and consistent support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can sponsor the Climate Workshop Podcast through Patreon, a crowdfunding platform for content creators.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Through this Patreon page you can specify the amount of support you want to give for each new episode we release.  You can also set a cap on the monthly total. We are aiming to release two episodes per month.  You can choose from the default levels or set your own when you become a Patron. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support and helping to make the Climate Workshop Podcast possible.

For his act of civil disobedience, he was sentenced to two years in federal prison. Held for a total of 21 months, his imprisonment earned him an international media presence as an activist and political prisoner of the United States government. He has used this as a platform to spread the urgency of the climate crisis and the need for bold, confrontational action in order to create a just and healthy world. Tim used his prosecution as an opportunity to organize the climate justice organization Peaceful Uprising in Salt Lake City, and most recently founded the Climate Disobedience Center.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeter Bowden \u003c/strong\u003eworks nationally as a speaker, trainer, and coach helping organizations unleash the power of human connection through small groups, social media, and other community building strategies.\u00a0 Since 2012 Peter has been working behind the scenes documenting Boston area climate actions and helping climate activists and other justice leaders increase their \nreach, influence, and impact. Tim and Peter have been working together for nearly three years, most of that time with Peter saying, \"We need to have a podcast! We need to share these conversations...\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
