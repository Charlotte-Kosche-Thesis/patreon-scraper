With at least 5 major wars playing out across 3 continents, it definitely feels that way. Whether or not this is the case, a major difference between this bout of conflict and what has occurred in the past in is the way it is being covered by the media. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhereas in the past large media organisations have had to pay to send correspondents to the far flung corners of the world in order to gather reports, these days we live in a world where almost everybody is connected. Through the internet, mobile devices and social media, it is now easier than ever before to connect with locals on the ground and receive information about events far before the mainstream media arrives. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis, combined with the fact that many conflict zones, especially Syria and Libya, are becoming too dangerous for journalists to easily cover, means there is a need for a new kind of reporting. Such an operation would have to able to collate the huge amount of footage and newsbytes coming out of these areas, verify and contextualize it and then present it in an easily transmittable manner.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uqgBabZ.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eEnter Conflict News... \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nConflict News started as project on Reddit reporting on the Syrian Civil War and the crisis in Ukraine, however rapidly grew to become a bigger project.

We source our news from a wide range of contacts and sources around the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur information disseminated on Twitter and our site is highly regarded within the journalistic community, with many well-known journalists following us, and major outlets such as Foreign Policy, The Times of Israel, The Huffington Post and BuzzFeed News sourcing information from us. In addition, we have been mentioned on-air multiple times by Kay Burley of Sky News. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo manage all of this however takes a large portion of our time, which we have to balance with other working commitments. We hope to turn Conflict News into a full time operation\u00a0for those of us involved, and are looking to upgrade, expand and improve all of our content. We hope with your support, we can achieve this goal, and will work tirelessly towards bring you the fastest, most accurate, and most in-depth reporting from areas in dire need of global attention.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a team of editors from all over the world, we all have our own personalities and our own motivations for providing this service.

I\u0027ve always been really interested in world events, and especially geopolitical struggles and conflicts. I\u2019ve used social media a lot in my IT career to gather information on the latest web development trends etc., but I soon began to see the huge potential it had for breaking news stories and covering conflicts where reporters are not able to go. So after a while of just being a big news enthusiast, I decided to use my passion for news to create Conflict\u00a0News, and try to shed some light on conflicts around the world that are far too under reported. We at Conflict News need you to sponsor us so we can\u00a0give conflict reporting the time and effort it really deserves.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56b625dd45bf21b401326901/56b7722760b5e91d272e05f2/56cefd2f2fe1318a78b19e0e/1456405856503/MichaelCN.jpg\" style=\"float: left; width: 215px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Cruickshank (@MJ_Cruickshank)\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\tI\u0027m a 25-year-old freelance journalist based in Berlin.
