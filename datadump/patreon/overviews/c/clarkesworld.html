Each issue includes six-to-eight short stories (which are also podcast over the course of the month) and four non-fiction pieces. We have\u00a0won three Hugo Awards, a British Fantasy Award, and a World Fantasy Award.

We might offer our issues online for free, but that doesn\u0027t mean we can get away with not paying for our content and people\u0027s time. Those expenses add up quickly and like PBS, we count on readers/listeners like you to keep the ship afloat. Some choose to buy digital subscriptions via Amazon, B\u0026amp;N, Weightless Books, etc. We also sell anthologies, take PayPal donations, and even sell advertising. Patreon is just another avenue available for you to support us and perhaps the most flexible of the lot. Whether it\u0027s $1 or $25/month, your pledges add up to something reliable and significant. Ultimately, we are on Patreon so we can continue to publish the stories we love.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eGoals\u003c/h4\u003e\n\tWe\u0027ve been on Patreon for a couple of years now and through the support of our Patrons, we\u0027ve been able to add extra stories, buy equipment for our podcast, and a implement a number of other improvements. At the moment, our focus is on helping Neil Clarke (Editor-in-Chief) make the move to full-time editor by increasing his pay so he can cover his health insurance costs. This will allow him to dedicate the time required to keep moving this magazine forward.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eOk, but what\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/covers/cwy7-250.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eAside from helping us continue to publish and expand\u00a0\n\u003cem\u003eClarkesworld\u003c/em\u003e, patrons have a variety of reward options available to them.
