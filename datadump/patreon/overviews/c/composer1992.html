    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi everyone! Thanks for visiting my Patreon page!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u0027s Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way for people to support artists creating their content. Similar to an ongoing Kickstarter campaign, you can donate a certain amount per video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you asking for support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work very, very hard to create every video on my channel - I spend many hours and days preparing my videos, creating the sheet music, learning to play it, recording it and uploading. Unlike gaming channels that can put out a 15 minute video by recording, editing and uploading, music takes far longer to prepare.\u003cbr\u003eI started making piano videos as a hobby for years however with patron support I have been able to produce more videos and on a weekly basis now! As of May 2017, support for my patrons is almost covering rent and with a little more support, I could devote myself to these videos full time! Patron support also enables me to improve the quality of my videos, such as better cameras and lighting. I may also eventually be able to record my videos in a studio on a proper grand piano!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I become a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you become my patron, you\u0027ll be supporting me in creating new videos with sheet music for you to play! I give special preference to my patrons in deciding what my next video will be - you can vote in the polls that I post! You can also message me directly! I also send a personal message to thank everyone who becomes a patron - not many other Patreon creators do this but I want to show my appreciation in a personal way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get in return?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere\u0027s several reward tiers depending on the amount of money you want to donate per video - you can get some cool stuff as a thank you from me, such as my sheet music PDFs, midi files and clean mp3s of my performances without the intro/outro like on YouTube. Check out the reward tiers below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I don\u0027t want to go over budget?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can set a maximum number of times to pledge per month. For example, if you pledge $5 but set your max to 2 times a month, you\u0027ll be limited to paying $10 a month. However I do kindly ask that you do support as many of my videos a month as you are able to!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I donate in my currency?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes! Your pledge will be converted to the equivalent in US dollars.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I don\u0027t have enough money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a $1 tier if you\u0027re on a tight budget. But if you can\u0027t afford anything, that\u0027s alright! Just stay subscribed to my YouTube channel and you\u0027ll keep seeing my new videos! If you share my videos it also really really helps me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you have two $5 tiers?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI used to have too many tiers so I combined some into the $5 tier. Patreon still presents them separately, so I encourage patrons to join the $5 tier with the most people in it so I can eventually remove the redundant one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo now what?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eScroll down and check out the reward tiers. If you like the sound of any, go ahead and become a patron! You\u0027ll have my many thanks!"
