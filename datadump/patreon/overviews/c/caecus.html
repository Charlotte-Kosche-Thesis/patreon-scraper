Art has been a hobby of mine for as long as I\u2019ve been able to hold the pen my young mother would offer to me as she toted me along with her everywhere. Back then it was just a way to keep me quiet in the waiting rooms, though, she never knew what it would grow into. My hobby transcended being just that when I turned ten years old and realize that I could get better an make something of myself. By the age of 12 I knew what I wanted to do with my life an now, seven short years later, I\u2019m continuing my quest to become a Comic Book Artist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   That\u2019s right, seven years! The particular comic that has been taking up the majority of that time has been SAN, which was recently expanded to a three-title series including Caecus, Continuum, and Novum. I\u2019m thrilled to have the privilege to say that this project has officially been launched! It has evolved so much over the years and I would dare to call it my crowning achievement.\u003cbr\u003e",
