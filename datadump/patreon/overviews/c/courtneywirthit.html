In fact, Courtney published a graphic novel of a collection of short autobiographical stories. After publishing said comic, she went on an almost 18-month hiatus, only drawing here and there\u2013she lacked inspiration. Then, in the summer of 2017, she randomly bought a new sketchbook (even though she had tons of unfinished sketchbooks already), and suddenly drawing became her center of focus again. Passion Fruit bubble tea with less ice and 50% sugar fuels her and is the secret ingredient for each episode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring her Korean classes, Courtney had randomly doodled variations of herself and Surrah studying in order to practice her Hangul. Along with their cartoon versions, Courtney had also drawn two male characters and instantly Surrah \u0026amp; Courtney started to brainstorm various scenarios of these characters interacting. They realized then that they had a lot of the same ideas and hopes for what they\u0027d like to see in a new webtoon and voila! \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHoney Lemon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e was born and published on January 31, 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been overjoyed by the amount of love people have shown for \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHoney Lemon\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e so far and we will do our best to continue to keep those expectations and demonstrate our gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs time has continued, Surrah could not keep up with the project and now Courtney is the one helping this lemon grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY BECOME A PATRON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I dream of being able to quit my full-time jobs to have all of the time to focus on \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHoney Lemon,\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I must unfortunately remain a fiscally responsible adult (ugh).
