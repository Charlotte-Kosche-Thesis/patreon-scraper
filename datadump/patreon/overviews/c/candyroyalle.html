     "about": "Candy Royalle is an award winning performing writing, performance artist, poet, storyteller, activist, educator and vulnerability advocate who fuses cinematic storytelling, poetry and unique vocal rhythms with confronting, political and heart thumping content seeking to break open closed hearts. She tackles topics ranging from sexual obsession to social injustice, exploring the human condition and illuminating the darker areas of the human psyche for her audiences. She has performed alongside many of the greats including Kate Tempest, Ursula Rucker (who said \u201cCandy Royalle is all at once fragile, powerful, raw, sensitive, beautiful, unflinching and honest. She, her spirit and her work, will change you\u201d), David Malouf, Shane Koyczan, Mark Tredinnick, Sarah \u0026amp; Phil Kay, Rives and Anis Mojgani to name a few. A festival curator described Royalle as \u201can act you remember for years\u201d and the Austin International Poetry Festival Chair stated Candy had \u201c...changed the face of poetry in Austin, forever\u201d. Few who see her can forget her intensity, her combustible blend of intellect, imagination and heart. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCandy Royalle has expanded across artistic boundaries engaging in mixed art forms and exploring those forms with various forms of writing. Most recent collaborations have been with choreographer Paea Leach for the Keir Choreography Awards where they explored the relationship between words, movement and space to critical acclaim. Candy\u2019s latest album \u201cBirthing the Sky Birthing the Sea\u201d was a collaboration with the band The Freed Radicals where their musical explorations blurred the lines of rock and roll, funk, experimental soundscapes and hip hop supporting Candy\u2019s own vocal experimentations of fusing poetry with song. She has also collaborated with photographers, film makers, visual artists and classical musicians. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHer solo work has included two published collections \u201cLove Spectacular\u201d and \u201cHeartbeats\u201d   which received excellent reviews with one reviewer stating: \u201cthere are some exquisite lines in this book...I am impressed by the scope of Royalle\u2019s artistic vision.\u201d Her solo tours have taken her across the nation and world. Her most recent international tour \u201cThe Butch Priestess International Tour\u201d took in 20 cities across the UK and parts of Canada and the US with the Wales Arts Review stating Royalle delivered an \u201cenergetic, assured and startling performance. Royalle engaged and enthralled\u2026This is the best live performance\u2026I\u2019ve heard in years\u201d. Other tours have included performances, talks and readings at The Sydney Writers Festival, The Austin International Poetry Festival, The Latitudes Festival in Toronto and The National Folk Festival to name a very small few. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccolades include being awarded the \u201cBig Picture Award 2015\u201d for her piece \u201cMemories\u201d at the \u201cOutside the Frame\u201d film festival in San Francisco, the 2014 Marten Bequest Traveling Scholarship for poetry, a highly commended award for the Queensland Poetry Filmakers Challenge in 2013, winner of the World Performance Poetry Cup as well as the AIPF Excellence in Poetry Award in both 2012 and 2013. She has won numerous competitions and has been nominated and highly commended for a number of awards. Her work and opinion pieces have been published and featured both in publications and online including  Fairfax\u2019s Daily Life, SBS Online, Overland Literary Magazine, Mascara Literary Review, Australian Love Poems, RN\u2019s Poetica, AIPF\u2019s Diversity anthology and many more. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRoyalle\u2019s work has been covered in all major media outlets including the ABC, Fairfax, News Limited, CNN, Sky, BBC and a host of local and street press.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCandy also delivers key note speeches, most recently for Amnesty International\u2019s youth conference.

The dream is to create a stop animation but first I need to get the pitch right and in front of all the important people so a short 3 minute version is the goal. This is an extremely costly exercise and so the money will be going directly to an animation production company. This dream must be realised!",
