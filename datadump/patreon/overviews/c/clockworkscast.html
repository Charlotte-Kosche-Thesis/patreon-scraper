Paul is an academic, Jan is a writer and library worker, and we both love fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would I be supporting exactly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently we produce two podcasts. \u003cstrong\u003eClockworks: A Legion Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e,\u00a0is a critical episode-by-episode analysis of the tv series \u003cem\u003eLegion\u003c/em\u003e, supplemented with interviews with some of the people who made the show. Clockworks is our flagship podcast, and that\u0027s where our name comes from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClockworks: A Legion Podcast airs Mondays. Check out our Clockworks archives for episodes about season one of Legion, as well as interviews with people behind the scenes on Legion and bonus episodes will be focusing on media that is related to Legion in some way. We\u0027ve talked about Legion creator Noah Hawley\u0027s other series Fargo, and we\u0027re slated to record episodes about some of the movies and tv shows that Legion reminds us of, like Pushing Daisies and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur second podcast, which airs weekly on Fridays, is \u003cstrong\u003eWay Too Seriously: A Critical Analysis of Kids\u0027 Movies\u003c/strong\u003e. On each episode of WTS we talk about a children\u0027s movie and take its themes and social perspective seriously. Some may even say, \u003cem\u003etoo\u003c/em\u003e seriously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get if I support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u0027re here it\u0027s because you like what we do, and we couldn\u0027t be more grateful. Thank you! We started this so that we could make something together, but if people are listening that is an overwhelming honour.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support us, we want you to know how much we appreciate you, and the best way we know of doing that is making you special things, so all patrons get access to special exclusive podcast episodes. Even at the $1 level you will get access to two extra exclusive podcasts: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) A weekly bonus trivia challenge to go with each episode of WTS. Paul and Jan quiz each other on trivia related to whatever movie we\u0027re talking about this week. That\u0027s an extra podcast every single week!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Periodic episodes of \"Current Obsession,\" a podcast where Jan and Paul talk about whatever cultural artifact has been occupying our minds lately. So far we\u0027ve talked about The Handmaid\u0027s Tale, Fargo, composing music, cross-stitching, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Broadchurch, Ms. Marvel, Harry Potter, podcasts, Danny Rand, Bob\u0027s Burgers, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Object Lessons, advise columns, and The Bright Sessions.\u00a0This podcast is updated irregularly, whenever we have something we feel is worth talking about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the $5 or up level you get access to periodic One-Shot episodes about a movie, tv show, book, or other piece of culture. So far we have recorded episodes about Logan, The Defenders Netflix series, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and Wonder Woman!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese rewards aside, you know and we know that if you\u0027re supporting us it\u0027s because you like what we do. Much as we began this for the joy of it, we can only afford to continue if we have support. If you like what we do here, you\u00a0want us to keep it up, and to keep improving at it. That\u0027s what we want too.\u003cbr\u003e"
