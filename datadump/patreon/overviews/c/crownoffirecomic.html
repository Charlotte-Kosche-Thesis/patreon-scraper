    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eHi! I\u0027m Brandon Hankins, a cartoonist living and working in Michigan (which city depends on the day). I\u0027ve made comics all my life, but since 2011 I\u0027ve begun self-publishing mini-comics and zines. My goals have always been to make larger series\u0027 of action/adventure comics, and I have written several worlds and stories that I want to show the world one day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://mindwandererpress.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/cf-first-cover-and-promotion-again.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe one I\u0027m currently working on, and why I need your help, is called \u003cstrong\u003eCrown of Fire\u003c/strong\u003e, an adventure comic about a little half-angel child named Autumn Wing on a journey to take sacred fire from a dragon\u0027s mouth. With it, he can forge his own halo and become a full angel. It\u0027s an idea that I briefly explored in a comic\u00a0I wrote and drew for 2015\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003e24-Hour Comics Day Challenge\u003c/strong\u003e, where you create 24 pages of comic within 24 hours. Even though I had to quickly come up with an idea for that challenge, I\u0027ve grown to love it\u00a0and I\u0027m really excited to create more adventures with Autumn and see where his quest takes them. My goal is to tell a story that would\u0027ve gotten a younger me through rough times, with a young hero who is often considered to be too soft-hearted to survive an adventure in an unforgiving world. This comic is an exploration of vulnerability, cruelty and identity, and a search for what it takes to keep or restore an open heart when hatred and cruelty are thrust upon us. I hope to find an answer through this story\u0027s creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy a webcomic? Because I want the freedom to explore this story any way I choose. In the past, I thought going to a publisher would be best for me. I\u0027ve even pitched older stories, but I no longer want to wait on pins and needles for an an email telling me whether or not I can tell my own stories. I believe through a webcomic, I can have freedom as a storyteller, and have a powerful and direct way of reaching you. No more gatekeepers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon, and where your money goes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I was 4, it\u0027s been my dream to make comics as my career. Throughout my college years and even now, I\u0027m working several jobs at a time to keep afloat, but it\u0027s draining physically and mentally. That\u0027s why I need your help. Patreon increases the odds that I can support myself through comics. The more I make here, the less time I\u0027ll need to spend away from my drafting table. I\u0027ll have more time, energy and freedom to create comics of quality. This may also help me pay for several items that would help improve work efficiency, such as a drawing tablet and a high-quality scanner. I believe that asking you, friends and readers, for your trust and support as I develop this and other projects, is the strongest chance I have at achieving my goals.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you get for pledging\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatrons get access to a Patreon-exclusive blog, sketches, behind-the-scenes content and developmental writing not seen by most. Higher tiers gain access to early page updates, a hand-drawn thank you postcard, and can participate in a monthly storytelling focus session with other creators via google hangout. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m working hard every day to get this webcomic off the ground, and appreciate you taking the time to stop by and say hi! Peace!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://mindwandererpress.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/brandons-pic-1.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
