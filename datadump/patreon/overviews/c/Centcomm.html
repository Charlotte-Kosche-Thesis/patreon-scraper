I would like to be in a position to actually survive and work on this full time. I have had many many compliments by both everyday people as well as professionals in the field. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I also try to keep the science \"within reason\" and that takes a lot of research to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I put out currently 3 strips a week on Datachasers and 2 a week on Luna Star I plan to have other things going as well. The funds for this help make sure me and my kitty Aslan can eat and live without wondering where the next meal is coming from. I also plan to make things available to you guys as I get more funds . like a hard cover book or whatever - anyway something you can read offline.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I also need funds to move forward on more marketing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Now something about the \"creative team\" I am the primary Artist ( well the main one ) and creator. \u003cbr\u003eMy Partner Tokyo Rose ( thats her comic handle ) helps write and does the balloons and tells me when im making a writing fubar. And I would like the two of us to be able to do things for you guys on a monthly basis. The funds will be shared between the two of us. ( This helps her too. ) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0What the funds will be going to is to help support myself monthly as I \ncan not currently work. and I have medical bills that come up as well. \non a three month basis and Monthly medications  that routinely cost more\n than I have I really enjoy the pleasure that people derive from reading\n and interacting with me via comments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Thank you for your help and remember anything helps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eremember - \u003cbr\u003eBasic math .. if 200 people donated 1.00 that\u0027s 200.00 to the person. that\u0027s cheaper than a bottle of water or a iced coffee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
