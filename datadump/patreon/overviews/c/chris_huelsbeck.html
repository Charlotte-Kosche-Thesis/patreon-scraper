It doesn\u0027t even matter if you use it for commercial purposes. The only request I have is to not resell the music by itself (means not attached to something you create) and that you give credit if you used the music or portions for it. Also nice would be a link to this page, so that more people can find this project, participate and grow this into a larger and diverse library. Thanks all for your ongoing support! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote for fans who just discovered this: If you decide to support this project, you will get instant access to all previous music pieces that I\u0027ve released here! :)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my brand new Patreon page!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere you can help me \u003cstrong\u003ecreate more music\u003c/strong\u003e by \u003cstrong\u003edirectly supporting me whenever I have a new track\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0ready (be it a single release or part of a new album). \u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027ll get the music in multiple formats including lossless audio) ahead of everyone else\u003c/strong\u003e, access to my \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive Patreon feed\u003c/strong\u003e with \u003cstrong\u003eupdates and info\u003c/strong\u003e about the \u003cstrong\u003ecreation process\u003c/strong\u003e, as well as \u003cstrong\u003eother perks\u003c/strong\u003e (like special\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ediscount codes\u003c/strong\u003e for my Bandcamp Albums for example) and you will know that \u003cstrong\u003eyour support\u003c/strong\u003e helped to \u003cstrong\u003emake this all possible\u003c/strong\u003e.

Patreon was created to support artists and creators using a form of \u003cstrong\u003ecrowd funding\u003c/strong\u003e.
