But that fickle little thing called finance isn\u0027t always so plentiful and as a result, we artists sometimes have to look elsewhere for ways to make things happen. That\u0027s where you, dear Patron, come in play! By supporting my CRAZY Patreon Page, you\u0027re helping me survive! Seriously, with your help, I\u0027ll be able to buy supplies so that my art can continue AND help get dream projects funded like the long talked about \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eCRAZY in Pink \u003c/i\u003eanimated show with Kim Belding of \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003ePicpak Dog\u003c/i\u003efame!
