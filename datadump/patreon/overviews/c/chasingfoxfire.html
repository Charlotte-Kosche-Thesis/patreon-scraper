My primary objective with the podcast is to add a little wonder to the world by connecting stories, ideas, and people. The show mixes science, nature, literature, art, medicine, pop culture, and just about any other field I can find with folklore (my primary passion and vocation). This is a show about tall tales, legends, and colorful characters, but it is also a show about insect collections, the perfect apple pie recipe, tipsy Puritans, and Bugs Bunny. As our tagline says, we follow folklore wherever it goes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Cory Thomas Hutcheson, and I\u0027m a professional folklorist and a university lecturer, as well as an author and podcaster. I bring my academic persona to the show (hopefully in a good way) but I\u0027m also interested in just telling good stories that add some magic back into the world around us. I hope you enjoy listening to the show, and if you like it, that you will consider supporting it here on Patreon. With your help, this will be a fantastic podcast, and a fascinating journey.\u003cbr\u003e"
