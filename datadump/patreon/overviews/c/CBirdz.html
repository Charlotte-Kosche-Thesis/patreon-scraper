Your\nefforts to eradicate invasive English Ivy are commendable and I appreciate your\nwillingness to engage in sustainability issues both as an entrepreneur and\nadvocate.

I\u2019m\na community focused facilitator, habitat steward, artist, and much more! intentionally involved in shifting societal consciousness, for around a decade\nso far. Causes seemed simpler when I was younger, before I grasped of the\nvastness that is intersectionality. I migrate my focus by what it seems the\nEarth-Mother\u2019s calling for as time and rhyme flow through me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbout me:\u003c/strong\u003e I really like healing (and being healed by) soil, directly, through removing\ninvasive plants / stewarding habitats.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI took a permaculture design course in 2014; it was amazing!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI like having a happy body, so I practice eating well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI like participating in peaceful and inclusive communities.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI dance.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI practice consent culture with people, and gift economy as much as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI enjoy music, massage, meditation, clean air and water, and when people are\nwilling to learn + teach!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI really love my 2 mewzes!!

Alternatively, we may have\nchatted some in person, and you decided to follow-up, thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn person,\nI take a lot of invasive ivy off native trees and out of the ground for people\n/ the land. I\u2019m a partner (affiliate) with Purium Health :D, through RAV Tongue\nDrums, Amazon, and\nsince 2010 with a cutlery company based in Olean (NY). After a\nyear or two, I found that while many people want to buy stuff because the\nproducts are amazing, some want to buy because they just want to support me.\nThat was a large reason in why I made this Patreon page; if you want to support\nme without buying any of the super-foods, instruments, etc. that I spread,\nplease give here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon shares 90% of the gift amount to the creators; about 5% goes to the\nwebsite\u2019s maintenance, and 5% as payment fees from other companies. If you want\nto give a single large sum directly to me rather than monthly with Patreon, or if you\u2019re interested in any product(s),\nplease email me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPurium creates super-foods for a variety of wellness goals. I\u2019ve been really\nenjoying becoming these products embodied and working with the team that\u2019s\npresent in our business structure! The model is more about sharing than\nselling; you get $50 off your first purchase, and order yourself online. My\ngift card (code) for you is: C.Birdz\u003cbr\u003evimeo.com/PuriumHealthProducts\u003cbr\u003ebit.ly/puriumrising\u003cbr\u003e\niShopPurium.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRAV\ndrums are similar to hand / Hang drums like the Handpan, except tongue drums\nhave slits instead of just raised and indented surfaces.

After staying in the woods for a while, his eyes are wild with the\nintensity of someone living their principled passions at the cost of much\ndiscomfort, and that discomfort is experienced to him as joy. He is fricking\nnuts and he is the kind of crazy that is much needed in our safe and\ncomfortable lives. Conversations with Christopher are intense and sound like\nchapters of Walden.
