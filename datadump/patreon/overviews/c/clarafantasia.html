Are you new to the tabletop roleplaying scene, or are you an experienced player wanting a change of tone and style?

However, we have parted from the tried-and-true dragonslaying campaigns and instead draw inspiration from \u003cstrong\u003eanime/cartoons and Fantasy JRPGs.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eNewcomers to the scene or anime/game nerds - we\u0027re talking to you! \u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tOur campaign, \u003cem\u003eThe Rekindled,\u003c/em\u003e has players embarking on a journey as young teens as they develop from hungry, bickering rivals that barely make it through the night, to a cohesive team feasting on a plate full of good-ol\u0027\u00a0\u003cem\u003edestiny\u003c/em\u003e. There\u0027s great side characters, high stakes, satire, and everything in between.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe world of \u003cem\u003eThe Rekindled\u003c/em\u003e consists of four warring kingdoms of different cultures, each in control of their own element - from the Airscion to the Emberkin, blessed by the Primordial Four (yes, we will have elemental powers!). Our adventure begins with a year-long war between the Airscion and the Earthborn, where young soldiers with elemental prowess have been sent to the battlefield. It\u0027s there where our fated heroes meet, set our differences aside (only so slightly), and weave our way into an overarching plot of love, revenge, and\u00a0fanaticism!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe entire campaign runs for approximately 40 hours (according to my initial run), but will certainly vary depending on the DM and the players.\u00a0\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eAnd now, my friends and I will be editing the campaign into a DM\u0027s Guidebook, complete with fully coloured artwork, maps, and instructions on how to run the campaign for you and your friends!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\tNote: \u003cem\u003eThe Rekindled\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is an anime/JRPG-inspired campaign through and through, and although everyone\u0027s narration style will differ, there are certain things to keep in mind:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eCertain parts of the narration could be satirical in nature, or self-aware.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003c/ul\u003e\n\t\u003cul\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eOur main characters would be young teens ranging from the age of 11-15 - no older! It\u0027s a great chance to embrace your inner child again and enjoy the world in a wide-eyed fashion, instead of creating a scarred, veteran ranger.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eCertain NPCs will join your party and fight with you (yay, no more questgiving NPC vendors)! They will come and go over the course of the campaign, and all of them are absolutely charismatic and lovable.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003c/ul\u003e\n\t\u003cul\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eStats and rolls are simplified, making it ideal for beginners into the D\u0026amp;D scene. We\u0027d like to adhere to the advice that we should create the most \u003cem\u003einteresting\u003c/em\u003e characters, not the best characters.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003c/ul\u003e\n\t\u003cul\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eOur guidebook comes with a homebrew battle system! It\u0027s a mix of D\u0026amp;D, Dragon Age Tabletop RPG, and JRPGs (with a tech tree!). It\u0027s simple to understand, but delves deeper into synergies and combos. Ultimately, however, it\u0027s focused on having fun.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe story is considered linear and \u0027on-the-rails\u0027, meaning certain events happen at certain times to drive the plot forward; it is a plot-driven story. Most likely, you will be vising the cities in a \u003cem\u003especific order\u003c/em\u003e as the plot dictates. However, side-quests, what you do in the cites, and \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e you tackle them is up to you and the DM! Additionally, DMs, feel free to read the intended plot, then completely change it to your own liking and create your own variant. We\u0027ll do our best to create a world that acts as the canvas for your creativity, so don\u0027t fret if you\u0027d prefer to make your own tale.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWith that in mind, \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThe Rekindled \u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eis \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eexcellent\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e for players and DMs that would like to embrace our inner geek and have a great time (especially newcomers).

Additionally, as a musician, I can contribute through character themes or overworld themes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t This will take time, but we\u0027ll slowly work towards that goal and hopefully by the end, you\u0027ll be able to share the campaign with your beloved friends. Once we amass enough funding and assets, after reaching certain goals on Patreon, we will attempt to present The Rekindled as a Kickstarter exclusive product - please consider helping us reach said goal, and share the joy of exploring a new world and a new story.
