    "summary": "Corvus analyzes aspects of video games and game design! That\u0027s me!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI originally started as a way to talk about and discuss video games when I saw the game review and news markets were oversaturated. I release in-depth videos that discuss and analyze games at length, leaving no stone unturned. I also release a variety of content, such as Kickstarter Analysis videos and more specific analysis videos; e.g., Mechanical Analysis, Music Analysis, Boss Design, Level Design.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe website will host an edited script for Full Analysis videos, and written portions for non Full Analysis videos.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThese videos, however, take a full-time job\u0027s worth of hours. This Patreon will help make that dream come true where I can focus on releasing videos at a reasonable rate.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhere\u0027s the Money Going?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRight now, everything is being used to help pay for Website hosting, equipment, and games that I\u0027ll be analyzing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLike I said, I would love to do this full-time, so eventually the money will help me live when I make that full-time transition. I would also love to pay those who help me out regarding proofreading, watching for editing mistakes, and even those who create future analysis videos. That\u0027s a prospect that might come to light in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat Are the Current and Future Tier Rewards?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe rewards may change as more people join. I\u0027m looking forward to interacting with you all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping the Discord server will end up promoting some interesting discussions and perhaps stir some thoughts about games / videos I\u0027m working on, although only Patrons will be able to take part in any discussions relating to content I\u0027m currently working on.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to make sure you get the most bang for your buck, so I stuffed the $1, $3, $5, and $10 Tiers with a couple goodies each.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBehind the Scenes and The Aftermath provide some additional thoughts, feelings, and an overall deeper look into the content released.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always willing to switch Tiers or Rewards around depending on what people want.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat Is the Future of Corvus Analyzes?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI would love to focus on Full Analysis content. Shorter videos may also be scattered in there -- all depending on the game, of course.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI still want to continue other video series such as Kickstarter Analysis. I have an idea for another series but \n\u003cem\u003eshhh\u003c/em\u003e it\u0027s a secret.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also want to mess with the idea of using a video camera to include me in the videos.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI could start streaming if people want to see that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile my focus is currently on video games, my original intent with the website was to support more categories such as movies, TV shows, and board games. Of course, in order to do this, I would need to bring more people on board. The website already has a couple Movie posts when we experimented with the idea. If this idea ever comes to fruition, I want to be able to pay everyone involved, so as of now, it stands as a bare bones idea.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThank You\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven a dollar keeps me going and would mean more than you know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhether you support me here on Patreon or not, I want to thank you for enjoying my content enough to visit my Patreon. Every viewer, Like, comment, and subscriber means a lot to me. You are the reason I can keep on doing what I\u0027m doing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhere Can I Find You?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHopefully Patreon and Discord!
