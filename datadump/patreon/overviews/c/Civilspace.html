    "summary": "Thank you for all your support!\u003cbr\u003eCivil Space is a small operation dedicated to fighting the never ending tide of nonsense inflicting the world. Currently we are just two people and half a studio. Sia is a political refugee from Iran, who came to Canada 4 years ago. He was sent to prison in Iran where he was tortured for talking back to the Ayatollah. Daniel is a Jewish Canadian who was surprised to find out that University in Canada is a place where students, professors and sometimes friends will calmly explain to you that almost all Jews (Zionists) are bad people. We met doing stand-up comedy in Toronto were it became quite clear any material that was to the Right of Joseph Stalin wasn\u2019t going to be acceptable. So we decided we had to try and do something, and were subsequently not allowed at half the venues in the city, since our views on the Carbon tax make us blah blah blah whateveraphobes. \u003cbr\u003eWhat we want to do is use our background in comedy and journalism and politics to bring you videos on interesting topics, with biting satire and hopefully educational. We do take on Socialism, Islamism, Feminism (basically more Socialism) and all the other ridiculous dated \u201cisms\u201d. We\u0027re not afraid to even draw a picture of the Prophet Moham\u2026 the Prophet Mmmhhh\u2026 the Propheheh\u2026 pictures of some religious figures as a joke.\u003cbr\u003eWe feel like Canada is going through a dangerous time currently, hell this is a country were \u201cmisgendering\u201d people is illegal. We\u2019d love to say that we are trying to defend freedom of speech, but to do that we would have to live in country with freedom of speech. Our supreme court has actually ruled the freedom of expression does not cover anything that is \u201clikely to expose people to hatred\u201d (could that be any vaguer?). In Canada comedians are being fined $42 000 by the social justice tribunals for making jokes. Yes, you read that right Social Justice Tribunals are a real thing here. To make matters worse the federal government is flirting with Islamic blasphemy in M-103. So if you are like us and believe that 1984 was a warning and not a guidebook please join us in our attempt to bring back common sense and logic into the conversation. \u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to turn Civil Space into a media with the collaboration and help of smart creative individuals with interesting views who are never heard or seen in today\u2019s media. With your help, this will be the start of something great. \u003cbr\u003e"
