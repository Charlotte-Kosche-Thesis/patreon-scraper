I\u0027m doing this for the love of it. \u00a0I have hundreds of dollars (maybe more) invested in an ideal audio set up with a pre-amp and audio recorder that I have collected over the years. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you feel that you get more benefit out of my podcasts than a sushi roll (I know I am pushing it there) I would appreciate a dollar donation. \u00a0I\u0027m not looking to get rich off of this podcast but I do hope that I can get the server paid for at least. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for listening. \u00a0I really feel that the more people that center themselves through meditation or any other way, the world will be a better place. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
