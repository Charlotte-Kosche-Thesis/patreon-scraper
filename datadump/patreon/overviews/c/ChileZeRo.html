Basically\u003cstrong\u003e the purpose is to cover the monetary cost that my new high quality videos have. \u003c/strong\u003eI always listen to all feedback and this lead to the current state of my videos having a dramatic upwards spike in terms of quality. From the high quality cameras to the increased production value in all my new videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is like an online \u0027Tip Jar\u0027 - Where you can support my content (in this case) by pledging in a monthly basis and in return you get awesome extra rewards. Patreon is different than say Kickstarter or other crowdfunding sites because you aren\u0027t supporting one big project like in those scenarios, but instead me as a content creator by supporting what I make. It\u0027s simple, and it makes a big difference!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Situation\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ve recently hired a video editor to finally help me put into the videos the ideas I\u0027ve always had but wasn\u0027t able to add due to time constraints\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003e(Remember, I\u0027m also a tournament player and have to defend my title)\u003c/em\u003e or my lack of ability. \u00a0This also means videos are much more consistently on time and on schedule, \u003cstrong\u003efurthermore there\u0027s artwork, comissions and other costs that come with creating high quality videos in a consistent way.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this patreon page is to cover for such costs that come directly from my paycheck every month. With the crazy use of adblock (over 60%) and me supporting my family financially completely, I\u0027m gonna be honest and say that\u003cem\u003e times are just really rough and I really mean it when every little thing does make a difference. \u00a0\u003c/em\u003eMy passion is in making better videos for you all, I love Smash Bros and the scene so much and I refuse to do anything else because this is simply where my soul is in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll that comes from Patreon will be put directly into making better and more awesome content, that is my promise with you all. \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI apologize if my rewards can\u0027t offer everything you guys would like to see from me, I just don\u0027t want to promise things I won\u0027t be able to deliver. Time is also always a constraint from me because I also play competitively in tournaments and do my best to defend my title, not to mention everything that is my life outside of Smash Bros which also takes time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for reading up to this point and supporting my content, you\u0027re AWESOME.\u00a0"
