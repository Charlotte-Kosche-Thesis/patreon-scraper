He writes to engage people of faith and of no faith in deep questions and engaging stories that matter for the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently Carl has focused his artistic efforts on projects to bring about good in the face of evil.  The Abolitionist Hymnal is a collection of 19th Century freedom songs set to new tunes, and is a benefit for the Not For Sale Campaign to end human-trafficking today.  Upcoming projects will explore violence done to friends by religious institutions and the beauty those same friends make regardless.   Carl hopes that his artistic work will be this kind of catalyst for good everytime he sits down to write or perform.\u003cbr\u003e",
