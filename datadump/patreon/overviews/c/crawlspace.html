    "summary": "Hi there, thank you for your interest in the \u003ca href=\"http://www.spidermancrawlspace.com/\"\u003eSpider-Man Crawlspace\u003c/a\u003e  podcast and website. I\u0027m Brad Douglas and I created the site back in August of 1998. It started as a simple Geocities website and has been going strong for nearly 20 years. In those 20 years it has grown in popularity and even received national attention. It\u0027s been spotlighted in USA Today, Entertainment Weekly and even in Marvel Comics themselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e The site continued to grow in 2006 when we launched a podcast. It was the first Spider-Man-centric podcast online and we have produced more than 400 episodes which are all available to download from our server. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e With the continued growth comes additional expenses. On average we receive  more than three million visitors a year. There are expenses that come with that many people coming to the website and downloading podcasts. There is additional bandwidth costs from our web host. There is also additional costs by upgrading computers, software upgrades, buying microphones, webcams  etc. It\u0027s not cheap to host a popular podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve offered several rewards for you to support the site and podcast. There\u0027s everything from a mention on the site to being a semi-yearly panelist on the podcast. Every dollar helps us bring more content and stay online for years to come.  Thank you for your consideration and keep on \"Thwippin!\""
