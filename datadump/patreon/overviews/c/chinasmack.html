Unfortunately, we are unable to \ncontinue producing translations or content on a regular schedule. We \nthank everyone who supported cS over this time and regret this \ndisappointment.

Let\u0027s get as far as we can!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor every level of individual patronage, we\u0027ve used a humorous slang term Chinese netizens have coined for certain types of people (\u003ca href=\"http://www.chinasmack.com/2014/stories/diaosi-peking-university-releases-report-on-chinas-losers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eand often self-deprecatingly for themselves\u003c/a\u003e!) These are all tongue-in-cheek, in the spirit of Chinese internet culture, and not meant to offend! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo show the world who is responsible for keeping chinaSMACK alive and independent, we\u0027re going to put the names of all our patrons on a public \"Patron Wall\" on chinaSMACK. Names will be displayed in the order they became a\npatron, so earlier patrons will appear first before later patrons. You also of course have the option of\nremaining anonymous, using a business name, or using an acceptable\npseudonym/nickname, but we want to make sure we give credit where it is due.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, please pledge any amount you\u0027re able to, based on how much you value our work, and we sincerely appreciate you checking out our campaign."

We\u0027ll also add articles and videos explaining notable Chinese internet memes and trends, pointing out interesting insights readers might not notice through our usual translations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything above this will of course allow us to do more, as well as add additional concrete goals for our community and patrons to consider.
