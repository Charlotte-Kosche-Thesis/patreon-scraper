I\u0027m currently studying Drawing and Print at the University of the West of England where I\u0027m learning lots of new ways of working. I will be uploading content on a weekly basis which will include digital images, pattern designs, prints, drawings, and photographs. My current project is an attempt to start a conversation about death in the hope that we can start thinking about and treating death in a different and more positive way.\u00a0"
