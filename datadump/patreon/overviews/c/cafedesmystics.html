    "summary": "Cafe des Mystics is a weekly gathering in Berlin, Germany focused on encouraging a daily meditation practice, sharing ideas and connecting with others.  There are guided meditations along with discussion periods, like the salons of old, where social and intellectual exchange were developed to connect communities. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJason Lamberth is the host.  He has taught meditation in New York, Bali, and Berlin for 13 years while also building an international furniture business and raising two very cool daughters. \u00a0Jason builds his practice on ancient wisdom from traditions such as Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Hermeticism, as well as, other mystical schools and religions. But the thrust of his practice is finding the individual voice that speaks within all of us, which is independent of knowledge or tradition. \u00a0We all know we are spirit living in a material world because we know our bodies will die one day. \u00a0And yet, who we are, remains. \u00a0This is where the mystic is in all of us. \u00a0It can\u0027t be explained. \u00a0It is a mystery, just like the origin of the wind. \u00a0But it is there. \u00a0We can feel it. \u00a0It moves through all of us. \u00a0Cafe des Mystics is dedicated to this dance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile it is hard to not sound a little flaky when trying to explain the inexplicable, Jason keeps it real. \u00a0We all have real lives with real responsibilities and real people we love. \u00a0We are 4-D spirits living in a 3-D body that has rent and taxes to pay. There is a way to handle it all while still being true to our inner voice. \u00a0In fact, there is a way to thrive beyond our wildest dreams and stay true to our path. \u00a0Mystics throughout history have passed on techniques to tune our listening to that still, small voice in all of us. \u00a0There are no secrets. \u00a0Everything is hidden in plain sight. \u00a0And we all play a part in uncovering its beauty.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to sharing and learning with you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
