    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Cal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting saved me. It gave me something to dream about, an escape from being a sad queer loser in a New England prep school where we were all LGBT \u003cem\u003esupporters \u003c/em\u003ebut none of us were, you know, \u003cem\u003egay \u003c/em\u003eor anything. Writing was an escape valve for when the pressure of my life became too much, for when the secrets I was keeping inside myself - sometimes even \u003cem\u003efrom \u003c/em\u003emyself - became too much to bear. Writing was where I could create the kinds of people that I needed to be and to have on my side, fighting for and next to me. Writing was where I could spin the kind of stories that I needed to read, but that I couldn\u0027t find on any shelf.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, you\u0027re not going to find these kinds of stories on most bookshelves, or TV screens, or video games - and if you do, they\u0027re often fatally flawed. The girl who ruled the world falls in love with the girl who fell from the stars, but they\u0027re parted all too soon. Two scarred, broken people find each other, and find wholeness in each other\u0027s scars and brokenness, but they are torn from each other before they can truly be healed. They can\u0027t be together, because that\u0027s not how the narrative works. The guy gets the girl. That\u0027s how it\u0027s always been, and that\u0027s the only way it can ever be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that\u0027s not how it should be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore last March, I liked the idea of writing the kind of story that a younger me - a scared, excited, terrified me, who had just realized that I might in fact not be straight - would have wanted to read. But afterwards, I didn\u0027t just \u003cem\u003elike\u003c/em\u003e the idea. I knew that I \u003cstrong\u003eneed\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eto write those stories, for the scared, angry teenager that I used to be. I need to write those stories because that kid is still inside me. And I need to write those stories for everyone who\u0027s still there, who still feels trapped in their own life. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose are the kinds of stories I\u0027m here to write. And according to you, I\u0027m doing it pretty well. You\u0027ve told me that my stories have given you hope in a time when you felt that you had none. You\u0027ve told me that they inspire you to continue fighting for the representation you deserve, but that has so far eluded your grasp. You\u0027ve told me that they\u0027ve fed your soul, just as they have mine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut while those stories have given you and me what we need to hold our heads up high in a world that can often seem intent on shoving them down, what they haven\u0027t done, so far, is feed my body. I recently quit a soul-killing job, and while I\u0027m trying to find another (one that\u0027s not quite so soul-killing), my dream is to live off my words. And that\u0027s where you come in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf everyone who follows me on tumblr chips in a dollar every month, I won\u0027t have to find another job. If half of you do, I will only need to work part-time. Without the need to worry about whether or not I can pay the bills, feed my stupid cats, and keep myself decked out in rainbow swag, I can be far more creative. I can do more. I can dare more. And that\u0027s why I\u0027m asking you to help me achieve that goal. I want to finally see my name on the spine of my own novel, just like my six-year-old self always dreamed. And\u00a0I want to write more of those stories that you guys love - the stories you said have helped you remember that maybe, someday, we\u0027ll all find the love we deserve.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for everything. You\u0027re all wonderful, and no matter what, I\u0027m glad and grateful to have gotten to know you through my writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
