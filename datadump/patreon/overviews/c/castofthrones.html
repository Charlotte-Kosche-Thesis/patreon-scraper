    "summary": "Cast of Thrones is a Game of Thrones podcast that initially focused on the HBO series, but has expanded to embrace all of the mind-fruits of George R.R. Martin. If you are here, then you probably know all about our band of lovable misfits and why Cast of Thrones is special.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why Patreon? We have used Patreon for other podcasts on the GeeklyInc network, and we love the way it allows listeners to support us at a level that is comfortable for them and lets us interact with our listeners in a variety of creative ways.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking Cast of Thrones is super fun, and we would do it even if no one was listening. But there are a LOT of you that are listening, and with the increased activity on GeeklyInc, we are seriously concerned that we will need to upgrade our servers and that takes money. We would also love to have an excuse to create extra content for you. So if you can support us, we would really appreciate it and we think it would allow us to make a better show for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for checking out our page, and we hope you consider becoming our patron."
