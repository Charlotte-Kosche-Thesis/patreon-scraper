    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy BIGGEST goal in life (before Hollywood, and before modeling) was to become a majorly successful empowerment author, who helped people like myself (a teenager who struggled with believing in himself) to look past his insecurities and his own self-limits, and re-identify and structure\u00a0the concept of himself from single-parent low-income small-town white trash, to something bigger than all of it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MY PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT SIDE...\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eMy other Patreon (\u003ca href=\"http://patreon.com/codydeal\"\u003ePatreon.com/codydeal\u003c/a\u003e) is a place for my most loyal fans to get some more skin, WEEKLY, and it\u0027s been a great deal of fun making this content for my patrons! I love posting stuff on my private Snapchat and through my nude erotic video content shot here in Maui, Hawaii, playing naked in the ocean, jungle, rivers, and sand. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eOf course this is a big color of me. Let\u0027s say this color is Orange. I love Orange. I dance in Orange a lot. But, I am also Blue, Green, Red, Yellow, and many other colors, and I am not getting the opportunity to really express this colors. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eNow, Orange is my most noticeable color. It\u0027s also what gets me the most attention, so it was the focal point of getting Orange out there for people to enjoy. And I have really delivered with ORANGE.\u00a0\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThat Patreon is supposed to be all about ORANGE!!!!!!! And I\u0027m gonna STOP throwing BLUE (writing, personal development, etc) at their face when they actually don\u0027t want to see blue more than likely. My patrons are there for ORANGE, so dammit, I am going to give them Orange!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, instead of throwing it at their faces, I have decided to try start a completely separate branch of myself...\u00a0\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eMany companies have different brands. Ford owns Jaguar, Toyota owns Lexus, but their companies and brands are built for different people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThis is Jaguar. This is Lexus. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBut I also want a different branch of content: Personal Empowerment. I have always been very about it, as most of you who follow me beyond Instagram or Twitter, or know my personal back story. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSo I am launching this SECOND and separate Patreon account, to focus in on core things that are separate from my erotic content. There will be ZERO erotic content here, and it also let\u0027s me see that people REALLY want to see this side of me, and REALLY want to read my words, and hear my heart, and my ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eFor those fans, who want to get access to me writing blogs every week (and pledging to me monthly to do so), on topics that THEY can pick and choose, to private journal entries not meant for anyone\u2019s eyes but my own giving my most intimate conversations with myself, to writing samples/chapters for my part-autobiography / part self-help book, and to help me build a broad more Personal Development branch to my brand, so I can eventually do speaking engagements, and start to offer retreats/workshops here on Maui, focused both on physical and mental strength. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThis is something near and dear to my HEART. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI want to be an open book here on my private writing community. I want to post a journal entry, and dozens of people create a back and forth; a real back and forth conversation about real struggles; real moments; real conversations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf this interests you at all, would you be willing to donate $3 in exchange to helping build this brand/branch with me?\u00a0\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThis is for NEW patrons; many who always valued my old blogsite, \u003ca href=\"http://hollywoodandbeyond.com/\"\u003eHollywoodandBeyond.com\u003c/a\u003e (now selling for $1700) or \u003ca href=\"http://codydealblog.com/\"\u003eCodyDealBlog.com\u003c/a\u003e (now selling for $250), both which are not around these days. I\u0027ll take it more serious again, and it\u0027ll also keep me accountable, which is something I personally need!!!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eMuch love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eCD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIF YOU DECIDED TO PLEDGE SUPPORT, THIS MESSAGE IS FOR YOU\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m actually both baffled and bewildered you decided to pledge to my writing. I always felt more insecure about my writing beyond anything else, but I also know how natural it comes to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s my constant struggle; feeling like I can write, but never feeling that anything I write is good enough. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am grateful for you because you are getting me out of my comfort zone, and making me accountable to put it out there REGARDLESS of my harsh judgement. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I thank you for that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you know of anyone who might be interested in supporting, please fill free to encourage them to help out this closeted writer, to get past his own self-limits, dig deep, and produce (hopefully) something that can add value you to people\u0027s lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank you for becoming part of this.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
