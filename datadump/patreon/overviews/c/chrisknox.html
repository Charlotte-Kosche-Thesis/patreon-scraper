Where Patreon takes it a step further is by the unique relationship that Patrons and I get to have that never existed before. Just by pledging to support me with \u003cstrong\u003ejust a buck\u003c/strong\u003e, you get access to my \u003cstrong\u003ePatron Only Stream\u003c/strong\u003e where, you guessed it, only Patrons have access to! I will be posting behind the scenes photos and videos of me working on different projects as well as demos and raw takes. You can leave comments and give me suggestions and we can chat and totally be BFFs. I\u0027ll also give you men some beard grooming and upkeep tips. For sure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support helps me and allows me to spend more time dreaming and creating and producing music and videos to enjoy with everyone, and not only my music but anyone and everyone who wants to come and create but never had the resources or the encouragement to do so! Patrons, \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0make it possible for me to keep doing what I love to do;\u003cstrong\u003e create music for the joy of all peoples.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI hope to be producing at least one song or music video a week at first. So check out my pledge rewards and your wallets and see what\u0027s good for you! Don\u0027t forget that you can also put a max on how much you are willing to give in a month just in case I go crazy one month and produce more than you can afford!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love you all and am grateful for your support in whatever way you show it. Looking forward to interacting with you all and talking about life, music, the Bible, beards, cold weather, Lord of the Rings, books by dead people, mountains, snow, the sea, pirate stuff, guitar gear, Star Wars, pizza, flannels, Homestar Runner and Strong Bad, Kyle Mooney and Goodneighborstuff, grizzly bears, the worlds finest USMC, why \"buried\" isn\u0027t pronounced \"berried\", and more!
