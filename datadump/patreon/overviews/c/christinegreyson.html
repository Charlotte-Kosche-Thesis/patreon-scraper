I write books, compose music, create visual folk art; I use just about any artistic venue I can to paint the world romantic., because I believe that a world without romance is a pretty boring place.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2v0y3bc\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i65.tinypic.com/2v0y3bc.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003eLily the Cajun Swamp Frog\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy projects fluctuate and flow according to the mood that hits me. I do almost everything, from writing stories to sharing experiences recorded on crappy phone videos. They\u0027re fun, though. I have been a dollmaker, a painter and a hobby musician, creating music that I love to sing. It may be lame, but it\u0027s mine and at some point jerked my heart around a little.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not consider myself a professional creative, and I don\u0027t have a blueprint or concrete goals. I believe life is to be lived and shared. We\u0027re all fumbling around in the dark together, and it helps once in awhile for someone to develop the courage to share his or her experiences without shame or apology. This is how we evolve spiritually alongside each other, and that\u0027s what leads to becoming more comfortable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI rarely put anything up for sale for an exorbitant price or try to make money off it, because our economy is a wreck and the kind of people who like what I do are just trying to get by and have a decent life. So for those of you who do dare to become a Patron of mine, I can\u0027t express how grateful I am for any dollar you are kind enough to shower my way. I\u0027m truly happy. The song on this cover page, Wonder Kid, was one I wrote in honor of an old friend who I lost back in \u002787. He was a boyfriend in high school, and he committed suicide. It may not be the best music in the world, but it genuinely came from me, and it wasn\u0027t written for the purpose of any popularity boost. This is an example of the way I operate as an artist, and it will continue until the day my grave is laid.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m on Patreon because I\u0027m a working artist.\u003c/strong\u003e I continuously strive to make my books easier to afford, my music as free as possible, and my craft work more available to those who want it instead of making it impossible to purchase. My job is to share my natural talents and inspire, \u0026amp; to bring new ideas to a growing, evolving society. Patrons and Artists are a community here. We are all working towards the same goals; to make things easier on each other, and to help one another move forward for the benefit of others as well as ourselves. Thank you for your loyalty, from the bottom of my soul.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
