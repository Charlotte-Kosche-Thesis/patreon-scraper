Your name will be added to all of the videos posted in the month following your pledge (for example if you pledge on December 22nd you would be credited in all of January\u0027s videos) - This is just to prevent people from joining the tier \u0026amp; getting a name credit then removing their pledge before paying. If I post less than 2 videos in your month then it will carry over into the first video of the following month (so that everyone gets at least 2 name credits per $2 pledged!).
