    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eThis page WAS the platform for musicians part of the IN THE KEY ELITE or ELITE VIP monthly memberships- coaching, guidance, and continuous cheerleading from me for your career. Worth hundreds and hundreds. If you\u0027re not a musician, all of the other levels were for you to support me in continuing to provide free resources that will help transform working musicians\u0027s career. AND I\u0027m changing it up so I can use this platform for my music fans and release more of my own music in a new and interesting way. STAY TUNED!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, any musicians who want to be part of the monthly VIP membership and get all the perks of Get It Done days, website reviews, songwriting reviews, collaboration and community, then head over to\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.InTheKeyOfSuccess.com/elite-plus\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInTheKeyOfSuccess.com/elite-plus\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0to join. We meet the last Wednesday of every month at 2pm EST on a zoom.us video call.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRead on for more of my story, and stay tuned as I\u00a0transition this page over the next month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eHere\u0027s why I have chosen Patreon as my platform to host my music creation stuff:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt took me eons to finally get to a day where I can write a blog post called \"\u003ca href=\"http://livingongigging.com/a-day-in-the-life/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eA Day In The Life of a Music Maker\u003c/a\u003e\" and be proud and completely lit up by the work I am doing and with whom I am doing it with. I wish Cheryl-of-ten-years-ago could have run into the 2017 Cheryl because I would have kicked my butt. This is getting confusing. But the gist is, I\u0027ve gotten real training and clarity on what it takes to craft a creative career. And it\u0027s never perfect, consistent, or predictable (not the way my type-A personality would like). That\u0027s why I am here. To be able to continue to share the process of being a full time musician while working the new digital age - giving my stuff away for free. Patreon is a place where not only do you hold me accountable to continue creating, but it\u0027s a place where you can give very little, really get true mentorship and networking, while making a VERY big difference... consistently and predictably! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was trying to get started, there weren\u0027t any other musicians openly sharing their mistakes, tips, and advice. Just lots of books by lawyers or label execs who didn\u0027t understand the lifestyle of touring songwriters, nor the need to wear many different hats to make ends meet. So. Many. Hats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo in 2008, (at which point I had made two\u00a0records and was regularly performing around the USA and Europe with my band) it started with a blog, \u003ca href=\"http://www.livingongigging.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLiving on Gigging\u003c/a\u003e, which recently was named one of the top 100 Music Industry Blogs by Musicians Empowered. And then it turned into getting asked to speak at the Millennium Music Conference, where Lou Plaia (co-founder of ReverbNation) told me I should write a course, which is now found at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.inthekeyofsuccess.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIn The Key Of Success\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0where all of my online courses, like the 6-week live online mastermind\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://inthekeyofsuccess.com/mx4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMX4\u003c/a\u003e, AND my first podcast,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/keyconvos\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKey Conversations\u003c/a\u003e is live. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe value of these resources comes from the content, and a lot of it is free. This is why I\u0027m hoping you can partner with me to make a difference for every musician out there, even if that\u0027s you! Each month, when I will post a blog article or a podcast episode or my own musical creation, you will be my partner in causing full self expression and creativity for hundreds (and hopefully thousands!) of musicians.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether, we can inspire other creative folks who give us SO much in this world, to do what they love, and do it well. Are you in?"
