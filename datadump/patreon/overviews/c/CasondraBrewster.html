    "summary": "Being an author in today\u0027s gig economy is not easy. You have to eat in order to write. You have to pay for ink cartridges, and paper, and internet, and your overdue library fines. Oh, and sometimes an occasional shot of whiskey, not to mention copious amounts of caffeine. Without loyal patrons, any artist struggles, fails, and fails, and maybe -- MAYBE -- hits the success lottery. My series \u003cem\u003eEcho Falls\u003c/em\u003e is the first of the projects I wish to complete.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wilderness-Rim-Echo-Falls-Book-ebook/dp/B01N4WRCM1/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1487975859\u0026amp;sr=8-1\u0026amp;keywords=wilderness+rim\"\u003eWilderness Rim, Echo Falls, Book One\u003c/a\u003e is already available But, the next in the series, needs a bit of a boost so I can focus on that instead of the freelance projects (read corporate communications and marketing) that normally pays my way in this world. I have a pile of short stories that need homes. All of this takes time and effort, that without the support I could get here, will just sit there while I write web content for yet another business. However, Patreon is a way to do it the way artists used to do it -- with benefactors and sponsors. This will help me make time and give purpose. No longer will stories be flung into the ether willy-nilly. There will be plans. There will be goals. Here, with you, I have a mission, a purpose, oh, and food in my belly. And biscuits for the puppies."
