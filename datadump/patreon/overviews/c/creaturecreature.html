    "summary": "A while back, I realised I\u2019m happier working for a \u201cwe\u201d than a \u201cme\u201d. Self-promotion makes me anxious. Focussing on other people\u2019s work, or collaborations, or things I want to do for my community, makes me happy. In fact, I am infinitely passionate about spreading enthusiasm and support for innovative live performance across the planet. So I\u2019m building a company. In order to appear less long-winded, I\u2019ll invite you to read the manifesto \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/1218754381486007/photos/a.1218758838152228.1073741827.1218754381486007/1223736750987770/?type=3\u0026amp;theater;\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e ou en fran\u00e7ais \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/1218754381486007/photos/a.1218757838152328.1073741825.1218754381486007/1227054997322612/?type=3\u0026amp;theater;\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eICI\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m really excited about this. I\u2019ve spoken with poets, and opera singers, and painters (among them, \u003ca href=\"http://benjaminkleinart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBenjamin Klein\u003c/a\u003e, whose luminous work graces our virtual office), and playwrights and clowns and stand up comedians, and greek scholars, and drummers and dancers...from Edinburgh and London and Amsterdam and New York and Vancouver and Whitehorse and Korcula (it\u2019s in Croatia) and Melbourne and Halifax and just around the corner and halfway across town...who I\u2019m already plotting out how I can bring together or exchange audiences with--and I\u2019ve got a long line of new relationships of my own to explore.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u2019s the situation: what I want to do is big. Too big to do alone. In order to find qualified people to help, I need to answer their main question: what\u2019s in it for me? The most direct answer to that question is money. Yes, I want to find other people like me, who are more passionate about the creation of surprising and delightful performance experiences than anything else--even money--and who, like me, would just go ahead and do it anyway, but it\u2019s also important for me to treat people\u2019s time and craft with respect. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBasically, i\u2019m asking you to trust me. To put your faith, and some of your dollars, towards my promise of investing your money in  surprising and delightful people and projects. That\u2019s what you\u2019re doing by signing up: because I\u2019m the artistic director of the company, I\u2019ll be making the curatorial decisions; so by donating, you\u2019re saying you\u2019ve got a certain amount of confidence in my artistic sensibilities. Or maybe you just want to humour me, and that\u2019s okay too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow what\u2019s to stop me from just using the funds for my own purposes? Again, it\u2019s about trust. I trust my sense of ethics. I know how important fairness is to me. You can ask anyone i\u2019ve worked with as a producer, I\u2019ve always given credit (and cash) where it\u2019s due: if they say otherwise, please ask them to contact me and I\u2019ll fix my mistake.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Patreon model has us come up with rewards here to entice you to donate, but we both know...if you\u2019re still reading it\u2019s because you understand and support what I\u0027m trying to do with creature/creature. I\u2019ve had the experience of promising a whole slew of labour intensive cumulative rewards on a frighteningly successful crowdfunding campaign and I don\u2019t want to make promises that\u0027ll take me a really long time to keep. So for now, you mostly get gratitude, at every level. I really like this Patreon place though, and I plan on figuring out how to use it to build our bond: how to get creative with the artist/patron relationship. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAbove all, I want you to know that seriously, your patronage--no matter what tier you choose--means a great deal to me. Not only will it allow us to build the company\u2019s foundations, but it makes me feel like I\u2019m not alone in thinking this wonderful many-headed creature I envision can and will exist for real. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003c/strong\u003e"
