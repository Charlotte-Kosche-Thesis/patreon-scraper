    "summary": "I just wanted to give you guys a little bit of a backstory as to why I chose to open a Patreon. I am not forcing anyone to pledge any money, nor am I trying to guilt anyone into it, if you choose to I would appreciate it a lot, but support in general from you guys means the world!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have ALWAYS loved music growing up, I may not have been singing the entire time but I have always been involved with music. I was in elementary school choir from grade 5-7 (yes school is weird in Canada! Elementary is k-7; high school is 8-12; or at least that`s how it was for me!) I played a clarinet in grade 6 concert band, in grade 7 I switched to an Alto Saxophone, which I hated. When high school came around for grade 8, I went back to the clarinet which I played in the grade 8 concert band, intermediate concert band (grade 9), and senior concert band (grade 10-12). I was also apart of Jazz band in grade 7 playing clarinet, I was in Jazz lab (grade 8) for the first few months of high school before my classes needed my full attention. Through out this time I had also been playing piano which I had started from scratch when I was 11 turning 12, beginning of my grade 6 year. I haven`t recently played piano which sucks, but I played it constantly going to lessons for 6 years and I got pretty good, even though I wasn\u0027t quite an expert I was happy with how well I was able to play.\u003cbr\u003eI never really got back into choir in high school as it was outside of class time, so it was either super early in the morning or after school til late. It sucked I was\u0027t able to be apart of the choir as I had to practice my two instruments at home as well as do all of my homework as I was placed in an honours program that was heavy in the academic side of learning, so basically you learned everything at a quicker pace and even learned things that were from the grade above if time permitted in that semester or year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my youtube adventures in Grade 9 (2010) on my own personal channel with random videos of all kinds. I eventually started making music videos with my best friend for her own channel where she covered songs that we went out and filmed scenes for to make awesome videos! In December of 2010 I really wanted to start making my own wow music as I had come across wow parodies by Ember Isolte and Sharm earlier in the year before ninth grade was over. I finally made a video but instead of it being music it had been a haiku from an app I had on my phone at the time that had a whole bunch of world of warcraft haikus on it. I finally made my own parody when Rebecca Blacks \"Friday\" came out on youtube, it was all the rage in high school at the time, so I picked up a pen and started writing lyrics for it. I honestly had no experience writing song lyrics, or recording and mixing down a track at all. I just winged it. I was 16 and no idea what I was getting myself into. A few months later Lady Gaga\u0027s Judas came out and every time I heard it on TV, I thought of Arthas, so naturally I began to write lyrics for a new wow parody. I wasn\u0027t the best at singing back then as it had been so long since I had actually sung. I kept making songs, and I have met some wonderful people over the years that I am so glad to call my friends, I don\u0027t know where I would be without them, or who I would be without them. If I had stopped after the first few negative comments, then I wouldn\u0027t be making music today for you guys to listen to. I wouldn\u0027t have met all these wonderful friends that I would do anything for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough my schooling isn\u0027t going in the music direction, but instead the science route, I have been asked so many times, \"why are taking science if you love music/arts?\" and truth is, is because I know it\u0027s hard to get jobs in the music industry unless you are truly talented, I am hard on myself, but I know I\u0027m not the best singer out there, I just simply do it for the fun of it, and for you guys to enjoy something!\u003cbr\u003e"
