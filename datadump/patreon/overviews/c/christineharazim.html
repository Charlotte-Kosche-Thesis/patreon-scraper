    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eTo the curious soul:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a musician, an artist, a writer, and a photographer. \u00a0I\u0027m working on calling myself an entrepreneur and a successful role-model. \u00a0I want to inspire other musicians, other women, and other music-lovers in my time on this earth, and there are a few ways I\u0027m working toward that goal. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m 25 years old. \u00a0I\u0027ve released two albums under my own name, titled \"Message to A Stranger,\" and \"For Love.\" \u00a0Like any young adult, I admit that I have had no idea what I\u0027ve been doing with my life, and these albums are proof of that. \u00a0Looking back, I know I didn\u0027t market them right. \u00a0I know I didn\u0027t perform them enough. \u00a0BUT I do know that I put my heart and soul into each song recorded and that I wouldn\u0027t change a thing. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI learn by living life and making mistakes. \u00a0The mistakes I made with my solo project, I have digested and researched, and now I\u0027m working on a new project called \"Scarlet Thieves\" with some incredible musicians. \u00a0We are recording our first EP together and I\u0027m so excited to put my knowledge to work now that I know which direction to go in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis brings me to my latest endeavor: Nashville Offbeat. \u00a0I began Nashville Offbeat in April of this year. \u00a0It started out as an Instagram feed of local bands and musicians in Nashville which turned into a Facebook page, and is now a music blog. \u00a0This is not the most lucrative thing for me, but it does help me to meet and be inspired by the incredible alternative musicians living in this town. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the next year, I plan on turning Nashville Offbeat into a networking and learning community for local DIY musicians. \u00a0As I learn more about the industry, I realize how little I still know, and I know I\u0027m not the only one who feels this way. \u00a0If you are a band or artist who is still working to get your name out in the world, it feels like such a huge task! \u00a0My goal is to figure out a way to provide workshops and classes to musicians in a concentrated and inexpensive way, and to create a community in which we don\u0027t all have to feel so alone in the music world. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, Scarlet Thieves will be done recording by Fall and will begin gigging and taking on the crazy town that is Nashville! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve ever subscribed to a magazine, you\u0027ll find that this is the same concept.  You will donate a monthly amount (that you can cancel anytime you like), and in return, I will work hard to become an investment that you can be proud of.  As much as it\u0027s joked about, (and not so joked about), creating music, taking photos, shooting videos, producing art...it\u0027s a lot of hard work.  The difference is that there\u0027s not a built in financial network for artists in the same way there is for an accountant or teacher.  This is my attempt at creating my own.  If it fails, it fails.  But if it works out, you will be a building block of something amazing! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you! \u00a0You are wonderful. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eREADING MATERIAL:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.nashvilleoffbeat.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.nashvilleoffbeat.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstagram:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/nashvilleoffbeat\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@nashvilleoffbeat\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/nashvilleob\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@nashvilleob\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
