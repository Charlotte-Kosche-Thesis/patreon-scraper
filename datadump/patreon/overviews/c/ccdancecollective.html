We encourage our dancers to become co-creators and develop as full artists, not purely technicians. Additionally, we are active in building and fostering a larger healthy dance and art community in the Coastal Bend. We rely heavily on support from the community and fellow lovers of dance. We continue to be amazed by and grateful for all of the support we\u0027ve received up to this point. We hope you\u0027ll consider supporting the rest of our collective\u0027s journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind out more about CCDC\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.ccdancecollective.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.ccdancecollective.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
