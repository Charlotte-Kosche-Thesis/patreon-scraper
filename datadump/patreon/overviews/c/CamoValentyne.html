I want to be able to be a mental home for people who have been thrown from theirs, or have had theirs destroyed by the anguish of these terrible emotional earthquakes. \u00a0I want to be able to touch the hearts of thousands, even millions one day with the words that I speak. \u00a0To accomplish this, I need to be able to find the people who need that help, and I need to be able to focus on my artistry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon I think is a very good way to start, to create a page where I can see myself growing in terms of viewers and supporters who also support this goal, and I truly hope to get to know each and every single one of them to the best of my abilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan You Help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, with all this being said, can you help more people find a place to call their mental home? \u00a0Can you help me achieve this goal that\u0027s so far away, and yet so close in the determined eyes of this artist? \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf so, please do, because I\u0027m not going to give up any time soon on what the purpose of my life is. \u00a0And I\u0027d love to have someone else just as willing to help along for the ride!\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Camo Valentyne is a 21 year old mc/hip-hop or rap artist from Atlanta, Georgia that started writing at the age of 10.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt that time it was just poetry and short stories that were written to fight away depression during his early teens. Having been diagnosed with very severe depression at 12 years old, he fought through to continue his writings and to make them even more beautiful. Music, however, at this point in life was never a thought. Only about three years ago at the age of 17 did he decide he wanted to get more serious about his music. He started listening a lot to artists who inspire him and became more in tune with the idea of becoming an musician.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis writing has adapted over the years to fit a style of his own that is completely unique, combining emotional music, fast rap, and burst pacing into a very grabbing mix.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2016 marked the first serious year for Camo Valentyne, the first year he got to get a solid foot in the door in terms of his music and the incredible game that is rap music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is to gain supporters, and people who are willing to help him climb the ladders to become one very unique beast within the music industry. \u00a0This is only the beginning of what\u0027s to come, and only the tip of the iceberg for what he has planned!",
