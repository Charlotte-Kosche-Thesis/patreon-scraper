Thanks for dropping by my corner of cyberspace here at Patreon!\u003c/strong\u003e Chances are you\u0027ve seen my art on \u003ca href=\"http://lady-cybercat.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDeviantart\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/cybercat/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFuraffinity\u003c/a\u003e or maybe one of my tutorials on \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/StephieArt\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 I love being able to draw, paint and share what I\u0027ve learned over the years, but there are SO many more things I\u0027d love to be able to do.\u00a0 That\u0027s why I\u0027ve joined Patreon. With your help I\u0027ll finally be able to expand on the types of content I\u0027m able to offer everyone, not just here but on DA and my other galleries. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently the majority of my income is through commissions, but that leaves me with little time to do tutorials or artwork out of my own imagination. And because I am limited to how many commissions I can take,\u00a0 not everyone who\u0027d like to get art from me can do so. That\u0027s something I really want to change.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon ?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e Simply put Patreon is a way to pledge monthly support or \u0027tip\u0027  an artist or content creator while getting bonus content. It allows you to control how much you donate  by offering different tiers of support. Want more info? Check out their official video here: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wH-IDF809fQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u00a0 sort of rewards will I be offering?\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve got tons of ideas, but some of the ones already in the works will be Wallpapers for desktops and mobile devices, Tutorials, WIPs, Full Resolution files of illustrations, Character Sheet Bases, Brush Settings, FAQs, and other downloadable content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eWill I use it as a PayWall?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Nope! I won\u0027t hold my art hostage! I\u0027m counting on the furry \u0026amp; fantasy art community\u0027s generosity here, allowing me to make more content that will be available for more people.\u00a0 That\u0027s not to say there won\u0027t be some Patreon-only exclusive content. There will be, as I want to give back to those who are directly supporting this endeavor. However the majority of the art, tutorials and bases will be available on my DA and FA galleries in a delayed release. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note\u00a0 Patreon will process the pledge payment on the 1st of every month. New content will be uploaded or emailed afterwards. \u003cbr\u003e"
