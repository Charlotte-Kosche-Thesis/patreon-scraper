    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m David Carillet, creator and administrator of the video game art website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.creativeuncut.com\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreative Uncut\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. Thanks for having a look at my page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2003, I\u0027ve endeavored to build a website that could one day earn the title of\u00a0largest curated collection of video game art galleries in the world. As a kid, I spent much time searching for artwork from my favorite video games, but was often disappointed by the lack of resources and quality of the materials. Many images were tiny or obscured by ugly watermarks placed by the website hosting them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an adult, and realizing I had the opportunity to provide a resource for the next generation of video game art anthusiasts, I set out to create the kind of website that I always wished was around when I was younger.\u00a0Character designs, concept art, line art sketches, promotional pieces -- I collect them all and feature the pieces in organized galleries, categorized by game title. You won\u0027t find any watermarks placed by Creative Uncut on the images.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, the website is home to tens of thousands of artworks from hundreds of games, all of them manually optimized and titled for an easy browsing experience. I\u0027m incredibly appreciative of and motivated by all the support from visitors over the years who have shared my love for video game art and helped popularize the site. I\u0027ll do my best to keep growing it. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m on Patreon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOne of the challenges through the years has been creating content while also realizing the need to display banner advertisements to support what I do. The ads I use generate a small amount of revenue when they appear on a page (not when they are clicked), but the proliferation of AdBlock usage has made this business model increasingly challenging, and the future of the site more and more uncertain. I see Patreon as a potential solution for AdBlock users who don\u0027t wish to see ads but still wish to support Creative Uncut.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo how does Patreon work? It\u0027s pretty simple, you just pledge a small amount of money to a content creator you wish to support. Say, for example, $1. You can cancel after one pledge or continue to support them monthly. Since it\u0027s a crowd-funding concept, every little bit adds up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny pledges I receive from Patreon will be used to cover the website\u0027s bandwidth hosting costs, as well as enable me to spend more time making the site the best it can be.\u003cbr\u003e"
