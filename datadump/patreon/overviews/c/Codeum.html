I want to reach the people who need to hear it, when they need to hear it. I want to reach this goal with quality and consistency with the hope that somebody will rethink issues they may be facing for the better. I\u0027ve battled with severe depression my entire life and this music has been one of the few things that has helped me through it. If I could get even 5$ per video, that would be enough motivation for me to upload way more often. It will also help me put together a better and more efficient studio setup. I will fully appreciate every penny I get, and make sure to use this money exclusively to make my music better."
