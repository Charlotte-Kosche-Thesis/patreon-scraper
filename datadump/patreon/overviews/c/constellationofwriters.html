    "summary": "When I started my Digital Office Hours project at the beginning of 2018, I had no idea what it was going to grow into. But there was this crystalizing moment shortly after I began that made me realize how important this community was going to be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Amanda Farough \u2014 I\u0027ve been a game journalist for eight years, namely with small sites that are now somewhere in the Great Internet Ether collecting Internet Dust. I was, for a short time, a games editor at Mic.com, where I worked with a number of upcoming journalists, including full-time staffers and freelancers. I\u0027ve had bylines at a number of different places, including Teen Vogue, PC Gamer, CG Magazine, and Paste Magazine. \u003cstrong\u003eThese days, I\u0027m the managing editor at a Very Prestigious Outlet That Cannot Be Named (and not because it\u0027s secretly Voldemort).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning the Constellation of Writers, our little-big writing community on Discord, has been such a pleasure. It\u0027s full of talented freelance journalists who bring their expertise, perspectives, and enthusiasm in every interaction.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong story short, I love this work and the community that has risen up as a byproduct. In order to maintain the hours needed to ensure that the community grows and the writers get what they need from me (and outside experts), we need support! This Patreon will cover my time, the expenses of running/hosting the podcast and interviews that the writers need to level-up those journo skills, and developing resources for the writers to use beyond the community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNothing will stop me from doing this work, short of my health (which is in good standing, natch). But your support will make it that much easier for freelance journalists to get the insight and perspective that \u003cem\u003ethey\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0need from editors and established writers in the game industry, including me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, of course, thank you for donating. This community has become so important. I\u0027m so proud of each of the writers and I can\u0027t wait to reach even more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxo,\u003cbr\u003eAmanda"
