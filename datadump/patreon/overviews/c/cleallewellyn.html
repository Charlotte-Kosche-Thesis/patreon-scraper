     "about": "Clea Llewellyn is a rootsy soul veteran. Discovered by former Public Image Limited bassist and world-music aficionado Jah Wobble, she toured the USA, Canada and Europe (including big name festivals such as Bestival and WOMAD) and wrote with him from 2005 until 2011. Two songs co-written by Jah Wobble and Clea were released on two of his albums.  Their song One Day also made it onto his new album, Redux: Anthology (2015).\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014 she released her debut solo album Us Against the World, about which Fatea Magazine said, \u2018the\u003cem\u003e more you listen the more you are captivated and drawn in especially by Clea\u2019s very smooth, dreamy and effortless vocals. There are definitely strong hints of Macy Gray (Deepest Fear), Jem, and Dido in these songs.\u2019  (\u003ca href=\"http://www.fatea-records.co.uk/magazineOld/2015/CleaLlewellyn.html\"\u003eread full article\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClea has spent years honing her craft as a singer and guitarist, touring, recording and writing. In 2004, she formed the electronica band Mooli, which released the album Concubine. The album\u2019s content was sought out by A7 Music Ltd, resulting in most of the songs being licensed to be featured on electronica compilations alongside artists such as Snow Patrol, Jose Gonzalez and Bonobo.  One of Mooli\u2019s stand-out tracks, San Francisco Rain, set fire to dance floors globally after it was remixed by house artists Marco Lys and Chris Lake. The band also performed live on BBC Radio 6, with presenter Tom Robinson championing their record.\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016, Clea leant her vocals, melodies and lyrics to the Chasing Demons album project by up and coming London trip-hop band, London Sky.
