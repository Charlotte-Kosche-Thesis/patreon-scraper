     "about": "I began practicing yoga 15 years ago to connect with the roots of myself and to discover a deeper identity. What I have found through my practice is an ever-changing expression of life in both its raw and refined forms. When I began, I was a student at U.T. in Austin, getting my degree in Cultural Anthropology while exploring my elective passions for writing and philosophy. When I graduated, I knew that I was going to share yoga with friends, I was going to travel the world, and I was going to write. I became a licensed massage therapist in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of our human body and to connect with others in a nourishing and well-balanced way. Also, practicing as a licensed massage therapist was a great way to make a living at the time, when yoga and writing were bringing in crumbs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2005, I have been doing bodywork and teaching yoga both in Austin and Costa Rica, and I have traversed the world to further my life experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy homebase is Austin, where I always come home and where I currently reside. I\u0027ve also listed Nosara and Copenhagen in this profile as locations where I am from, as many parts of my travel writing emerged from there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
