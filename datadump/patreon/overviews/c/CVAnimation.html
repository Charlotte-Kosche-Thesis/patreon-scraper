I\u0027m Luis Cruz but my nickname on the internet is \nJetz aka CVAnimation (Classic Video Animations). I have been making animations as a hobby since I \nwas 14 years old (2004!) and ever since I have never stopped creating. I graduated in 2012 with a bachelor degree in Graphic Arts with Concentration in Animation and expanded my skills from just Adobe Flash to Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere and other design programs. I\n have made a couple of animations in many different styles such as sprites, drawn and machinima that have come\n to be well received at its time including \u0027Wood Man Is Incredible\u0027, \u0027Let The Games Begin\u0027 series, \u0027Garrymon\u0027 and lots more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eI would continue to make this animations as a hobby in my spare time, but It \nwasn\u0027t until 2015 when I joined 1up-Island which is a group of awesome people \nnetworking with each other that I finally realize how much I wanted to \nkeep making sprite parodies and some how make it my living. This is why \nI\u0027m here on Patreon, to try my very best to make that dream a reality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eThere\u0027s a reason why animation channels are so far and few on YouTube. At the moment ad revenue on YouTube works in favor of content creators who produce videos on a daily basis. This is great for YouTubers who make Let\u0027s Plays, reaction videos and news channels but terrible for independent animators who can typically take from 2-4 weeks to produce just one video. Add to that the problem that is Ad Block and you have yourself the scary scenario animators have to live with if they want this as their career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can I help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eWhile pledging even the simplest amount on Patreon will help me a whole lot, you don\u0027t have to in order for me to make videos. I will continue making videos on my channel but since I must balance this with a regular job there\u0027s no certain release date for my videos. There are other ways you can help though, such as subscribing, sharing the videos and just spread the word about my animations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBellow you will see the what you will get in return for pledging.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThank you to everyone for the incredible support through the year. I\u0027m happy I have so many dedicated and awesome fans \u0026lt;3 Thank you very much! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
