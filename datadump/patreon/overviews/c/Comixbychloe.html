I am Chloe - as of this writing, a twenty-six year-old bisexual trans woman making her way in Austin, Texas - and I make comics and draw lots of stuff and have lots of thoughts about things! Do you like queer stuff? Sexy stuff? Happy stuff? Sad stuff? I do it all!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was a kid, my goal was to be a comic book artist. That changed to filmmaking when I was fifteen, but, after a decade-long hiatus, I am back hitting art harder than I ever had before, but now with the added benefit of being the real me I always wanted to be (little kid me didn\u0027t even know what transgender was, ya know?), and therefore WAY more open in what I draw and present to the world. I constantly strive to push myself to do more and more, and I hope that you\u0027ll find a lot to love in what you see here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny and all donations will be used to give me more time - more time to focus on the art that I love so dearly! Every bit of help is 100% appreciated, as, with my current schedule, I cannot go about making all the effing art I want to on a constant basis (though I still make plenty!).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy what I do. Thank you for your gracious support!"
