    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi, I\u0027m Cynthia.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you want more of my story and what I generally write\nabout, check out my blog at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cynthiajeub.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCynthiaJeub.com\u003c/a\u003e or \"Insights on\nEpic Living.\" I\u0027ve been telling stories about my family and what it\nwas like to grow up with fifteen brothers and sisters in a conservative\nChristian family, and to be on reality TV. My story includes changes in political\nideology, struggling with my religion, and the recovery process\nfrom realizing my parents were abusive and losing access to my little brothers\nand sisters. I also blog about other things, like how to live life as an epic\nstory, personality types, and philosophy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow I\u0027ll Use Your\nDonation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWriting takes time, and right now I\u0027m busy working multiple\njobs to support myself. This will help me pay bills like rent and\ninsurance, while still having time to work on a book. In addition\nto writing a book, I\u0027ll still upload YouTube videos and keep my blog\nupdated. I\u0027ll also set funds aside for things that authors need - a\nprofessional editor, a publisher, publicity and printing costs, and possibly\ntraveling expenses for book tours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Patreon Works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSome funding websites let you raise money for one project at\na time. Patreon lets you donate small amounts on a monthly basis for ongoing\nprojects. I\u0027m always going to be working on three things: my blog, my YouTube\nchannel, and my book(s). I update my blog and YouTube channel more often, and the current book is a larger project that will take several months to complete. When you offer monthly support, you\u0027ll give me what I need\nto release regular content, and depending on how much you give, I can offer you\nexclusive rewards.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Project I\u0027m\nWorking On Now: \u0027Music in the Dream House\u0027 - The Book\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe project I\u0027m starting with is a book about my upbringing. It was tentatively titled \"Growing Up Jeub,\" but in 2018 I chose a new working title, \"Music in the Dream House.\"\u00a0I\u0027ve always written with descriptors from the music that has\nshaped my life. And I\u0027ve always been a dreamer, and my siblings were dreamers,\nso the illusory nature of our reality in a world of sheltered gaslighting is\nnaturally described as a dream. My parents\u0027 book was titled \"Love in the\nHouse,\" which was a far-off dream compared to our reality. So I call it\nthe dream house. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Many of you who\u0027ve been following along with my\nstory on my blog have seen hints of the full story, but I\u0027ve only been giving\nsnapshots, with thematic blog posts. I\u0027m working on a book with a more linear\nstory, starting from the beginning. There are things people are asking about, that\nI\u0027ve tried to blog about, and it\u0027s just too long and complicated to explain on\nmy blog alone. These things include how my family got to know Michael and Debi\nPearl, and what it was like to have them stay in our house. Pro-life advocate\nDr. James Dobson of Focus on the Family had never seen an ultrasound until\n2004, when my mom was pregnant with one of my little brothers. This book will be full of fresh content, not just a copy of what\u0027s\nalready on my blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\u0027s my first project, but Patreon is an ongoing campaign,\nand I have more to write about than just my family. However, I know that not\neverybody cares as much about the same content, so you\u0027ll know when I\u0027m finished and am moving on to something\nelse. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Happens When I\nSwitch Projects?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen I finish this book and move onto another writing\nproject, I will let all of you know so you can adjust what you want to help me\nwith. If a book about education or spirituality is more interesting to you than\nmy family past, just watch my blog for the update that I\u0027m switching to a new\nproject. Similarly, if you\u0027d rather not hear about my thoughts on religion, you\ncan always withdraw your support once I\u0027m finished publishing the book I\u0027m\nworking on right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecome a Patron, Get\nExclusive Content\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy my blog and want to read my\nbooks when they come out, that\u0027s great! Please don\u0027t feel like you owe me\nanything for that. I\u0027m honored that people want to read my work. Some people\nhave said they want to support me, so this is an opportunity for you to do\nthat. If you \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e to support me, I\u0027ll\ndo my best to offer you exclusive content and access to express my thanks. Patreon is cool because if you give me support, you get special content that my regular blog readers don\u0027t get.\u00a0Here\u0027s what you\u0027ll get, based on how much you pledge per month:"
