    "summary": "\u003cp\u003eHey guys! \u00a0This is Jonathan Burton or \u0027CarBot\u0027 of CarBot Animations and thankyou for checking out my Patreon page! \u00a0I have joined Patreon to possibly quick expand with StarCrafts and CarBot Animations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat I Do..\u003c/b\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you probably already know, I have a passion for StarCraft and gaming in general, and of course making cartoons and cartoon parodies. \u00a0Most people do not realize the amount of time it takes to create a cartoon, especially doing it in the classic frame by frame style as i do. \u00a0It often takes me the full week to create the 1 to 2 minute StarCrafts episodes you see each saturday. The support on YouTube has helped make animating my job, but supporting me through Patreon as well can make this my career. \u00a0It has always been my dream to entertain through cartoons powered by my own imagination, this is why I have made a Patreon page.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat is Patreon and how do I help?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Patreon allows fans to become direct supporters of content they love. \u00a0Its kind of like a kickstarter, but in smaller numbers and on a consistent basis. \u00a0Once you have made an account, you can choose to support me through a donation of your liking. \u00a0It can be as little as 1 dollar or as big as you want. \u00a0This \u0027tip\u0027 or support is applied with each new episode I release, but is not charged until the end of the month. \u00a0You can also put a maximum per month, just in case if I some how make 100 episodes in 1 month. \u00a0There are also bonuses for contributing. \u00a0 If you decide its not worth it anymore or change your mind later, you can cancel at any time. \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Goal...\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Through Patron supporters (you) I can not only consider this my job but my career. \u00a0This extra boost will also allow me to improve my work space and equipment... because I sweat in my loft a lot. \u00a0I want to thank you all for being supporters via youtube, but even a bigger thanks to those who have decided to directly support me in CarBot Animations!\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u00a0GL HF\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003e\u00a0:D\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
