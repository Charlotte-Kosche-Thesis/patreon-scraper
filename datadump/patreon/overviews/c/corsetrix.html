Thank you for following along.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf\n you like corsets, there\u0027s a pretty good chance you\u0027ve read one of my \narticles for The Lingerie Addict, where I was a writer for 5 years. My current\nproject is \u003ca href=\"http://www.thedailywaist.com\"\u003eThe Daily Waist\u003c/a\u003e, a lingerie blog focusing on all things corset, as experienced by an expert corsetmaker and longtime wearer. I\u0027m really excited about this venture, creating a new hub for corset enthusiasts and education. It\u0027s my goal \nto create an inclusive space first with the blog, and then take The \nDaily Waist name to other platforms, such as a book on waist training, and eventually an app.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCorset Education\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I am a corset maker who believes passionately in educating my audience \u2013\n about how to recognize fit and quality in a corset, about the myriad \nphysical and emotional health benefits of a well-made (and properly \nfitted) corset, about how to find a corset that best suits their \nindividual needs, and so forth. I also write about the art and business of corsetmaking for Foundations Revealed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCredentials\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e My professional life at this point has come to revolve around corsets, \nand I studied corsets extensively through the coursework of my BFA and \nMFA in fashion design.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am best known for my innovative corset line \u003ca href=\"http://www.popantique.com\"\u003ePop Antique\u003c/a\u003e as well as my popular corset-focused column for \u003ca href=\"http://www.thelingerieaddict.com/author/Marianne\"\u003eThe Lingerie Addict.\u003c/a\u003e I also work at \u003ca href=\"http://www.darkgarden.com\"\u003eDark Garden\u003c/a\u003e (a legend in corsetmaking, and the longest practicing corsetiere in the Americas), and was a founding Corset Fellow for the \u003ca href=\"http://www.conferenceofcorsetry.com/\"\u003eOxford Conference of Corsetry\u003c/a\u003e.\n I have networked far and wide, and my opinions on corsets are informed \nby my own experimentation as well as direct experiences with other \nmakers\u0027 work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMe\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live in San Francisco with my wife and a minimum of \u003cdel\u003etwo\u003c/del\u003e\u00a0three cats."
