We aim to create timely content and commentary on the contemporary art world. And to broaden the discussion on the many facets of art and creation. We have two podcasts, The Undergang Armchair, and By The Way: A Contemporary Art News Podcast. As we grow we will be adding more podcast as soon as possible. We thank you very much for your support along this wonderful journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe history of the idea started in 2013, when Ando started a Copenhagen based podcast called The Undergang Armchair. The podcast presents in-depth interviews with internationally well-known artists, emerging artists, and key figures. Focusing on both Scandinavia and the world at large, it ultimately reveals the nuts and bolts of the contemporary art world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy The Way: A Contemporary Art News Podcast came to be as a new way to engage our audience up to date with art news with a twist. Two artist friends, Eric Wall and Ando, irreverently discuss news from the art world, while attempting to stay on topic the conversations. Each episode regularly touches upon the topics of culture, society, law, and politics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
