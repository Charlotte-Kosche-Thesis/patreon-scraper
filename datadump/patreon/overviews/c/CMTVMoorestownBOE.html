We unfortunately have more than one story of \"official\" recordings \"malfunctioning,\" being edited, or simply disappearing. True transparency is further ensured when the recording is \"crowdfunded\" by constituents  instead of paid for by the governmental body.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are many specific benefits of becoming a patron. Please check out the various \"rewards\" for what is available. Also, please look through the various fundraising \"goals\" for the many extra features we will be able to add in the future. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition to raising funds, this CMTV-Moorestown-BOE Patreon fundraiser provides a way for constituents to directly communicate with Citizens\u2019 Media TV (and with each other).

Executive sessions can be anywhere between fifteen minutes and two-hours in length. At the end of the executive session, the meeting is capped off by a final public portion. Sometimes this final portion is extremely short: they simply and quickly vote to adjourn the meeting, often not even sitting down. At other times, however, critical decisions are made at this time \u2013 almost always in front of an empty audience, and with no recording devices in sight. The only way for the public to know what happened is to read the body\u2019s own minutes; something not made available until they are approved at the following meeting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, instead, you can be assured that our cameras will be rolling the entire time.
