    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn 2014, we launched\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cityblocs.ca\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCityBlocs\u003c/a\u003e, a website to help citizens keep track of how their city councils vote through visualizations of their voting patterns. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn most cities, tracking how city councillors vote is actually a pretty time consuming process. Even though cities provide minutes of the meetings online, they are almost always presented as unstructured data, meaning that to get the councillors\u0027 voting records, you have to go through them by hand and translate the text into usable data. This makes getting this information laborious and error-prone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, we want to expand the project: we want to\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eunlock voting records\u003c/strong\u003e from city council minutes using tools we\u0027ve built, develop \u003cstrong\u003etopic classification algorithms\u003c/strong\u003e to classify what the votes are about, build other \u003cstrong\u003et\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eools to make the data more useful\u003c/strong\u003e and make all of the data \u003cstrong\u003efreely available\u003c/strong\u003e as easy-to-use data sets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, support from patrons has allowed to create and maintain a dataset of council voting records for\u003cstrong\u003e London, Ontario\u003c/strong\u003e. We\u0027re also holding a vote to add a second city in February 2016!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe data will be regularly updated and posted for all to use at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cityblocs.ca\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ecityblocs.ca\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0At the end of every month in which we reach a milestone funding goal, all CityBlocs patrons can vote to decide which cities or feature upgrades will be added next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, the datasets contain:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eevery motion that comes before council;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea classification of the motion by topic using automated methods developed by Centrality;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ehow each councillor voted.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eThe dataset for the first city funded under this project is available here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cityblocs.ca/api/v0.1/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://cityblocs.ca/api/v0.1/\u003c/a\u003e. If there is something else that would make the dataset more useful to your project, please let us know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many different types of questions that these data can more easily provide the answer to than going through minutes by hand, or -- even worse! -- attending every council meeting in person. As the project develops, it will consist of more than just datasets, and we have plans to add features to the website, such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eREST API: This will allow users to download subsets of the database in a variety of formats, in addition to downloading the CSV files.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBrowsable interface: This will allow users to directly access the data from the website without using the API.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore advanced query options: For instance, you could query the database to see what percentage of votes were lost by the sitting mayor or how often pairs of councillors vote together. (You can do this with the CSV files if you want, but this will make it easier.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpgraded vote classifier: Automatically classifying text is a difficult problem, and adding additional power to the vote classifier will make the classifications even more accurate.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCouncillor profile pages: This feature will summarize city councillors at a glance. Ever wanted to know which councillors were most similar in their voting patterns? Which councillors end up voting on the winning side most often? This tool will help.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\nUsing these data, we hope citizen groups and researchers will make tools and analyze the data to help us all better understand our governments, journalists can more easily see what\u0027s going on their city councils and all of us can benefit from knowing what\u0027s going on in city hall.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027d love to continue to do all of this with your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s involved in the project?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been hard at work developing a Python library useful for extracting data from city council minutes. The project so far has also involved writing a simple motion classification system using a dictionary method, classifying motions by keyword. We also need to maintain the database infrastructure, and expand the website to include a number of useful tools. Funding will allow us to cover these ongoing costs, and all money raised goes directly into making CityBlocs better and available for more cities.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho\u0027s working on the project?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a project by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://centrality.ca\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCentrality Data Science\u003c/a\u003e, based in Calgary.
