Our efforts\u00a0are unlike any other comics-related podcasts out there. Whereas\u00a0others focus almost entirely -- if not exclusively -- on the mainstream superhero fare, we do something different. We are more concerned with\u00a0alternative, indie, and primarily non-superhero titles, and as such, we help draw attention to comics that might fly under most people\u0027s radar. We are especially interested in discussing the work of, and interviewing, creators who do great work but need more attention. So in supporting \u003cem\u003eThe Comics Alternative\u003c/em\u003e, you are also indirectly supporting the artists by helping \u003cem\u003eus\u003c/em\u003e bring attention to their work."
