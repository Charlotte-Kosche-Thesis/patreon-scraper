    "summary": "Two years ago, I gave up my passion for wedding photography after I was diagnosed at 26 years old with ALS\u2026 I\u0027m slowly becoming completley paralyzed. I can\u0027t carry a camera anymore, but recently I said fuck it and mounted it on my wheelchair.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI started doing street photography in Redlands, CA. I\u0027m in love. I realized that my wheelchair destroys all social boundaries. I get to capture raw, authentic, and photojournalistic encounters in neighborhoods, streets and alleyways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter viewing some of my work, I hope my supporters will better understand a different perspective. A perspective in which everyone you encounter is so incredibly nice, a world where no one is intimidated by your physical appearance and eager to have a conversation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027re all looking for happiness, for purpose and to overcome adversity.  Underneath it all we are all the same just fighting a different battle and should not be ignored on the street or denied a simple smile.  What would the world be like if we shared love with this kind of intensity with everyone.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goal isn\u0027t to create \"pretty\" images but to capture a moment in time that will remind us about the impermanence of life and the need to breakdown social boundaries that are prohibiting us from loving one another fully. I just hope you enjoy and feel something. Yes, I realize I sound like a hippy. I don\u0027t care, it\u0027s worth it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSubscribe to my photography for $5/month \u0026amp; you will:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBe helping me continue photography despite my disability.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReceive access to an exclusive online photography gallery that will give you access to images not displayed to the public.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePermission to download ALL images in the gallery for free!!! (personal use only)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMost importantly, you\u2019ll be directly helping me fund my mom\u2019s nursing care. (more info below)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOh, also, I\u2019ll be following all my Patreon supporters on Instagram + twitter\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eALS is incredibly expensive\u2026 and there\u0027s two of us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy Mom has ALS too\u2026 she has progressed to a point where she\u0027s completely immobilized and requires total care 24/7. We have a beautiful nurse that we are hiring full time that we can\u2019t afford ($3,800/month). Until my mom\u0027s medical needs are met, I am giving 100% of all proceeds to my mom\u0027s care. Anything left over will go to my current and future medical expenses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy mom and I plan on fighting a long fight but this fight is financially draining. Our insurance companies will gladly put my mom in a nursing home but will not cover continuous home-care. Our family is working hard to change the problems with insurance coverage for ALS patients. My mom created\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.change.org/p/tell-als-association-improve-home-care-for-als-patients\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTHIS PETITION\u003c/a\u003e to help the entire ALS community solve this problem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you give love, I want to give it back. If by a miracle, I was able to fund our medical expenses indefinitely with my love and passion for photography\u2026 I would be speechless. I would\u2026 take my camera wheel-chair out every healthy day knowing that every single image I take has a greater purpose\u2026 and I would also pee my pants and cry my face off!!! Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your consideration and continuous support \u0026lt;3 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewebsite: \u003ca href=\"http://www.AnthonyCarbajal.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.AnthonyCarbajal.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003einstagram: \u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/carbajalphoto\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.instagram.com/carbajalphoto\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003efacebook:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/TheAnthonyCarbajal\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/TheAnthonyCarbajal\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003etwitter: \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/carbajalphoto\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.twitter.com/carbajalphoto\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0#rollingstreetphotographer #nurse4mom #kissourALS\u003cbr\u003e"
