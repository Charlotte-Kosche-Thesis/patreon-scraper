We have all shown our work regionally (except for the baby). We have collaborated together on some pieces, as well as embarked on individual work. Our oldest even collaborated with another prominent local artist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoel, the papa, is part of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://truroartsociety.ca\"\u003eTruro Art Society\u003c/a\u003e Executive. This is an exciting endeavour that helps build the community of arts, patrons, and the potential of beauty to change a region. He as been a photographer and videographer for more than 25 years. In the past 15 years he has embarked on a journey of illustrative and multi-media work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAE, mama, says: \"I love to create. Growing up I was encouraged to build and experiment with materials, colour and texture. I always chose art class when I had electives, have taken many art workshops on mediums/topics that interest me, and was apart of an arts group at UNB. I find it difficult to restrain myself to one or two mediums. I enjoy painting with acrylic, watercolour and encaustic, drawing, using pastel, pencil crayons, mixed medium, modified found art and making jewelry, just to highlight a few. \u003cbr\u003e\nOnce I had my first child, I changed to textiles. They are much easier to clean up and allow a toddler to play in your workspace. All 3 children now have a deep love for all things in the fibre arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe each person is created with gifts, talents and abilities meant to give life and to advocate for those around us. For me, a large part of that is expression through art and design.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe children draw, paint, sew, and create daily. This is a practice in our family. The more we practice, the better we get.\u003cbr\u003e"
