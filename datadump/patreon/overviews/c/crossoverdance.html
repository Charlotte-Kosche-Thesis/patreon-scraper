    "summary": "Crossover Dance Studios is a unique place. It\u0027s a dance studio for sure, but over the last 6 years we\u0027ve cultivated a reputation for being a bit more than that. Take a step inside and you\u0027ll see, XO is a place for dancers. An internationally known spot for b-boys to jam, a gathering point for street dancers, a place to just relax and hang out and a place to train and improve yourself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been fairly free and welcoming to dancers from all over the world to come and use our space and usually ask only for a coin donation. But it seems counter productive to ask this from you guys every day, and the trick of hunting for coins in the couches is getting out of hand. So we\u0027re going to try out using the Patreon to see if it makes this easier for everyone! Despite popular belief XO doesn\u0027t run on goodwill, so we do have actual costs such as electricity, maintenance, cleaning and equipment. Every little contribution helps us to keep going!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d like to stress that this is completely optional. A donation is a donation, so we\u0027re asking you for help but not demanding it. Also if you\u0027d prefer to keep just chucking coins in the bowl then all good too! But if this sounds like something you\u0027d like to get on board with, we really appreciate anything you can contribute! The most important thing is that we can keep having a space for people to just dance. And together we can! Let\u0027s keep enjoying dance! XO!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
