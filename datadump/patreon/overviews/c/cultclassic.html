My pattern\u0027s always been the same: spend a lot of time obsessing about an idea, do a lot of work real fast, show it publicly once or twice, then abandon it all entirely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThat\u0027s not a sustainable way to make great stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eWhen I started working on my second one-person show, I knew I needed to do things differently. When Hayley Johnson and Let\u0027s Comedy started a Guerrilla Theatre Open Mic in Fort Wayne, I hoped that would be a good place for me to start playing with some of the ideas I want to explore. It\u0027s been better than I could have expected.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery two weeks I go up with fifteen minutes of new content related to my next show \u003cem\u003eCult Classic, Not Best Seller. \u003c/em\u003eAfter I sent the recording of one of those chunks around to my inner circle, it seemed like it might make sense to turn this into a podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m doing this through Patreon (and asking for donations) because all of this is really rough. It\u0027s probably not ready for public consumption and it\u0027s \u003cem\u003edefinitely \u003c/em\u003enot the way I want people to come to this work for the first time. Having said that, if you\u0027re one of the awesome people who\u0027ve had my back as I\u0027ve worked on stuff in the past and you want to see (and hear) how this next thing is coming together - here\u0027s your chance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePodcasts will come out twice a month, no more, rarely less. \u003cem\u003eCult Classic, Not Best Seller\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is an exploration of sexuality in the 21st century. It\u0027s super NSFW, and even more NSFPWRTM (Not Safe For People Who Are Related To Me.)"
