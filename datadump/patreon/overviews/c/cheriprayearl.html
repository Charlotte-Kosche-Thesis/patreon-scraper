My\u00a0current novel projects are for adults, even though so far I\u0027ve published books only in the children\u0027s market; in fact, my literary agent is shopping my latest middle-grade novel around at this moment. I\u0027ll let you know how that goes. If it goes. Ah, the publishing world. I\u0027m also a big \u003cem\u003efilm \nnoir \u003c/em\u003efan, which you\u0027ve already guessed from the images I chose for this page, and I can\u0027t resist a good murder mystery--in a book or on the screen.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have a large immediate and extended family and two rescue dogs named Lizzie and Darcy. Yes, I\u0027m a dog person, and okay, yes, their names are pretentious.

After losing my husband to cancer last year, a hard but awakening experience, I made an honest assessment of my life and came to the conclusion that I don\u0027t spend much time doing what makes me happy. So I decided to ignore reason and try being a full-time writer. After all, spinning stories into novels is what I love to do, and I\u0027ve noticed that life doesn\u0027t stand still and wait for us until we\u0027re no longer afraid to take a step. So I\u0027m stepping up now; I hope you\u0027ll come with me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAn Offer You Can\u0027t Refuse\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo be a full-time writer means I have to support myself by writing rather than teaching.

I\u0027m a big fan of murder mysteries, in film or in books, so I\u0027ve decided to write a murder mystery novel on Patreon, scene-by-scene. I recently lost my husband to cancer, a hard hard experience that has pushed me to take this first step toward becoming a serious, full-time writer. Life is too short to be afraid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRMZohvk7EojaEtYvdk-jgrk2CtmVqF-32gQAJI9II-7dYhOoZJtg\" style=\"width: 306px; height: 165px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eI have a big immediate and extended family, two dogs, and a house. I\u0027m lucky to live in the West near the mountains and I love cold and snow. I\u0027m also a big film noir fan, as you\u0027ve already guessed from the images I chose for this page and my homepage. \u003cbr\u003e",
