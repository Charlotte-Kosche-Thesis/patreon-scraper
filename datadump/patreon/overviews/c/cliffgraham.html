I want to briefly share why I am using this format to deliver new content to my readers from this point on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBackground\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2006 I began writing my novel,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eDay of War\u003c/strong\u003e, about the battles of King David and his warriors. I envisioned it being the first of five novels called the \u003cstrong\u003eLion of War series\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI had to write it in my spare time.  During the day I worked full-time on the ministry staff at a church. In the evenings I was a full-time seminary student, and on  weekends I was fulfilling the remainder of my service commitment as an Army officer in the reserve component. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor several years, from 10 PM to midnight on every evening I could stay awake, I researched, developed, and wrote the novel. I spent time in Israel studying the terrain, interviewing experts, and visiting the historical sites to make it as authentic as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe finished novel\u00a0was eventually picked up by Zondervan, an imprint of the major publisher Harper Collins, as part of a two book deal. Filmmakers soon optioned it to be produced as a major motion picture franchise.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the time since the initial publication of \u003cstrong\u003eDay of War\u003c/strong\u003e, I was able to release its sequel \u003cstrong\u003eCovenant of War\u003c/strong\u003e through Zondervan. I also created an early reader program where I could release the third book in the series, \u003cstrong\u003eSong of War\u003c/strong\u003e, to a limited number of readers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNeeding a creative break from the Lion of War series to keep things fresh, I also published a novel about the Biblical character Caleb named \u003cstrong\u003eShadow of the Mountain\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0through the publisher Bethany House. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition to my novels I have released occasional short stories in my \u003cstrong\u003eHall of the Mighty Men\u003c/strong\u003e series, a spinoff of the \u003cstrong\u003eLion of War series\u003c/strong\u003e that tells the origin stories of characters in the novels.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe next step was producing a couple of podcasts, since many people prefer audio methods to engage with content. One podcast was for my interview and teaching series, named the \u003cstrong\u003eGood Battle podcast\u003c/strong\u003e, and one was for audio productions of my \u003cstrong\u003eHall of the Mighty Men\u003c/strong\u003e stories.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the course of my years spent writing, I have also been part of an operations team working to rescue children out of trafficking, launched a program to bring people to Israel at an affordable rate, and have been blessed with many opportunities to teach about the Scriptures, the Old Testament in particular, at conferences, churches, and other venues.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWorking on these projects has been an incredible journey. Based on reader feedback, they have been a blessing to many. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, due to budget restrictions, rights issues, and many other unforeseen challenges, I was unable to release new content for the last few years. I tried a subscriber-based model on my author website to fund more projects, but the management was so burdensome that there was no time to create new material with excellence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe New Model\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor a while now, I have been searching for a service that can generate the revenue we need to produce my work while also having an infrastructure robust enough to allow me to have the time to develop, write, and publish books with full creative control. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTraditional book publishers continue to be a great option for many authors and I am grateful for those I have worked with in the past who have helped establish me as a writer. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the content and design of a book, as well as its release schedule, is ultimately at the discretion of the publisher and not what the author envisions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy books are aggressive in tone and style, and contain material that can be edgy for some readers who are accustomed to gentler Bible-based fiction produced by other authors. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince my books focus extensively on the wars and battles mentioned in the Bible, the editorial process with a traditional Christian publisher results in a \"sanitized\" version of the stories, edited to please retailers and a broad Christian base. I certainly don\u0027t begrudge this; the industry need to make a living.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is the first platform I have encountered that offers me a chance to create and release my work on a more consistent basis, and to do so with complete creative control. It is a way for you, the reader, to have a direct hand in the creation of my books while preserving their original vision. It also allows a more direct, tangible relationship between author and reader. I have tried many methods of achieving this, and many of you have been with me on the journey for years. I believe this is the path forward.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOther Projects\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n My readers and listeners have always known that my projects are about more than just entertainment. The core mission of my work has always been to spark interest in the Bible, especially among men. I am deeply honored to count among my readers those who might never read a \"Christian\" book otherwise. Copies of my books have accompanied Navy SEAL teams on deployments and prison chaplains in cell blocks. They have been purchased by mothers of teenage boys eager to find something that will inspire their sons to read the Bible. Fathers have read them with their sons when they come of age. Guys have passed them around to buddies as a way to begin conversations about spiritual matters. It is humbling to see ways my books have made an impact and what they have come to mean to many people. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n In addition to creating books and teaching, I also wanted to create opportunities for men to engage in the great battles of our age that they should be more involved in, such as fighting human trafficking and exploitation. To do this, we created the Gibborim program. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eThe Gibborim Program\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nGibborim is the Hebrew word for \"Warrior Men,\" and is a program for ordinary guys to challenge themselves in the way that King David\u0027s warriors did 3,000 years ago. Attendees learn many new skills and are informed of ways to become involved in helping the most vulnerable in society.

My books will eventually be available to a mass audience upon publication. However, I need to shift to a model where most of my work is available primarily to the patrons who helped bring it to life. Even as projects become available to the general public, patrons will always have access first. \u003cem\u003e(Just a quick note that if you are an original Warpath member from the past few years, that program\u0027s terms will still be honored).\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAn update website and devotional material.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI have been asked many, many times about the timing of book releases, the status of my current projects, how production of the Day of War movie is going, whether I am still alive, etc. I will now be able to share updates on a consistent basis for patrons.

Using the historical and geopolitical context of the narrative in 1 and 2 Samuel, we will explore how God used this ferocious, passionate, and deeply flawed man to bring glory to Himself.
