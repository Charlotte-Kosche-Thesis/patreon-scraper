My two main digs are fantasy and solarpunk, and my fiction tends towards complex multi-storylined novels that center friendship, found families, and other non-romantic relationships. I build detailed universes and series, and would love to share more with you. Here are the two mains :\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIsandor \u003c/strong\u003eis a City of Spires of merchants family vying for power through trade wars. It\u0027s a high fantasy universe, with elves and magic and magic great classic tropes. Mainly trilogies and novellas (debuted February 2017)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBaker Thief \u003c/strong\u003eis a science-fantasy series of standalone novels in the fictional French ciy of Val-de-mer. Every novel shifts the focus on different characters, but they always feature one arospec MC (expected debut: June 2018)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of these are (or will be) published through the Kraken Collective, a cooperative of QUILTBAG science-fiction and fantasy authors I launched early in September with other amazing indie authors. Patrons will get to see more of them, vote on the content they want (reviews, extra fiction, worldbuilding, blogging), and chat with me any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write \u003cstrong\u003ea lot \u003c/strong\u003eand edit! If I could, I would spend my life with fiction--reading, writing, editing, gaming! And this is what this Patreon is ultimately about. The goal is three-fold:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eProvide more of my fictional universes to my fans. Especially Isandor! This world has existed in one for or another since 2006 and it is wide and deep. There are so many stories, small and big, that won\u0027t make it into novels! But here they can,\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTranslate my fiction from English to French. I write directly in English, but I \u003cem\u003elove \u003c/em\u003eFrench and it is an incredibly important part of my identity. Translations either cost a lot of money or a lot of time, however. Having my stories available in both language would give me warm fuzzies.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eQuit my day job and write for a living. This is a very faraway goal, and I hold no illusions about the work it involves, but I like to aim high and work hard!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eWe\u0027ll see how it goes, I guess! One thing is sure: every word of encouragement, every reader\u0027s squeal (and tears!), every dollar here? They make my days and keep me going. Thank you all so much for your support, now and forever. You are amazing. \u0026lt;3"
