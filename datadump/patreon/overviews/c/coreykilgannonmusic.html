    "summary": "Hey folks,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading.  I\u0027m Corey. I\u0027m about to turn 23, I live by the beach in Florida, and the moments when I\u0027m not pretending I know how to surf or playing with the cat, I spend most of my time writing songs, recording, or touring. I dropped out of college a few years ago to travel for a few months with friends playing songs, and found that since it has been hard to imagine doing anything else.  I\u0027m humbled by where music has taken me. I\u0027ve toured the country several times and even had the opportunity to play a bit in Europe, met hundreds of kind listeners, and opened for several of my heroes.  I\u0027ve been able to make lo-fi bedroom records, and work in one of the nicest studios in Nashville. The greatest honor of them all, is that I think a few folks out there have really connected to songs I\u0027ve written.  Songs are a huge part of my being. There are several to which I truly believe I owe my life. I do not take it lightly, and to have anyone listening is deeply meaningful.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently have a full length album\u00a0\"The Hollow II\" out, released last October.  It is a sonic/lyrical follow up to my very first EP.  It is the biggest endeavor of my life thus far. It\u0027s been a tough stage for me, in that I have hired a manager, agent, and publicist and a good bit of financial investment in the record.  That makes it very easy to start seeing this as a \"business\" which though it is, I strive daily to avoid that mindset. My hope for this Patreon page, is that it provides  a fun and interactive space for those of you who are real fans of my work, and that it gives me an outlet for some extra-creativity ...stuff I wouldn\u0027t typically release.  I\u2019ll be sharing exclusive content for Patreon, like voice memos of songs, some poems, maybe even some short stories from the road.  I would also love to hear what types of things you care to know/read! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m no stranger to odd jobs (construction, bussing tables, selling eye glasses, driving a pedicab, etc) and I will continue to work hard to be self sufficient through playing shows and making records. Your pledge will not only help me to do that, it will allow me to connect better with those of you who have supported me over the years. I want to use this page as an open line of communication, a place where I can share my ideas with you first. I would be honored if you wanted to be a part of it. Thanks for taking the time to read my thoughts on this, I\u0027m excited to see where we go from here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd be on the lookout for\u00a0\"Soften, Continue (Another B-Side)\" set for release in May 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eyours,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCorey\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I\u0027m Corey Kilgannon, a wandering singer-songwriter and restless soul. I was born in the outskirts of New York City but grew up on the coast of Florida, currently residing in Jacksonville, FL. Songwriting is so much more than just putting words to paper. For me it is a therapeutic process with lyrics and sounds that call to mind the inevitable loss of love that is so prevalent in human nature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m excited to share new music and release a new album that is the culmination of a journey I\u0027ve been on over the last 3 years. The new record will be out late fall in the fall of 2017 but in the meantime please check out some of my other stuff at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.coreykilgannonmusic.com\"\u003ewww.coreykilgannonmusic.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers!\u003cbr\u003eCorey\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
