    "summary": "I am an author and gallery represented mid-career working artist, whose main medium is collage and mixed media. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve traveled the country in a teaching capacity, sharing my love, not only for the art that I am making, but how the process of creating connects the artist to the authentic place inside of them to discover their own unique voice. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe artist\u0027s intuition. That place of knowing. The place we all have inside that recognizes what is right and true, even when we don\u0027t know how to speak it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI collect bits and pieces salvaged from old books and packaging material. Ephemera from lives past, and everyday flotsam most people would view as trash. As I move this material around the work table creating my designs, I marvel as I discover the humanity in each scrap. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eElevated worth as art. Previously unrecognized for the beauty it contains. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd in the process of creating, I recognize my own humanity, the worth within my own being, and the worth of all of humanity around me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI seek to create an inner dialogue and an outward conversation around the issue of self-worth and the perception of value through the use of the salvaged materials in my art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am ever aware of, and grateful for the support I receive as an artist, whether it is from the collector who connects with my work and purchases it for their office or home, the life-long learner who comes to the table in a workshop capacity to listen to me speak and learn the processes I share, or the reader of my words who reaches out to tell me how my writing impacted them. I delight in seeing those \"Aha moments\" coming to light in others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me on Patreon is not a one way relationship. Through helping me achieve my goals as an artist, I can help you discover and pursue your own. The main \"reward\" is entrance to my Patreon\u0027s And Peers private Facebook group. A virtual round table, if you will. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA sort of Beta group where I am able to share behind the scenes glimpses into my studio practice, while developing material for future e-courses and my next book.  You get the raw material, the unedited and live version. You get the direct interaction with each other and with me as these things are developed. Value for you, is the inexpensive monthly fee to have first access to the material I am developing, the value for me is to see how you respond to what I share. The value for all of us is the community support we build within the group.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis group will receive one exclusive monthly live broadcast from my studio, where I share what I am currently working on and demo some aspect of the work. These videos will be archived and available in the group for viewing as many times as desired, with the ability of the viewer to interact with questions on the technique or process I am sharing. There will also be a monthly live Q\u0026amp;A session, sometimes focused on a specific topic, sometimes as an open forum. These Q\u0026amp;A sessions will also be archived in the group and available for viewing anytime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Aside from the two regular monthly live broadcasts, I will randomly turn the live app on while I am in the studio- you get to have an occasional birds eye view over my work table, to be a fly on the wall as I work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also be editing down technique footage each month and sharing as a video in the group.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently we began a monthly art challenge based off the edited tutorial. Members get to interpret the challenge any way they wish in their own artwork and share their images in the group.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe group members also have access to exclusive Patreon blog posts, where I share about the life of an artist, insights to the creative process, talk about goals, work out concepts for a future book, and more. Sometimes the posts will feature guest bloggers, sometimes they feature members of the group.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you have goals as an artist and need a little accountability, or help understanding how to achieve them? This group is designed for you. The atmosphere will be open, community minded, peer-to-peer interactive sharing. A safe place for you to process your own work and goals as an artist or writer. I talk about my goals and how I break them down into manageable realistic steps and you have the space to develop a plan to tackle your own goals if you choose.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust looking for a place to share your work as you develop your style and find your own artistic voice? You can do that too. This is a place of mutual support and accountability. You get to decide how much, and in what way, you want to participate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you are already an accomplished artist, or just beginning a journey of discovery, you belong. Together we will celebrate each other\u0027s accomplishments, encourage each other\u0027s dreams, recognize each other\u0027s strengths and accept each other\u0027s weaknesses in an affirming way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTier levels are designed to build credits towards other incentives, as spelled out at each level, but include, building credit towards bi-annual gatherings in my physical studio space, building credit towards a private or semi-private workshop, a summer residency, or building credit towards limited edition prints and original works of art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreons and Peers. Let\u0027s do this thing together. There is room for us all at the table.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith love and gratitude,\u003cbr\u003eCrystal\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027ve recently expanded it to just over 1000+sf to accommodate the large works that I\u0027ve been creating and make it more feasible to host workshops and events. It isn\u0027t just a place for me to make art, it is the place I want to build community. At this level, I can maintain the studio rent and expenses + continue to open the virtual doors to you in the Patreons and Peers private group online. Artists need to feel connected to be able to reach their fullest potential. Think of the private group as having a space in the building where you can walk down the hall when you\u0027ve been isolated in your own studio too long. Live broadcasts, archived videos available for repeat viewing, group discussions, problem solving, goal setting and achievement, guest artists and professionals from the industry. If enough people join, we can do round robin swaps and set other group goals together. Helping me keep my studio doors open will help this community thrive.",

My idea wheels are turning on a \"book without pictures\". I poured my heart out in the writing portion of my book \"The Art Of Expressive Collage\", but the format was more technique and image driven. I want to share the why behind the art making. The intuitive stuff that I share with my students when I teach, tapping in to the inner voice and authentic self and making discoveries through the art making process. I want it to be an art making guide on how to develop your own process, and find your own voice, in a sometimes humorous, sometimes serious, short story memoir kind of way. Reaching this level will assist me towards setting aside some precious studio hours to focus on writing.\u00a0",

Finding more representation is a big goal of mine, including looking in the area closer to home- Milwaukee, Chicago. One of the often overlooked expenses of being an artist is the amount of cash required on the artists behalf up front. Framing, shipping artwork, booth fees, traveling to openings, etc. is all out of pocket before a sale is ever made. This level will enable me to pursue more representation without fearing I can\u0027t afford the expenses involved to get started. And I get to share the experience with the Patreons and Peers group online, helping others in their quest of developing a professional art practice along the way.",
