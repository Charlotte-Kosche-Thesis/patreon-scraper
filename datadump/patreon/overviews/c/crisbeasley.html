We\u0027re all inside inconvenient bodies trying to figure our shit out in a world that seems to only get more chaotic, uncertain and lonely. I have been writing since December on a handbook of embodied exercises to build tolerance for emotions, both the happy ones as well as the dark ones we\u0027d rather numb out to. The bad news is that if you want to feel the good emotions \u2013 joy, wonder, contentment in small daily pleasures, compassion \u2013 you must accept the dark ones also \u2013 grief, sadness, despair, fear. The good news is that the more you learn to feel your emotions the *less* they run your life. This card deck present you with a short exercise to do this work. Each card has a number which corresponds to a chapter in the handbook which explains what to do, why and the latest cognitive research that backs up how it works. It\u0027s a bridge between practices passed down from traditional cultures and modern understanding of how brains and bodies make sense of our world."
