The show was birthed from the married hosts, Jon and Lisa\u0027s, desire to expand their own knowledge of music as well as to share it with others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Story So Far:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEpisode one was recorded and released on September 9th, 2017 from our apartment in Alaska. We chose to release it through Soundcloud due to it\u0027s ease of access and reliability. After releasing our first handful of episodes, we were pleasantly surprised to see how many hits we received. Our fifth episode, which discussed Brand New\u0027s fifth studio album \u003cem\u003eScience Fiction\u003c/em\u003e, has reached 600 plays on Soundcloud alone and continues to rise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow An Episode is Made:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAn album is selected by us, or you (email requests to canomusicpodcast@gmail.com)\u00a0 and an artist or guest is asked to help review it depending on availability. We hope to review music of varied genres and popularities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe research and listen to the music throughout the week. This happens through our drives to work, intentional listening and lyric reading sessions in the apartment, watching interviews online, and reading other reviews and articles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext, we typically record the episode on Saturday mornings. We grab our drink of choice, set up our interface and condenser microphones and discuss the album sitting around the table. The discussion takes one-two hours while it\u0027s recorded through Logic Pro X.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the recording is complete, Jon edits the episode for one-three hours. During this process, audio is adjusted, trimmed, deleted, and EQ\u0027ed. Example tracks, bumpers, sound effects and other flair is added as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe episode is then exported and uploaded to Soundcloud where the RSS feed is attached to iTunes and Google Play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Thanks:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you are a weekly listener, a monthly listener, or even a one time listener we want to thank you for your support. Your plays, reviews, and comments directly validate the need for our show. We hope that through listening you are coming away with a greater appreciation for the music around you. Please continue to send your feedback and reviews in hopes to create a better podcast and informative experience for our listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Love and Thanks,\u003cbr\u003eLisa and Jon\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
