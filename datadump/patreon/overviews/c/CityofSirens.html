I love a good murder mysterious, a juicy psychological thriller and a fun supernatural, fantasy series. This series is all those genres wrapped up into one epic graphic novel series about a vigilante, serial killer hunting, siren aided by her angsty former fianc\u00e9e, detective Reilly Stanton, and her diabolical and currently incarcerate serial killing mother, Lilith Carver. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe series follows El and Reilly as they work together to solve crimes and murders and navigate their way through the dark alleys and back streets of the city, deal with mobsters and gangsters, bust human trafficking rings, stop the twisted political agendas of the wealthy and elite, defeat crazy god like psychos who wanna watch the city go down in a blaze of flames and gun fire and track down your every day garden variety bad guys and nut jobs. It\u0027s American Gods meets Sin City meets Silence of the Lambs and it\u0027s gonna be fun and dark and scary.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://pro2-bar-s3-cdn-cf3.myportfolio.com/dc6ca34ea6d7a1dce5f4987f230b8617/448073a8fd8b9b83aa4ad7d6_rw_1920.jpg?h=78fc6e7f99c91275d9104047b0367728\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSeries Synopsis\u003c/h4\u003eSeven years ago Elizabeth Carver found out the truth about her mother. She was the Crimson Rose Killer, a vicious and volatile serial killer that had been plaguing the city of Sirens for years. Ever since that day she has been on the run, trying to escape the past, trying to find out who she is apart from who her mother wanted her to be and why she has a knack for tracking down bad guys, thieves, murderers, serial killers, monsters, gangsters, thugs and pedophiles.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b8/40/d8/b840d83f25cde1618212f191f0126003.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eShe spends her days going from town to town, never settling down, chasing monsters, proving to herself she isn\u0027t like her mother, until the day she is called back to where it all started, her home town, New Port City, aptly nicknamed the city of Sirens because the Sirens never stop. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce back in town she returns to face not only an old enemy, but all the questions that were left unanswered, all the people she loved and left behind, all the consequences her disappearance has had on a city plagued with crime, murder, crazies and corruption.
