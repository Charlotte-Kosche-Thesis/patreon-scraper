    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eBoard game video reviewer Ben Eddings had a small but loyal viewership. His folksy lo-fi review show \"Cast The Bones\", created in his own home, made him a small living and gave him a sense of purpose. But now Ben Eddings is dead. \u00a0And his story has caught the eye of a journalist, Sophie Bakerleigh. What happened to Ben Eddings? Who is uploading videos, pretending to be him? Why is his cult still growing? And who is the true designer of the sprawling, poisonous board game The Lord Of Blank Faces?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHi, my name\u0027s Rab Florence. I\u0027m a writer and director, and I sometimes do a bit of acting, if it\u0027s absolutely necessary. I sometimes do a bad American accent too, which you can soon enjoy in this very project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always been interested in the notion of storytelling in unconventional forms. With \u003cem\u003eCast The Bones\u003c/em\u003e, I\u0027ll be attempting to produce an online TV show that, on the surface, seems to be a show about reviewing board games. A show that, over time, develops into a dark, occult thriller with a black comedic streak. So, yes, a review show that will give you the heads-up about the latest and greatest games. Every review, as this poor, doomed character Ben Eddings, will be \u003cem\u003ereal -\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ea genuine review from the heart. But each review will also be a developing step towards a really awful place where heads get chopped off and hooded figures chant inside caves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m serious.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs someone who grew up in a world with only four TV channels, I\u0027m fascinated by how the internet has created a generation of cult personalities, with significant online followings, who go on to create intense relationships with their viewers. I\u0027m fascinated that we live in a time where individuals who begin as hobbyist consumer advice vloggers can start to influence viewers\u0027 decisions, lifestyles and politics. I think that world, the world of the accessible, corruptible internet personality - and corruptible audience - is ripe for a dark, supernatural, satirical twist. I want to tell a story, over the months and years ahead, about an online personality\u0027s descent into madness, and about the audience who follow him there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s also worth saying that the story I\u0027ll be telling goes into some very dark places, and so it\u0027s likely that at some point down the line you might not want to let your kids watch. This isn\u0027t a \"family-friendly\" review show, is what I\u0027m saying. \u00a0You don\u0027t \u003cem\u003eneed \u003c/em\u003eto be interested in board games to watch this, either. The reviews act as a framework for a broader story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve gone to Patreon to attempt this thing, because what I really need to make it all happen is ongoing support - and more importantly, an ongoing \u003cem\u003eaudience\u003c/em\u003e. As a recent convert to the potential of Patreon (I\u0027m also one third of the Consolevania Patreon team - https://www.patreon.com/consolevania)\u00a0I think the best people to ask for a little bit of support are the good folk of that very \u003cem\u003especific \u003c/em\u003eaudience that this show is aimed towards. I dunno if enough people will want to see this show, but I hope so, and I can only reach out to find out. Do you like weird TV? Are you concerned about the influence of YouTube on your kids? Do you enjoy Lovecraftian stories? Do you like pen and paper RPGs? Do you like weird old board games from the 70s and dark paperback books with really weird covers from the 60s? Do you like HP Lovecraft? Do you like black comedy? Horror films? Arthouse stuff? What about HP Lovecraft? Then you might like this show I\u0027m planning. Your support will allow me to slowly build out Ben Eddings\u0027 world, and take this experiment into some weird places as we go on down the road. We\u0027ll also be able to chat about some amazing board games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love board games, and wrote about them for over six years on the PC gaming website Rock, Paper, Shotgun under the Cardboard Children guise. Here\u0027s a peek at one of my favourite columns from that time -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/08/27/cardboard-children-heroquest/\"\u003eCardboard Children - HeroQuest Review\u003c/a\u003e. I have a comedy series on Netflix called \"Burnistoun\", where I always tried to sneak in some Lovecraft references.\u00a0I\u0027ve also made a horror film, called \"The House Of Him\", that you can watch on Amazon Prime for free right now. AintItCool said it chilled them to the bone. I\u0027m working on another film at the moment too, called \"NOGAKU\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I need to talk about board games again. Just like poor Ben Eddings.\u00a0He played a game called \"The Lord Of Blank Faces\", you see, and then it was all over for him. And all over for everyone else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why don\u0027t you come Cast The Bones?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
