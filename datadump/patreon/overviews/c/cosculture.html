Here you can sign-up for subscriptions and support the magazine by becoming a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCos Culture Magazine is an independent print publication dedicated to the art and culture of cosplay. Established in 2014, the magazine has featured cosplayers, photographers, and artists from around the world. Each issue features tutorials, interviews, and photo spreads, and is 100% independently published with absolutely zero advertising.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeginning in 2017, Cos Culture will re-launch to include more great content. We will be initially scaling back our publishing schedule so we can focus more on creating high-quality content, and increasing the value of each issue! Please check out our milestone goals and help spread the word so we can reach our next milestone and \u00a0increase our publication schedule. We have set a series of milestones, and will increase our publication schedule with each new milestone met. Once we meet our first milestone, we will go ahead with the first issue of 2017! (Hint: It\u0027s going to be AWESOME, and will feature music)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout us:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCos Culture Magazine was founded in 2014 by Nikko Marie. The magazine has been distributed to stores across North America since summer of 2014, and increased to a subscription-based bi-monthly print schedule in 2016. Beginning in 2017, the magazine will be switching over to Patreon for all of our subscriptions, and we will be scaling back print publication to focus more time on each issue. With each new milestone we meet, we will increase publication. The ultimate goal is to release every month, and we need your help to get there! Because we don\u0027t rely on advertisers, the magazine runs solely on our supporters and financed by Nikko. Let\u0027s get together to support the cosplay community and help spread the positive message this magazine sets out to promote. Support indie!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCos Culture Magazine is committed to supporting the cosplay community. If we pass our final milestone, additional funds will go back directly into the community by way of grants and bursaries to cosplayers, photographers, prop-makers, and artists. We look forward to the opportunity to sponsor the work of the many talented people in this community."
