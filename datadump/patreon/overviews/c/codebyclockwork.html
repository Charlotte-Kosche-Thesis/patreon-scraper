For example, if you have a dungeon crawl with 3 encounters in it, you could make 3 scenes, and in each scene have the requisite monsters added along with notes on their combat strategies and pre-laid traps. Once that scene arrives in game, you simply open the scene in gCalc and will be able to quickly start combat utilizing the functionality already set down by the \"GM Control Board\" feature gained at the $80 pledge level.",

The Encounter Tracker will exist on the GM Control Board and will allow you to easily track and manage combat scenarios for each scene. When a scene arrives, the Encounter Tracker will autopopulate with all Enemies and PCs in that scene (in speed order of course) and will allow you easily rolls attacks, change initiative order, and track the HP/Fp/Conditions for all.\u003cbr\u003e",

This will allow for very fast DR and HP calculations, speeding up combat significantly. For example, a PC may open their \"short sword\" options and select \"orc #3 and \"skull\". When the player hits attack gCalc will automatically roll the attack, the prompt the gm to select a defense (with optional modifiers) and then roll the defense. If damage is dealt, gcalc will then reduce orc #3\u0027s HP, taking into account hit location and wounding multiplier.\u00a0",

However, any auto-calculations that were done by your character\u0027s native app (GCS/GCA) will not work on gCalc, so if you up your Strength, for example, you would need to then go update the fields that rely on Strength manually.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, because gCalc does not talk directly with any of these other apps, if you were ever to upload your character again from one of these other apps and overwrite your character you would lose any of the changed data.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a very large update with a lot of moving parts, but has been oft requested, even with the caveats set above, and so I am pleased to announce that it is on the roster!",
