For example, you all probably have heard how bad the noise is on one of my microphones. With your help I can get a proper set of wireless microphones, which will not only improve the audio quality, but make it much easier for me to do reviews at events.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future I hope to be able to make high-quality event videos, and maybe even live streams as products are released at shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy plan is that I will be asking you, the patrons, first when deciding what to review and what I will cover. I will also be making special content for supporters, including behind-the-scenes videos, special and alternate takes of reviews and also provide high-res versions of my photos to use as wallpaper on your computer if you wish.  You will also get first priority if you wish to ask for my help in choosing gear to buy, or for my best supporters, if you wish to buy something from Japan that you can\u0027t get where you are I\u0027ll arrange that for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs direct supporters of the content being created, you\u0027ll have access to the Patron-only feed or and Discord chat, we can discuss upcoming ideas and I\u0027ll take all your feedback into consideration. If I\u0027m at an event, you\u0027ll be able to contact me directly and almost instant feedback on questions about products on show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, as I have something of a collection of free gear from manufacturers (as wonderful as that sounds, almost all of it is not stuff that I want or need and it just fills up my cupboards) I\u0027d like to give it away. Who better to than people who support me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so much for your support, and I look forward to making more great videos with you all!\u003cbr\u003e"
