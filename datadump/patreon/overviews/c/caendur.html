Over time, I began writing more for my own sake, as a way to cope with my depression and simply because I like the creativity of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven before I started writing, though, I wanted to be an author. All my life I have dreamed up my own worlds and filled them with my own stories, and I have always enjoyed sharing these things with the world. And that\u0027s what EternaCore.net is all about, sharing my creations with any who want to take part in them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my hope you will find the novels and short stories I put there to your liking and will find it in your heart to help me get a little closer to my dream of supporting myself by telling these stories, of devoting myself fully to this calling of mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHumbly,\u003cbr\u003eCaendur"

This one would require finding someone to help me out with some coding to be done the way I really want to do it, but even without that it would be a fine addition to the site.\u003cbr\u003e- Short stories: Voidwalker isn\u0027t the only thing I\u0027ve written, and this would allow me to expand the site with a section devoted to those tales which have nothing to do with Bareuin. Be they sci-fi, cyberpunk, or just fantasy in a different setting.\u003cbr\u003e- Bareuin Campaign Setting: Maps, cultures, important people, historic events, legendary artifacts, and assorted jibber-jabber about the world of Bareuin (where Voidwalker takes place).\u003cbr\u003e- Reviews, analyses, ideas, etc about games: I do, technically, have a degree in game design/analysis/research.
