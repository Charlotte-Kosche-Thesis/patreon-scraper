    "summary": "Hello brothers and sisters. For 3 years now you have been standing with me and my facilitation partners to reach out to the public in effort to bring everyday people together to heal the wounds of racism through connecting through \u003cstrong\u003eContact \u0026amp; Conversation\u003c/strong\u003e. We have successfully opened minds, touched lives, and inspired real action in battling American racism and it\u0027s deleterious personal and social effects! I\u0027m Darryl Aiken-Afam creator of the \u003cstrong\u003eContact \u0026amp; Conversation Mindfulness-based Racism Reduction Method\u003c/strong\u003e, and we need your help to continue to bringing \u003cstrong\u003eC\u0026amp;C\u003c/strong\u003e to local and neighborhood venues, Colleges and Universities, churches, libraries, art galleries, business organizations, and gathering places of all kinds where people can come together in safety, united in Oneness and compassion with \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 0); background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ean earnest desire to be able to have genuine and effective conversations with others outside of their race that yield lasting results\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy joining and subscribing to our Patreon page, you will allow us to continue to do this very important and timely work unabated. The costs of renting venues, travel, materials, promotion, logistics, etc add up quickly and has on many occasions hindered us from bringing Contact \u0026amp; Conversation to those who have asked for it. Requests from Dallas, Boulder, Chicago and other cities for our services have been on a waiting list as we try to gather resources to train, equip and certify local individuals to hold Contact \u0026amp; Conversation events in their cities and neighborhoods.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNow more than ever before as racism bares its ugly teeth all around us everyday through social media, law enforcement, hate groups, business and government institutions, and the White House, we MUST stand together and consistently take on the challenge to reduce racism NOW in our time! We might not be able to get rid of racism completely, but we most certainly can lay the foundations for the healing process to begin today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJOIN US!"
