    "summary": "Over the past 3.5 years I have created Chi Time Radio in the UK. Initially this was an hour long monthly show on a community station with interviews and music on the varied themes of 21st century well-ranged well-being. My guests are a wealth of local, national and international well respected teachers, authors, speakers and musicians, that I had to squeeze their awesomeness into 10 minute interviews, to get three on each show, plus tunes, which didn\u0027t seem fair, having gone to the effort of organising, connecting and preparing. I knew there was enough content to create a weekly show, but was held back with time restrictions and sound engineering challenges.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn April 2015 I was awarded the \u0027Most Improved\u0027 radio show trophy on 93.7ExpressFM, wow, thank you! and in June I began creating a weekly show on the Soul Traveller Radio network along the same lines, but now each guest could have a whole show and choose a couple of tunes. Fortunately, Shayne Locke, who runs the 24hr station and so much more, stitches Chi Time\u0027s components together for mass listenership, or it would not get on the air, it was always the technical stuff that eluded me somewhat, so its necessary I hand that kind of skill over. Shayne is getting busier and busier as his world expands and Chi Time is a constantly evolving job too, help! I need to be able to employ a sound engineer and researcher, as to keep up with the necessary level of research this show has become know for, I need assistance..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have noticed a marked increase in requests to join in with Chi Time via various social media platforms since joining Soul Traveller Radio and really need to increase the Chi Time Team to get things grooving along to a whole nutha level :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you in?\u00a0Can you spare a dollar for assisting the continuation?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePersonally, I have a free range approach to a home, having a shared place in northern Austria and when in the UK, house sitting for friends. During my excursions around and about, Chi Time, plus Chi Kung \u0026amp; Meditation, have been a constant resource for me. To be able to talk with some of the key thought leaders, teachers, authors and artists of our time, has been fantastic source of learning, assisting my process and progress of managing my life creatively and to pass the experential information on to those in my field of awareness. I have been a teacher of Chi Kung and Meditation for over 15 years and have recently backed off from the amount of sessions offered to re-connect with my chi and some of those observations are shared in Chi Time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings need to become more sustainable for me now and as much as I love to create Chi Time I also need to be able to follow its lead and create a bigger network of effective and funky connections. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is time to ask for assistance and offer you a possibility of becoming part of a fast growing scene. You, me and the Chi.\u00a0 If you could offer something of a pledge, to boost our potential to reaching thousands, maybe millions of open hearted people, the wonders of the Patreon programme platform will spread the rest and we get Chi Time guest wisdom shared with many, many more souls, uplifting the creative community of like-hearted souls willing the planet into repair and sustenance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show is transmitted via \u003ca href=\"http://www.soultravellerradio.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.soultravellerradio.com\u003c/a\u003e on a Thursday 7-8pm with the repeat on the following Tuesday 8-9pm. This is local time in 3 different time zones: Australia AEST, UK and US, PST.\u003cbr\u003eI would like to continue offering the show to ExpressFM but really require assistance for this to be possible, then we can look at syndicating the show on other networks, whaddaya think?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be eternally grateful and enormously appreciative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you kindly\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out some previous shows via my website \u003ca href=\"http://www.claraapollo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.claraapollo.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eD\u0027ya wanna know who I\u0027ve had on?\u003cbr\u003eOk, here goes and in no particular order, just how I remember them:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeale Donald Walsch\u003cbr\u003eDiana Cooper\u003cbr\u003eDr. Masuru Emoto\u003cbr\u003eBarefoot Doctor\u003cbr\u003eLorna Byrne\u003cbr\u003eRobert Holden\u003cbr\u003eKyle Gray\u003cbr\u003eJamie Catto\u003cbr\u003eTim Wheater\u003cbr\u003eRebecca Campbell\u003cbr\u003eJill Purce\u003cbr\u003eTim Freke\u003cbr\u003eCharlie Morley\u003cbr\u003eSandy Newbigging\u003cbr\u003eWilliam Rand\u003cbr\u003eSika Deer\u003cbr\u003eSue Stone\u003cbr\u003eBecky Walsh\u003cbr\u003eSandy Humby\u003cbr\u003eAnn Wilson\u003cbr\u003eSharon King\u003cbr\u003eTim Whild\u003cbr\u003eMarty Daniels\u003cbr\u003eLucinda Drayton\u003cbr\u003eRob Greenfield\u003cbr\u003eRoss Bartlett\u003cbr\u003eDavid Wells\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd soooo many more\u003cbr\u003eHop over to \u003ca href=\"http://www.claraapollo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.claraapollo.com\u003c/a\u003e for more Chi Time information!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
