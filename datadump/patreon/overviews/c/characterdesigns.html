I started the site back in 2005 as a photo reference site for figure drawing and other artist-focused resources, so it\u0027s been around for a decade now! People have always asked if they could contribute or donate to the site, but I\u0027ve never figured out a solution that worked for the benefit of both parties until Patreon came along.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\u0027s why I\u0027m here today! As some of you may have noticed, the website\u0027s core structure has become dated and difficult to use over the years, and I\u0027ve been meaning to overhaul the site so that it can be fully functional as a proper learning resource. A lot of that comes down to time, as I teach on the side to make ends meet and keep the site alive. With your support, I\u0027d be able to free up more time to refocus on the site, rebuild it and get back to helping everyone in an easily accessible way. Your support would help me book models and pay for locations for new photo shoots as well, so that I can start updating the site regularly again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAs patrons there will be photoshoots that are for your eyes alone, as well as higher resolution photo resources. Please consider becoming a patron for further benefits!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a lot of experience as both a concept artist in games and a character design teacher at Art Center College of Design, Gnomon School of Visual Effects and Otis College of Design, so this is also a great chance for me to share some of that knowledge with you all! Let\u0027s grow as artists together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
