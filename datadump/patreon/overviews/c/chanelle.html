I\u0027m going to see if this works for what I have in mind.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst\u003c/strong\u003e, I really do need to be paid for the work I do. If you want to do that, \u003cstrong\u003e$50 a month\u003c/strong\u003e is dope.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSecond\u003c/strong\u003e, it is clear that folk got upset about a list a wrote...O.K. Most of that list was directed at Black and Brown people in generational poverty. What was disheartening was so many people telling me about their situational poverty or how they mama was poor all they life. What Black and Brown people face isn\u0027t a situation- it\u0027s a system. So, you want to help to break it?!?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThird, \u003c/strong\u003epeople\u00a0like eating too and you know what, that\u0027s a natural right. People exist = they need food to eat.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you just happened to come across this account and have no idea who I am, I\u0027m an organizer for Black Liberation- freedom for Black people away from White supremacy and patriarchy. I believe in helping people and supporting people and that\u0027s why I made this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf you came here to harass me, I may...may not be in the mood...just depends. Just being honest. Don\u0027t do it tho.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#LetsGetFree\u003cbr\u003e"
