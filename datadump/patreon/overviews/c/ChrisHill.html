    "summary": "Doing this work is my oxygen and it\u0027s what excites me to get out of bed every morning.\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to change the world around me, and that will always be my driver. I spend a TON of time creating content, in order to make that happen. Literally, twice a week I work through the night creating meaningful content. I\u0027ve also responded to every single email that has enteted my inbox, every career related question received on Facebook, and I\u0027ve never turned down a podcast interview, college lecture, or reasonable charity request. These are the ancillary affects of being a content creator - which is great, but when it pulls fromy full time gig as a chef and restaurant operator, it puts me in a dilemma. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow much is my time worth spent creating content, plus doing there other things as well?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, I\u0027m not sure, this is where you come into play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0haven\u0027t asked for much. I hate charging for e-books and other things - it seems petty. Honestly, I\u0027d like to offer ALL of it for free, so starting now, EVERYTHING is free, unless otherwise stated. If you just bought my ebook, shoot me an email or message on here, and I\u0027ll reimburse you. (Email is Chris@bachelorkitchen.com )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead, I\u0027m asking for a small monthly donation. How much? That\u0027s up to you and what feels comfortable (you\u0027ll see different perks with different monthly amounts). I\u0027m not looking to get rich off of your donations, just something small that shows you appreciate what I do, find it valuable, and want me to continue doing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis way, all of my writing, talks and books will reach another million people, and I\u0027ll be able to create even better content, more frequently, and with your support, it\u0027ll all be free (well, it will technically always be).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will allow me to put some money back into advertising, in order to spread the word, reach more people, and have a bigger impact on the world around us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to sustain a life out of making a difference in people\u0027s lives, so I hope you\u0027ll consider supporting me in a way that is safe for you. It would mean the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you are able to, help or not, my content is and will continue to be free. I\u0027ll keep inspiring y\u0027all in the best way I know how.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxo - Chris Hill"
