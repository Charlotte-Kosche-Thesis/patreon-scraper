XD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the course of 2017, our goal will be to keep you informed on the progress of Maid Mansion and deliver the game on time (\u003cem\u003eshould there be any delay whatsoever; Patreon, Kickstarter and Twitter will be our main avenues for updates\u003c/em\u003e). This Patreon will serve as the main focus point on our current status as well as help fund other games that we put on hiatus during late 2016 to focus on \u003cstrong\u003eMaid Mansion\u003c/strong\u003e. With your help in funding here, not only could we \u003cstrong\u003ere-start my other visual novel\u003c/strong\u003e, but it would \u003cem\u003ealso\u003c/em\u003e help me continue with a \u003cstrong\u003ecard game I was working on\u003c/strong\u003e for much of last year as well. \u00a0You might be thinking, \"...a card game, you say?\" \u00a0Me: \"Yes indeed!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo while our focus will begin with visual novels, \u003cstrong\u003emy dream for Crazy Cactus Entertainment is to have a variety of different game types in its portfolio\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0I don\u0027t want to be limited to just visual novels, and that\u0027s where you all come in! Those of you who pledge here, have my utmost gratitude - plus, it would be my honor to bring you along for the ride. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s to 2017!\u003c/strong\u003e"
