Think of my reviews as a running commentary of goings on by a kid that likes explosions, crossed with a woman that is tired of seeing the use of certain plot devices and is not afraid to boo in their general direction. You know which ones.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be reviewing Game of Thrones as well as a show currently being voted on by my supporters, episode to episode, as they come out and I\u0027m hoping that with your help I can add more shows to my schedule.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou may know my particular brand of bizarre and critical from my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://chrysreviews.com/index.php/game-of-thrones/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/a\u003e recaps. These reviews will be a more coherent and rational extension of them and will be posted\u00a0on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://chrysreviews.com\"\u003echrysreviews\u003c/a\u003e as well as here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works:\u003c/strong\u003e Each month you can contribute a specific amount. Think of it as a subscription for as low as a dollar a month. You get to choose how much you want to give and you get perks depending on that amount. (I am open to suggestions about more of them.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do it:\u003c/strong\u003e If you enjoy my recaps, you\u2019ll probably enjoy my reviews and this would be a way for me to do more things, like new shows, older seasons of shows and maybe even movies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWait, reviews? \u003c/strong\u003eWell, since I use copyrighted material for my recaps, I\u2019m going to do a text version of them which you can help fund. Not to worry though, recaps will continue for the shows I review.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m really excited for what this could potentially mean for the future and I\u2019d be very grateful if you helped me see it through.\u003cbr\u003e"
