As a Patreon you receive access to exclusive content and other great perks from the artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I am choosing Patreon for supplemental funding?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt took me a year to wrap my head around the idea of asking for support for my art. I then realized that every time I rent or go to a movie or download a song I am supporting an artist trying make their passion pay. Patreon created a platform for this to happen. Patreon\u0027s platform has been the source of over 100 million dollars being exchanged between artists and the people who support and enjoy the work they do. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStreet/Documentary photography is my life\u0027s work and\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eI want you to be a part of my ongoing journey\u003cem\u003e.\u00a0A\u003c/em\u003es a photographer I take to the streets etc and capture photographs and share them with you \u003cem\u003ein exchange\u003c/em\u003e for your support. The Patreon platform and the funds I receive will allow me the privilege to continue my passion for photography while extending my reach not only here in Seattle, but in other cities and around the World.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Chad, why not just keep sharing your photos on Facebook and Instagram?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eGreat question!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a 10-year ongoing apprenticeship in the streets and \u003cem\u003ehundred\u0027s of thousands \u003c/em\u003eof photos captured I feel like it\u0027s time to take another leap of faith. I need to connect with more people and new subcultures. The funding my Patreon project will provide allows me to extend my reach and not only free me up to shoot more and take on new projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0As familiar and comfortable as I am shooting here in Seattle, that is the very reason I feel the need to explore, grow, and capture the essence of other people in other cities as well as insight from the street photographers who shoot in those cities. We have been getting by financially by supporting my passion any way I can, currently I am working at 4am as a \u003cem\u003e\u0027Chef in Training\u0027\u003c/em\u003e in a restaurant which grants me my afternoons to shoot, in addition my fiance, Joni, (incredibly supportive) has worked extremely hard to take up the slack, forever grateful. \u00a0Street photography is a very challenging genre of photography to make a living at yet it inspires so many people around the world. Many times it\u0027s a free look into real life in places across the world.. \u00a0If my work brings a little value or entertainment to your life please consider becoming a patron. My goal is to break the mold of 99% of street photographers and actually make some money, I will give as much of me and my work as I can in exchange for you coming along on the journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eLead by Example:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wouldn\u0027t feel good about asking you to come along on my journey if I too didn\u0027t support \u00a0artists whose work I admire. I love the arts and admire those who make a go at it at any cost. \u00a0I found Patreon to be a very simple, logical way to support the work of other artists. I looked through a bunch of Patreon profiles about 8 months ago and found an artist I really liked, I began supporting his work with a few dollars each month and have been supporting him every since. In return for my support I get more exclusive access to his incredible time lapse drawings, videos, and emails, it makes me feel good knowing that I, along with a bunch of other people collectively allow him to keep creating while turning his passion for art into income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Street Photography is so important to me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI venture out from the apartment building we manage in the city\u00a0to take photographs every chance I get. I have sacrificed a successful professional career in sales in order to document my time here and feed my passion for connecting with people. Sometimes these \u0027connections\u0027 only last a fraction of a second and in some cases, years. \u00a0It started out as a way for me to learn how to use the settings on a camera my mom bought me. Truthfully, I had no idea that street photography even existed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor nearly 10 years now, I have shared my photographs freely with family, friends, and anyone who wants to see them. The experiences I have gained and lessons I have learned through the lens have been life transforming. \u00a0My end goal being to create emotion, imagination, interpretation and conversation. The vision I have for my efforts is that people will perpetuate my work for future generations to look at.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope one of my contributions to society will be the thousands of hours I will spend in my life walking the streets interacting, capturing, and sharing photographs and stories of strangers with future generations while creating a little compassion, wonder and hope along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you are compelled to support my work, here\u0027s how:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst, I would love to chat with you individually on messenger, text or a phone call in order to clearly express my purpose for why I do what I do, why I feel it is significant, and why your support would be so important to me.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:chadxlyons@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEmail Me Here\u003c/a\u003e for my contact information if you would like to chat!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShould you wish to support my work in exchange for some creative rewards select the level you would like to support me at. \u00a0You can choose as little as a dollar or as much as wish, I will in turn offer you rewards such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eExclusive Content\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eAccess to my Podcast\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eDownloadable prints\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eJournal entries\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eStories\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003ePostcards\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eBehind the scenes videos\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eStreet Photography Tips\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003ePrints\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
