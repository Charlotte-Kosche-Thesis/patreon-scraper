I\u0027m thrilled you\u0027re reading this and are thinking about being a part of my silly little corner of the interwebs!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA bit about me, I\u0027m a cosplayer ladynerd who has a degree in Film Costuming from Columbia College Chicago. I\u0027m a third generation seamstress who\u0027s been cosplaying seriously since 2013 when I graduated. \u00a0I\u0027m probably most well known for my Lana Cosplay and all my Starfires, but I Cosplay a wide range of characters, from movies to cartoons to comics and anime! I also Volunteer my time and sewing work to Critical Care Comics, a Charity in my city that brings comics hand delivered by superheroes to Children in hospitals to help brighten their days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCosplay is my true passion, I love to sew and create more than basically anything else on the planet, and spend almost all my free time doing so. I have so many costumes I\u0027d like to make and Ideas for projects I have, but I currently don\u0027t have the resources to create everything that\u0027s bouncing around in my head! Several of my friends on social media have shown interest in me doing new characters and getting more shots, so I figured this would be a good way for us to work together to create the nerdy content we want to see! This Patreon will go to fabrics and materials for my work, as well as being able to pay some of my amazingly talented photographer friends to do more expansive shoots/videos. If this is something you\u0027d like to contribute to, I thank you with all my heart!\u003cbr\u003e"

If I manage to get to this point with my Patreon I\u0027ll be able to pull back at my job to focus on cosplay more, so I\u0027ll be able to do builds faster and shoot more for you guys! I\u0027m thinking it would be one character based cosplay shoot, and one pinup or boudoir shoot that may be cosplay ro may be 50\u0027s cheescake but we\u0027ll figure it out if we get there!",

The problem has been I just don\u0027t have the resources and time to shoot and edit as many videos as I was doing a that time, especially after my lighting setup was stolen from my car. If I get to this tier, I\u0027ll be able to get new lights, update the quality of everything, and reach the point where I can set more time aside to film and edit! Patrons would get first look at my youtube uploads as well as maybe your names in the credits if you\u0027d like!\u003cbr\u003e",
