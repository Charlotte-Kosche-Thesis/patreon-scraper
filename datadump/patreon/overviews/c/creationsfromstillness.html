    "summary": "Hi \u2013 I\u2019m Mahasweta, and painting is an extension of my spiritual journey. My gift (without any formal training) of being able to create paintings was revealed to me in 2010, and I have enjoyed creating from this place of stillness (intuition) since then.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA couple of years back, I began working with David Gulotta, my mentor and teacher and friend, and as I worked at the Gulotta Studios,  I was introduced to working with good quality paints, brushes and canvas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s when I realized, having the right art supplies, makes the art flowing from stillness so much more authentic and efficient. The right tools for any job make such a difference in the quality and finish of the final product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my case though, affording the higher quality supplies is not easy and  I often have thought, having  a patron of arts support my art would be such a blessing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Joined Patreon and How You Can Help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so, coming across this site feels like a dream come true \u2013 because Patreon takes the benefits of crowdfunding, and combines them with the tradition of art patronage. Now, artists no longer need a single patron who can provide a lot of support \u2013 but rather, a community of friends and supporters who serve as a \u201ccollective patron\u201d, with just a little bit from each person, per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help I can afford to work with the those good quality art supplies, and it won\u2019t break anyone\u0027s budget, because many small donations can and do add up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to be able to buy some Old Holland paints and professional quality brushes and canvas. Then, over time, I\u2019d like to be able to spend more of my time painting \u2013 creating from stillness. And with your support, I know I\u2019ll be able to; \u201cmany hands makes light work\u201d as the saying goes \u2013 even $1 each month makes a big difference when enough people participate. Please click the \u201cBecome a Patron\u201d button and select how much you want to pledge per month. And a huge Thank you in advance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy website :\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://creationsfromstillness.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCreations From Stillness\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

What do I mean by \"stillness\"? In terms of my paintings, I mean the pure creative intuition that flows, when my thinking and analysis is out of the way. I get some general inspiration about what each painting will be, but then the actual creation is a a flow of stillness through me.",
