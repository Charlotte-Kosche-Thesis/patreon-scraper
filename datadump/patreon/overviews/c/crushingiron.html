We are a couple of guys, Mike and Coach Robbie, who have have created over 125 podcasts (released every Monday and Thursday) all focused on demystifying triathlon for beginners, intermediates, and seasoned veterans. This page is built specifically for helping us with costs associated with podcasting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe simply love triathlon and want you and the sport to flourish by building a community of great people. We\u0027ve been sharing our enthusiasm for years on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://crushingiron.com/moms-daughters-and-ironman/\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://crushingiron.libsyn.com\"\u003epodcasts\u003c/a\u003e, through\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://crushingiron.com/coaching/\"\u003ecoaching athletes\u003c/a\u003e, and by making high quality race tribute videos like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_VZV8TGmaeQ?ecver=1\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Situation:\u003c/strong\u003e We are Mike Tarrolly and Robbie Bruce, two guys who met through triathlon. Robbie helped coach Mike to his first Ironman finish in 2013 at age 50. Throughout that time Mike journaled that experience on CrushingIron.com and Robbie was a frequent contributor.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the next three years, Mike finished three more full Ironman and several shorter triathlons, all with Robbie as his coach. They began thinking about a podcast, but the timing wasn\u0027t right. Robbie moved to Kansas City and the podcast started for real by Skype in November 2016. Now that Robbie is back in Nashville and we have big plans for Crushing Iron, including our first triathlon camp in July. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q-dIC37f6vE?ecver=1\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s 2018 and we have over 125 podcasts and nearly 1,000 published articles on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.crushingiron.com\"\u003eCrushing Iron\u003c/a\u003e. We\u0027ve also produced multiple race videos that have been watched by 10\u0027s of thousands of triathletes on YouTube and Vimeo. The seed is in place, but in order to take this all to the next level, we need some support. Not a ton but some so we can make more rich content that helps triathletes succeed in races and life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way Patreon works is a supporter can donate\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ean amount of their choosing\u003c/strong\u003e and that donation recurs each month. Any donation, from $1/month up, is hugely helpful to the cause.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We\u0027ll Use the Money For\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many costs associated with producing a podcast: Equipment, time, storage, hosting, etc. Anything you can afford will go directly to making sure the podcast is viable and will continue.\u003cbr\u003e"
