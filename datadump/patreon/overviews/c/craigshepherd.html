As being a content creator is a costly\u00a0way of life, money is a struggle (especially if you don\u0027t have a job like me). There are so many things I wish I could do but I can\u0027t because\u00a0they in some way require money. Patreon will allow me to create the content that I want\u00a0to create and will help to fund my future projects.\u00a0 Thank you so much for your interest in helping me out, it really means a lot to me. The benefits won\u0027t just affect me, not only should you enjoy the better content, but being a patron there are the added bonuses of facetime calls with me, exclusive live streams and early access to my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cu style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eWho am I?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eIf you don\u0027t already know me from my YouTube channel or from my social media, my\u00a0name is Craig and I was born on the 29th of January 2001 in Edinburgh, Scotland where I still live today. Ever since I was young I have loved being creative, I would go running around my house singing and dancing and then when I was 10 years old I was given my\u00a0first camera. With my camera, I would go out and make little movies with my friends of me exploring the woods and stop-motion\u00a0animations of cars and play-doh. I would also just record me doing random things throughout my\u00a0days. This all led to me starting my YouTube channel in 2013 where I could share my\u00a0creativity with the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI first started making random videos about my pets and videos of me cycling on a bike track in the woods near my house (which can no longer be seen). Throughout the past 5 years of me making videos on YouTube, a lot has changed, from me making short films to unboxings, tech videos, tutorials, reaction videos and finally to vlogs where I have found my way of sharing my\u00a0life with the world. My vlogs are generally videos of what I am doing in my life, showing me as a person dealing with my successes and my failures alike, however, doing the vlog I go to cool places and do fun things which I would never usually do if I didn\u0027t make vlogs. This not only makes fun, interesting vlogs\u00a0but also improves my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhere Will Your Money Go?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eYour money will go into paying for new tools that I can use to improve my content, such as Epidemic Sound for\u00a0music, new camera and lighting equipment\u00a0and also to fund future projects of mine, maybe some short films and some clothing in the future?? With the help of you people, I can do more fun things in my videos and even start travelling around the world.\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e"
