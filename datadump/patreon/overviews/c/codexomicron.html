    "summary": "I am Omicron, and I write fiction on the Internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am the author of original Quests (a form of serialized interactive fiction) on the Sufficient Velocity forums, as well as the serialized novel \u003cem\u003eShould the Sun not Rise\u003c/em\u003e, and have further projects for novel writing to pursue in the future. Although I also write derivative works, this Patreon aims at supporting my original work, which I can actually monetize but for which it is more difficult to draw an audience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI dedicate much of my time to creative writing. I consider this a hobby rather than a line of work I am pursuing, but in the future, and with your help, this might change! With your patronage, I would be able to dedicate more of my time and effort to writing, and quality as well as output would improve. As of this Patreon\u0027s launch, I intend to update each of my Quests at least once a month, while \u003cem\u003eShould the Sun\u003c/em\u003e will continue on its weekly schedule. With your support, I may be able to sustain more active works.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your following and your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eActive Works:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://shouldthesun.wordpress.com\"\u003eShould the Sun not Rise\u003c/a\u003e is an original novel set in a urban fantasy setting.
