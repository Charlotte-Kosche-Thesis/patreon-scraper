    "summary": "Hi everyone! My name\u2019s Cannon, and I\u2019m here to share my love of music and help people further their own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been playing guitar over a decade now, with nearly two decades total of learning music. I\u2019m extremely proficient at reading music and sight-reading, have received several years of both formal and informal instruction on music theory in addition to my own studies, and have tons of both live and recording experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why am I here? Well, I love to teach. Few things in the world make me happier than helping someone reach their musical goals. But lessons are expensive, right? It can be hard for many people to afford, especially for young adults. I know many people out there who have a huge drive to learn and wish they could but simply can\u2019t make it work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I want to offer an alternative. I have a *huge* collection of lesson material and sheet music, and I mean proper huge. I\u2019m also constantly writing more material and recording new videos all the time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I want to do is offer all of that in one place, a well-organized resource of practice material that has tons of content with more being added on a regular basis. And most importantly, I want it to be affordable for anyone that wants to learn.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is absolutely no obligation. I do what I do every day (writing music and practicing and recording) because I love it, as much of a cliche as that may be. I appreciate every single bit of support I receive, monetary or otherwise. I wanted to do this to be able to offer something more to those who are interested.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what\u2019s all this mean to you, potential patron? It means you get access to a constantly growing compendium of my practice material, TAB and sheet music of all sorts of different techniques and style. Ideas to keep you on your toes and make sure you never again feel like you\u2019ve got nothing to practice.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019ve made it this far, thank you. Just taking that time is something I\u2019m seriously thankful for. And if you\u2019re intrigued by what you hear and feel like contributing, then I look forward to going on this journey and helping some people with their own musical pursuits. Thanks again! :)"
