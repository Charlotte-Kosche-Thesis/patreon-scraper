    "summary": "My name is Chelsea and there are two things I\u0027m passionate about: Creating comics and my family! (Not necessarily in that order.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore I had my son, I worked as an elementary school art teacher in Maryland. I was told I could stay home and retain my job within the county for two years (pretty sweet, right?) Unfortunately, the policy changed while I was on leave, and I was forced to resign. So now I\u0027m a freelance cartoonist. So glamorous, right? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see my work here and on MomComic.com. I\u0027ve also had work featured on the Huffington Post. Check it out! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/20-hilarious-comics-that-show-you-just-cant-win-while-parenting_us_5720cf3ce4b0b49df6a9b94d\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/20-hilarious-c...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/15-hilarious-comics-that-tell-the-down-and-dirty-truth-about-pregnancy_us_57394508e4b060aa781aa288\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/15-hilarious-c...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also occasionally experiment with other comics and art forms. Sometimes I\u0027ll post my political comic, Penny the Pissed-Off Pussy. I\u0027m currently working on some personal illustration stuff which I\u0027ll be posting soon (I LOVE getting feedback from my Patrons!). I\u0027m going to start doing some Patron-only time lapse videos of my drawing process soon. Basically, you never know what you\u0027ll find on my page! Well, you\u0027ll definitely see Mom Comic, but there\u0027s other stuff too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, I hope you consider contributing to my work. Pledging to me will help me continue to publish super funny comics for you! Also, it will help me feed the babies. They\u0027re the main source of inspiration and Mom Comic will really suffer if he starves. Plus, I think I have some pretty cool rewards at different levels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for looking at my work, and I appreciate anything you would like to give. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/c6wjvck.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(A picture of me when my son was tiny and I was not pregnant with baby #2. Now he and I are both much larger.) \u003cbr\u003e"
