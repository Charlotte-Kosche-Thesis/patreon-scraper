    "summary": "I have found that automotive videos and articles that try to teach come out bland or too monotone. I aim to fix that with more entertainment along with the education and help those who struggle with automotive subjects. I will do this with fun videos and story style writing that draws people in without it being too distracting from the core lesson.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, Carbage should be more than that and that\u0027s another reason why I feel that you should support us. I have a plan for Carbage beyond just being anything close to a hobby and I\u0027m not on here to just say \"Hey, pay me!\" The plan is this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Use Patreon to fund better equipment and travel expenses to get to tracks, shops, or where ever the stories are at.\u003cbr\u003e2. Use Patreon to fund Carbage to hire more writers, photographers, and videographers.\u003cbr\u003e3. Eventually move away from Patreon when Carbage becomes self-funding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, as you can see, I have a grand scheme for Carbage and hopefully show that I\u0027m not just your average Patreon or social funder, looking for money to have fun or buy expensive crap. I want Carbage to grow and prosper, to give someone else a chance to do what they love doing for a living wage, and become a major media and news source in the automotive industry. It\u0027s not lost on me that this still takes time, effort, and sacrifice even with Patreon, but this is something I\u0027m willing to dedicate my life to and I fully understand the challenge before me. Through Patreon and your monetary support, it makes the challenge a little more affordable.\u003cbr\u003e"
