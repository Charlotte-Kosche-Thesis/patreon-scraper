I\u0027m James Wynne, you might recognize me from my articles at \u003ca href=\"http://www.gamezone.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGameZone\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve been writing about games for a couple of years now, and it\u0027s something I\u0027d love to put more time into.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter winning a small writing contest held by GamesBeat, with an article about \u003ca href=\"http://venturebeat.com/community/2014/06/28/maturing-into-wind-waker-and-nintendo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ematuring into Zelda\u003c/a\u003e, I was hooked. I tried to break into the games writing business by writing for tons of small websites \"for exposure.\" It was terrible, but eventually I did get gigs as a freelance writer for pay, mostly at Game Zone. My time working my way up in the business has let me see firsthand the kind of shady dealings that go on in video games media, and it repulses me. Advertising has rot the core of most small gaming sites I\u0027ve dealt with, and everyone already knows the questionable nature of the larger ones. I don\u0027t want to be involved with a system I think is mostly broken, but I want to continue with my passion for all things gaming. To that end, I have turned to Patreon in order to break free of an industry that\u0027s more advertising than journalism, and a community that\u0027s becoming increasingly belligerent towards ideas its members don\u0027t like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to evoke the spirit of 90\u0027s gamer culture, a true Golden Age of Gaming. Innovation was everywhere, even in sequels! Political correctness was a joke, but acceptance in the gaming community was at an all time high for anyone not named Jack Thompson. It was during the 90\u0027s that women became major stars in games, and portrayals of minorities increased and, while stereotypical at times, were mostly positive. I don\u0027t recall people clamoring for these things to be pushed, but the industry was healthier and more well rounded at the time, so diversification occurred naturally, without backlash.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe 90\u0027s were a time when gaming was ahead of the social curve, the big names still innovated, and the community wasn\u0027t toxic. Maybe that\u0027s the point we need to return to before we, as gamers, try to right the ship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
