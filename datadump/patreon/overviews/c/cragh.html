    "summary": "Greetings and Welcome! My name is Crag Heydar, a.k.a. Crag\nHeyder, of Prentil Studios and I am an independent game designer/developer/programmer and Artist.\nMy project is Swords of Vridhan, which sets you, the player, in the land of the\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.prentil.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGreat Isle of Prentil\u003c/a\u003e. Prentil\nis an epic fantasy world created by co-collaborator \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/prentil?ty=h\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNick Greaves\u003c/a\u003e. Swords of Vridhan is free to play, and will rely solely on donations to continue development and refinement.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently under development using the glorious \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eUnreal\nEngine 4\n\u003c/a\u003e, Swords of Vridhan is a switchable 1st/3rd person perspective\nfantasy role playing game in which you develop your character by increasing attributes\nthrough training and skill use. Questing is a big part of the Swords of Vridhan\nexperience and players will directly and freely affect the political and\neconomic environment of the world. As a\nplayer, you can explore this strange new world, clear areas of monsters and wilderness\nto make towns and help civilize the land. Or, if you prefer, you can become a bandit who preys on the weak and the\nunwary, or a lone adventurer who carves out their own niche in the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur ultimate goal is to create a fully immersive MMORPG, but\nwe plan to achieve this goal through a series of releases.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe first release will be a standalone single player version\nof the game. This will allow us to work\nwith you, our players and supporters, and fully develop our character\ndevelopment, inventory and combat systems.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe second release will allow players to host their own game\nservers. As a host, you will be able to\ncustom configure your version of the world of Prentil and invite friends to\nplay along. Host a monster battle, a\nsocial event, or a PVP match \u2013 it\u2019s all up to you!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe third release will incorporate the persistent universe\nand the world clock. Each host that\nchooses to do so will be linked into a central server that will control the\nworld\u2019s timetable and sync all of the individual host servers together. This will allow us to push content, make\nupdates to the overall world status, and maintain a universal leaderboard. This release will also introduce the world\nlineage system. No longer will you be\nlimited to the life of a handful of characters. The Swords of Vridhan will give you the ability to perpetuate entire\nbloodlines. Carve out your own piece of\nthe world and create a legacy!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe fourth release will be the full MMORPG. But the beauty of this release is that all of\nthe previous versions of the game will still be fully functional. Play the game on your own, run your own\ndisconnected fully customized world, run your own interactive version of\nPrentil, or immerse yourself in the full MMO experience \u2013 the choices are\nyours!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe final version of the game will introduce functionality\nthat will make the Swords of Vridhan truly unique. As the players complete the first saga of the\nPrentil game, they will be introduced to the capability to travel to different\nworlds! The Swords of Vridhan will\nexpand beyond the world of Prentil and open up our players to an entire\nuniverse. Take your sorceress to the old\nwest, or your knight to a world with advanced technology. The possibilities will be endless. If we can think it up, we will program it!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can download the game here:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://prentil.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5\u0026amp;t=6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSwords of Vridhan Pre-Alpha R1\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
