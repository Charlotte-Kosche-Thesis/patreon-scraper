I made a GameWisp page which I happen to prefer in terms of giving you stuff since it has notifications, soon to have emotes, and was simple to use. However, some people simply like Patreon and I thought it might be nice to let the fans choose which way to support me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a patron for me will allow me to continue my works keeping me financially stable for the most part. I\u0027m learning how to manage my money so that everyone can benefit from my work whilst I still have a roof over my head and a way to work! Every dollar counts and goes a long way! I hope you may become a patron and enjoy what I love to do and make!"
