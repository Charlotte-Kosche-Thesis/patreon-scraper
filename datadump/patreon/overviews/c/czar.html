No, the text is unstable and, with few caveats, can be edited by anyone at any time. Yes, the text is generally good enough for an overview, the main condition for which I\u0027d read it. No, the text is written by schmucks and often without regard for the reader. Yes, a few hundred articles are impeccable. No, one should never cite an encyclopedia. Yes, you\u0027re unlikely to find a better overview on the non-core topics either in print or online. Wikipedia is an imperfect encyclopedia, but it\u0027s the best we\u0027ve got.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe trick to reading Wikipedia is to remember that it\u0027s inconsistent. Articles that look like garbage are likely garbage, and articles that look like serious business are likely serious business. By and large, the garbage articles were written by many anonymous editors. Each added a bit and did not care to attach the references to the right claims. By and large, the serious business articles were written by diehards who scoured the best available sources to accumulate, in one place, what no other medium would dare publish: an exhaustive treatment of what most people would want to know about the topic. Wikipedia will live and die as the free encyclopedia (\"freedom\" undergirds its gratis content), but in your lifetime, you will know Wikipedia by its increasingly common quality content was thoughtfully \n\u003cem\u003eedited\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0by someone with the wherewithal.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eThe chase\u003c/h1\u003e\nI write articles on video games, education, and art, though I edit broadly.

The subjects of my work (for example, most of the above) would not otherwise have this level of overview in a public repository. For a taste, some current projects include the 31 titles included in the recent \n\u003cem\u003eRare Replay\u003c/em\u003e compilation, the complete works of radical pedagogue Paul Goodman, and a rewrite of \u003cem\u003eDemocracy \u0026amp; Education\u003c/em\u003e for the book\u0027s centennial anniversary. I am also a visiting scholar with the Smithsonian on a collaboration with contemporary African artists.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027d like to be able to work on older games, which requires more time in recovering sources from the dustbin and is less rewarding in a utilitarian sense.\u00a0I\u0027m also developing a database of magazine coverage, which I hope could carry across all publications online and offline.\u00a0There are plenty of games databases, which don\u0027t really interest me, but on WP reliable sources are sacred. Say what you will about games journalism but the opinions of some outlets have more gravitas than others. The idea is to catalog the main sources of record for posterity and to make it easier to write Wikipedia articles about games with hard-to-find references (i.e., games that rely on offline references, or games from the early Internet whose sites have now gone offline). Funds will also support archival work to preserve old print and web content, which I make available for reference via the Wikipedia video games project.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI should also add that \n\u003cstrong\u003eI dedicate all of my Wikipedia work to the public domain\u003c/strong\u003e. This means that instead of cc-by-sa, my works become immediately open for distribution in the quickest and dirtiest ways possible so helps the spread of knowledge. My work has also led to the relicensing of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/nhcrd6lwccd3jj2/Screenshot%202016-04-23%2002.23.44.png?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehundreds of video game assets\u003c/a\u003e for free use in illustrating all types of game concepts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt my first tier, you\u0027ll receive updates on these things. At the second tier, you\u0027ll get exclusive access to previews as they roll out. I\u0027ll also poll the group for ideas on what to work on next. (For example, maybe I should drop the above and work on articles related to games journalism, or our video game glossary?) At the third tier, you\u0027ll have access to me, we\u0027ll chat regularly and talk about Wikipedia or games or whatever you want.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eEthics\u003c/h1\u003e\nWhile I expect\u00a0input from my patrons, my editorial independence is important to my work. It\u0027s also my prerogative. I am not a paid advocate and will not accept money in exchange for work on specific articles. (If advocacy is your intention, kindly do not support this Patreon.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m happy to talk about Wikipedia and give generalized advice. If enough of my patrons are interested, I can canonize this advice in posts or videos or something. I also give\u00a0frequent surveys to gauge interest in broad topics/categories. I welcome your feedback, but I\u0027m serious about the independent affiliation stuff.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am a doc student in the history and philosophy of education. I haven\u0027t worked in the games industry and my meager connection to it is old friends and Wikipedia contacts. It would be interesting to discuss how I choose topics and the process of researching them in the regular chat, if patrons request and, of course, I will declare any potential conflict of interest that would compromise my neutrality or editorial distance.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eImages\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Emoji_u1f451.svg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCrown emoji\u003c/a\u003e by Google, Apache License\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:JMW_Turner_-_Modern_Rome_-_Campo_Vacino.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eModern Rome \u2013 Campo Vacino\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e by Wm.
