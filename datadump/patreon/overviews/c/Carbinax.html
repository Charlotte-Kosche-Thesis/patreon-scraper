    "summary": "It seems like such a long time ago that I heard a track by Kraftwerk called \"The Model\". I was aged 10, and didn\u0027t know it then, but it set me on a very definite course that would change my life forever. I discovered other artists .......Jarre, Vangelis, Depeche Mode, Howard Jones, Juan Atkins, Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada , during my rite of passage through my teens into adulthood, who built on that initial foundation that Kraftwerk laid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI became obsessed with synthesizers, but I was young, had no money, and as ridiculous as it sounds, I used to draw meticulously detailed synthesizers when I was about 14, because it kept the flame burning bright within me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the age of around 18, all I have wanted to do is make electronic music. I had casio and yamaha keyboards, and worked up to a roland d20 and a fostex 4 track, but it wasn\u0027t until I bought a computer when I was about 30, that I was able to actually make what I heard in my head, with unlimted sound, and then put it online. \u003cbr\u003eThe past 18 years or so have been a lot of fun, and it\u0027s still such a rush to discover my music has been played in the democratic republic of congo or whatever, and I\u0027ve put an extraordinary amount of time into learning my craft.\u003cbr\u003eWhen normal people have been asleep, I\u0027ve been regularly pulling all-nighters, fuelled by determination to succeed, propelled by \"rags-to-riches\" stories of Stephen Spielberg being rejected from film school, Colonel Saunders living out of his car and knocking on 1000 doors before someone accepted his KFC recipe, the Wright brothers being told by \"experts\" that \"nothing heavier than air can fly\" etc....\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve believed in the dream that I could make it.......that I could make a modest living from music, and it would be my career, and I could make some money doing what I truly love............but............a sequence of unforeseen events has affected my health, to the point where I\u0027m unable to work, and despite doctors reports, the government have decided I\u0027m not ill enough to receive any kind of benefits whatsoever, even though someone can lie through their teeth about having a bad back, and get those benefits and indulge themselves with spray tans and style ( I see this a lot )\u00a0 , so the music I make is my ONLY source of income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really didn\u0027t want to make this page, because I don\u0027t want to be seen as a charity case, or achieve anything through pity. I\u0027m not that kind of person at all.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve just reached a point where I know that what I make is technically good enough, but having reached this point, the music industry is being herded towards \"streaming\", and when you have sites like spotify paying an artist \u00a30.00004 per play, my only source of income, my only real ability, after a lifetime of singular focus on developing my craft, has been stripped away as music becomes more and more devalued.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I make this page, as an attempt to say \"Here\u0027s my music. I\u0027ve put blood, sweat, tears, years of work, lack of sleep, gritting my teeth into it. If you like the music, I simply need 1,000 true fans who understand what I\u0027m trying to do, and recognize my art as something that has value\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat makes my electronic music different to the majority of what is out there ? \u003cbr\u003eMelody. A lot of electronic music is ephemeral, and doesn\u0027t say anything. It has no message, no story, no depth of emotion, and is mostly beat-based. My music is like a fusion of the experimental curiosity of aphex twin and the depth of Vangelis, and spans everything in-between, with the desire to try to do things that little bit differently, plotting its own unconventional course, but equally balancing experimentation with easily identifiable melodies that can be catchy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want pity. I simply want what Vincent Van Gogh wanted.......to be recognized. It\u0027s ironic that His paintings change hands now for \u00a3Millions, and in His lifetime He only managed to sell one painting, to His brother, and died penniless with one ear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf my lifelong journey of grit and determination has touched you, to the point where you listen to my music, and you enjoy it, please confirm my faith in humanity, and help me realise my lifelong goal of 1,000 true fans, who will buy my music because they truly love it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not doing \"tier rewards\" as its too hard to quantify here with the way Patreon have it set up.\u003cbr\u003eIf you become a patron of Carbinax, it basically grants you a backstage-pass, and you\u0027ll see videos and get early access to tracks that I won\u0027t be posting anywhere else, unless they\u0027re due to be released on an album. \u003cbr\u003eIm very prolific, so the content should build up very quickly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks for your support. In this age of \"empty likes\" and followers who don\u0027t actually follow, it means a lot\u00a0 =)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy music lives here -- \u003ca href=\"https://carbinax.bandcamp.com/\"\u003ehttps://carbinax.bandcamp.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChris Carbinax\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
