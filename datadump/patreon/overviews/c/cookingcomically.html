Isn\u0027t he living it up in the Caribbean, swimming in money like Scrooge McDuck?\" Not exactly. There isn\u0027t much money in traditional publishing (none for me yet, in fact) unless you sell \n\u003cem\u003elots\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0of books. That just wasn\u0027t the case.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eBack from the dead\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nI\u0027ve recently relaunched Cooking Comically after a long hiatus which you can read about on the website. I\u0027ve committed to releasing recipes every single Thursday. I\u0027m dedicating all of my time to it, which is not something I\u0027ve ever done. I\u0027ve always had another job or school to keep up with as well but, not this time. Right now, I am all in.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhat goes into it\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nIt might not seem like it, but Cooking Comically takes a \n\u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e of time and effort to create. I have to research recipes, cook them, usually at least twice (either because it needs tweaking or because I screwed something up) I have photograph the process, process the photos, write the recipe and whatever jokes I can scrounge up, then I have to draw the cartoons and put it all together in a package that\u0027s easy to follow and understand and also, hopefully entertaining for you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eYou and me\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nI need your help to keep Cooking Comically going strong and that\u0027s where you and Patreon come in.\u00a0I should make it clear that the recipes themselves will \n\u003cem\u003ealways\u003c/em\u003e be free. But, if you choose to help me out and support me you do get certain rewards. For instance the lowest tier gets you access to the patron-only feed. There I\u0027ll be posting updates, in-progress doodles, little behind the scenes things, and generally interacting with patrons. The next tier gets you access to the weekly live stream I\u0027ll be doing where you can watch me draw the cartoons and assemble the upcoming recipes. And there\u0027s more for other tiers that you can read about just below on the page.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eThe Model\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nMy funding works on a recipe-by-recipe basis. You can choose to give $1, $3, etc. You can contribute whatever you want per recipe. And you can place a cap on your funding. I\u0027m currently doing 4 recipes a month and if you only want to support me for 1 or 2 of those recipes that\u0027s fine. You can do that. That way if I go crazy and drop 10 recipes in a month, you won\u0027t be contributing more than you expected.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith this model, if I don\u0027t create recipes, I don\u0027t get funded. And I think that\u0027s the way it should be. It makes me responsible to the only people I really care about when it comes to Cooking Comically: You guys.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eIn closing\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nSo that\u0027s that. If you like what I do and want to be a part of it and help me make it all happen then this is the way. I will be eternally grateful for any support you can offer. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks. And keep cooking.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-Tyler\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
