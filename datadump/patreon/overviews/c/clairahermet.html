    "summary": "I am Claira Hermet and I made a big decision. Not just big this is pretty mammoth. I have decided to sell my belongings, pack up all my stuff, move out of my flat, leave my family, friends and work behind to go traveling for 8 months ON MY OWN. I am literally quitting my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLife for me has been a little bit insane. Losing my mum at 9 has meant i have never really felt at home anywhere. I have always felt a bit lost. I have always felt alone and lonely. I have always felt like a part of me was missing. Add to that the fact i have never really felt like i fitted in anywhere, i\u2019m a bit weird, i\u2019ve never been \u2018cool\u2019 and i have always felt quite separate. At times i have been a very unhappy person. Losing my mum meant learning about life, womanhood, boys/men, love, friends and everything else through trial and error with very little guidance. It meant never really knowing and always just guessing in the hope i would stumble on the right answer. I was very sad inside but i always managed, even as a child to keep the outside contained and smiling. Very rarely did my mask slip. Inside i felt wretched, doomed, scared, alone, miserable and like a big pit of deep aching pain but outside i was cool, collected and strong. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until my sister Emily died almost 4 years ago that things started to change. Looking back now i realise i tried my usual tack tick. Be strong and fearless on the outside but don\u2019t let anyone see whats inside. This time though i couldn\u0027t keep it up. It was just too much. I moved home, back with my parents for the first time in years. I spent a lot of time with my amazing friends and i drew a conclusion. I had no idea how but i decided that if my mum and sister couldn\u2019t be here but i could then i sure as hell owed it to them to be happy. To enjoy life and to be grateful for all i have. The journey has been long. It\u2019s been wonderful. It\u2019s had extreme highs and extreme lows. I have had to learn so much about myself, accept responsibility for things i had spent years blaming others for and unlearn so much that i thought i knew as gospel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow i\u2019m here. I honestly thought like most my friends by now i\u2019d be on the road to marriage and kids. I thought i\u2019d have a booming career, a mortgage and be madly in love. Life, as i have discovered, had other plans. I have spent the last 6 years pursuing a career as an entertainment presenter. I have had some amazing successes. I have thoroughly enjoyed most of it. However after i had a preventative double mastectomy in January (i carry the BRCA gene mutation which increased my chance of breast cancer which was the causeof my mum and sisters death) something started burning inside me. A need, a want and a desire that has thrown everything else into the shade. It was like i just couldn\u2019t stop thinking about traveling. Packing my bags and leaving everything i know. In the past it was never something i really wanted to do. Suddenly it became all i could think about. I started talking about it and trying to create formats around traveling. I started to think how can i do this as work? I went from going to not going to going to not going to going. Every time a format was rejected i thought \u2018right thats it back to the real world lets get on with it\u2019. However my mind wouldn\u2019t let me just leave it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThats when \u2018My life your hands\u2019 was born. I started off wanting to get sponsors and brands on board so i had the financial security to travel. When that didn\u2019t happen fast enough i decided i couldn\u2019t wait because ultimately this is not a business venture this is my life and i want to do this. I feel i have put my life on hold enough. I have spent the last few years feeling like i\u2019m forever waiting for the right job, for the right man, for the right excitement and for the life i have always wanted. I don\u2019t want to wait anymore. I want to get out there experience the world, learn and grow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAm i scared? Bricking it. The closet i have come to anything like this was a week on a fasting detox in Thailand on my own about 7 years ago. This is 8 months of traveling with just a backpack. My life on my back like a turtle. ON MY OWN. I have no idea whats going to happen. I\u2019m not sure where i\u2019m going to go or who i\u2019m going to meet but i know this; sometimes you have to be big enough and brave enough to follow your heart. You have to shun everything common sense is telling you is the sensible thing, take a deep breath, a huge leap of faith and risk it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo work this trip needs you. \u2018My life your hands\u2019 is as much bout you as it is me. I need your help with where, who and how to visit places. I need to know the amazing things you learnt and know from your experiences. I need to know of amazing causes and charities i can visit along the way. I need things that will challenge me both mentally and physically. I want to know the things i can\u2019t miss and the thing i probably should. I need your love, support and conversation so i\u2019m never alone. I need you to pick and chose what i do next. Incase I haven\u0027t made it clear YOU are vital to this experience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am planning to visit South, Central, North America (Including Canada) and Alaska. I would love you to get in touch with any info you think may help me on this trip.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow before you start thinking i must have loads of savings, some kind of financial security and a big sponsor to be able to do this, let me tell you. I don\u2019t. I have \u00a310k of savings and donations from my parents (who are by no means rich). I believe they (i am so grateful) decided to give it to me because i think even they can see how much i want to do this. I have started using this money for equiptment so i can film the trip, my first 6 weeks of travel (flights, food, accomadation), insurance and developing my website. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money raised will be used keep me fed, watered and travelling, to hire other people to film and edit elements of the trip, to pay for online storeage so i can keep all my footgage to create more content when i return, to make sure i can do all the activities/things suggested by the audience, continued web support and development and a PR agency to make sure as many people as possible hear my story and are hopefully inspired.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mum and sister died. Give yourself a second to get your head around that. Death happens to all of us and so, thankfully does life. I want my life to be lived to the fullest for me, for them and because something bigger than me and them is telling me there is no other option. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have never been so excited in my life. I have never felt so on purpose, even though technically giving up everything to travel might not be considered a purpose i\u2019m pretty sure this trip is going to lead to some great things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the first time in my life i am doing something souly for me. The first time i am following my heart. The first time i am taking control of my life. To me this is the most important thing i have ever done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t begin to explain how much this trip means to me and thus how much every penny will mean to me. I know what it takes to earn money and if you chose to part with yours and help me i will be so bloody grateful i can\u0027t explain. It\u0027s so difficult to express  the level of joy and gratitude your donation would mean to me. I will express it with a personally written postcard for as many of you as i can. Plus i will express my huge thanks in various youtube videos. If you help me do this i will love you forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can keep updated with my travels here:\u003cbr\u003eMyLifeYourHands.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove and light,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClaira Hermet"
