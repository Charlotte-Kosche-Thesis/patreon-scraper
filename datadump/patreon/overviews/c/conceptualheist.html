Based in\nthe year 2090, our protagonist Jemma Heiss walks among the elite society of\nthe 1%, a group she has never had any compassion or love for, and stealing\ntheir art for her own financial gain. With a 1920\u2019s style, the look this world has we have called Jazzpunk, flapper girls with computer contact lenses, and\ndapper men with cyborg arms.

As Matt became comfortable in his release\nschedule we began talking about comics theory and story telling forms. We\neventually decided to work on a project together using the \u201cScatterlands\u201d style\nof adventure comic that Warren Ellis and Jason Howard used in their daily comic\nstrip as Matt believed he\u2019d be able to fit that strip style into his schedule.\nCombining our love of Heist films and science fiction we decided to begin work\non\u00a0\n\t\u003ca href=\"http://conceptualheist.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCONCEPTUAL HEIST\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://conceptualheist.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, the story of Jemma Heiss working as an art thief in the\nyear 2090.
