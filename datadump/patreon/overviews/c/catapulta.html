Published triannually, the magazine highlights current scientific research, popular science, and science initiatives in the BLS community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last few years, we have grown to become a club of over 50 members and have published many issues. A major source of our growth has been the funding that our school previously provided. Unfortunately, beginning this year, our funding has been cut, leaving us with no way to continue publishing and creating content, except through your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a school publication, \u003cem\u003eCatapulta\u003c/em\u003e involves the hard work of the entire school community.  Written and edited by dedicated students from grades 7 through 12, \u003cem\u003eCatapulta\u003c/em\u003e promotes scientific literacy and journalism. Articles are regularly submitted by members of the school community from all grade levels and over a thousand copies of each issue have been distributed for free.

In the 2014 school year, we were awarded the Meritorious Award by the New England Scholastic Press Association (NESPA). Last year, we received the Best in Science award from the American Scholastic Press Association (ASPA), and for the past two consecutive years, we were also named best publication by the ASPA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to recent school budget cuts, we no longer have the funds to publish at the same scale or level of quality that we have established in recent years. We hope you can support us with even the smallest donation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, we hope to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaintain the quality and volume of publication that we have previously achieved\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExpand our reach and impact within the community\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease visit\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blscatapulta.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eour website\u003c/a\u003e for more information.\u00a0Thank you for your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eN.B. if anyone reading this is interested in advertising in \u003cem\u003eCatapulta\u003c/em\u003e and/or becoming a corporate sponsor, please email us at catapultasciencebls@gmail.com."
