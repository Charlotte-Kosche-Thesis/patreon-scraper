     "about": "Hello, I would like start by\nsaying my name is Simone and I am a human being, I feel honoured and\ngrateful that you are interested in finding out about me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWho am I?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell, I could start by telling\nyou that I am a founder and CEO which would have put a certain view of me into\nyour mind, or I could tell you that I am an artist, or a shop keeper, a mentor.\nEach of these roles is true and each would have changed how you perceive me in\nyour mind, how you might react to me, think of me or treat me even. This would\nnot be your fault, our society has taught us all to rise to the top and seek\nuseful networks that help us to become successful. We don\u2019t have time in this fast paced\nworld to connect with those that are not as useful at helping us achieve our\npersonal goals.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe first question we all ask\na stranger has become \u2018What do you do?\u2019 rather than \u2018Who are you?\u2019. We live in\na world where our title defines us over our actions. I am keen to always\nremember that, really, all we are is a reflection of every interaction we\u2019ve\never had, every place we\u2019ve ever been and every person we\u2019ve ever met. People\nact and think in reaction to their personal experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis understanding allows me\nto feel connected to every other person on this planet. As I know, if I had\nbeen born in their place, I would have only known their life experiences and\nwould be living their exact life, with all its beautiful faults, complicated\nrelationships, views and perspective on life. This helps me to reserve judgement\nto others and want to connect with people whether or not I am instantly drawn to them,\nor deem them useful as part of my network. I\u2019m not perfect, this is still\nsomething I am working towards, a life goal that I may never fully achieve but\none that pulls me in a direction of service.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy job title does not define\nme. I define myself my knowing that I am working towards my personal purpose, I\nuse my skills, my creativity and my time to help others achieve their goals. I\nam successful if I know that I did the best I could to achieve my goal. If I do\nnot succeed at helping every person I meet, I am not a failure, I am only\nhuman. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nhave an academic background in architecture and urban design and a love for all\nthings creative. I am the founding force behind Flo, or Florence as I like to call her.\u00a0\u00a0",
