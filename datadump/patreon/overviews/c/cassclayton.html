I\u2019m doing some of my own independent writing/producing projects\nthis year while continuing to sing and write music with Hogback Blues Band and\n7th Heaven, two bands I dearly love!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is\nthis Patreon page for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMaking a living as a musician is dicey these\ndays. Streaming music has a lot of advantages for all of us music lovers, but\nit has made monetizing our music challenging for artists. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI really believe in creating high quality\nproductions that warrant listening to again and again. Of course, that can get expensive, but there\u0027s no shortcut that I know of. For my first two original songs: \"Woman In The Way\" and \"Fell From Grace\", I learned a ton. I\u0027m proud of the way they turned out. It\u0027s a lot of work and involves so many people: co/writers, co/composers, a great production and engineering team, studio musicians, a mastering studio, etc. And then you have this little baby that you put out into the world and hope and pray people love it. This process never felt like work to me even for a moment. In fact, I can\u0027t wait to put what I learned to use as I prepare to go\nback into the studio. It\u0027s platforms\nlike this one that allow me to do what I love while also having a job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMy job includes: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e-\nWriting lyrics and melodies\u003cbr\u003e\n- Recording with Geoff Gray (studio owner and engineer)\nand David Snider (co-writer and producer) along with other projects with my band and collaborating musicians.\u003cbr\u003e\n- Singing and coming up with slide guitar licks\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- Mixing (this is by far the most time consuming part)\u003cbr\u003e\n- Mastering (we send the songs out for this so\nthey\u2019re radio ready)\u003cbr\u003e\n- Promotion, social media etc...\u003cbr\u003e\n- All managerial, clerical \u0026amp; financial stuff\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u2019s a long process. Each song\ncan often take over 100 hours to create, and this doesn\u2019t include the back\noffice stuff and promotion. And I love every second of it. Now how to get paid,\nright?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen you become a patron, you\u0027re sending some cash my way to let me keep making the music you enjoy. For that I am very, very\ngrateful.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\nrewards do I get for contributing? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are a few rewards for contributing. I\u0027m always adding new reward tiers, so they\u0027re not concrete and may change slightly based on your feedback. You will never lose anything, you\u0027ll get what I add to the list. Examples: First access to new\nmusic as it\u2019s being created, exclusive videos showing what we\u2019re up to in the\nstudio and in the creative process, one-of-a-kind jewelry and art, demo mixes,\nbehind the scenes prose, private house concerts. The music itself is\nmy reward and I hope it is ultimately yours too!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRight now, I am an independent musician. That means that \u003cu\u003eyou\u003c/u\u003e\nreally are my label. I\u2019ll be communicating regularly, asking what you want to\nhear, what works and what doesn\u2019t and hosting get-togethers for patrons to hear\nnew stuff as the band plays it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI want everyone to be able to hear each release regardless of\ntheir financial situation, so even though patrons will get it first it will eventually be offered to all. And please know that if you choose not to contribute\nI completely understand \u2013 if you do, I want it to genuinely be because you feel\nmoved to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I stop donating in the future if I can\u0027t\u00a0afford it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes, of course! You can adjust your pledge at any time for any reason.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks soooo much for taking the time to read this, for believing in me and helping me to create quality music, and for supporting the dream!
