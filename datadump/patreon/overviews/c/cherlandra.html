My name is \n\u003cstrong\u003eCherlandra\u003c/strong\u003e and I am a \u003cstrong\u003epassionate creative\u003c/strong\u003e! My artistic endeavours are diverse in nature and include fine art, graphic design and artisan projects. Even within each discipline my work is quite eclectic. I believe that true creativity is about continuous \u003cstrong\u003eexploration\u003c/strong\u003e and renewed \u003cstrong\u003eexpression\u003c/strong\u003e. When I communicate creatively, it comes out in different voices so I learned to, not only embrace the multifarious nature of my work, but to celebrate it. Creativity is different for everyone. My artistic path is not just about \n\u003cem\u003emaking a living\u003c/em\u003e. It is about \u003cem\u003eactually living\u003c/em\u003e. When I wake up in the morning, I can\u0027t wait to create. I \u003cem\u003eneed\u003c/em\u003e to create. It\u0027s where I come alive and feel that I am contributing to the world. It\u0027s where I\u0027m my \u003cstrong\u003eauthentic self\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://cherlandra.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Baby-Steps.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am continuously building my portfolio and concurrently working towards being a self-sustaining artist. I\u2019ve learned that living a creative life takes \n\u003cstrong\u003epassion, commitment, faith and perseverance\u003c/strong\u003e. It also takes significant resources, especially during professional growth stages. My short-term goal is the ability to support myself solely through creative means but my end-game plan is a bit more ambitious. It includes the dream of an\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eartist centre\u003c/strong\u003e where I can create, put on exhibitions, host art retreats, hold workshops and \u003cstrong\u003ehelp other creatives\u003c/strong\u003e pursue their dreams. Baby steps though, and that\u0027s where you come in! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://cherlandra.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Together.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThrough Patreon, we can take a \n\u003cstrong\u003ecreative journey together\u003c/strong\u003e! Become a Patron and you will be supporting a \n\u003cem\u003eliving artist\u003c/em\u003e who is working hard to bring original beauty into the world. As my intention is to eventually create support resources for other artists, paying it forward, here with me, goes even further than you might think. For just a dollar a month, you can be a part of my unique journey and feel great knowing that \u003cstrong\u003eyou are supporting arts and culture\u003c/strong\u003e of \u003cem\u003eyour time\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for joining me in this creative adventure and also for\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003esupporting the work of a living artist\u003c/strong\u003e!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
