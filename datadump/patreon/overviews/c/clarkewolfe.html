So I purchased gear, worked with graphic designers, musicians, launched a website, and hired incredibly talented people to help me make this thing soar.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHitting the goal of 250 patrons a month means that we are really building a community and that can lead to improving the quality and frequency of the content that I can provide -- this includes not only the podcast but live streaming movie nights, digital interaction and activities, videos, and more.
