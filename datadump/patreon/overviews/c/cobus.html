I LOVE THIS. It\u0027s been a long time coming and I\u0027m very excited!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I do everything myself (set-up, tuning, miking, recording, mixing, editing, etc) it makes it very time-consuming (and expensive!) to produce high quality videos, which means I can only really do it every few months. I am hoping and praying that Patreon makes it possible for me to do this WAY more often: uploading a new video\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eevery two\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eweeks. \u003c/strong\u003eI am hoping to eventually do many more videos, collaborations, lessons, and original music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Your Money Goes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eRight now, your money will quite literally go towards me \u003cstrong\u003epaying rent and buying food\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027ve taken the plunge and rented a permanent studio space where my drums, cameras, and recording equipment is set up all the time, and even though this is a significant extra expense: it also makes it possible to record much more content, much easier. I\u0027m hoping that enough patrons sign up so I can keep this recording space full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf things go well and more patrons sign up, it will make it possible to UPGRADE to higher quality videos, bigger productions, more diverse content, and more community-focused projects (like the YouTube Band Project, or the Re-Cover Music Project).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow It Works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eYou\u00a0have \u003cstrong\u003eCOMPLETE control\u003c/strong\u003e: you can have a look at the reward tiers, pick what you want, and pledge that amount towards every new video I upload.
