Stereoscopic 3D animation requires double to rendering time.\u00a0 What I will do is render one \"eye\" for the standard release in the more aggressive \"around the clock\" mode.\u00a0 When that is complete, I will render the 2nd eye images in a more leisurely \"only while I am away or sleeping\" mode.\u00a0 This means your stereoscopic reward will arrive much later than the standard release.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n3. Not all releases will have stereoscopic rewards available.. Only 3D animation.\u00a0 I will post ahead of time if stereoscopic animation is possible.\u00a0 This way you can have time to decide if you want to donate this much and adjust your pledge accordingly.\u00a0 Also,stereoscopic is not possible for older \"retro\" releases.. Only those that qualify after Feb. 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. If you have special virtual-reality hardware such as the Occulus Rift or the HTC Vive that can play true stereoscopic video without the need to cross your eyes, try the sample linked above.\u00a0 I do not own these kinds of devices, but I will work with you to try and make it work with your hardware.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n5.
