I bring you along the entire process through all the ups and downs as we turn the bike into a one of a kind machine!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the Wrecked Bike Rebuild Series?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a video series, where I take a salvaged bike and learn hands-on how much potential sits in a bike that some may find no value in. The series starts as Chase chooses a salvaged motorcycle and get\u0027s it back to running order (if it isn\u0027t able to run already). Once the bike is running, the customization process begins. This is also where the weekly live streams come into play. It\u0027s important to mention that this series started as a video series but has turned into a supportive community, and during the weekly live streams YOU help Chase decide what parts and accessories to get for the motorcycle! If you subscribe to the top tier you can even watch Chase work on the bike \u003cstrong\u003eLIVE\u003c/strong\u003e! Once the bike is finished and road legal again, one of the \u003cstrong\u003eFANS\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003eof\u003c/em\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eWRECKED BIKE REBUILD\u003c/strong\u003e will be offered the motorcycle for $1.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do the series?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis series started as a way for me to learn more about how bikes run and working on them. My original hopes were that after I worked on a couple of bikes I\u0027d be better at working on my own bikes. Much to my surprise, this series has transformed into a huge community of people that all collectively like following the progress of working on motorcycles and sharing their own progress for their own personal bikes that they are working on as well! This series is also focused on \u003cstrong\u003egetting out of your comfort zone\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eshowcasing\u003c/strong\u003e that you don\u0027t just have to buy either a brand new motorcycle or meet up with sometimes sketchy people on Craigslist. You are now able to take advantage of websites like Dashub, the one I use to get all my Wrecked Bike Rebuild motorcycles, and for less money than you would spend on a running bike, make your own the way you want it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy sell the bike for so cheap? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support is what allows me to keep this series going so it wouldn\u0027t be right for me to keep the motorcycles once they are finished. I want these beautiful things out in the world, being enjoyed like they were built to be! I also know the excitement and fulfillment that comes from being on two wheels and I want to share that with others while I have this opportunity. After reaching our $8,000 per episode goal, we will be adding a BRAND NEW MOTORCYCLE, of the same make and model as the one being rebuild, and selling it to one of the WRECKED BIKE REBUILD\u003cstrong\u003e FANS\u003c/strong\u003e for a $1 to show our appreciation for making this series possible and supporting us at the highest level!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e When will I get charged for the episodes I support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport for Wrecked Bike Rebuild is on a \u003cstrong\u003ePer Episode\u003c/strong\u003e basis and is taken out \u003cstrong\u003eMonthly\u003c/strong\u003e. That means if you support at the $5 level and I make 2 episodes a month, at the end of the month you will be charged a\u00a0total of $10. You can also \u003cstrong\u003eset a maximum\u003c/strong\u003e you would like to support. That way if you would rather support at the $15 level to get those specifics perks, you can support at that level and set a MAXIMUM you\u0027d like to pay per month. That way you don\u0027t have to worry about too much coming out of your account!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the bike go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Once the bike is finished and the series is complete, a \u003cstrong\u003eFAN\u003c/strong\u003e of WRECKED BIKE REBUILD will be sold the finished bike in appreciation for supporting the series. In the case that we reach the \u003cstrong\u003enew bike goal,\u003c/strong\u003e the same process will happen with the\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0brand new bike\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0(of the same make and model as the one shown in the series). Both bikes, in the case, that both bikes are sold, will be shipped directly to the supporters home for no additional charge. (other than state tax for the individual when registering the motorcycle).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will videos be published?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWrecked Bike Rebuild, or WBR, videos will only be published on Tuesdays ( normally mornings at 8am EST). My plan is to release an episode every week. I am also aware that many times things don\u0027t go as you planned regardless of how much time you put into it. There will most likely be times where an episode isn\u0027t published, but fear not! Your subscription level \u003cstrong\u003eONLY\u003c/strong\u003e get\u0027s charged on a PER EPISODE basis. That means if no episode comes out, no money will be taken out of your account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many episodes will the series be?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe total amount of episodes is challenging to nail down when it comes to rebuilding a motorcycle from salvaged. Based on the initial plans, I estimate 10-15 episodes per series. You are free to support the series for just one single episode to see what it\u0027s about, leaving after one episode is published. If you are no longer supporting, you will no longer have access to the live weekly streams used to discuss ideas, plans, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if you aren\u0027t able to\u00a0support the build but still want updates on the process join the Wrecked Bike Rebuild FAN Email list?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney tight and not able to actively support the series?
