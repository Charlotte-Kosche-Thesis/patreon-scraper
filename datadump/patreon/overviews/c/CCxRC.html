I just wanted to thank you for all the support you\u0027ve shown me and let you know that I am excited about the growth of the CCxRC channel. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am dedicated to bringing you more and better RC content regardless of whether or not you give to me on Patreon. Anyone who runs or has run a YouTube channel knows the amount of time, planning, effort and cost that goes into creating content. I am not creating this account with the intent of getting rich, but rather to see if I can provide you with better content by devoting more time to the channel and the hobby. I\u0027m also not here to beg you for money because I know money is tight for a lot of people and I know that many of the people who watch are kids (and I don\u0027t expect them and wouldn\u0027t want them to feel the need to support the channel monetarily). I\u0027m simply making it available to people who want to invest in the show. The collective support of a small percentage of subscribers could make a huge impact on what we can accomplish on the channel. For the people who do choose to give, it\u0027s a great way for me to be able to reward them for their support of the show. I have a lot of people show up and comment on videos to be entered in giveaways, but that\u0027s all they are there for. I\u0027d rather know that the people who are invested in the success of the show and spreading the love for the hobby are the ones who will win items I choose to give away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of giveaways of items...I want to to give back some of my time. To give you special videos and content that is more personal and wouldn\u0027t be something I\u0027d share on the YouTube channel. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal this year is to create 2-3 videos per week for you that will feature Run Videos, How To, Unboxings, Behind The Scenes, Live Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s and more.  You can help make that possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eSupport CCxRC. Gain Access.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might have seen this pop up on one of my YouTube videos. The text area there is limited on the YouTube cards and it\u0027s hard to get the point across. \u00a0As I mentioned above, I plan to offer less polished and more personal videos that I wouldn\u0027t want in my YouTube stream. \u00a0YouTube isn\u0027t a great way to share all the information that some people want, but this seems to be a way that I can limit access to people I want to see the messages. For those of you that want more access... I\u0027m working on delivering that to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, thanks for tuning in and have fun RCing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTony Cece\u003cbr\u003eCCxRC"
