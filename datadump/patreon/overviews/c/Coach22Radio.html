    "summary": "Hi Patrons..\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to look at our profile, we are about to embark on an amazing journey and would love to share it with all of you.\u003cbr\u003eWe are a family of four who live in New Zealand, we have been dealing with some life challenges the last few years... our two youngest children, Elias aged 4 and Boston aged 7 are both on the Autism spectrum, Elias is non-verbal and Boston is high functioning but also suffers from severe ADHD. We felt like we were letting our boys down by not being there due to work so something had to change and in a big way. So we did what we thought would be the best way to take some control back in our lives and be there for our boys...so we brought a bus to restore and convert into a home for us so we could be there for each other. We brought a 1971 Ford R226 retired coach bus, it was all we could afford in our budget so it has come with some issues but its a beautiful old bus and we are looking forward to the challenge in front of us. So with the bus purchased next step we decided to home-school our boys as the normal school system wasn\u0027t working for them with their diagnosis and live and travel full-time in our bus throughout NZ. Great concept... Now to make it work... oh yeah that\u0027s right work... to make this possible we needed to find a way to support ourselves as a family on the road. In these situations we go to our strengths and that\u0027s what we are doing. I have been lucky enough to enjoy a career in media and I thought I would combine that and the bus and create what I believe to be a world\u0027s first... A commercial online Internet radio station broadcasting from our bus as we travel on the road throughout NZ. Coach22 Radio is born. \u003cbr\u003eSo we are in the process of building the station and also converting the bus so we need your support to make this dream come true for our family. Coach22 Radio focus is going to be on the tiny home, house bus, motor home, RV\u0027s, van life, boating, caravan, off grid and camping communities, creating entertaining content and relevant information for these communities. It will be an adult contemporary station with entertaining announcers and shows as well as sponsors opportunities to target this way of life directly. \u003cbr\u003ePlease join us on what we believe to be a journey of a lifetime\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You from our family - Al, Maria, Boston, Elias\u003cbr\u003e\u0026amp; from the Coach22 Radio team - Al Miranda, Dave Sparks, Brett Wilson\u003cbr\u003e"
