     "about": "Clovice A. Lewis, \nJr., who has composed numerous works ranging from ensemble to electronic\n and orchestral pieces, graduated from the prestigious College of \nCreative Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He \nbegan teaching as a freshman at the school, and upon completion of his \nstudies, accepted a position as a Lecturer in 1978. He\n was shortly thereafter promoted to Associate Professor and taught until\n 1985. He was, at the time, one of the youngest professors in the UC \nsystem (at 22) to hold such a position. His duties included generation \nof funding for continued support from private and public sources of the \nElectronic Music Studio. Lewis served as Faculty Head and Administrator \nof the studio from 1980 to 1984.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLewis has studied composition \nwith Peter Fricker, Anthonus Lolov, Thea Musgrave, Gordon Crosse, Edward\n Applebaum, and Stanley Krebs. His cello teachers included such renowned\n cellists as Peter Preston, Peter Rejto, Geoffrey Rutkowski, and Robert \nMason.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis pioneering work in the field of electronic music and \ncomposition led him to be noted as the most outstanding composer \nproduced by the College of Creative Studies in the November 1985 issue \nof OMNI magazine in an article entitled \"How To Build A Creative \nScientist\", which highlighted the achievements of the school and its \ngraduates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLewis was the recipient of a University of California \nUndergraduate Fellowship from UCSB in 1975 to reproduce the scores and \nparts, as well as to attend the premiere performance of his first \nsymphony, which was completed when he was 17 years old entitled \n\"Portraits of the Gulfcoast\". The piece was performed by the Gulfcoast \nSymphony Orchestra under the direction of James Shannon as part of their\n Bicentennial salute to American Composers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the past 30 \nyears, the music Lewis has composed has been performed by numerous \norchestras in California, including a Concerto for Trumpets and \nOrchestra, a Poem for Tenor Saxophone and Orchestra, a Bassoon Concerto \n(with Rufus Olivier) and a Multi-Media Cantata for Soprano Voice. He is \nthe recipient of numerous awards for composition, including the 1985 \nCabrillo Music Festival award for outstanding composition for a string \nquartet composed in 1976. In June of 1993, his Concerto for Violoncello \nand Computer was hailed as a breakthrough piece when it was performed \nfor the Old First Church series of concerts which showcases exceptional \nNorthern California composers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClovice has composed over 150 \npieces of music. His eclectic tastes can be organized into various broad\n categories, from pieces for individual solo instruments to large \norchestral, jazz, and computer music.",

It is a 1920s-era musical that explores present-day issues of racism, LGBTQ issues, inept leadership, African-American military service in WWI, and racial profiling (among many other issues). \u003cem\u003eHarlem Voices\u003c/em\u003e is about a brilliant young black vocalist who was traumatized by the Rosewood, FL massacre of her family members by the KKK in 1923. She is conflicted by falling in love with a white patron of the racially segregated club where she works in Harlem called the Black Jay Club. The piece is approximately one quarter of the way done.
