I\u0027ve worked with some incredible people like Neil Gaiman, Alan Moore, Stan Lee, Warren, Ellis, J Michael Straczynski, Anne Rice, and Clive Barker. Books I have illustrated have won many awards and honors, including Eisner and Harvey Awards, been listed as YALSA Great Graphic Novels for Teens, in\u00a0 Best American Comics, and they have appeared on the \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e bestseller list.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have personal projects to complete, primary among them my magnum opus \u003cem\u003eA DISTANT SOIL. \u003c/em\u003ePublished by the Image Comics imprint Shadowline, it is an epic space opera which spans more than 1000 pages and has taken me many years to tell. Our bankrupted printer discarded our catalogue of archived negatives, which set production of the series back years. Restoration of the project is costing approximately $100,000, all without outside funding or crowd sourcing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.adistantsoil.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ADSrestore.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI push on. And that\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ache to finish the final eight issue story arc of the fifty issue \u003cem\u003eA Distant Soil\u003c/em\u003e run, as well as to complete more personal works, many of which have been on the back burner for years: \u003cem\u003eDaughters of the Wind\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Six Swans\u003c/em\u003e, coloring book projects, my novels, and a major King Arthur project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy noble patrons are my lifeline. You support my art, and I make more art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the kind permission of my publisher Jim Valentino of Image/Shadowline\u003cem\u003e,\u00a0\u003c/em\u003efinished\u003cem\u003e \u003cem\u003eA Distant Soil\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/em\u003epages will appear here one full year before anywhere else. We decided not to go to press until all art on the series is finished. That\u0027s a lot of work and a long wait, but patrons don\u0027t have to wait! You\u0027ll see hundreds of sketches, in progress peeks, and have full access to my never-before published \u003cem\u003eA Distant Soil Sourcebook\u003c/em\u003e\n info, as well as original fiction, character drawings, \nand new illustrations. You also get to vote on \nupcoming incentives such as pin, poster, patch and clothing designs,and to see all of the process involved in making them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.adistantsoil.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ads37cover.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll have access to my other creator-owned works in progress, my fine art which I have never displayed, as well as a number of goodies available for preview via kind permission of my clients. I also spent many years blogging about industry issues, as well as working as a lobbyist in Washington for creator \nrights. I\u0027m moving all of that in-depth blogging and research here exclusively for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I love working for my many clients, I am desperate to complete my creator-owned works for you, my patrons. My deep gratitude will be returned to you with frequent, high-quality content: informative, in depth, useful. Every single week. Multiple updates per week and later, videos, too. Also, awards which include my original art, books, prints, and cool prizes, swag from the many, many gifts publishers and film studios have sent me over the years, like signed books, Sideshow Weta sculptures, toys and other wonderful things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support is invaluable to me as an artist. You are my oxygen. Thank you for your kind patronage. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s make magic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
