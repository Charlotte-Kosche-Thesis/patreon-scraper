    "summary": "My passions are about mental health. For individuals - working through headspace stuff and being more self aware. For society - changing damaging behavior and fostering social justice. The way I work towards this is through my art. I paint - using traditional and digital mediums.\u00a0I also run art jams, to give as many people as possible a chance to express themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe series of paintings that I\u0027m currently working on is called \u0027Inner Child\u0027 It is about the different types of childhood trauma. My own as well as the experiences of people that I have spoken with. The series looks at the different coping mechanisms and how the trauma shapes our lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy painting style is post-impressionist often with surreal elements. I use both traditional and digital mediums. I love gouache paint. It is so flexible with layering, glazing and adding various mediums.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I seek to raise awareness of mental health, through my paintings and exhibitions. To build up the art jams into a community hub, where everyone can express themselves. As well as delve into social justice themes. I feel that an important aspect of improving our society, is working on mental health. Expression is an important aspect of this. There is also breaking down stigma, and bringing to the surface our \u0027shadows\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e"
