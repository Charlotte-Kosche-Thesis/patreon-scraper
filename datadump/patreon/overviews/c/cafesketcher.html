    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I ?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello my name is Marc Sunseri. I\u0027m a new artist. I started cafesketcher.com to showcase my art pieces and inspire new and fellow artists to create spontaneously and sketch in a sketchbook. All my life I\u0027ve wanted to draw. Now after being introduced to watercolor by family as a creative outlet I\u0027m drawing, sketching and painting for the first time since I was a kid! It feels amazing! I\u0027ve been drawing and painting since December 2017. I would like to one day support myself by doing art. I am currently not working as I have bipolar and it is difficult to hold a steady job with my disability. Believe me I\u0027ve tried. I\u0027m not lazy, I like working and being productive. I have a college degree. I studied sustainable living and graduated with a 3.74 gpa. I work 6-8 hours a day on my art drawing, sketching and painting and working on my website and social media promoting my art. I started my blog to share my process, journey and experiences with art in greater detail. Additionally I am sober 2 years and drug free and I also meditate. I live a very clean life! Life in the greater Bay Area of California is expensive. With Patreon, I am hoping to raise money for art supplies, a smart phone tripod, as well as for road trips to neighboring cities to do urban sketching and film videos of my sketches and travels. Your monthly contribution could help me accomplish this. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon? Sponsor an artist for as little as $1 per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a sponsorship program it\u0027s not charity. \u00a0In exchange for your patronage you will be sent high quality digital photographs of my art as well as gain access to patron only posts. By becoming a patron you will be helping me pay for my art supplies and get a new smartphone tripod for making YouTube videos of my process for my followers. I am hoping to inspire people to start sketching and making art. Think of Patreon as a membership connecting artists and art enthusiasts and a way to help me make and teach art. Thank you for your interest and patronage!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOnce you sign up as a patron and choose an amount for your pledge, you will be billed that amount on the 1st of the month. \u00a0After your paympayment is processed you\u2019ll be sent your rewards corresponding with your pledge tier. Cancel or change your pledge at anytime by logging into your Patreon account. \u00a0See help center and FAQs for common questions below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the best,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMarc"
