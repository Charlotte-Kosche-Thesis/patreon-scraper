Simply put: \nIt\u2019s a series for discovering the great artists of our world today -- and\nthen bringing them directly to you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eTake a peak at some of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/MazumaProductions1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eepisode on YouTube here\u003c/a\u003e, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.colourinyourlife.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehead to our website\u003c/a\u003e and take a gander at our episodes and artists!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur initial goal is $40,000/month. That money\nwill be enough to keep CIYL going, indefinitely. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHere are CIYL costs:\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy name is Graeme Stevenson and I have been a\nprofessional artist for 35 years. I began CIYL as a project to showcase artists\nand their unique creative processes in their studios.  The show enables the Artists to get global\nrecognition for their work and allows millions of people around the world to\nlearn directly from them.  Having crossed\nAustralia, America and New Zealand in the last 6 years filming some of the\ngreat master artists of the world--almost 200 hundred to date\u2014I have also gone\ninto jails to teach inmates and also nursing homes to help the elderly and have\nhelped disabled kids to learn through my own abilities and also the amazing\ninformation that these shows and artists have shown to the world. I have made\nthis information free to people across the world. With your help that will not\nchange\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThat will \u003cu\u003enot\u003c/u\u003e\nchange.  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo grow my team and keep up with the\nhuge amount of work as many more artists come aboard, however, I need your\nhelp. That is the sole purpose of this Patreon campaign--and where your\ngenerous support comes in.  My aim is to\nrelease at least 2 to 4 new videos every month and expand the range of\nartists and locations featured. We have Artists and film teams in, America,\nBritain, Canada, Cyprus and India that want to be apart of this as well. in order\nto continue producing high-quality programs and grow our capabilities and\nhandle the many routine items involved with an ongoing project of this\nmagnitude we need your help and patronage to help make this happen.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt is extremely expensive to do what we\ndo. During this project, I have personally put all of my savings and any money\nearned from my art into producing the series. \nThe result has been unique in the sense that most usually only get to see a finished painting on\na gallery wall, but each CIYL episode peels back the curtain and shows the artist\u2019s\nunique process behind creating their art. \nHaving this kind of access to the fascinating, private and often\nreclusive studios that the public never gets to see is a very rare\nprivilege.  Investing in showcasing this\nkind of creative diversity in all of its forms is a worthwhile endeavor that I\nam honored to pursue--and one that I sincerely hope you\u2019ll join me on.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am often amazed at the positive comments the show\nreceives from all over the globe.  CIYL is\nchanging many people\u2019s lives for the better and your support will help grow\nthat even further.  Please join the\nproject and help expand what we can do with the idea of CIYL--together.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur aim is to release at least 2 to 4 new videos on\nArtists from across the world every month for any of this to happen, I need your patronage. I need your\nhelp to hire camera operators, get software, buy equipment, license music\ntracks, not to mention book flights \u0026amp; accommodation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOver this time I have personally put all of my\nsavings and any money earned from my Art into the business and due to the fact\nthat we now have many other countries that would like the platform we have\ndeveloped over the years to be filmed and aired in their countries, we have\nwell realized that to enable our idea to be developed in other countries we\nwould need help from the folks across the world that love Art and would like to\nlearn from these people.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\n1) WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nWe have rapidly growing numbers in our social\nnetworking systems and after filming nearly 200 Artists we also have many\ncompanies wanting to air the series through their systems.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am amazed at the comments the show receives from\nall over the globe; it is changing many people\u2019s lives for the better!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\n2) WE NEED TO GROW THE BUSINESS \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nThis enables other teams to be taught across the\nglobe so that Artists in their countries can be a part of this huge central\ndatabase of Artistic information from around the world. As far as we know this\nis the only show of its type in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe want to try and keep the shows as Ad free and as\npure as possible for the benefit of the Artists and the information that is\ngiven to the viewers, so hence the need for support from our Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u2019s thinking about long-term sustainability.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur online Art gallery, support from Artists and my\nown Art career and also a small amount of money from YouTube has helped keep\nour heads above water.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt is extremely expensive to do what we do. To\ntravel locally and internationally, then hire cars and drive thousands of\nmiles, stay in multiple hotels. I have been nailed by bed bugs on three\noccasions across these three countries. God what a horrible experience; yes the\nlittle blighters are really out there! To get the shows edited and filmed and\nthen transcribed and uploaded\u2026 It\u2019s a job that has been done by four people and\nit really needs seven or eight to do this.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOne of the great folks that helps us in the States\nsuggested that we needed to be a part of Patreon and tell people what we have\ndone over the last six years.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo get Patreon support will completely change what\nwe can do with the idea of CIYL!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e3) WHAT WILL WE USE THE MONEY FOR?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nOur initial goal is $40,000.00/month. That money\nplus the small amount we currently get from our other sources will help us take\nthis to a global audience in many other countries across the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nHOSTING:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nWe need a robust enough hosting plan to support the highest spikes in\ntraffic we ever get so we don\u0027t crash during those moments.

For nearly six\nyears now this project has relied on group hugs and the love and passion for\nthis to work from our dedicated team of four.

I had an epiphany about 6 years ago about creating a TV\nseries on Artists in their studios that would allow the Artist to get global\nrecognition for their work on many and varying Internet, digital and TV formats\nand also allow many millions of people around the world to learn directly from\nthese amazing people.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI went back to college to learn how to do this and in the\nproviso I meet a lady who was a film and documentary producer called Sophia\nStacey.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSophia and I have crossed three countries in the last 5\nyears Australia, America, New Zealand filming some of the great Master Artists\nof the world, thus far close to 200 hundred Artists and in that time we have\ncreated a number of channels that allow many people to go in to the studios of\nthese people. We have made this available to people for free for 6 years.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe have had three other talented ladies come on board to\nhelp with all of the management, Transcribing, social networking, uploading and\nweb site management. A huge amount of work to do as many more Artists begin to\ncome on board. We have all worked almost 7 days a week for the last 5 years. No\njoke, We eat, sleep and drink the work we have in front of us.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur aim is to release at least 2 to 4 new videos on Artists\nfrom across the world every month for any of this to happen, I need your patronage. I need your\nhelp to hire camera operators, get software, buy equipment, licence music\ntracks, not to mention book flights \u0026amp; accommodation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOver this time I have personally put all of my savings and\nany money earned from my Art into the business and due to the fact that we now\nhave many other countries that would like the platform we have developed over\nthe years to be filmed and aired in their countries, we have well realized that\nto enable our idea to be developed in other countries we would need help from\nthe folks across the world that love Art and would like to learn from these\npeople.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n1)WHERE DO WE GO FROM.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe have rapidly growing numbers in our social networking\nsystems and after filming nearly 200 Artists we also have many companies\nwanting to air the series through their systems.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am amazed at the comments the show receives from all over\nthe globe now, it is changing many many people\u2019s lives all for the better.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n2) WE NEED TO GROW THE BUSINESS. and enable other teams to\nbe taught across the globe so that Artists in their countries can be a part of\nthis huge central data base of Artistic information from around the world. As\nfar as we know this is the only show of its type in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe want to try and keep the shows as Ad free and as pure as\npossible for the benefits of the Artists and the information that is given to\nthe viewers, so hence the need for support from our Patreon fans.\u003cbr\u003e",
