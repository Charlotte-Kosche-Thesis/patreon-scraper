Unfortunately, podcasts are sometimes tough to generate revenue to pay for equipment and keep the lights on. Sponsors can help, but they are difficult to get and keep, while regular expenses like hosting fees, studio costs, new mics/equipment, etc. have to be accounted for. This is where \u003cstrong\u003eyou \u003c/strong\u003ecan help us, while also getting some bonus perks and content on top!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon lets fans support their favorite creators by becoming patrons. Unlike other fundraising services, which raise for a single big event, Patreon is for creators who create a stream of smaller works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere will the funds go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides direct support to Ian \u0026amp; Pat, funds from the Patreon will be used to go towards better gear to improve the visual quality of the show, podcast hosting fees, studio costs, help with trips to events where we record live podcasts and meet fans, and also go towards additional video content, such as a Let\u0027s Play show and the often-spoken and rumored legendary\u00a0Ian\u0027s Happy Handhelds review show!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e*\u003c/strong\u003eIf you would like to sponsor or advertise on the CUPodcast in either video or audio form please contact Pat Contri at cupodcast@thepunkeffect.com\u003cbr\u003e"
