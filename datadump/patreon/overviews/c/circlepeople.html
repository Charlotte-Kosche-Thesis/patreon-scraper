(Although with the adpocalypse going on, and osu! videos being extra targeted because we\u0027re part of the \"anime\" part of youtube, we\u0027ve never really earnt much from ads. Which of course makes us appreciate your support even more!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money we\u0027ll get from Patreon will instead go into Circle People as a channel and community. It\u0027s money we can use to finally pay the people helping us everyday with everything from uploading videos, recording livestream, editing videos such as osu! Alert, script writing etc!\u003cbr\u003eSomething that hasn\u0027t been possible before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do promise you that the money donated here on Patreon is valued very highly, and we will try our best to put it to the best use to improve the Circle People channel and community!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do decide to support us, I give you my biggest thank you, from the bottom of my heart!\u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
