    "summary": "\"A rising tide lifts all boats.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a cliche, but most cliches hold a lot of truth, which is why they are used so often. You are aware that it\u0027s a difficult time for new and independent music artists to get found. The world is now able to get seen and heard, but in the middle of the crowd, it can be hard to gain attention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started The Co-Op Communique, an annual series of compilations to be a true music discovery platform. Unlike many compilation providers, we don\u0027t charge the artists to be placed on the annual release. To keep new listeners coming back with the intent to \"find your next favorite musician,\" we don\u0027t charge for the download of the release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can imagine, this makes maintaining this service difficult. This is where YOU can help. By being a patron of our music discovery platform, you enable our work to continue, allow new listeners to find artists, and make it so these artists can be found.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause we work with Bandcamp.com, we can ensure that the artists\u0027 compositions always remain under their ownership. If they decide to no longer be a part of the Co-Op, we can remove their track(s) upon their request. If they stay with the Co-Op, we promote previous volumes just as we will each year\u0027s newest. We\u0027re committed to continually promoting everyone who works with us, for as long as they choose to do so. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have several patronage levels and sponsorship opportunities. Want to contribute but not have your name attached? We can do that. Want to tell the work that you\u0027re a patron of the performing arts? We have that too. Want to take it farther? If you have a company or organization and want that to be a sponsor, we will thank you with either your company/organization\u0027s name or a combination of name and logo added to our promotional communications. You can show that you are taking a positive stand for independent musicians and music discovery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSound good? We hope you will help us help artists get heard, get found, and continue to do the thing they were meant to do. Choose your participation level today. Thank you for your commitment to supporting the arts .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
