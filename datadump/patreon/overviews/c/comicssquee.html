The pun and innuendo jars.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThey\u0027re all for you, our lovely listeners.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have a lot of fun bringing the Comics Squee podcast to you, recommending the comics and graphic novels we enjoy. That\u0027s why the cost of web hosting, media hosting, pizza runs, and recording equipment, the Hours of audio editing time and writing of show notes, it all comes out of our personal budgets and schedules.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWHY PATREON\u003c/h3\u003e\nOur goal is to make the show wholely listener supported, so we never need saddle you with sponsor spiels or annoying ads to keep the Squee going.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo we\u0027ve turned to the wonderful tool of Patreon. Now you, our lovely listeners, can drop some nickels in the tip jar. Make the daring leap from Listener to  Precious Patron of Pulp Pamphlet Parley*!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHOW DOES PATREON WORK?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nIt\u0027s like the love child of Kickstarter and an NPR pledge drive. \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?x-yt-ts=1421914688\u0026amp;x-yt-cl=84503534\u0026amp;v=wH-IDF809fQ#t=16\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSee a snappy video here \u0026gt;\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou choose how many nickels your budget can accommodate. You set-up how you prefer to be billed; PayPal, debit, etc. Each month Patreon tips those nickles into Comics Squee\u0027s jar for you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatronship starts at the low, friendly $1 level. But the system\u0027s flexible, so you can set your sponsorship level as high as your generosity fancies. Like any pledge drive, there are different \u0027thank you\u0027 rewards; from your name on our Patron page, to an appearance on the podcast.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe also have \u0027Goals\u0027 like on Kickstarter. Where we can set milestone targets. Like, if we get a certain level of monthly patronage we\u0027ll buy a pie and make pi puns to thank our Precious Patrons of Pulp Pamphlet Parley.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNOTE: Patreon does NOT store any of your financial information, so it\u0027s pleasantly secure.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHOW DOES THAT CHANGE THE SQUEE??\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\nWe\u0027ll continue putting out 2 issues of the Comics Squee podcast each month for the wonderful price of free. But now we\u0027ll have Precious Patrons of Pulp Pamphlet Parley helping with our costs and thanking us for our hard work with their hard earned coin.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd certain milestones of patronage will allow us to make improvements to audio quality and such, improving the podcast we all love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo take the plunge, become a Precious Patron of Pump Pamphlet Parley*. Show us the love so we can squee on for your comics loving amusement.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n----------------------------------------------\n\u003cbr\u003e\n* We posed the question to you of what delightful alliterative appellation to use for our listener patrons. And you suggested: \"Podcast Paladins\", \"Precocious Plucky Patrons\", \"Persevering Patrons\", \"Pleasant patrons\", \"positively pleasurable patrons\", and - disturbingly - \"Palatable\" and \"Patent Leather\". But regular guest Alex de Campi\u0027s wonderfully wordy suggestion won out.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
