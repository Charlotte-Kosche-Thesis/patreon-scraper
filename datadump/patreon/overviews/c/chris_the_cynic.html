    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m a writer\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0I write. \u00a0It\u0027s kind of what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt present my writings live at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://stealingcommas.blogspot.com\"\u003eStealing Commas\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI usually write in fiction fragments. \u00a0Sometimes a single scene, sometimes less. \u00a0That . . . doesn\u0027t leave me with a lot of stories that have beginnings, middles, and ends. \u00a0Sometimes I write the fragment and move on. \u00a0Sometimes I keep returning to the story or its universe, but traditional narrative form is something that\u0027s seldom attained simply because it takes a lot of fragments to make one whole story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy fragments tend to fall into (oversimplifying here) three categories:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eEntirely original work. \u00a0This is exactly what it sounds like.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSerious parody. \u00a0People tend to forget this exists outside of lawsuits and that\u0027s a real shame. \u00a0There are so many stories that you can look at and see the other stories within them, and told right those other stories, in themselves, represent a commentary on the original that can be anything from scathing to\u00a0laudatory. \u00a0They don\u0027t have to take the form of pointing and laughing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e(Hopefully) funny parody. \u00a0This is the parody people remember outside of court and watch on SNL. \u00a0It may have deep and meaningful points to make, but even then it\u0027s in a jocular form.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eI also sometimes write things other than fiction like what it\u0027s like to live with depression, thoughts on the tax code, observations on civic buildings, and the experience of going to Arisia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThen there are the pictures.\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0My mind is very non-visual. \u00a0I don\u0027t even think there are words to describe what I \"see\" in my mind\u0027s eye because I could not produce an actual image to save my life. \u00a0So I take pictures. \u00a0Lots of pictures. \u00a0All the time. \u00a0Sometimes I digitally play with them. \u00a0Sometimes I share them as is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt has been a very long time since I\u0027ve made a puzzle\u003c/strong\u003e, and the reason is simply that I don\u0027t have the money. \u00a0But I have made them, and I\u0027d like to again. \u00a0When Erno Rubik made his cube he set off a slow revolution of puzzle design, and now that it\u0027s reached its golden age . . . I can\u0027t afford to do anything. \u00a0I\u0027d like to change that. \u00a0The mouthful that was the fully functional extended cuboctahedron shouldn\u0027t be my last puzzle. \u00a0At least I don\u0027t think so."
