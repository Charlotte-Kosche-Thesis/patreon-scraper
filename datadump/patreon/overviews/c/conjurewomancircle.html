    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eSince my teen years I\u2019ve felt drawn to spirituality outside of a strictly religious context. I feel blessed to share this gift and my passion for healing with all those who are ready to do the work. The path is not an easy one, but the rewards supersede the effort. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I realized I had a gift for tarot reading, I utilized them first in my personal life and they have provided a path to healing for me. I share this gift, because it has been of such great value and significance in my life. At one point in my life I believed tarot cards were evil and something to fear, but I realized that for healing to commence we must be open to truth in any and all ways we can receive it and they have been a saving grace. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eBeginnings\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI unofficially created the Conjure Woman Circle over two years ago to share tarot readings and moon rituals with my friends and family. I had no plans beyond that. But soon after, I fell to my lowest point. I felt lost. I lacked the passion that blazed in me before. I had no clue where to turn. A chance reading with cards I gifted to someone in March 2017 gave me the answers that led me to this point. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe synchronicity of it all is incredibly, awe-inspiring as I reflect on that time. In two follow up readings, I was implored to focus and create the path I wanted to walk. For months, I struggled with debilitating indecisiveness. I wanted to be like everyone else, I wanted my path to exist, but it didn\u2019t. So I had to create it. In the first of the two readings the \u003cem\u003eOracle Cards\u003c/em\u003e card appeared, which meant: \u201cYou are able to discern answers and guidance for yourself and others.\u201d Then, in the second of the two readings the \u003cem\u003eMake a Decision\u003c/em\u003e card appeared. I didn\u2019t think the Universe was going to speak any louder or be any clearer. Within a couple weeks I opened the roses\u0026amp;concrete online store and offered healing services to clients, including intuitive readings, auric cleanses, and sold crystals, sage, and other spiritual necessities.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHealing Methodologies and Teaching\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Conjure Woman Circle will be an extension of my healing work that will allow me to offer more direct, one-on-one attention to clients, while aiding their process of developing and sustaining spiritual growth. With this circle, I hope to continue sharing a wealth of information about rituals, balancing the chakra system, channelling energies and archetypes. As we delve deeper into the healing of the Divine Feminine I will elaborate on magic as it relates to sexual and creative energy, and the development of a spiritual practice not only as an ascension, but as a return or alignment with the truest, highest self. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy methodology combines scholarly frameworks, cultural expressions, \u0026amp; spiritual doctrines submerged in an unmistakable Blackness. Reflecting belief systems of Native/Indigenous, African, \u0026amp; Diasporan cultures in Latin America, the Caribbean, \u0026amp; the United States. I utilize meditation, crystals, numerology, natal charts, moon rituals, \u0026amp; tarot cards to help guide clients towards the path of personal responsibility, clarity, self-awareness, \u0026amp; healing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShadow-Work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDue to a variety of personal, social, and historical factors we often become overly attached to our traumas and the unhealthy behaviors they caused. Some of us have become fearful of success and we doubt our abilities. Many people have a fear of success that manifests as procrastination or perfectionism or self-sabotaging behaviors. However you define success you won\u2019t find it until you do healing work and address your traumas. They\u2019re literally standing between you and the life you want. In this circle, we will address emotional blockages, detrimental patterns, generational traumas, harmful familial cycles, and negative self-talk among a number of other issues that inhibits success, joy, healing, \u0026amp; fulfillment.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe Conjure Woman Circle will encourage you to use truth and accountability to incite passion, create vision, and invite healing. Allowing you shed shame and guilt as you embrace, and integrate your shadow. Many healers will utilize light work, but I believe Shadow Work to be the key that unlocks the door to thriving. The monthly exercises will allow you to continuously work on revealing, getting to know, and understand your Shadow. This is the most powerful force that exists within you and integration is vital. Sometimes\u2014I say more often than not\u2014we need Shadow energy to help us accomplish what we want. This is not to say light is good and shadow is bad. I hope to encourage you to do away with this type of binary thinking. Look instead for purpose and power. What have you been able to accomplish by attempting to hide the Shadow and swallow the pain?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Divine Union\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Conjure Woman Circle is open to genderqueer/non-binary peoples, women, and men. My healing methodology is specifically tailored for marginalized populations, however I welcome anyone who is accepting of this purpose. I believe our society\u2019s injustices force us into a mode of survival that causes us to suppress our emotions and vulnerability. We then fall out of alignment with our purpose. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFor this reason, I decided to use this circle to heal the Divine Feminine. This is the internal energy that guides us. It is intuition. Stillness. Creativity. Love. Nature. It is the potential energy. The rock atop a high mountain that needs only a small amount of energy, to be acted upon in a way that allows it to move.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThough we all have various skills and external visions they must all start within our minds and our hearts, so this circle will inspire you to heal and connect to this part of yourself. Once our internal guidance or Divine Feminine begins to undergo transformation we easily align with our purpose. Divine Masculine energy is no longer unsure of its power. Led by the Divine Feminine, it can now be incited to action. The incorporation and melding of the masculine and feminine leads us to a type of androgynous spiritual existence. Having discipline and balance invites us to reach our full potential. Allowing us to call upon and manipulate energies at will for the purpose of manifestation and transmutation in the expansion of self and spirit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn closing, I hope to share a means for us to heal, reclaim our truest selves, and edify our souls. My healing work centers marginalized groups using a unique methodology that I developed and utilized for my own spiritual development. I implore you as the Universe implored me, be open to hearing what you need to hear, not what you want to hear. Your healing depends on it. Those who have benefitted from my work say:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u201cShe has helped me so much! Truly blessed to know her.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThey inspired me to get back into my mediation and focus on my mental wellbeing.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cSpecial, special, special thanks to you for helping me get started on my own journey. I am particularly grateful for her personal readings which have greatly helped me center myself and deepen my discernment.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI had my first tarot card reading and I was blown away! The cards she pulled and the interpretations she provided helped me see some patterns in my life, gave me language and images to further my spiritual and personal development. Her positive, deep energy was a joy to experience as well! Looking forward to my next reading.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u201cI\u0027m so excited for this year because of your reading. I feel like I\u0027ve been placed on the right path and (finally) given instructions (that I understand lol) for the first time in a long time!\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
