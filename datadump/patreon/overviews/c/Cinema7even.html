Seeing an opportunity to record these debates and discussions, the podcast was the natural outlet. With a focus on \u003cstrong\u003eFilm\u003c/strong\u003e,\u003cstrong\u003e Gaming\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eEntertainment\u003c/strong\u003e, Cinema 7even strives to bring quality content and discussion to its listeners.\u00a0\u00a0Cinema 7even consists of three core members, outlined below, and several other additional spotlight regulars across many episodes. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMARIO BACCARI\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhile the podcast does not have an official person in charge, the three core members discuss ideas and content, it can be said that Mario Baccari is the one that drives the podcast onward, managing a good portion of its social media, appearing on EVERY episode to date, and providing the venue to record podcasts on most days. \u00a0Mario Baccari, 27, resides in Virginia Beach, VA where he works at a local Best Buy, with bigger and stronger goals on the horizon. \u00a0An avid lover of Predator, Comics, Wrestling, Video Games and more, he is passionate about the things he loves and does not hesitate to give his opinion or get into a discussion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJOHN KNOKE\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf Mario is the one focusing on content of the podcast and managing the social media, John Knoke is the one looking for opportunities to expand and grow the podcast in both traditional and non-traditional ways. \u00a0Originally not a member of the podcast officially until some restructuring occured, John Knoke has since appeared on a good number of episodes. \u00a0John Knoke, 25, also resides in Virginia Beach, VA working as an Assistant Finance Manager at the local water park. \u00a0With a degree in accounting, he strives to live comfortably and further promote the podcast, while providing a realistic view of where and when goals can be accomplished. \u00a0Of John Knoke\u0027s interests, highlights include: D\u0026amp;D, Tabletop Gaming, Video Games, Comics, Collecting and more. \u00a0Quick to provide a thought out opinion, John Knoke will debate a point with the cold hard FACTS.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCHRIS HAWK\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe third and final core member of Cinema 7even is Chris Hawk, the podcasts heart and soul. \u00a0The spirit of the team, always excited and ready to do what needs to be done. \u00a0Chris Hawk having been on the second most episodes, behind only Mario Baccari, provides that final \"something\" that all podcasts need in their core members. \u00a0Chris Hawk, 27, resides in Virginia Beach, VA with his wife and daughter, where he works as an electrician to create a stable life for his loving family to grow and thrive. \u00a0Chris Hawk\u0027s interests include Time Travel Anything, Marvel Comics, Spider-Man Anything, Video Games, and more. \u00a0Chris Hawk boasts a complicated review system that even his fellow podcast members don\u0027t quite understand, The Chris Hawk Similarity Rubicon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
