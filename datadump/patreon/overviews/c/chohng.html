I\u0027m Chuck, currently based in Los Angeles as a visual artist, working on two exhibitions right now for South Korea (\uc7a5\uc6b1\uc9c4 \ud654\ubc31 \ud0c4\uc0dd 100\uc8fc\ub144 \uae30\ub150\uc804), and here in SoCal for the City of Manhattan Beach (\u003cem\u003eToyetic\u003c/em\u003e for 2018). Since my projects tend to be shown toward public/ government institution as the venue, a majority of cost per project comes out of pocket.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt might not look much to you, a $1 per month, $5 or whatever the amount I might ask you for. But each donation you make per month will help me find a workspace where I can work on my various mediums including printmaking, soft-sculpture, and video to name a few. To create and to be secure enough to sustain liability as an artist would strengthen my chance to express my ideas more freely, as well as possibly add opportunities for other artists who felt their voice was not important to be heard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for reading this again!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
