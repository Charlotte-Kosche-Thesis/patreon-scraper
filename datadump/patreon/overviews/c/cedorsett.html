I\u0027m so excited you took a moment to visit my Patreon  page. I have so many stories I want to tell and I hope you will become a part of making that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you don\u0027t know much about me yet, my name is Charlie, and I write scifi, fantasy, and secondary world wuxia. My fiction tends to be a bit weird with a focus on characters and worlds I can\u0027t find elsewhere.  Many of my characters are LGBTQ+, and I strive to tell stories balancing personal stakes and epic adventure.  You may be familiar with my scifi books: Liquid Sky, Fates\u0027 Harrow, or Shine Like Thunder.  Or you may have read my dark urban fantasy: Wand and Weaver: The Chain.  I also do a daily podcast- \n\t\u003ca href=\"http://www.projectshadow.com\"\u003eProject: Shadow.\u003c/a\u003e What I am working on now is something new, \u003ca href=\"http://www.ashdancer.com\"\u003eThe Ash Dancer\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nI call my fans the Riders of the House of the Blue Dragon, because they joined me on this journey.  Okay, it\u0027s mainly because I love Wuxia, and I love the idea of being part of a Jiang Hu sect. Sputters the Blue Dragon has been in my logo for twenty years, so it seems only proper to name the House after him. Yeah, it\u0027s a bit corny but if we can\u0027t have a little fun, what is the point of any of this? \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5005f7f0e4b0830aa84e18cb/t/597829fb5016e128b8dc7291/1501047295218/Home-banner.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch2\u003e\n\tWhy Patreon?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\tIn short, it all comes down to how far your dollar goes. \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5515e461e4b057e153f226cf/t/5a6a3dd9652dea2a1c335c61/1516912094464/howmuchiearn.png?format=2500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\tDepending on your decision, this is how much of your contribution goes toward supporting the work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery cent here makes it possible for me to focus more on writing and art.  Your membership enables me to become a full time fiction writer.  It also helps me get to more conventions around the country so I can meet you face to face.  Some will also go to procuring more James, but I am not greedy, I always share.  My dream has always been to build up a company that not only produces books, but eventually comics, animation, and other media.  Together, we can build toward that future.\n\u003cbr\u003e\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cdiv\u003ePatreon allows me to focus on creating things rather then promoting and selling each project.

I want to spend my time making fiction for you.  I don\u0027t want to work for advertisers, or Amazon, or any other company that doesn\u0027t really care about their audience.
