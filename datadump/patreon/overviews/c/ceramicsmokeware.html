By creating content on YoutTube I will lead this new market around ceramic pipes! So I\u0027m glad you could join me here on Patreon to be part of the community from the beginning! Take a look around and get involved if you can\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\tI am on Patreon with the intentions of reaching an audience dedicated to the idea of creating ceramic pipes and water pipes. No matter what, I will produce free content on other platforms and I think that some of you will simply want more content that is dedicated to your needs. But the financial support that you contribute will accelerate this community to great places in a quicker manner then I could achieve on my own. So instead of keeping all of my work to myself I want to share it with individuals who will truly benefit from my knowledge within a community place dedicated to the growth of Ceramic Smokeware artists.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAbout Patreon \n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\tPatreon is a way to join your favorite creators community and pay them monthly for making the stuff you love. This means if you are pledging $1 per month, you\u0027ll be automatically charged $1 on the 1st of every month until you delete your pledge. This means the creator gets paid regularly, and you become a patron of the arts. Imagine your favorite creators making a living doing what they do best, because of you.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhere does your money go?\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\tYour hard earned money that you contribute goes to achieving the goals listed to your left. From funding ceramicsmokeware.com to the content provided every week and even bringing on part time help so I can dedicate time to designing new products with patrons.\u00a0But please know that your funding will be what allows me to sustainably teach other artists how to make pipes so they can begin a career in the ceramic smokeware field. So with your help we will start seeing more artists making ceramic pipes all because of our united dedication to this community. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t*Note: if you are low on money and making a contribution is out of your budget, please don\u0027t feel like you need to support the community in that way.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat is The Ceramic Smokeware Community?\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\tThe Ceramic Smokeware Community is going to be located on ceramicsmokeware.com. Here you can receive help from the community of ceramic artists through online forums, plus someone can learn through blog and video posts. Best of all ceramic artists will have a place to feature and sell their ceramic smokeware. Artists will also have a place to purchase tools used to assist them in making pipes.

I create ceramic pipes as a profession and am here to share my knowledge of how to do what I do. I create pipes for several reasons: to help teach others of this unknown art, provide for my family, and to grow so I can continue reaching my life goals. I love what I do and I want to keep doing what I do. But the most important thing I want to do in life is manufacture sustainable technologies such as bio-gas digesters, alternative energy systems, rain catch and recycle systems, vehicles that use alternative fuels, and systems to grow all of your own food no matter where you live. When I can do this I will try my hardest to deliver it to the people for hopefully no cost. So once we have these technologies many people will have the ability to live a sustainable life without the constant burden of paying for things that we could provide for ourselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for spending your time to learn about me.\u003cbr\u003eIf you are like me and want to make a difference I would love to hear from you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
