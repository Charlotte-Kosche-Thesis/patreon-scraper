Now, kneel before me...and enjoy the roast that\u0027s about to commence!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho is this loser?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eChristopher Galbreath. What can I say about him? A loser that gets caught up in games once he sees some minor detail of interest? Seriously, someone tell him to stop playing Pok\u00e9mon and get back to work on writing!\u00a0In high school, he started as a band nerd but had the gall to start\u00a0writing fan fiction under the penname \u003ca href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net/~izumiryu\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eIzumi Ryu\u003c/a\u003e. Really, Chris? What kind of name is that?!\u00a0He\u0027s been trying to\u00a0convert to original works over time. Define \"original\". Now,\u00a0he\u0027s\u00a0done some script editing for a furry ninja\u00a0comic called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ninjawolfsaizo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNinja Wolf Saizo\u003c/a\u003e, yet I can\u0027t get him\u00a0to stop denying he\u0027s a furry himself!\u00a0Now, he\u0027s been writing this story\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://centerlanecomic.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCenter Lane\u003c/a\u003e. Which contrary to popular belief, I\u0027m the\u00a0\u003cem\u003ereal\u003c/em\u003e star\u00a0of this comic!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Center Lane?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDavid Ramsey is this awesome high schooler doing something his classmates can only dream of. And seriously, he IS awesome. You have got to read some of the stuff he\u0027s written. He\u0027s just as twisted as I am! I seriously can\u0027t blame him for legally trying to get away from his parents. His mother creeps me out enough as is. He\u0027s not quite there yet, but he\u0027s got a pretty cool roommate letting the kid live with him. He\u0027s gonna need all the help he can get with both high school and the \u0027real world\u0027. Honestly, I can barely tell the two apart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can spy on this kid\u0027s life every Wednesday and Sunday. Seriously, not like you\u0027re doing anything different than to anyone else on Facebook...or the NSA to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Am I Asking For?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI need some serious help getting enough weapons under my control to make humanity kneel before me, so I\u0027ll be siphoning off of Chris\u0027 Patreon as soon as I set up the leak... Wait, Chris, did you just set this to leak back into your account? Killjoy! You really are a loser!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, at least you can help the real help behind\u00a0Center Lane.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://rafalee.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRafa Lee\u003c/a\u003e, the Brazilian artist behind our comic is\u00a0currently paid fully out of Chris\u0027 pocket. So anything at first will be helping to pay this guy.\u00a0He\u00a0really makes me look\u00a0awesome in this. Unlike those fillers Chris throws together in MS Paint. He sucks.\u00a0Rafa does have a lot of work going on, so we can\u0027t\u00a0post more than\u00a0twice a week, but we might get some more bonus content or...sigh...we could get more of Chris\u0027 half-baked ideas made.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest, Chris does have a lot of stories going on in that jumbled head of his. Now, he just needs to get them written. Wait, there\u0027s actually scripts written? Then, why haven\u0027t you...oh...right... you still need more help with that, don\u0027t you? So, if anyone wants to see a comic about middle schoolers stumbling on classmates with powers or a new Digimon comic, we can use the financial help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd well, every creator\u0027s dream is to be a lazy bum and live off their work instead of their day job. Can you get any more clich\u00e9 than that? But hey, he\u0027s a long way away from that, so we know that\u0027s just a pipe dream. Whether he\u0027s worth it or not is up to you guys.\u003cbr\u003e"
