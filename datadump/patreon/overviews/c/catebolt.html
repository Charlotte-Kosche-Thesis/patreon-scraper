    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello, my name is Cate Bolt and I like words\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve made it onto onto this page you\u0027ll probably know that I like some ...\u0027colourful\u0027 words. Despite having dedicated the last seven years of my life to saving women and children from human trafficking and forced prostitution, most people still know me as \"the cunt cushion\" woman. Yes, I\u0027m \u0027that\u0027 Cate Bolt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite my \u0027lame internet fame\u0027 being attributed largely to having a viral product, in reality it was my words that created my audience - namely, the way I dealt with unreasonable customers. My penchant for putting petulant patrons in their place. My viral email exchanges with the likes of Sam and Jane and Karlyn (seriously, what the fuck is up with that name?) that gave me the audience that I enjoy/tolerate/loathe, depending on the day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re discovering me for the first time, I am just an average 45-year-old mother of nine mostly adult children, affectionately known to many as \u003cem\u003eAunty Cate\u003c/em\u003e. I own and independently fund an orphanage and various humanitarian projects in Indonesia. I\u0027m an ex-music journalist/youth lifestyle magazine editor, ex-bouncer/security guard/prison officer, and I once owned the largest retailer of wedding goods in Australia, which I literally built from scraps of fabric left over from my wedding dress. I like pretty things. I also like porn and I masturbate excessively. I live in a pretty lush converted bus (which I decorated in a Walking Dead/zombie theme) with my dog, Ollie, who I love but insult...frequently.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a complicated past which involves a lot of pain and suffering. I\u0027m proudly autistic and openly discuss my struggles with addiction, depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder \u00a0and frequent thoughts of suicide. I am, what is commonly referred to as, \u0027a train wreck\u0027. I\u0027m a survivor of childhood abuse, domestic violence, and sexual assault. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have stories to tell\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I plan to do for the next six months is write. Write my memoir. Tell my story in bold, graphic detail. I want to expose every single injustice I\u0027ve ever witnessed, but more than that I want to expose my soul. I will be writing my memoir while travelling in my 1973, pink, newly fitted out early Bay Kombi, Shambala. My biggest issue, however, is that I have financial commitments related to my orphanage that have been preventing me from \u0027just going\u0027. I need to guarantee an extra $2,000/month for the next six months for me to focus exclusively on \u0027words\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo many of you have told me you would \u0027buy the shit out of my book\u0027, well that\u0027s not what I\u0027m asking you to do. Yet!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat I am offering you is a unique opportunity to come \u0027behind the scenes\u0027 in the process of writing. Share the experience. Maybe even become an enviable part of history\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt least once a week I\u0027ll be publishing special content exclusively for my Patreon supporters. Almost like a written podcast for a TV series you haven\u0027t seen yet. How fucking awful yet delicious does that sound?? These might include some general diary style posts about how I\u0027m feeling about the material I\u0027m focusing on and anecdotes from my travels. They might include copies of my expressive writing sessions, which I\u0027ll usually do for fifteen minutes in the morning before I attempt to write for the day. These can be pretty fucked up at times. And for my most supportive supporters I\u0027ll include some non-plot spoiling teasers from the manuscript.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis book is the most personally important project that I have worked on, ever. I\u0027m offering a unique opportunity to sit in the front row and be a part of it with me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you from the bottom of my cold, black heart for coming on board and helping me make this dream a reality\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e"
