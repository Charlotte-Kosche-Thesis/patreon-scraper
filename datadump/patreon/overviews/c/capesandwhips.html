Actually, after a writing hiatus for most of the year, I am back with a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://capesandwhips.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erevamped web site\u003c/a\u003e and related social media (including this page!) to offer up more of my writing for everyone\u0027s enjoyment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot has changed personally and in comics since I started my site and this Patreon in 2013 so unfortunately I do not have any more conference presentations to talk about or plan for, but I do have more time for writing. Which is also due to the sudden loss of my regular, non-writing involved job this year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what do you get in exchange for helping me keep a roof over my (and my partner\u0027s) head and keeping my utilities on the up and up?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll kinds of things! But especially Catwoman things. No one should go into my writing unwarned for the heavy Selina presence. ;) Although the scheduling became ... not very scheduled, one feature I have consistently run is a Sunday Fun Day involving, for both the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://capesandwhips.com/category/sunday-fun-day/escher-cats/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecurrent\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://capesandwhips.com/category/sunday-fun-day/wheres-waldo-jim-balent-catwoman-style/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eprevious\u003c/a\u003e, completed runs, the Jim Balent era of Catwoman\u0027s first solo series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut what am I going to like about that, you ask? (or maybe you don\u0027t! or maybe you already got bored!)\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eHidden cover cats! (sadly I must confess a few covers remain unsolved on my part and only one was reader-solved) Loving sarcasm about 90s covers and plots! (and loving love about good ones) Lengthy discussions of art and plotting and printing differences! (yes really, come for me discussing ink and paper) And, for the new run of Sunday Fun Day ...\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://eschergirls.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEscher Girls\u003c/a\u003e scorecards for every cover Jim Balent did for that first series! (and even more annotations and loving sarcasm, of course. I am supreme ruler of entertaining image captions and alt text)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat else do you have, o Empress of the Sarcastic Image Caption? What do you have to offer us that isn\u0027t the written equivalent of watching endless playlists of cute cat videos?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCute cat videos are in fact excellent entertainment (and cute puppy videos. and baby shark videos) but I also write, depending on time, energy, and material availability, longform posts doing straight up reviews of comics or other works or longform posts cataloguing and discussing fandom reactions, comic narratives, and contentious bits of continuity. I may also get back to throwing in fun quickies because everyone deserves a treat and some things are hard to find."
