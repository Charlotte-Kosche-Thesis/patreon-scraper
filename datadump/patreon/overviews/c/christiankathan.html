In addition to my published work for the publishing house \u00bbBeyond Affinity\u00ab (and the future novels there), I also will publish short stories and novels as a self-publisher in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith being a patron to me, you will support me directly to cover my daily life expenses as well as helping me to create fine literature and to publish it. You help me establish more ressources, to have more freedom in everyday life and in writing ... and to ensure the health and safety of my cats (Mia and Tiffy). With your support, I can finally (re-)build a good life and create amazing novels, I can help other artists and I can lay out the way for a phantastic journey on which you will be my travelling companion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy projects\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to have special projects. There will be an exclusive short story per month for my Patreon patrons, there will be special translations and exclusive spin-offs of my german projects (e.g. \u00bbLady Twilight\u00ab) and there will be quite bit of insight into my work as an author (and yes, there will be cat photos!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst Draft - Work in progress\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the very first version of my Patreon Description page. Thus, there will be updates and alterations and additional information appearing here in the future. It would be great, if you support the further development of the Patreon page (as well as my and my cat\u0027s existance) and join me on my progressional stride into a great future. Of course, please do not refrain from asking questions - please, contact me whenever you feel like. Looking forward to hearing from you soon! :-)\u003cbr\u003e"
