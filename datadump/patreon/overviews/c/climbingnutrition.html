    "summary": "I\u0027m Brian. I\u0027m a climber, a bodyweight-exercise afficionado, a writer, and a sports nutritionist. I run a site called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.climbingnutrition.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eClimbing Nutrition\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and I\u0027m asking for your help. But first, let\u0027s talk about what Climbing Nutrition is all about.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eScience-Driven, Climbing-Focused Nutrition \u0026amp; Diet Information\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nClimbing Nutrition is a \n\u003cem\u003escience-driven, climbing-focused nutrition website\u003c/em\u003e where climbers of all disciplines can get honest, accurate information about their diet. Using peer-reviewed research as the basis, I cover sports supplements, performance nutrition, common myths, and more, all in an effort to help you be the strongest, healthiest climber you can be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMost of my articles are long-form (2000-4000 words; that\u0027s about 8-16 pages long) and in-depth. I don\u0027t just give you a quick synopsis of a topic\u2014I explore it from all angles, link to relevant research, and address the potential controversies. When you finish an article, I want you to feel like you\u0027re as much an expert in it as I am, and to feel confident in the choices I encourage you to make.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition to \"one and done\" articles on climbing and nutrition-related topics, I also run several recurring features such as:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.climbingnutrition.com/supplements/depth-supplement-guides/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupplement Guides\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, where I compile all the current research on a topic, explore what it means for a climber, discuss dosage and safety concerns, and make a final recommendation.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.climbingnutrition.com/case-studies/case-study-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCase Studies\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, where I go show you the steps I would take if I were to see a particular individual as a client and discuss how you can apply those steps to your own diet.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.climbingnutrition.com/diet/how-much-protein-does-a-climber-need-part-i/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMacronutrient Series\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, where I go deep into a particular macronutrient (such as protein) and explore how it affects climbing.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.climbingnutrition.com/ask-a-question/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReader Questions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, where I answer readers\u0027 nutrition questions publically (and also\u2014much more frequently\u2014privately over email).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll of these features and articles\u00a0take a long time to research, write, and edit, and I currently do it all myself in my free time. So far, I haven\u0027t asked for any support, but as my vision for what Climbing Nutrition can become grows, I\u0027m realizing that I need more money, financial security, and time to make it a reality. That\u0027s where I\u0027m hoping \n\u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e will step in!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eI Want to Give You the Cleanest, Most Unbiased Experience Possible\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u0027t advertise on Climbing Nutrition and I have no sponsors because I want to remain as unbiased as possible. Several companies have contacted me about potentially advertising on my site, and I have rejected all of them because they are food- or nutrition-based companies; I don\u0027t want my writing to be affected, directly or indirectly, by a relationship with a company because they may not like what I have to say! Whenever I tell you something, you should be 100% confident that it is because I\u0027ve done the research, not because I\u0027m getting a kickback. I also don\u0027t use random ads because I want to deliver you the cleanest experience I possibly can, not a website optimized for revenue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith Patreon, you can support me and Climbing Nutrition \n\u003cem\u003eon your own terms\u003c/em\u003e by becoming my patron and funding me in as great or small a capacity as you feel able. Even if you cannot contribute much, collectively you have great power (think of it as an ongoing Kickstarter campaign for the constant improvement of Climbing Nutrition). And if you cannot afford (or don\u0027t want) to support me, then don\u0027t worry about it\u2014\u003cstrong\u003eall of Climbing Nutrition\u0027s features and writing will always remain free!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eIf you appreciate what I offer to you through Climbing Nutrition and you can afford to donate a small amount to me every month, then I hope you choose to help me out. Either way, thank you for being my reader, and thank you for your consideration!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat You Get When You Support Climbing Nutrition\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFirst and foremost, you get the satisfaction of helping out a worthy cause\u2014but you potentially also get much more. As Climbing Nutrition reaches higher tiers of funding, I will have the ability (thanks to increased financial security, revenue, and available time) to produce new and interesting types of features for the site. Some of these features include:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMeal plans \u0026amp; recipe guides for climbing trips!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCustom, online nutrition plans or programs for different goals!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eActual climbing-specific nutrition research!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u0027t offer \"rewards\" for individual levels of backing, however, because the guiding philosophy for Climbing Nutrition is open-access, free information for all, regardless of ability to pay. If I make access to a certain feature depend on payment, then it\u0027s no different than charging for that feature, and I want \u003cem\u003eeveryone\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to have access to this information, not just those who can or want to support me! If, in the future, I can provide non-information-based incentives (like T-shirts, or chalk bags, or whatever), then I may update the page\u2014but I will \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0charge for access to information.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat the Money Goes Towards\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe money you pledge goes towards supporting Climbing Nutrition in a number of direct and indirect ways.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou directly support Climbing Nutrition and new features by providing the revenue to create and develop those features. For example, creating an online program will require me to hire a developer. Creating meal plans means hiring a person who knows how to create tasty recipes when given a set of criteria. Just hosting a website costs money every month, and those costs grow as a site becomes more popular.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIndirectly, I need to make enough money to continue working on Climbing Nutrition as a primary focus, and to be able to focus even \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0time and energy into it in the future. I work part-time and also see clients, but the more steady an income I can make from Climbing Nutrition, the more effort I can put into it instead of my other jobs!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBecome My Patron and Support Open-Access, Science-Based, High-Quality Climbing and Nutrition Writing\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s the most I can say\u2014become my patron, and you\u0027ll be supporting open-access, science-based, high-quality climbing and nutrition writing, and you\u0027ll be helping spread that information to everyone else. I want all climbers to be healthy, safe, and strong, and I hope you\u0027ll help me spread the word.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks!\u003ca\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"

     "description": "\u003cstrong\u003eThis is the beginning of something great.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve always positioned Climbing Nutrition as a science-driven performance nutrition site for climbers, but so far that has only meant reading, interpreting, and writing about the research already out there. I will continue doing this, of course---but beginning with the achievement of this goal, I will also begin to perform my own research on climbing and nutrition to publish for all of you. The end goal? A fully crowd-funded research machine that explores sports science hypotheses about climbing that will simply \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0be funded in any other way because scientific funding is too limited to devote to these topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to start small; in some ways, \u003cstrong\u003ethis goal is a barometer\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0for how strongly the climbing community feels about my concept. If the concept takes off, the sky\u0027s the limit for how far we can go. To begin with, though, I want to put together a comprehensive, journal-grade survey covering climbing, nutrition, and physiology---this is a task I can execute myself, if need be, and therefore ideal for a starting point because it doesn\u0027t require a lot of funding. If we do reach this $250 level of funding (or above!), then future goals will be \u003cstrong\u003ebigger.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave climbing nutrition surveys been done before? Yes. This doesn\u0027t make this goal less worthwhile, however, because a major part of science is reproduction. Whatever this survey tells us will be weighed against every other survey; together, we\u0027ll get an even better idea, and we\u0027ll be better able to compensate for each survey\u0027s relative weaknesses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy timeline for completing this survey will depend on what level of funding we achieve. If we only hit this goal, I estimate it will take 6 months to design the survey, a couple months of circulating, and a few more months for data interpretation---so about a year start to finish. If we hit some of the stretch goals, it will take longer because there will more formalities to address. \u003cstrong\u003eIn these cases, I will continually update you with what\u0027s happening and cite interesting data from the survey outside the context of a completed publication so it\u0027s not opaque.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne last thing:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027m going to be running this Patreon page a little like a Kickstarter campaign in that we will all be working towards \u003cem\u003eshort-term, tangible goals\u003c/em\u003e. Right now it\u0027s a survey; in the future, it may be a study or something similar. There is a big difference, however, which is that Patreon is \u003cem\u003eongoing\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0support while Kickstarter is a one-time big donation. \u003cstrong\u003eScience needs ongoing support to work.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0While I would love to propose a study, get funding, and then make it happen, I think such an approach would ultimately fail or fall behind. With an ongoing support approach, we can continually increase the scope of the work we\u0027re doing, perhaps even helping to fund \u003cem\u003eother\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0scientists who want to do research on climbing but cannot due to lack of funding---which would be huge!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay---let\u0027s see if we can make this happen! Remember, this is only the \u003cstrong\u003einitial goal\u003c/strong\u003e. There will be more projects down the road, and there are \u003cstrong\u003estretch goals\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0for this current project. I encourage you to click through and see what they are!\u003cbr\u003e",
