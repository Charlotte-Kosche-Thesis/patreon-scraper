I\u0027ve found myself sidetracked by quite a few ridiculous things over the last few years, but I\u0027ve finally got myself together and started Photoshopping cats with energy beams coming out of their eyes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn July 30th 2016, I began my latest artistic adventure, \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/catlazers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCAT LAZERS\u003c/a\u003e!\" It is a sassy Facebook page featuring daily images of user-submitted pictures of cats which I moronically eviscerate in Photoshop. The result could be a cat starting a forest fire, or destroying a city \u003cem\u003ea la \u003c/em\u003eCatzilla, or scorching a large chunk of the galaxy. Whatever\u0027s funniest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all started one day when my friend Cole proudly posted a picture of his cat. It had horrendously glowing eyes in the picture, and I decided to have some fun by Photoshopping it destroying a city with those powerful retinas... the very first LAZER CAT. The response was strong enough to make me want to try a few more, and before long I had started up the now-glorious CAT LAZERS Facebook page for the whole world to \"enjoy.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts ranks are growing, and my very real mathematical estimates arrive unfailingly at a CAT LAZERS FEATURE FILM arriving in your local IMAX theater by 2022. Save the date! In the meantime, I can\u0027t build this mighty empire of cats and lazers (and maybe a few other surprises along the way) without your support. Commissioned works are planned, as well as whorish merchandising, but if you take a moment to subscribe here on Patreon and join the growing ranks of SUPER LAZERIANS, your patronage will be personally rewarded!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not already a Patreon member, it takes about 14 seconds to sign up through Facebook. Once you\u0027ve done that, take another 9 seconds to select any amount you want to contribute every month (and you can set a max, just in case you become drunk with generosity and risk bankruptcy). You can be a vanguard supporter of my new venture before the rest of the world, and tell all your friends how ridiculously cool you are because of that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBE\u00a0A SUPER LAZERIAN.\u003cbr\u003e"
