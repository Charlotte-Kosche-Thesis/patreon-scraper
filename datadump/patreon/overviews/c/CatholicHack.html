    "summary": "I am passionate about traditional archery and I know you are too! For us, this is more than just a sport... it\u0027s a journey. For me, it\u0027s spiritual... apart of who I am as a Christian. \u00a0For the past few years I have been producing traditional archery videos (tips, tricks, techniques \u0026amp; more) to help share our passion with others and to build a community around this lifestyle/sport. I\u0027ve been blessed to have several videos featured and promoted by YouTube and gain tens of thousands of views. I\u0027ve run into archers online, and in person, who have told me how much my videos have helped them, and I am truly honored and blessed to have a role in their journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, after much prayer and discernment, I felt the need to create a new YouTube channel dedicated to Traditional archery, to better focus on this community.\u00a0\u00a0I truly feel that together we can add tremendous value to the trad archery community around the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe biggest challenge to producing consistent, quality videos for this community has been time. The trick to building a YouTube channel is consistency (much like in archery). Given that I am a husband, father of 6, and work full time in Catholic broadcasting... my schedule is often NOT my own. This makes it truly difficult for me to achieve my vision.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to produce at least one video per week for this community but, do to that, given my challenges with family/work/youtube/life, I know I can NOT do it ALONE and I\u0027m going to need help. If I can \"nail\" this goal of $250 per video, I will be able to afford to pay a reliable video editor/producer to assist me with the production process on a weekly basis. Additionally, it will lay the ground work for the future content I am planning to produce (product reviews, podcasts, films etc.). \u00a0These funds are crucial to helping me bring value to the traditional archery community online.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWould you consider becoming my patreon and helping me build our community? I have several levels for you to choose from, these are designed to best fit your budget. This is not a one-time gift but, rather a reoccurring patronage per video released on my YouTube channel. Not only can you choose your level (look to the right hand side) but, also, you can limit the maximum amount you want to give per month. Plus, you can cancel at anytime. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for considering your patronage of this work, and thank you for watching my videos and helping to share our passion for traditional archery. Together, we will inspire a new generation of traditional archers!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m praying for you, that you shoot straight, and I hope that you will pray for me, that I shoot straight too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMay God Richly Bless You!\u003cbr\u003eJoe McClane"
