From that day on, I have been a huge Nintendo fangirl and have bought every main Nintendo console and main series game that Nintendo has created.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027ve recently started making YouTube videos with my friends Mike, Jewel, Blitz, Kitty, Marcus and Marlee. In particular, we\u0027re creating a lot of Splatoon video content in the form of our \u0027Fun Times with Woomys!\u0027 series. Splatoon isn\u0027t all we do though! We have recently started another series based on Mario Kart (Fun Times with Vroomy\u0027s!), with more possible in future!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9-qFz03aoDM\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWhen I started making videos, I had no idea that they would take off in the way they have. So much so, that it has now somewhat become a full time job to produce them! I love creating these videos, right from filming them with the crew, to production, and to release and seeing everyone enjoy them. Sadly though, creating these videos does come at a cost but hopefully with your help, I can continue to create more and more awesome video gaming content!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMaking these costs money?

There are other benefits available too, which you can see in the Rewards area of my page!
