    "summary": "We\u0027ve been making\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://crateandcrowbar.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe Crate \u0026amp; Crowbar podcast\u003c/a\u003e for over three years, and we love doing it. We\u0027re really proud of the community that has grown up around our rambly, tipsy chats about games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re returning to Patreon with a view to sustaining and growing this thing we\u0027ve made. If you\u0027re up for contributing a dollar or two per episode, we\u0027ll put it into a fund that we\u0027ll use to cover various expenses, compensate contributors for their time, purchase new equipment, and establish spinoff projects - like our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag7sc-ecG1w\u0026amp;list=PLS0A_TmLPr5F6DNE4kWbWfklIXDA8djDD\u0026amp;index=1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDark Souls II\u003c/a\u003e video series or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://crateandcrowbar.com/2016/11/24/dishonored-2-a-lock-in-at-the-crate-and-crowbar/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDishonored 2 deep-dive\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn particular, we\u0027d love to put this money towards hosting cool guests on the podcast and covering their expenses. As everyone\u0027s life circumstances have changed, getting three or four people in a room to record has become more of a challenge. In some cases the reasons for this are obvious: new jobs in other countries will do that. However all of our lives have shifted in ways that change the value of our time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHosting more guests would be great because it allows us to bring new viewpoints and areas of expertise to the show and give regular podcasters a break. This is one of the ways that your money will help us make Crate \u0026amp; Crowbar better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore broadly, we\u0027re excited to expand the range of subjects we cover. While you can expect that Crate \u0026amp; Crowbar will continue to be primarily a podcast about PC games (plus tangents), the community around the podcast and its creators both have diverse interests. We\u0027re excited to include tabletop gaming, roleplaying, pop culture, TV and film in the range of things that we talk about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions about how the Patreon works, there\u0027s a channel dedicated to just that on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/0Uz2RsGMemgl9DZT\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eour Discord server\u003c/a\u003e.
