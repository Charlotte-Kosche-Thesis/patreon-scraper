It is about creating a final product in which the colors and style of the dice, convey the meaning behind the imagery which is used. It\u0027s making sure that a line image is used rather than a silhouette, or vice versa, depending on the situation to ensure a final product that looks nice.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt can be a multiple step process that undergoes several stages in the creation process, it is one I enjoy, and that I have been sharing with my friends and family on Facebook for years.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings us to why we are here! How you can be involved, what you can get, and how you can help support an independent entrepreneur while having fun and getting cool swag at the same time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://thecaverns.net/store/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_9095.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0*Black Dragon Soaring in the Sky - Stile Teckel design for Caveloot.com Stock\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best thing for you to take a look at is the Rewards and goals section if you\u0027re still interested \u0026lt;g\u0026gt;enough after\u0026lt;/g\u0026gt; my summary, to check out all the details.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn summary, though, let\u0027s break it into those two sections.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSHOW ME THE DICE! \u003cbr\u003eRewards, what can you get for supporting me? Please note that rewards are dependent upon pledge level!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e- I will share the majority of my dice creation projects with my Patrons from start to finish. This includes both custom orders from customers as well as projects to be carried in-store inventory.\u003cbr\u003e-Dice sent to you at no cost from each new Inventory order we place\u003cbr\u003e-Discount opportunities for custom Dice orders\u003cbr\u003e-Discounts from our store(s)\u003cbr\u003e-Earn commissions on goal funded dice projects in the form of free product.\u003cbr\u003e-Chance to provide input and help finalize the dice we create\u003cbr\u003e-More!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eNot a Reward:\u003cbr\u003eSomething else I will be doing, that is not part of any sort of official reward. Because I appreciate the support I earn from my Patrons and I want to give something extra back. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month I will be giving away a gift of one random die from my store inventory. \u0026lt;g\u0026gt;I\u0027ll\u0026lt;/g\u0026gt; choose who I am sending this gift to at random and all shipping costs will be paid (Including international shipping). I\u2019ll be putting ALL my Patrons \u0026lt;g\u0026gt;who\u0026lt;/g\u0026gt; support me at ANY and ALL reward levels into my drawing for this free gift each month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT?\u003cbr\u003eWhile I could do nothing but create dice all day long, every day, creating dice costs money! Here are a few of the things I would like to accomplish.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e-Money for some equipment to do proper Video recording for you all! This is a small one-time expense.\u003cbr\u003e- Create dice, give you dice, sell dice, and make more dice! Primarily money from patrons will be used to create dice projects. The higher the funds I receive the more often I will be able to create new dice. In return, the idea is that I am creating ways to put those dice in your pockets for helping to support us.\u003cbr\u003e- While I am initially putting in place some cool (I hope!) Goals, further goals and ideas will be something I will develop as I have time to work with my supporters for the \u0026lt;g\u0026gt;feedback\u0026lt;/g\u0026gt;!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn summary, its ALL about Dice!\u003cbr\u003eSincerely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eSir Stile Teckel\u003cbr\u003eOwner of Caveloot.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://thecaverns.net/store/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ankh-Quill.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Please note that all refrence to dice on this Patreon, is in regard to D6 (six-sided) dice, at this time. In the future additional dice types may be added (and I have customized D10 before). Keeping it simple to start!\u003c/div\u003e"
