Crimson Vial Studio is young, small and ambitious group (impressive, isn\u0027t it? I can bet you\u0027ve never met anything like this!).\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Precisely we are:\u003cbr\u003e Viarch: Artist, scripter (you can see some of his works \u003cbr\u003ehere\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/dinarproductions\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eViarch Productions\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e Aleter: Writer, scripter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0What are we\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0trying to create?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Our project is called \"Dark Influence: Stolen Fate\". It\u0027s a story of demonic being that traveled (actually escaped) from his own dimension to world inhabited by humans(mostly), who live in society more or less similar to european Renaissance. You\u0027ll lead him from being penniless and homeless refuge to rich brothel owner (what is good adult game without brothel?) and eventually to..... no, no spoilers. You\u0027ll meet and \"conquer\" a lot of women on the way, gather tons of riches, and ... damn, no spoilers again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is distinct about DI:SF? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 It is attempt to show the story throught the eyes of non-human being - with his own, non-human set of priorities, bias and understanding what is right and what is wrong. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 We are trying to keep it as realistic as possible (considering the fact that there are demons and magic in game world). People are superstitious and uneducated, they won\u0027t became your best friends\\followers\u00a0after first meeting and their moral code is far from modern Earth one. Women won\u0027t jump into your bed two seconds after you approached them (unless you know, they do it for money), social taboos are strong, and it will require a lot of time and efforts to persuade or force people to break it. No sudden gifts from the sky, noone going to give you anything for free, and revealing your identity could lead to disasterous consequences. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eAbout gameplay...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 You should handle your limited resources to achieve best possible outcome, however we are trying hard to make sure that most of the goals could be reached through more than one way and there will be very little to nothing obviously bad or good choices.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Grind... oh, that is one scary word. There will be some, we won\u0027t deny it, but the further you\u0027ll progress , the less grind will be included. That\u0027s right, egocentric demons like working even less than you do! Building web of \"favors\", investments, obligations and blackmails, gather emploees and hirelings, building \"harem\"  - those are your goals (why work yourself, when there are people that could do it for you?). You have more important thing to do - like chasing women! Or riches! Or means to resolve conflicts with those who dared to cross your path! \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Every your significant action in this world will cost you something - time, money, mana, favors. Magic, though powerful, never comes without the cost. And .... Your hero must have sex on regular basis to survive! Trust us, there will be plenty of persons to have sex with!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eWhy donate?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Because we are great guys! (Stop, I already used that joke before, damn!). Well, with your support we\u0027ll be able to put more time and efforts into game development, purchase more and better models, and pay for English proof-reading ( we both aren\u0027t native English speakers, so we apologise in advance for mistakes and hope that those mistakes wouldn\u0027t ruin your game experience completely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eLink to public version:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://mega.nz/#!1ZQElCoB!bwQWsJtlzv56G7VWEYeqOHHQm_3WIiGQdqeM7g0QYO8\"\u003eMEGA\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
