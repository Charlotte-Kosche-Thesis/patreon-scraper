I\u0027m Melissa, a cosplayer based in the West of Canada that occasionally hangs out in the USA. I\u0027ve been going to conventions for 8 years and cosplaying for the last 6 years, so cosplaying has been a very prominent aspect in my life! I love being able to create and bring characters to life, it\u0027s always been a ton of fun for me and the learning, challenges, and satisfaction making costumes has brought me makes cosplay a very rewarding craft.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/16938559_1820433934878197_9160544286559837299_n.jpg?oh=750ccdc5cc15584e6bb109707a2f05d3\u0026amp;oe=59966C25\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy make a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eBetween living expenses, \u003cstrong\u003esaving up for post secondary \u003c/strong\u003eand the big move that will be involved with it, as well as making sure to be able to visit my significant other 2000 miles away, it\u0027s become very hard to keep up with making cosplays and being able to craft as freely as I used to. As such, having a Patreon allows me to have the funds to not only make costumes, but give things to supporters that I wouldn\u0027t be able to regularly (Such as prints and a lot more personal interactions). \u003cbr\u003eFunding aside, Patreon will give me the incentive and motivation to work hard, document my work, get out of my lazy comfort zone and experiment much more, and do more photoshoots that I want to do!
