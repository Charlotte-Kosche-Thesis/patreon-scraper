I mostly\npaint figurative humans or humanoid creatures. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy work is influenced by movie/other stories atmospheres and aesthetic.\nSome of my very early acrylic paintings which I now think of as \u201cclassics\u201d and\nwere really my first step into horror and macabre, were inspired by the real\nlife experiences of Chris Costner-Sizemore as written in her auto-biography\nEve. Chris, who was born in the late 20s, had multiple personalities, which\nfought against each other, and caused her to lead a very strange and troubled\nlife. A movie called The Three Faces of Eve was made about her, based on a\nbiography one of her doctors wrote, but as she states in her own telling of her\nlife this first book and movie is highly inaccurate. Eve reads more like a\nfictional book, and shows the horror of being undiagnosed and misunderstood in\nan un-accepting world, while having your own self (or selves) against you. My\nartwork at this time features portraits being mutilated by pencils (as well as\nwriting her autobiography, Chris was also an artist), mixed media works using\nold photos and collage, and cogs to symbolise thought and the workings of the\nbrain. Cogs have since been present in many of my works. Chris was an advocate\nfor others with multiple personalities, until her death in 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe darkness of movies like Alien, The Matrix, and the game series\nSilent Hill inspires me to create dark and creepy works. Although I like\neverything weird I\u2019m not actually all that dark a person, which is why I think\nmuch of my art turns out somewhat light-hearted. My final works for Fine Arts\ndegree were based on this dark humour, or light-hearted horror, with films like\nHellraiser and Peter Jackson\u2019s \u201cSplatstick\u201d being major influences. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/crosseyedmorgan\"\u003ePlease consider supporting me by becoming a Patron, while also accessing exclusive rewards.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/crosseyedmorgan \"\u003eI\u2019m also the creator and Director of the Cross-Eyed Collective.
