Now that same journey continues with each video I publish, for you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0.5em 0.5em;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://geo.chasingtheironman.net/images/Phoon-example-CITO.jpg\" width=\"120\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIn the CTI logo\u003c/strong\u003e is what\u0027s called a \"phoon\" pose, and I marked every day that year with a phoon photo. Now, I hope to use this theme to encourage and inspire others to challenge themselves, to never give up, to look forward to the goal, not down in discouragement when things may get tough. The theme is dedicated to my mother, whose faith set a precedent in my life, both in daily struggles and in my own walk of faith.\u00a0 We can never achieve perfection, but as long as we keep our eyes up and on the target, we can move forward and continue our strive to improve, to grow, and to help others along the way in their own journeys and struggles.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI started this Patreon to\u003c/strong\u003e aid in my desire to create and produce content for you. Each video takes a lot of work (and if you know me you know I\u0027m a perfectionist!), and tools and equipment - and things cost money, go figure!\u00a0 And as much as I\u0027d love to be able to do costly things for people with money solely from own pocket (and will continue to do so when it\u0027s possible), this is an opportunity to open more avenues in this creative endeavour, while also hopefully being able to encourage and inspire others in the same way I was, to pay it forward. Any funds received through this Patreon will go exclusively to tier fulfillment and costs related to all things \u0027Chasing the Ironman\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you sincerely for your patronage!
