I\u0027m in the middle of a huge transition from traditional photography to sculptural and pigmented resin works. I create using plastic-based polymers, alcohol suspensions, mica, ink and other synthetic products. While most of my current artworks\u00a0are intended to hang from a wall, not all of them are. I welcome anyone who is interested in my journey, to come along for the ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I offer\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAt any given time, I have scheduled content slowly being released across multiple social media platforms for absolutely free, but what I am offering you for your support is a chance to bypass the waiting and get a little more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1 a month gets you 30-day early access to all my public posts. These posts consist of a BTS (behind the scenes) post every other Saturday, a HIM (how it\u2019s made) post every other month, and my monthly updates that post on the first Monday of every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the $5 mark, you will get instant access to my WIP (work-in-progress) updates. These weekly posts are released every Wednesday. They cover the progress of my current projects, commissioned works, and unlike my other posts, they never go public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who invest a little more, I create original artwork exclusive to Patreon as a thank you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoin the Community\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease know that your presence on\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cerebral_aperture/\"\u003e Instagram\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/CerebralApertur\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CerebralAperture/\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e, etc is also an infinite encouragement to me.
