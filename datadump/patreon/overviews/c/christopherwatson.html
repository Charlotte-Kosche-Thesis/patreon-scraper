My particular interest is the Dusky Grasswren (\u003cem\u003eAmytornis purnelli\u003c/em\u003e) and the members of the Striated Grasswren group living across central Australia. Our taxonomy of this group is far from complete. I\u0027m interested in refining our systematic understanding of the grasswrens and gaining a more up-to-date and high-resolution picture of their distribution. Habitat loss/modification is a growing threat to outback species and we may be in danger of losing species before they are described. We need to know *exactly* where they live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEcotourism\u003c/strong\u003e - I\u0027ve been involved with wildlife tourism for many years and continue to run tours from time to time. I\u0027m interested in documenting the scientific contributions made by ecotourists and tour guides.\u00a0I think ecotourism and ornithology are a natural partnership for funding research and exploration in remote areas.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy patrons\u0027 support will assist me by allowing me to spend less time at my day job and more time in the field on arid zone ornithology projects and in the office chipping away at publishing projects, reviewing books and maintaining the blog. I write about my time in the field and use my experiences to profile scientists and their work, and highlight conservation and ecological issues of interest and/or import.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNB: Patreon ONLY charges in $US.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
