On the site, I create and post graphics that look at the facets of Chemistry that we come across on an everyday basis. Through the site, I want to bring chemistry knowledge to as many people as possible! The graphics are shared under a Creative Commons licence, and available to download for free so that they can be printed and displayed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re new to Compound Interest,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.compoundchem.com/infographics/\"\u003echeck out the index on the site to see the graphics!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting the site, you\u0027ll be helping towards its hosting costs, as well as contributing towards the continual development of the website and its content. Making the graphics takes a fair bit of time, and doesn\u0027t leave me time to do other things, like improving the appearance of the site, and making it easier to access old graphics. I\u0027ve also got lots of plans for the site\u0027s future, including creating some form of compendium of all of the graphics on the site, and possibly even creating a graphical chemistry textbook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of whether you\u0027d like to contribute or not, the site\u0027s content will always be free to access. If you do want to contribute, I\u0027d hugely appreciate it!\u003cbr\u003e"
