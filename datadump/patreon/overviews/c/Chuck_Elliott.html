    "summary": "So here\u0027s the thing. Somewhere along the way it seemed like a really good idea to start making more ephemeral, experimental print work, to set alongside the larger pieces I\u0027m making with Perspex and laser technologies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe there\u0027s an opportunity here to get back in touch with the roots of what being a print maker can be, creating beautiful, intriguing, ephemeral works on paper, that can be enjoyed in the moment, stored, given away, or displayed around your home. A little like a bunch of flowers from your garden, fabulous, but transient, to be replaced by a new bunch in the not too distant future....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the idea for the project, a kind of \u0027print club\u0027 where people who love geometric, colour, abstract digital print can look forward to being sent 4 new pieces of work to collect every year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon seems to have bridged that most particular of problems; how to connect an artist with a small group of collectors who\u0027d like to support contemporary studio practice. In exchange for a $25 monthly fee, I\u0027ll pledge to create 4 new works on paper each year, and post them out to you, 2 at a time, Spring and Autumn. The works may be etchings, screen prints, Gicl\u00e9e or Lambda prints. Maybe single pieces or part of a series. The content will be a continuation of my current exploration into light, line, movement, colour and form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver a period I hope we\u0027ll build up a dialogue, in which the output of the studio can be mapped through this collection of new works. Entirely exclusive to Patreon, the size of each edition will be strictly limited to the number of members on the date of issue. Maybe just you and me, and never more than 144 people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the works will be signed, numbered and dated. The pieces will never be re issued. It\u0027s here and now only, a moment in time. So there\u0027s even a chance that the works may become collectible, who knows...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn simple terms, you\u0027ll receive 4 unique new prints in the post, twice yearly, Spring and Autumn, in exchange for a payment of $25 per month. That\u0027s $75 USD or approximately \u00a355 per artwork, including packing and delivery. And of course you can leave the club whenever you want to, with no further obligation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoes this idea work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have absolutely no idea, but I think it\u0027ll be interesting to find out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLooking back in time, would I love to have been able to subscribe to a regular piece of new print work by Hokusai or Chillida? Absolutely yes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoes my studio have that resonance or stature, definitely no!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut maybe by using this new method of funding for a private studio practice, alongside gallery shows and group exhibitions, we\u0027ll be able to create a new framework for the creation and collection of contemporary print.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSure in the knowledge that peer to peer Patronage will make a real difference to the progress of the form over the coming years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePure logical progression...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChuck Elliott"

To collect, display, frame or give away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll mostly be using digital tools, but maybe not always... ideas I have for the club right now include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA 50cm square Lambda photographic print, ready to frame\u003cbr\u003eAn aquatint etching\u00a0on hand made paper, printed at Spike Print Studio\u003cbr\u003eA\u00a0foil blocked bi colour geometric study on pearlescent board\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also planning to include some smaller items with each mail out, included alongside the main editions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA printed flick book of an animated sequence that I\u0027m working on\u003cbr\u003eA set of postcards on metallic board to send to your friends\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the main works will be signed, dated and numbered, and will only ever be issued once, exclusively via Patreon. So if you\u0027re in, you\u0027ll get a series of unique works, that I hope will build into an intriguing collection over the coming years. Strictly limited to the number of people in the club, with a maximum membership of 144. That\u0027s 12 x 12. I tend to work with 12. It\u0027s a beautifully divisable number when you\u0027re working with geometry....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope it sounds like a good offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll be helping to fund my studio, whilst simultaneously collecting some, hopefully fabulous, contemporary print work. I like the idea of using this new digital technology, Patreon, to build a bright future for an age old form, printmaking. It\u0027s an exciting prospect...",
