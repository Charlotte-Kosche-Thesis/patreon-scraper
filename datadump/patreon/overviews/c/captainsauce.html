This is\nwhere you can help support my passion in creating entertaining gaming videos\nfor you to enjoy. I\u2019ve loved YouTube\u0027s gaming community for years, but\nonly started creating my own videos a little over a year ago. It wasn\u2019t long before I developed a passion for content creation and began building my\ntruly inspiring community. Now I wake up every morning with a smile on my face,\neager to sit down and play a game with you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhere do your pledges go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe short term plan is to have all pledges go toward maintaining and improving video production. The long term plan is to have patreon act as a cornerstone\nin my transitioning into fulltime YouTube. Ive never hidden the fact that my\ndream is to be a fulltime YouTuber, but taking that step is a big risk. You not\nonly have to earn enough money to maintain the channel, but also to live off\nof. YouTube is a volatile place and right now ad revenue is suffering. I hope that by growing support through patreon, ill be able to safely make that transition someday without having to make compromises.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this sounds like something you want to contribute to, check out the donation tiers and rewards to the right! Regardless of whether you decide to become a patron or not, thank you for supporting me and my channel. Your viewership is worth more to me than any donation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards are usually sent out 1 month after signing up to prevent fraud. Some people try to register using fake information or sign up for the reward but cancel before being charged. If you don\u0027t get your reward, reach out to me!!! I want to know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- CaptainSauce\u003cbr\u003e"
