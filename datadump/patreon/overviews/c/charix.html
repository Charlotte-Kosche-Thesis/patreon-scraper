Here is a way to support my creation and get some extra little things of your own. They are small things. Ways of saying thank you if you support me, but not something that people will miss if they don\u0027t or can\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be no Patron Exclusive content created. VIPs generally get Nifty Stuff that\u0027s fun but not earth shattering. They especially get that warm fuzzy feeling* that comes from contributing to the writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you can\u0027t pledge as high as VIP level, your contribution is appreciated and goes toward the overall goal of getting me to make more awesome stuff for you. And you have extra weight in your say when I ask for opinions and input. And should you choose to just depart and pledge nothing, you\u0027ll still see all the things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGot comments or questions? Let\u0027s hear them! I read all the comments! I may not be able to respond to them immediately, and some may not get a response at all, but if I am aware of it, I read it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVery Important Information:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledge amount are considered \"Monthly, but only when something happens\". If Something Happens in a month, there will be a -single- \"paid\" alert that month. All things that happen will have alerts, but only one will generate a charge. So if nothing happens, no pledge charge. If one thing happens, one pledge charge. Two or more things is still only a flat one pledge charge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason for this is...?\u003cbr\u003eA: So that you have a stable expectation of what you will be donating. It won\u0027t be one thing one month and five another.\u003cbr\u003eB: So that you are not donating when nothing happens. Putting monthly donations into nothing happening is silly, so you know something happens for all donations\u003cbr\u003eC: So that I am not stressed out trying to make every happening \"worth it\". There may be small things, big things, medium things, many things, few things, or no things. I do have a full time job and many things to accomplish on a daily basis after all. Make sure you make a pledge that you are comfortable with regardless of whether there\u0027s a thousand or fifty thousand words that month.\u003cbr\u003eD: All of the above.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Hint: The answer is D.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(* Probably not a Kitsune, sorry)\u003cbr\u003e"
