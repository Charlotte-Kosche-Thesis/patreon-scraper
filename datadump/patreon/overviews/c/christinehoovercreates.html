I mean that.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been creating content on my website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.gracecoversme.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGrace Covers Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, for about 10 years now, including writing weekly blog posts, producing occasional videos and printables, releasing ebooks, and more. As I\u0027ve poured countless hours into this work, I\u0027ve found great joy in connecting with readers and pointing them to Christ.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently I also began producing a podcast,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/by-faith-with-christine-hoover/id1341513188?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy Faith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, in which I talk with men and women who are walking forward by faith in specific and often difficult circumstances. I created the podcast in conjunction with the release of my latest book,\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://amzn.to/2uuTcCX\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSearching for Spring\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, thinking it would be temporary, but I\u0027ve enjoyed this work so much that I\u0027d like to continue the podcast indefinitely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to continue to do deep word-work: authoring books, writing articles on my blog, and producing the podcast. I want to use my gifts to encourage and help the Church.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the same time, I have a growing desire to live embodied and localized. In other words, I want to continue using the gifts God has given me to serve the Church, but I want to do it in a way that allows me to focus on my local church context (rather than traveling for speaking engagements) and in relationships that help me thrive. My prayer is that God would use my writing in a way that serves not only my local church but anyone who interacts with my words. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to serve my family well.\u00a0For several years, I\u0027ve paid out-of-pocket for tools I use that are increasing in cost and are starting to add up, things like Mailchimp (sending out blog posts), Link in Profile (for your ease of use on Instagram), domain registration, and website redesigns. With podcasting, I\u0027ve added costs for Zoom (recording podcast interviews) and Buzzsprout (podcast storage). I\u0027ve considered ads, but the bottom line is that ads just aren\u0027t me. Instead of ads, I\u0027d rather focus on continuing to provide biblical content to serve you, and I\u0027d rather recommend books and opportunities that I really believe in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWould you consider a partnership with me in order to make my continued work possible?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027d be incredibly grateful. I do not take lightly the opportunities God has given me, nor the audience he\u0027s directed my way, and I promise, with your help, to continue to be faithful to the work God has called me: speaking and writing gospel truths in a compelling way.\u003cbr\u003e"
