    "summary": "Hi! My name is Jason, and I make a\nwebcomic (Chainmail Bikini) about the kind of stories I like the\nmost: High adventure in a world of swords and sorcery! I am heavily\ninspired by things like Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, Lord of the Rings,\nConan and all the amazing artists and authors who have helped us peer into a myriad of \nfantasy realms over the ages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon is a crowdfunding site that\nallows artists and other creators to receive the patronage of\nenthusiasts like you, in the form of monetary pledges. In short, your\npledges contribute directly to your favorite creator and his or her\ncreations!\u00a0Patreon isn\u0027t a charity, it\u0027s about giving your favorite artists a reward for a job well done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s my hope that a few of you, who\nhappen to like my comic, might see fit to show your appreciation by\npledging a little money to my cause. Think of it like a tip for a\nservice provided, not absolutely required, but very encouraging to\nreceive.  My webcomic will always be free for all, that\u0027s the service\nI provide: a little entertainment when I post a new page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo what do you need to do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAll -you- have to do is click on that\nbutton above that says \u0027Become a Patron\u0027 and select a pledge level\nyou feel appropriate. You can pay via paypal or a credit card, and\nyou can set a monthly limit so you don\u0027t have to worry about paying\nmore than you\u0027d like to. You will only pay when I post a new comic\npage (2 to 3 times a month), and your payment will automatically\nhappen at the end of the month. It\u0027s easy and hassle free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my utmost gratitude for\nbecoming a patron of my art, you will also receive tokens of my\nappreciation in the form of access to Chainmail Bikini content only\navailable here on Patreon, such as sketches, concept art, .pdf files\nfor print, line art for those who like to color, and early viewing of\nnew pages. I\u0027m new to this Patreon thing, so I don\u0027t have much\navailable yet. I apologize for that, but I am working on it, please\nbear with me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I plan to do with your\npledges?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBuild and grow my site and comic, maybe\nget my own DNS and web hosting. Buy supplies, like pens, markers,\nnon-photo blue pencils, and inks. Maybe even save up for a copy of\nPhotoshop, or a Wacom Cintiq ( I can dream big, can\u0027t I?)!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMany artists dream of being able to\nsupport themselves with their passions, but unfortunately, it\u0027s just\nnot in the cards for most of us. If I could manage to some day\nsupplement my income even a little through my art, I would be\noverjoyed!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you if you managed to read this\nwall of text, you are a trooper!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003etl;dr \u003c/strong\u003e\u2013\nI would greatly appreciate your patronage!\u003cbr\u003e"
