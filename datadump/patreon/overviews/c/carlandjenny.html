Discovering new languages, cultures and nature, meeting new people and making new friends? Downshifting your life and get more time to live? And to do it all with a sailboat?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHi there from Carl and Jenny\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e so much for making it to our Patreon page.

Early 2017 we both took early retirement to fulfil our plans. We had lived in England all of our lives, working hard and raising two wonderful children who are now grown up. We sold our house, exchanged contracts, and put the deposit down on a Bavaria 47 sailing yacht and once the house sale completed we bought the boat.Time then to move to Crete to live aboard the boat. Setting off\u00a0for a life on the ocean wave breaking free of the traditional lifestyle, and creating a sustainable life cruising around the world. Join us on our adventures before and during our time to departure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can follow us\u003c/strong\u003e through our training, theory and practical and some of our day to day adventures.

Through our videos we can share with you the places we visit, the culture, history and wildlife of each unique place.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOur aim of Filming, editing, and releasing one feature episode per week is a \u003cstrong\u003eFULL-TIME job\u003c/strong\u003e in itself, and often takes more time and energy than many of our boating jobs! Along with extra vids and live chat shows we literally have a camera with us all of the time.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt\u2019s \u003cstrong\u003eimpossible\u003c/strong\u003e for us to continue to release high quality, consistent videos for our entire journey \u003cstrong\u003ewithout your help\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe hope our videos\u003c/strong\u003e will serve as both entertainment and a look into the realities of preparing to cruise, and the cruising/live-aboard life for other prospective cruisers and travellers!\u003cbr\u003eYour support will help fund better suited recording \u0026amp; editing equipment so we can improve on the videos we bring you.
