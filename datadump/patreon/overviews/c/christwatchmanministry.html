What does that mean? Well in today\u0027s time, as Daniel prophesied \"knowledge shall increase\" (\u003cem\u003eDaniel 12:4\u003c/em\u003e) many receive their information online or through social media. However, there aren\u0027t many mainstream TV resources-if any, for a millennial audience to receive Christian relevant news and commentary on trending topics and YouTube lacks Christian news continuity, but there\u0027s news continuity for every other topic from sneakers, to games, tech, fashion, and entertainment and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo Christ\u0027s Watchman Ministry is here to fill that void as an urban news shows hosted by West \"Watchman\" Brooks who gives world news updates, reports, research, and commentary through a Christian biblical and eschatological (study of end times) point of view. No suits and ties, religious robes, bragging of titles and degrees-just the facts, the truth, and commentary on what the word of God has to say about it. The views, opinions, and beliefs of West \"Watchman\" Brooks are to inform, update, and educate the christian community and show how lessons, stories, and events in the Bible correlates to today\u0027s modern time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is all in an effort to find God\u0027s lessons and the truths of Jesus Christ in a very dark and cold world, that His light might shine through Christians, so that His sheep might be fed and gathered unto Him. In addition, remember as the Book of Revelation gives prophetic events that leads to Jesus second coming (because nobody knows the day and hour of His return), Christ\u0027s Watchman Ministry will track these events that Christians might watch, understand, and be prepared for Jesus arrival as the Lord warns \"\u003c/span\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eBehold, I am coming as a thief.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBlessed is he who watches\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eand keeps his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u201d Revelation 15:16.

This world is going to grow so much more in darkness and confusion and Christ\u0027s Watchman Ministry wants to shine the light and hope of Jesus, the truth of God, and the understanding of the Holy Spirit. So your financial support will go toward the following in hopes that this media channel grows and reaches many more people the Holy Spirit gathers to this service. You will never hear this ministry ask for a $63 million dollar donation for a private jet like some pastors, or tithes and offerings in exchanges for blessing from God because you \"planted a seed\", or donations for a down payment on a mansion-nope. Not here. I pray to maintain a heart to increase Jesus, that I may decrease and your support will to the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchase of better video equipment\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchase of better sound equipment\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchase of better lighting equipment\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchase of photo stocks\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchase of green-screen digital footage\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSocial media marketing campaigns\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTravel expenses for live presenations\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInvestments for Christ\u0027s Watchman Ministry exposure: shirts, hats, apparel, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOperational and maintenance expenses\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLegal expenses\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\"\u003cem\u003e27 But Jesus looked at them and said, \u201cWith men it is impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible.\u003c/em\u003e\u201d Mark 10:27\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy family and I thank you for supporting what I love to do for our Lord Jesus Christ, in service to you!\u003cbr\u003e-West \"Watchman\" Brooks\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCLICK THIS TO WATCH A VIDEO\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/zX6Lb2w3TkY?t=325\"\u003eA Little About Me And How I Got Here\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
