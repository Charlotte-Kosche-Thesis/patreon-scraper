    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tHello! My name is Kelly Turnbull but the internet calls me Coelasquid (sometimes. When they\u0027re not calling me Kelly Turnbull) I am the writer and artist behind the webcomic\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thepunchlineismachismo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eManly Guys Doing Manly Things\u003c/a\u003e and my new soon-to-launch project, Platinum Black, which is slated to be up and running in May.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen not in the webcomic mines, I make a living as a full time animator with projects for\u00a0\n\t\u003ca href=\"http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/ugly-americans\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eComedy Central\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.mtv.com/shows/good_vibes/series.jhtml\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMTV\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwbFQd7vvGo\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSony\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.cosmosontv.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFox\u003c/a\u003e, and others under my belt. I love what I do and I\u0027m proud of everything I\u0027ve accomplished in my professional career, but the life of an animator is typically one of late nights and frequent crunch time which means there isn\u0027t typically a whole lot of time left for other creative endavours. But I love making comics and sharing them with people, no matter how stressful and demanding my professional life gets I\u0027ve always managed to make sure my comic gets some kind of new content once a week. The world of professional animation is one of design by committee, and webcomics gives me a creative outlet that I have complete control over. Plus in a tumultuous art-related industry, webcomics are my unemployment insurance so I have a plan B if other work becomes scarce.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\tOkay that\u0027s great but where do we come in?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tPlatinum Black is a story I have been wanting to tell for years. It\u0027s going to be a long-running narrative, much more serious in tone than MGDMT (though not without a sense of humour), and without the same kind of pop culture satire Manly Guys readers are used to. It\u0027s a modern fantasy story with elements of horror and science fiction, following the journey of a regenerating day labourer and a timid prize fighter through a world of talking monsters, organ thieves, and ghosts. It\u0027s a very sincere project for me, and I want to make it the most polished, professional product I possibly can.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tUnfortunately I just don\u0027t have the hours in the day to create Platinum Black to the standard I\u0027ve set for it on my own AND continue making MGDMT simultaneously, but\u00a0I am so honoured and humbled by how well received MGDMT has been and how much it means to the people who continue to read it after all these years that I don\u0027t just want to leave it dead in the water. So to strike a compromise, I\u0027ve decided to hire a colourist for Platinum Black, the amazingly talented\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://emilykcomicsmith.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEmily Smith\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/533c853ed78f01cf9dbea9f38025bd1c/tumblr_n0z7moT6Fv1qjm6tmo1_1280.png\" style=\"width: 662px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027m paying for Platinum Black out of pocket, and largely relying on MGDMT ad revenue to make it happen. Handing off the colouring to someone else means I can produce pages exponentially faster than I would if I was doing it all on my own and using MGDMT ad revenue to support it means I have incentive to keep both comics updating on schedule. The only downside is that it really is going to cost me a substantial amount to produce this comic. MGDMT income has always been my emergency savings fund/unemployment insurance, so committing it to an ongoing expense like this is going out on a limb a little for me. But I\u0027m excited to finally have this comic in motion and I\u0027m glad that in making it I\u0027m also able to support another amazing artist in the process, so it\u0027s a risk I\u0027m willing to take.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo wait do I have to pay to read this new comic or...?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tOh no! Not at all!\u00a0\u00a0MGDMT will always be completely free for anyone to read and as soon as Platinum Black joins the roster it will be too. I make comics for the love of sharing stories and entertaining people and any money I can make on top of that is just a much appreciated bonus. This is just an elective tip jar I\u0027m putting out there for anyone who might want help me make this story a reality, and I cannot even begin to express how incredibly grateful I am to anyone who feels like chipping in to the cause. If not, no worries at all, I appreciate everyone who supports my comics just by enjoying them and spreading them along to other readers who might enjoy them as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
