Aside from Post, I am also working on a zine (yay!) and pay the rent with commissions and freelance illustration work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work is magical, whimsical and playful.

Etsy has gotten my followers really used to seeking out artist-made reprints of work, which is costly to produce, package, ship and sustain. As my Patron, your investment goes into funding my current project as well as my growth; be that in studio costs (art supplies), production (making new goods like stickers or prints), and artistic innovations (learning new things!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be posting my small-format paintings from Post, the drafts and the finished monthly series, as well as other projects that pass through my studio space. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so apprectaive of the support of my Patrons to help me continue to draw, paint, and tell stories.
