    "summary": "Hello anonymous internet void. Its strange and familiar screaming into you. If you know about me, which you maybe don\u0027t, I\u0027ve been posting daily comics and illustrations for about two years over on my Instagram \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chainsawcathy\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/chainsawcathy\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an autobiographical comics artist and self publisher with distribution from Radiator comics ( \u003ca href=\"http://www.radiatorcomics.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.radiatorcomics.com\u003c/a\u003e ). My first self published book, \"Winter Beard\" was made with a grant from the Xeric Foundation. Since then I\u0027ve created several other comic books about my life, art, boys, naps, mental illness, eating disorders, and my cats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a new comics project that I\u0027d like to do in 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve already self published two three-month journal comics diaries \"Springtime in Chicago\" and Chicago in Fall.\" These books have daily 4 panel comic strips, one panel of which I share for free out of context on my Instagram, usually about the most significant event of my day. For 2017 I\u0027d like to do a similar project\u2026. but also a bit different!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to self publish a physical mini comic each month with a one panel comic for each day. I suffer from Depression and part of my therapy is challenging my ways of thinking and something I\u0027ve been thinking about is drawing the best or happiest moment of my day or practicing gratitude and mindfulness. I think incorporating this technique with my daily comics practice will be beneficial to my mental health. My comics tend to be very sad bastard so I\u0027m excited to try something new\u2026 ish :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo anyway, the actual comics will be the cool fold out mini kind. The comic will open up to a full page illustration representative of the month on the verso. That way people can read the comics panels or pin it on the wall as an illustration as I like to do both! Its fun for me to work in both styles. I\u0027ve already been sharing my comics but I\u0027d love to try to connect with people who like to read my comics and also enjoy my illustrative style. I\u0027ve been thinking of a project suitable to start up a Patreon with and this is perfect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $5 or more a month you will receive a printed fold out mini comic of each month\u0027s daily comic panel, starting with the month you sign up. I\u0027m doing this DIY style so each comic will be crafted by my own pink, little hands. Comics will be post-produced and sent out to Patreons as soon as I am able to finish the cover illustration and stuff envelopes and get stamps!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like to look at my comics but maybe aren\u0027t into having a book or prefer to go paper free you can tip me digitally for $1 or more a month. I will publish daily, unedited panels, and then a high resolution, printable cover illustration at the end of the project. This is basically the pay-what-you-can tip jar as I plan to continue to post daily panels for free on my Instagram.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
