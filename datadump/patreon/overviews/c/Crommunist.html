    "summary": "I\u0027m a singer-songwriter from Vancouver, Canada. I draw from a wide variety of influences (from Barenaked Ladies to John Mayer to The Roots) to create music, using my guitar, my viola, and my voice. I live to create music, and am working every week to add new content. Support from patrons will mean that I can afford better recording equipment, studio time, and professional production. As a patron, you\u0027ll get first access to created music, exclusive content that won\u0027t be available elsewhere, and behind-the-scenes looks at what I\u0027m doing thanks to your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s how it works: I produce music in my home studio. You pledge what you\u0027d like, and pay only when I release a new song. The money you pledge goes toward sending me to a professional studio to record an EP with session musicians. Patrons get extra rewards based on the amount of their pledge. It\u0027s that easy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a sample of my work, see the above video, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/crommunist\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echeck out my SoundCloud page\u003c/a\u003e!"

     "about": "Born in Vancouver and raised all across Canada, Ian Cromwell has one true home: the stage. A classical violist by training, Ian has spent more than 20 years performing with classical ensembles, symphonies, quartets, and as a solo performer. Ian\u2019s love of the stage put a guitar in his hands some years later, and he hasn\u2019t looked back since. A 4-year veteran of the Vancouver music scene, Ian has rocked houses in Vancouver both as a solo artist and alongside Jack Mercer and the Whiskey Bandits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIan\u2019s love and deep passion for music transcends the cerebral classical genre and takes root in the full-throated, no-holds-barred, primal scream of rock and alternative music, tempered by an affinity for upbeat and memorable pop hooks. Blended together with his signature powerful vocals, Ian\u2019s musical range is sure to please anyone who describes their musical taste as \u2018eclectic\u2019.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what do you get when you put together Ian\u2019s love for the raw power of rock, the magestic sweep of classical, the technical wizardry of hip-hop, and the virtuoso improvisation of jazz? Well, you get a live musical experience that truly must be seen to be believed. Ian uses effects, loops, percussive hits, and of course his unparalleled vocals to craft soundscapes in front of an audience that is always left wanting more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCombine all this with Ian\u2019s trademark energy and enthusiasm for performance, and you end up with a truly unforgettable show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
