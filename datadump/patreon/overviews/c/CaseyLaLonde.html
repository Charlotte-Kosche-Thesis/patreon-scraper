    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Casey LaLonde. I want to make your ears happy. I have a bandcamp page\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://caseylalonde.bandcamp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e with all of my work so far on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making music since I was a teenager, recording my $5 acoustic guitar into a $2 tape recorder and being fascinated with the sounds it made when I put a big magnet next to it. Ten years down the road and I\u0027ve bought a slightly more expensive guitar, stopped putting magnets next to things that they definitely shouldn\u0027t be next to (as often), have released four albums and a few EP\u0027s and am still just only beginning to explore the world of sound. I\u0027ve also come to a point in my life where I \u003cem\u003eneed\u003c/em\u003e to - finally - take an earnest shot at trying to make music, like, literally all of the time until my heart eventually stops.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether, I think we can make that dream a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027d make music anyway, so why Patreon now?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027d continue to try to, for sure, but it\u0027s only getting harder with time. I\u0027ve been lucky to balance work and art like I have so far, but the gig that pays the bills ends up needing more of my time, my energy, my enthusiasm. I\u0027ve turned down every offer to play live shows because of work and school, and those invitations don\u0027t come forever. If I don\u0027t take a shot at getting away from the soul-suck of the day job now, the odds are good that I never will. This is my attempt at steering the S.S. LaLonde towards those calmer seas. Whatever you pledge, it gets you a hand on the rudder and a soft, encouraging smile from a grizzled sea-stag who will make good use of your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou like deer.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA bit. Let\u0027s move on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is it you\u0027re actually offering?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn all sincerity, I want to make music that touches people\u0027s hearts, tickles people\u0027s brains and brings people together. I want to give you that \u003cem\u003ealong with\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0letting you into my personal head space and showing you interesting pieces of the process of making the work. I want to have you smile, laugh, sometimes cry a little while I do. Ultimately I\u0027m offering to keep making music that I hope that you\u0027ll love and, in return, what I ask for is the support to have this be what I do every day, from sun up to sun down, until the day I breathe my last.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWoah, easy.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, I\u0027m offering some neat stuff over in the rewards list too. Could give that a look and see if that does it for you. Those will evolve over time as I\u0027m able to afford to add more stuff. Maybe things like writing songs specifically for those pledging to a specific tier, getting shout-outs in a music video or album sleeve - who knows. This is gonna be an experimental, ongoing net-gain for everyone though, surely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless, every little bit helps, and I want to thank you for considering becoming a patron. I\u0027ll work to make the very best of this both for you and for myself, and I hope to see you on the other end of the finish line towards the big goal. Thank you so, so much.\u003cbr\u003e"
