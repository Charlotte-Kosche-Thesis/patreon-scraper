    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for visiting the Crosshead Studios Patreon page. Every month I will be creating general assets, like tokens, maps and characters, for your fantasy role-playing games! All of these assets will both be designed for high quality print and for digital use on platforms like Roll20.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the assets have also been designed for use with my homebrew-friendly Campaign Setting, called \"FourRealm: the Place of Things\", which I will be launching on Kickstarter. \u003cem\u003eAll of the content you pay for on the Patreon is unique and will not be included in the print of the final game.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.redd.it/si1yx1gqa2p01.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals \u0026amp; Rewards\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt the moment everything I create and all the time spend doing so has come completely out of my own pocket. I had saved enough to be able to create content full time for a full year, but in order to keep going I need your support. I will start out small with a focus on hosting my content and spreading word about my work. Slowly but surely I hope to be able to focus on creating quality content full time!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my rewards can be used in all of your favorite fantasy role-playing games, only certain details of my artwork will be focused on specific game systems. The character art, for example, comes with specific stats that can be used in 5E games. Depending on the requests I am open to create stats for other systems as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePackages\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEach month you will receive a downloadable package of all the assets created with your support. For all previous packages you need to have been a patron for at least one month, from then on you will be sent two packages including the new and one \"old\" set of assets from months before you joined. You can also ask for a specific month or package if you would like to receive that one first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will reward patrons, who stick with me, with other unique content. Like a character booklet of all characters created thus far (a pdf booklet). Other rewards might include printed items:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrint\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf things really kick off, I might print some of my rewards like the character cards. Just like in my Kickstarter Campaign for FourRealm, I would like to print them as a Deck of Playing Cards. This will include 56 unique cards featuring pop-culture characters to use as NPC\u0027s, all ranked by CR. It will also include a booklet for all the stats of each individual card.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I do get to the point of printing the deck of cards, all patrons, who have stuck with me for at least 3 months, will get a discount according to how long they have been my patron. As a Lord you will also get a chance to pick what characters will be featured in the deck!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFree\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be sharing some of my maps, tokens and characters for free. All of these assets are posted in my aptly named dropbox folder located\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/v4vw6ow8pwic1ct/AAC93uvrZ7BPDsTZA7eQvoTKa?dl=0\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFeel free to contact me at:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:crossheadstudios@gmail.com\"\u003ecrossheadstudios@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eYou can also find more information about my campaign setting and possible future projects at:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.crossheadstudios.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.crossheadstudios.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
