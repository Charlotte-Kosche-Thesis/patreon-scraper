These are pieces that give me the opportunity to work with or champion other talents. As a writer/director, I get to collaborate with actors, cinematographers, and composers, but my pieces tend to go further, exploring musicians, artists, dancers, athletes... In the above, we profiled a renowned violinist, getting inside\u00a0her unique mind... but my hope is to continue with all sorts of videos, so long as they\u0027re devoted to storytelling (or at least have a musical shape) and explore concepts and emotions that have impact, that can inspire you, challenge you, affect you...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not a YouTube creator, and that\u0027s always been a concern in the back of my mind. It takes a long time to put up new projects, because I build them like individual films, specifically tailoring them to a unique objective, each with their own reason to be made. With a series or creator channel, the goal is to keep making more of the same, but my agenda differs per video, and therefore, it\u0027s difficult to get funding from niche sponsors. Each one is like starting from scratch. \u003cstrong\u003eAnd each takes well over a month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0All I know is some of you out there see these individual pieces and really dig them, and I would love to create more of them for you. I call for strong production levels, so each can cost upwards of $10k. Artists usually don\u0027t have the funds to pay me for them, and I don\u0027t have the funds to keep paying my collaborators, in addition to equipment, locations, travel, etc etc...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMore dope examples\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make a living in the commercial advertising world, but not a lot of that gets to be self-generated. I\u0027m hoping to focus my energy a bit less on that and more on creating things that are distinct and special. Here are some (they get good attention,\u00a0including Vimeo Staff Picks):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAn ode to swimming in 1 minute - \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/113571214\"\u003ehttps://vimeo.com/113571214\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ethe first NYC wifi orchestra -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/109672232\"\u003ehttps://vimeo.com/109672232\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eMy site, which has more stuff:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://chrisshimojima.com/\"\u003ehttp://chrisshimojima.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo...\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a dream... that these kinds of creative pieces will one day be easily funded, rather than having to run the bureaucratic gauntlet each time in the hopes of company sponsorship.
