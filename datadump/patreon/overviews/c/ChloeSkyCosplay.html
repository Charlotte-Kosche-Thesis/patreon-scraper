One very important thing: please do not feel obligated to pledge! Regardless if you are a Patron or not, I appreciate everyone\u0027s support, no matter if it comes in the form of donations, Patreon, internet shout out love, or even saying hi to me at conventions. I love meeting new people and make a point to talk to everyone.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have created my Patreon to help me financially so I can continue doing what I love! I sincerely hope that I\u0027ve provided enjoyment or inspiration through my work to others, and hope to continue to do so! With Patreon I am aiming to\u00a0create a support system where we can get to know each other personally. Cosplay is a very time consuming and expensive hobby and I want to supply you guys with the very best content. Ideally I\u0027d love to be able to bring you guys new costumes and photoshoots every month, and someday travel far and wide to cons so I can meet every single one of you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/YISrBp8.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Chloe Sky, I am an 18 year old Canadian cosplayer who has been at it for 3+ years now, I couldn\u0027t have continued cosplaying without all of you guys! I am a full time University student and balance my time between the two things that I am most passionate about: school and cosplay. I have been working very hard these past 3 years to make my dream a reality, to get better at cosplay and turn this hobby into a lifestyle. I am currently pursuing a degree in theatre, so I can one day have a career in costume design.\u00a0I have been pushing myself to work on much larger projects and\u00a0many more exciting plans that I am hoping to make possible through Patreon! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up I was always interested in makeup and modelling, I always felt that I was creative but had no medium to properly express myself. I grew up watching anime, reading, and playing video games; I kept to myself and for a long time thought that I was the only one out there with an interest in things like that. It wasn\u0027t until I attended my first convention that I was introduced to the amazing world of cosplay. I immediately felt like I was at home, I remember how overwhelmed I was by the amount of people that were there to celebrate their love for anime and video games, and I was very surprised by the beautiful costumes, it was inspiring to see people passionate enough about a character to dedicate so much time to bring that character to life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eCosplay has played an important role in shaping me into who I am today. I overcame a lot of personal struggles with cosplay, like my self esteem and my social anxiety. Before cosplay I could not talk to strangers, and since then I have been on podcasts, radio, and many interviews. With cosplay I have found confidence, my passion, and a voice, but the most precious gift I have been given, is all of the beautiful people I have befriended while on my cosplay journey! Lets be friends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0You guys have given me so much by supporting me through my cosplay journey, I\u0027d love to do anything I can to give back to you guys, which is why I decided to make a Patreon!
