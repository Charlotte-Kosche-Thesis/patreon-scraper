    "summary": "Hello, we are the \"Can\u0027t Speak!\" podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are three mates from the town of Wigan, England.  In early 2017 we had the genius idea of making and creating podcasts.  We all shared one major interest... Rugby League.  We grew up watching rugby of the 80s and 90s and can often be found, bleary eyed at 2 in the morning, watching old Challenge Cup Finals on YouTube. These blasts of nostalgia left us wondering where all our childhood heroes were now...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe decided we wanted track down and interview some of these childhood heroes and legends of the game. There isn\u0027t anything like this available on the internet, aside from Sky TV\u0027s men in shiny suits, mumbling through platitudes like they were at an awkward business meeting. There must be plenty of rugby league fans out there wondering what their favourite players thought of their time in the game, wanting to hear some of thier anecdotes from on and off the field, and hear them set the record straight on spurious rumours and public misconceptions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike we\u0027ve mentioned already, we love rugby and understand how lucky we are to be meeting these sporting greats (and I don\u0027t use the term lightly). However, making a podcast does come with some considerable financial burdens and it\u0027s difficult for three regular young men to shoulder the strain.  That\u0027s where we\u0027d love you, the loyal devotees of the Can\u0027t Speak Podcast, to give us a helping hand... with a bit of cash.  If you could take a PUNT on us, from as little as a quid, we could CONVERT that generosity into more cracking interviews with your sporting heroes. (See what I did with the the words then? Double meaning. Plenty more where that came from.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fman1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17264703_231595430645886_3927606853814918021_n.jpg?oh=9dfb3cef6bf567c9c65a58d762557283\u0026amp;oe=595B8181\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt work with the inimitable Andy Gregory.  Episode 1.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW YOU\u0027D HELP:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTIME:\u003c/strong\u003e You\u0027d be helping us to afford the time to give the players the respect they deserve. It takes many hours of research, writing, planning and production time to create the best quality of interview and podcast possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOSTING:\u003c/strong\u003e We host our main podcasts on the wonderful podbean service. This means the podcasts will be reliably be there when you want them and available on all of the major podcast apps that you use. But, it also costs us about \u00a3100 a year. Your donations would help us pay for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePRODUCTION:\u003c/strong\u003e We have our podcasts professionally recorded and edited by Tom at Splicing Block \u003ca href=\"http://splicingblock.com).\"\u003ehttp://splicingblock.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0He\u0027s got posh gear and the knowhow to get the podcast sounding great, but also costs us money. Your donation would stop us having to record the podcast on Gaff\u0027s boombox.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTRAVEL:\u003c/strong\u003e We might be pie-eaters but we try to cover as many different clubs as we can.  This can sometimes mean a six hour driving round trip to Hull on a wet and windy Tuesday or a lost day to public transport, lugging gear on buses and trains. Your donation would put a bit of petrol in our tanks and get us to where we need to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGUESTS:\u003c/strong\u003e We aim to get the best and biggest guests we can. Those who have played at the highest level of Rugby League and who have made their name in England and Australia. For them, this means taking time out of their already busy schedules to meet some fans that they don\u0027t know from Joe Bloggs.  We want to either pay for their time or donate to a charity of their choice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you enjoy listening to it as much as we enjoy making it, and can find a few quid to help us keep creating and releasing these unique podcasts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe understand some people truly can\u0027t afford to give, if you can\u0027t then please like and share our page and pass us on to all your Rugby League loving friends!"
