I started Cardboard Clash at the tail end of 2016 because I continuously ran into a problem when researching board game purchases: there were too few reviews covering the experience with two players. Most of my own gaming is done with my wife, and so that player count was important for me, and I was certain there were other couples out there who were encountering similar problems. So I got to work and started reviewing board games from my collection.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to being a reviewer and avid player of board games, I am beginning to dabble in the design process for board games and am a published author of Fantasy books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to 2018 and I am approaching my 50th review on the site. I have explored writing strategy articles centered around certain games, an avenue I really would like to continue pursuing. I\u0027ve considered trying to film playthroughs of games in a style similar to Rahdo. I would like to attend, and provide coverage for, my first\u00a0board game conventions.\u00a0I have dreams and ambitions for creating content, and you can join me on this exciting journey and gain access to Patron-exclusive content and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will my contribution go toward?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHere are a few of the things I plan to implement as soon as I am capable:\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 *\u00a0 Professionally-created logo for Cardboard Clash\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 *\u00a0 Improved website layout and a custom domain.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 *\u00a0 Shipping costs for giveaways, including patron-exclusive opportunities\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 *\u00a0 Occasional purchase of the latest \"hotness\" games and expansions, as voted on by patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 *\u00a0 Equipment for making video content (editing software, video camera, microphones, lighting, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e"
