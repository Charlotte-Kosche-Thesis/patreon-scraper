The program emphasizes giving space and time to artists from historically marginalized demographics. It takes place in Cart Pusher Studios in the Millworks Studios building, which also houses the studios of residency facilitator Ken Nurenberg. Resident artists are given over 400 square feet of studio space, access to all of the studio tools, computers and creative software, and have the option of putting Ken to work as their studio assistant during their session.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho We Are:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMisty Alvaro is the residency\u0027s organizational mastermind and works as a public librarian with an MLIS from Kent State University.

The project asks the question, \u201cCan facilitating the work of other artists be an artwork and form of making in itself?\u201d I believe the answer is yes. The film industry, with its workforces of all range of artists coming together to produce one product, is a crude example of what I mean, but this project is nothing so industrial. It is about artists empathizing with one another and thinking bilaterally and collectively about how to support one another\u2019s individual missions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I\u2019d like to present why the residency emphasizes giving opportunities to artists who are not straight, white, cis-gender males. This comes from a belief that art spaces and institutions of all sort need to consider how to be representative of the population of artists in art audiences in their communities and in the world. Equity in representation and access to resources are vital in fostering a dynamic and rigorous creative community. There are always two artists in Cart Pushers Studios at one time, a resident artist and myself. So the math of that is that there is really only room for a maximum of one white guy working in the spaces at a time, and, well, I\u2019m currently keeping that spot to myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
