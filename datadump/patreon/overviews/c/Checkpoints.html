Click the banner above you to listen to the show, \u00a0here\u0027s the pitch: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eThis is a show about video games, the people who play them, and the people who make them. Each episode a guest on the show talks about the games that have shaped their life in one way or another; games that have inspired them, games that have forged connections and games that have soothed wounds. Checkpoints\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\nI created the show because nothing like it existed and it was something I wanted to listen to and it\u0027s been a real thrill to discover how many other people are enjoying it too.  I\u0027m delighted with how the show has progressed, and the community of listeners I\u0027ve been able to build.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been incredibly lucky to speak to a\u00a0wonderful selection of guests, including some of the finest game developers working today like Adam Saltsman, Brendon Chung and Sean Vanaman - true videogame pioneers like Mel Croucher and Chris Crawford - wonderful writers like Cara Ellison, Meg Jayanth, Ellie Gibson and Simon Parkin and people from outside of games altogether, like Iain Cook from the band Chvrches, the novelist Christopher Brookmyre, comedian John Robertson and one of the creators and hosts of Go 8 Bit, Steve McNeil. \u00a0With your help, I want to make the show even better.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDonations will largely go towards hosting costs and equipment maintenance, but they will also help with travel costs for live events - I hosted a special live episode of Checkpoints at the Game City Festival in Nottingham last year - and would enable me to work on ever more ambitious AUTOSAVE episodes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
