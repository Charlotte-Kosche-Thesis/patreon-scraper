    "summary": "Greetings and Salutations!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor nearly a year, Colin\u2019s Last Stand has endeavored to entertain, inform, and educate, and has developed a loyal audience of viewers, listeners, and fans who don\u2019t just love one thing only. Indeed, CLS wears its Renaissance Man ethos on its sleeve. After all, there\u2019s something interesting to see, hear about, or experience nearly everywhere you look. So why not celebrate those loves, bound together as one community?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eColin\u2019s Last Stand\u2019s four shows so far -- three active and one on hiatus -- prove that varied interests can be shared under one digital roof. The original CLS is dedicated to all things history and politics. The podcast series Fireside Chats revolves around interviews with interesting people from all walks of life. Side Quest dives deep into the video games (and video game industry) we love. And the newest CLS show -- KnockBack -- is all about the nerdy subculture that permeates our lives, whether it be with movies and TV shows, comic books and toys, or video games and books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting Colin\u2019s Last Stand on Patreon, you\u2019re quite simply keeping the CLS Dream alive. No matter what level you choose to support the show at, your hard-earned cash keeps this independent venture alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you enjoy Fireside Chats, Side Quest, or KnockBack -- or all three -- I hope that you\u2019ll choose to join me here on Patreon, and that you\u2019ll help keep CLS fueled and stocked well into the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration, your support, your kindness, and your generosity. I\u2019m doing my very best every day to deliver content worthy of your time and attention, and I hope that it shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Friend, -Colin\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/g52RzVi.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.) What is Colin\u2019s Last Stand?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eColin\u2019s Last Stand (or CLS for short) is a brand created by me, Colin Moriarty. Before founding CLS in the Spring of 2017, I worked in the video game industry for more than 14 years, working my way up from freelancer to Senior Editor of the world\u2019s biggest gaming website (IGN) before co-founding a YouTube company (Kinda Funny).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginally, CLS was founded as one show, a show focused on history and politics. But that\u2019s expanded since launch. In late Summer of 2017, CLS expanded to two shows: The original CLS, and a podcast series called Fireside Chats. In the Fall of 2017, CLS expanded again, this time to three shows: The original CLS, Fireside Chats, and a new video series focused on video games called Side Quest. Now, CLS is technically four shows, although one (CLS Prime) is on hiatus. Fireside Chats, Side Quest, and KnockBack are the three shows currently in rotation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2.) What\u2019s the release schedule for content?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood question! Here\u2019s what a typical week of CLS content looks like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMonday: New episode of CLS: Side Quest on YouTube*\u003cbr\u003eTuesday: New episode of CLS: Fireside Chats on Patreon**\u003cbr\u003eWednesday: New episode of CLS: KnockBack on Podcast Services***\u003cbr\u003eThursday: New episode of CLS: KnockBack on Patreon**\u003cbr\u003eFriday: New episode of CLS: Fireside Chats on Podcast Services***\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* - $5+/month subs on Patreon get access to the audio-only version of these shows.\u003cbr\u003e** - Early access is granted to $5+/month subs.\u003cbr\u003e*** - These releases are available to all, free of charge, regardless of subscription status.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3.) Why should I support CLS on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, let me first say that you absolutely don\u2019t have to. If you don\u2019t have the money, or aren\u2019t inclined to, or want to wait and decide later, that\u2019s totally fine. Your money is your money, and you work hard for it. I don\u2019t want to hold a gun barrel to your head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if you like any of the CLS shows (and especially if you like two or all three of them), I hope that you will jump into CLS\u2019 Patreon at a financial level that makes the most sense for you. The fact is, without Patreon, nothing CLS-related would exist. CLS\u2019 funding pretty much entirely revolves around Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u2019d say you should support CLS on Patreon if you like the content and want to see it exist for a long time to come. You also get perks for jumping into Patreon, which I\u2019ll describe in the question below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.) What do I get for supporting CLS on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease see the Tier Selection to your right for more information at what you get at each of the eight applicable support tiers. Please choose the one that\u2019s right for you! Any level of support is deeply and sincerely appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
