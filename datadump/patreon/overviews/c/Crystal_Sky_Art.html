My primary Patreon campaign is on hold for a while.\u003c/strong\u003e During this time I will finish getting my Bachelors degree, allow my hand to heal from the injury in January, work on commissions, and work on an online digital art school program. My goal is to be able to provide even better art for all of you while improving my skills as an artist. Once everything is completed I will resume my regular Patreon campaign with even better quality art than before!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn the meantime I will still have Patreon running with a $2/month tier.\u003c/strong\u003e This tier will include all the high res scans of all my Tuesday Doodles and any other art that I complete included as a downloadable file attached to a patron only post after completion. My goal is to have each scan of a Tuesday Doodle stream uploaded Tuesday nights after they are completed. This will also include all digital art that I work on as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for taking the time to look at my page!\u003c/strong\u003e Your support would be greatly appreciated in helping me reach my goal of becoming a full-time self-employed artist as I have health problems that make most things difficult for me. I focus on painting and illustrations while regularly working on challenges designed for me to learn new techniques, maintain regular practice of art, and to involve my followers in my process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEven if you are unable to pledge you are welcome to follow and share my feed! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for taking the time to look at my page! :)\u003c/strong\u003e"
