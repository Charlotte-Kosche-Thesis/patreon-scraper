    "summary": "ChristCenteredGamer.com looks at video games from two view points. We analyze games on a secular level which will break down a game based on its graphics, sound, stability and overall gaming experience. This aspect attracts visitors of all religions to the site to see how fun a game is and if it\u2019s worth buying. If you\u2019re concerned about the family friendliness of a game, we have a separate moral score which looks at violence, language, sexual content, occult references and other ethical issues. We point out all the questionable content we see so that Christians and parents can make an educated buying decision. Our reviews also feature a highlights box where you can quickly find the strengths, weaknesses and moral concerns of a game without having to read all of the text. No matter what religious beliefs a person has, they can count on our integrity in our reviews. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been around since 1999 and are no strangers to the gaming industry. \u00a0We\u0027re on good terms with several publishers and often get sent games to review. \u00a0The trouble is that we\u0027re a volunteer run site and we can get reviews out faster if we had dedicated staff to review these games and other popular titles in a timely fashion. \u00a0That\u0027s our biggest problem. \u00a0I\u0027d like to have income I can rely on to meet some basic needs and hire trustworthy writers and editors. \u00a0Will you help us?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChrist Centered Gamer is a 501 C 3 Tax Exempt Non-Profit Organization.
