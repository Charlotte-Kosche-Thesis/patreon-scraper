    "summary": "Chinjufu Channel was started on 18 March 2015 by two Kantai Collection players, Kitsuoka and ExudingFate to deliver full translations of developer tweets so that amidst all confusion of different interpretations, members of the community could look to one reliable source and read for themselves. It was a movement that sparked the change from short summaries which could be prone to misinterpretation, to full translations which allowed readers to think for themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis movement was successful; after a year, Chinjufu Channel has become a trusted source of early event intelligence, a page collecting great fanarts and one that reports information on merchandise and events related to Kantai Collection. On 21 June 2016, Chinjufu Channel reached its 10K likes milestone. However, with the retirement of ExudingFate, the main translator, and the growing community, it has become apparent that Chinjufu Channel should take a step forward and join Patreon to provide better services.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon pledges, Chinjufu Channel will be able to provide a lot more. These are, but not limited to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eManga translations, by which capital is needed to obtain and scan raw copies\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBook translations, by which capital is needed to obtain a copy of the official books\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMagazine sharing/review, by which capital is needed to purchase relevant magazines that have developer hints such as Comptiq\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRegular DMM point giveaways, by which capital is needed to maintain\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eImproved web services such as a website, wiki or forum, by which capital is needed to pay a web host, domain and other software\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
