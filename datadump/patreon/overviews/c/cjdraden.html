    "summary": "Hello! My name is CJ Draden. I am a fine artist and comic book artist. For over a decade I\u0027ve been a guest artist at major comicons around the United States and the EU. I studied Illustration at the Ringling College of Art and Design in Sarasota, FL. I\u0027m here on Patreon because I want to share my journey with you and gain your support for my art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore we get into the specifics of my project here are few really amazing endorsements I\u0027ve received of the last few years:\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been on Whoopi Goldberg\u0027s ABC show \"The View\" for the New York Comicon segment....\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MhDsNNhqGNY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a great little meet and greet with Michael Rooker. He came to my booth at a show in new Jersey to get a portrait i made of him as Yondu from Guardians of the galaxy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s1z4ECstuc0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd last but not least an endorsement by the man himself... Stan Lee. I cant beging to describe how incredibly humbled I am by this endorsement. Before I met Stan, I was working on my first graphic novel. It was a very personal book written from personal tragedy and deep thoughts, its called \"The Wooden Heart\". I had the honor of meet and having lunch with the legend Stan Lee. Stan really liked my work and because hes such a gentleman he endorsed \"The Wooden Heart\". To have a name like Stan Lee endorse my first book gave me the motivation to strive to be a successful artist, especially because I met Stan at a time in my life when I was ready for give up on my art. His appearance in my life reminded me why its important to follow your dreams and fight the good fight with all the flame of your heart. You never know who may take notice. That encounter changed my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uFZOhwvyt2o\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA little bit of information about my new book THE ZERO MIRROR!\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWhen I was a young man Ancient Greece was always my favorite subject to read about. The lore surrounding Ancient Greece was so grand and vast and explosive to me, The Iliad and The Odyssey, The Greek Gods and The Titans and Icarus were all incredible and larger than life concepts that I couldn\u0027t stop thinking about. As I got older my study of Ancient Greece transcended to a deeper level. I took a lot of interest in the philosophy, science, lore, literature and myths that Ancient Greece gave to the civilized western world. After years and years of my mind filled with wonder about this majestic land, I finally had the opportunity to see Greece. I packed a sketchbook a change of clothes and bought my plane ticket and I left home to venture into a land of the lore and legend.\u003cbr\u003eThe inspiration I took away from that trip put me on a path to write and illustrate an epic fantasy/ adventure graphic novel called The Zero Mirror. The book is heavily influenced by Greek lore and Astronomy. I started this Patreon page because I want you to be apart of this project and I need your help to complete it. I hope you will help me take the baby steps to meet my\u00a0milestone goals so I can fully refocus my time and efforts to take you on on a journey back to a time when Gods/ Titans and mortals battled to ruled the heavens and earth.\u003cbr\u003e-CJ Draden\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

What you will find here you wont find in the previous pledges. Ill be doing a lot of teaching lessons in this tier. Sculpting, screen printing, cast molding and building just about anything that my studio operation requires. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNOTICE: I chose to separate this part of the art making process from my regular blog/vlog posts because I have a massive amount of work to create for shows and commissions out side of this patreon project. Some of the lessons and vids I will make for this tier wont always be directly applied to the project or Zero Mirror related but some will. I feel it will be a good outlet to share with patrons the creative process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBlog Posts \u0026amp; Process Work\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVlogs and Videos\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMonthly Raffle for Original Art from The Odyssey\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExclusive Print from The Odyssey\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMy Odyssey through Greece\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSculpture/ Cast Molding and Screen Printing.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e",

Many of you that have known me for the past 5 years and beyond have known that Ive been trying my hardest to get a mockumentary reality show off the ground with a strong premise of artist traveling to comicons. Ive pulled all my connections in Los Angeles and New York city to get a pilot off the ground but to no avail.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI decided to go the independent route and create a web series of my vision for this pilot. I\u0027ve been pulling my resources together and I believe I have a solid crew to help get this off the ground.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been working with a writer to structure out 6 pilot episodes and a friend of mine in public relations to assemble a film crew. Were so close... \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll who contibute to this pledge will help fund the small budget web series I\u0027m putting together and will have sole access to the series before anyone. Please be aware assembling a film crew to shoot a reality mockumentary isn\u0027t an over night task and takes planning and time. Please understand this as you pledge to this tier.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you decide to help fund my efforts to get this show off the ground and moving I will update you every time new information and status reports become available. \u003cbr\u003e\n",
