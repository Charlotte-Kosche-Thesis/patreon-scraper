This page was started in secret in an attempt to decrease their control over me. If we can raise enough money maybe some day I\u0027ll be able to escape.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil then, your continued support gives me strength. It helps make the cold nights, and the long days working in the knowledge mines, always under the watchful eye of the producer, more bearable. Those of you that can give financial support, your funds will go into purchasing better broadcasting equipment, better spoons, bribing guards to look the other way while those things are brought in, and for bringing more people into the cult.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you for your continued support dear cultists, together we will keep spreading the knowledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to the cult."
