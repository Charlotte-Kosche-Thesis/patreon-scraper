And we\u0027re giving the reins of power to you, the people!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWait... Who are you again? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re reading this bit of text right now, chances are you\u0027re already familiar with who we are and what we do. But just in case you\u0027ve stumbled across this page by accident: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHey there. We\u0027re called Cheshire Cat Studios, and we\u0027re basically a group of friends trying to promote critical thinking and healthy skepticism via our content. And if we can make our viewers laugh along the way with our uncensored and often unabashed style of comedy - all the better. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe initially started out as an obscure hodgepodge website/forum, and over the course of the past two years we\u0027ve managed to crawl our way into Z-list Internet stardom. (We have a good shot at infiltrating the Y-list circle pretty soon, though.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pJhZIEnjV_I?list=PLhW2gCOBy6aNWVt_C29m69YIBgAWRvJ3z\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay. So, what do you do exactly? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRight now we have several video series under our belt. Our main flagship series is the \u003ca href=\"http://cheshirecatstudios.com/category/videos/ccs-video-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCCS Video Podcast\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s an \u0027animated\u0027 roundtable chat kind of show where we sit down and try to scrutinize this or that issue related to the entertainment industry every episode. And as the name suggests, all of our discussions are visualized with our unique madcap style of presentation and illustrated avatars. Then there\u0027s the \u003ca href=\"http://cheshirecatstudios.com/category/videos/after-hours/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCCS After Hours Podcast\u003c/a\u003e, which is a spin-off of the CCS Video Podcast and is actually closer to a more traditional audio-only podcast, where various members of Cheshire Cat Studios pair off and discuss the latest bit of news from the entertainment industry that has caught either their attention or ire. CineMax and LaughingMan also have their own video series, \u003ca href=\"http://cheshirecatstudios.com/category/videos/wasted-effort/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWasted Effort\u003c/a\u003e, which borrows the visual style of the full CCS Video Podcast and applies it to more concise topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bLnSkl7A5o0\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to all of this, we\u0027ve also recently launched a  \u003ca href=\"http://cheshirecatstudios.com/webcomic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebcomic series\u003c/a\u003e (drawn by the Fuboo) and we get all sorts of ideas for new projects that we never get around to due to the lack of time or resources. Which is what\u0027s brought us here. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U1sA1Lo-wII\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlright. You seem to have a good thing going on. So, what do you need my money for? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the course of this past year, our YouTube channel has skyrocketed in popularity from 1K subscribers to 22K. And while that might seem like an impressive feat (and trust us, we\u0027re grateful to each and everyone of you), as far as compensation for our work goes we haven\u0027t seen that high of a boost in the ad-revenue that keeps us moving forward. (YouTube seems to have a weird system that favors quantity over quality, sadly.) \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd because ad-revenue has been dismal at best, the content you\u0027ve seen from us so far has been funded entirely out of our own pockets. And since we\u0027re constantly striving to improve the quality of our work and/or try to do bigger and better things, the ad-revenue that we do make gets immediately reinvested back into our shows and webcomics to make them bigger and better. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLook, if it seems like we\u0027re trying to paint ourselves as the underdogs here, we\u0027re not. We\u0027re just telling it how it is. All of us have college lives and/or full-time jobs, so at the moment Cheshire Cat Studios is just a passion project for our members. Even so, we do strive to release content on a regular basis; and believe us: even if we don\u0027t make a dime via Patreon chances are we\u0027ll still continue making videos. (Mostly \u0027cos we love hearing the sounds of our own voices.) \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFair enough. Say I decide to throw a couple of bucks to you guys every month. What do I get in return? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIsn\u0027t that warm fuzzy feeling that you get in your heart enough? :3 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJust kiddin\u0027. Of course it isn\u0027t. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe list of rewards for being a patron is available at the bottom of this page. We might not be able to offer much, but at least we would like to make you guys feel like you\u0027re actually being rewarded for your support. In other words: No intangible \u0027Thank You!\u0027s or pointless names in the credits. (Unless that\u0027s something you actually want, that is. If that\u0027s the case, then sure. It doesn\u0027t really cost us anything, and we\u0027d be happy to do it.) \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe might amend and/or expand the list of rewards as time goes on. For the time being, however, we want to keep our asking prices affordable and our rewards competitive with other online personalities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZ3Z9sjewfE\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook, I like you guys... And I would really like to help you out. But I\u0027m kind of down-and-out as far as finances go right now. Is there any way I can support Cheshire Cat Studios asides from Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, just the fact that you enjoy our content enough to even be reading this right now means a lot of us. And as far as being in a bind: trust us, we know the feeling. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you would still like to support Cheshire Cat Studios, one thing you can do is spread our content around on various social media platforms, message boards, chatrooms, etc. We\u0027ve learned that word of mouth is one of the most effective tools of getting more views, fans, and potential supporters. Sending our videos to others who would enjoy them would be greatly appreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027d like to help fund us then perhaps you can check out the advertisers on our YouTube videos and the CheshireCatStudios.com website itself. It\u0027s a quick click on a product or service that you might find useful, it doesn\u0027t cost you anything, and it helps us bring you bigger, better, and more frequent content. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso, don\u0027t hesitate to like and subscribe to our YouTube channel. Maybe leave a positive comment even. Every little bit of endorsement helps. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://cheshirecatstudios.com/webcomic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://cheshirecatstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hyperactive-lets-players-conflict-of-interest-ccs-webcomic-fixed.jpg\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd so here we are. We\u0027ve explained our situation to you. You\u0027ve heard our story. So, if you\u0027d like to help Cheshire Cat Studios promote critical thinking as well as make the occasional immature dick jokes here and there, please help us out anyway you can. In return, we promise that we\u0027ll try to make it worth your while by bringing you the continually improving content that you\u0027ve come to enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\n- The CCS Gang \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
