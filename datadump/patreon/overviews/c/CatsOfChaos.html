My name is Annie and I\u0027m the artist behind\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://chaosincolor.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eChaos in Color\u003c/a\u003e, featuring \u003cem\u003eCuriously Cognizant Cats and Skeletons\u003c/em\u003e. As the tag line suggests, my work is dominated by cats who like to hang out with skulls and skeletons. If I think of something funny then a few other oddities might also make an appearance. Even though there are skeletons present, I don\u0027t depict any gore.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a bit of a niche market. Millions of people like cats, and skeletons have an impressive following of their own, but the combination makes for a very special group of people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you one of those people? If so then I invite you to join my creative process by becoming a patron. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this age of social media many artists end up essentially working for \u0027likes\u0027 by posting new content on a regular basis and never earning any income from it. The hope is that followers will eventually make a purchase but the reality is that most never do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe patron model gives the artist the ability to keep creating without constantly worrying about selling. This is not a donation though, patrons receive benefits! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Patrons at every level get to see exclusive posts about what\u0027s happening at Chaos in Color. This includes things like works in progress, where you can give feedback and maybe even influence what happens in the artwork!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Patrons at the $5 level receive a new piece of artwork every week. These are not available on any other social media. You can even download the artwork for your personal use (but we do maintain copyright).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) Patrons at the $25 level get access to all past posts, as well as to all new posts. We\u0027ll even give you a shout-out in a special post, unless you prefer to remain private, that\u0027s cool too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd last but certainly not least, patrons make it possible for us to donate even more artwork to non-profit fundraisers, which are almost always cat rescue groups. These organizations either raffle or auction the artwork to raise money for services that help cats and kittens. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can pledge whatever amount these benefits are worth to you. For the cats and skellies, for the creation of new artwork, and for your own enjoyment, thank you for becoming a patron!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Contemporary artist Annie Dunn uses freehand digital painting to take thought provoking jabs at reality. Her offbeat style most closely resembles American magic realism crossed with Dia de los Muertos and a copy of the Sunday funnies. A special affinity for cats is also overwhelmingly evident. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a night owl who grew up across the street from an old small-town cemetery, Annie\u0027s paintings gravitate towards the supernatural. This comes through with her use of exaggerated color and light, as well as more subtle symbolism, such as curiously cognizant cats and skeletons, dark shadowy forests, lively graveyards, and starry night skies. In a way she has become reacquainted with her childhood love of writing spooky stories, except this time with pictures instead of words. While largely self taught, Annie credits online classes for most of her art education and says that she makes a point of learning something new with every painting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough a self-described recluse, Annie has exhibited throughout the Southwestern United States at art shows, comic conventions, and book festivals. In between these public sightings, she is rumored to live with her husband and a clowder of cats in the suburbs of Phoenix, Arizona.",
