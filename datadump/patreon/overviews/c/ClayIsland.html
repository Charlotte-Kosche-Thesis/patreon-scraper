    "summary": "Our purpose is to be the change we want to see in the world and show others how to do the same.  What does this look like?  Bringing to the ocean love, joy, play, compassion, cooperation, and respect.  Often we see people dumping their physical and emotional garbage in the ocean, leaving trash on the beach, polluting via drains and sewers, bringing their rage, excessive competing, and blaming and shaming everyone around them.  We believe they do this because they have never been shown otherwise, no one has explained to them in a loving way the consequences of their actions, nor have they been given tools to live differently.  We want to give everyone the tools to feel better, live in harmony with nature, and welcome the love, peace, beauty, and joy that they have inside themselves.  Please \u003ca href=\"https://clayisland.com/membership-account/membership-levels/\"\u003ejoin us\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.clayisland.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003econtact us\u003c/a\u003e.

     "description": "I lived on the top floor of an Outer Richmond building in San Francisco for a few years, before that I lived in a small condo community in Santa Cruz.\u00a0 In both of these areas the owners and managers viewed the property as an asset with a goal of maximizing appreciation and or rental income.\u00a0 While enjoying the afternoon sun on the third story balcony and looking down at the mostly empty backyards that made up the interior of that rectangular block in SF I caught a vision.\u00a0 This vision has been built in far away places that most people have never heard of, and as far as I know it has yet to be tried in a well known popular city.\u00a0 A city block near the water in the San Francisco Bay Area contains around 50 buildings, with an estimated price of $1-3 million each.\u00a0 This seems to me to be the perfect place to show the world a lifestyle more powerful and fulfilling than chasing money.\u00a0 Let us reclaim a city block of isolation, competition, and fear, and together, inspired with cooperation and love, build a village of dreams that nourishes our soul and lights the way for all who are suffering to rediscover what it feels like to be truly alive.\u003cbr\u003e",
