    "summary": "Hello and Welcome! You\u0027ve reached the page of a creator who\u0027s just starting out. Like alot of young creators, I\u0027ve got alot of big ideas i want to see through, and the sooner i start, the sooner i can realize them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re considering supporting me, i appreciate it and hope you decide to! If youre on the fence, maybe there isn\u0027t content here you like, maybe its too simple, or maybe im just to small, I encourage you to check back in a month or two! Current projects are only going to become more fun, with new projects being added and elaborated on. Its your Money, and I want to make it worth your while to support me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Double Simple\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDouble Simple is my mini series about mischievous little bunnies who are only living life to their fullest. Its a very simple 3-panel comic that I\u0027ve got alot of ideas for am passionate about! To me, Double Simple is something sustainable that i can rely on. Its not intricate or complicated and i can consistently put out a comic or two ever couple days without struggle or delay. I think that this kind of reliability and consistency is what people are looking for in content creators. This mini comic is my starting line, and my practice to creating something people can enjoy while being on a set schedule. Double Simple is my road to bigger and better projects, please consider supporting it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eAbout Wizard Show\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003eWizard show is my baby. I\u0027m so excited to be able to bring it to life even though in the beginning\u00a0its a bit rough. Animation is a valuable\u00a0skill to have as an artist and I\u0027m hoping to learn that skill through wizard show. The premise for this show is based on Dr. Weird, the cold opening to the first two seasons of Aqua Teen Hunger Force. I fell in love with its ability to be less than a minute long but still be funny. I also loved that some episodes didn\u0027t need to rely on adult themes to get their point across. I\u0027m hoping that wizard show can be just the same, fun for all ages and something i can be proud of.\u003c/div\u003eThanks so much for reading!"
