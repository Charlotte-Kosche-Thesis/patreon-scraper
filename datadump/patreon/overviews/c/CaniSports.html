I have so many ideas I would love to turn into reality and dreams that I am chasing, that I basically never stop thinking about how to improve my content every day.\u003cbr\u003eI am uploading 1 video a day during the week and 2 videos a day on weekends, which means I am uploading daily content, currently with +156.000 subscribers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs you guys might know I recently moved out to become a Full-Time-Youtuber and solely concentrate on creating content for my lovely fans. This is my childhood dream and I am only able to live it out because of you guys out there supporting me every day.\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately the amount I earn through YT has drastically changed since the CPM (amount you get paid for 1000 monetized views) is dropping lower and lower every year because of the market being flooded with new content creators every day and apps like Ad Block basically cutting our earnings in half.\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to keep creating content for you guys because this is my ultimate dream, being a Youtuber. I am on the brink of being able to do this Full-Time and I have so many crazy ideas for great content but I am limited by the amount I earn. \u003cbr\u003eIf you are in a position where you believe I am worth your support then please become a patreon of mine and support me in chasing my dreams!\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this and considering becoming a patreon,\u003cbr\u003eyours sincerely,\u003cbr\u003eCani"
