    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003eSo why are you here?\u003c/h4\u003eOne of the questions I hear the most is \"Why don\u0027t my photos look better?\" I\u0027m here to show you how to make your photos look more like a pro took them, show you how to give your photos impact, how to control your camera to get the shot YOU want,\u00a0 how to make you a better photographer and\u00a0perhaps get the best shots of your life!\u003cbr\u003eSo hopefully you\u0027re here to learn!\u00a0 I\u0027ve learned from some of the best in our industry, especially in the field of nature and wildlife, so now I\u0027m here to share that knowledge with you. That\u0027s why my background in education is just as important to you as my knowledge of photography, so more on that later.\u003cbr\u003e\nDid I mention I love to travel? Well, I do, so if you like to travel and take photos, too, then you\u0027ll be able to join me on workshops where I\u0027ll be right by your side helping you. Honestly, a workshop is one of the best ways to learn as it gets you right there to see what I see and how I\u0027d shoot it, and then how I post process my images for impact. That doesn\u0027t mean I do a lot of post processing of my images. I don\u0027t. If I spend more than a couple of minutes on an image in Lightroom, I\u0027m spending too much time on the image. I shoot to get it right in the camera, but I shoot RAW, and I maximize my images to make people go wow! You can do that too, and I\u0027ll show you how.\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting my efforts here, you\u0027re helping me to provide you with an ongoing education, which takes a lot of work behind the scenes, so thanks for your contributions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eWhat gives me the right to be here in the first place? My experience! It started over 35 years ago when I got my first camera, so here\u0027s a little about my background: I have a Bachelor of Science in Photographic Science with Honours from the University of Westminster in London, England. My first job out of college was with Polaroid, UK, but since then I\u0027ve worked in just about every genre of photography there is. I\u0027ve used a camera from almost every manufacturer, including medium and large format technical cameras. I\u0027ve spent way too many hours in the darkroom and I\u0027ve owned a 1 hour photo lab. When I was in college I made holograms using lasers, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last 15 years I\u0027ve worked as a professional photographer, and I\u0027m a Licentiate of the Royal Photographic Society. I belong to the Professional Photographers of America, the North American Nature Photography Association, and\u00a0I founded the Ballantyne Photography Club in Charlotte, NC., which now has over 650 members!\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m on the Board of the Charlotte Camera Club, a PSA affiliate, and I\u0027m an instructor with the Light Factory here in Charlotte and with Nikonians, too. I used to run the photo department at the US National Whitewater Center and I work as a freelance photographer every day of the week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn one of my other careers I worked in adult education in both a corporate training environment and at a college. My ability to teach in a fun and meaningful way meant that I became a Train the Trainer Facilitator, Department Chair and Head of the Training Department.\u00a0 I love teaching so it\u0027s been a natural progression to make it part of my business.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNow I train other photographers, consult with companies, speak at camera clubs, lead workshops and tours and have helped hundreds of photographers at every stage of their experience to learn to shoot like the pros do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHow can I help you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
