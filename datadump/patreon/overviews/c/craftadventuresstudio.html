    "summary": "I am Amy, and I like to make things. Knitting, writing, and mixed media are my staple pursuits, with lots of variation (e.g. spinning yarn, table top role-playing adventure creating, and learning to draw people). I\u0027m a Mama and Wife and Homemaker and becoming a Crafty Adventurer because that involves me doing things for myself, to improve myself, enjoy myself, and challenge myself. You can find my repository for projects and blog postings at my website, \u003ca href=\"http://craftadventuresstudio.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCraftAdventuresStudio.com\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0and\u00a0see some of my final products for sale at my two Etsy shops, \u003ca href=\"http://anchovyknits.etsy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAnchovy Knits\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://craftyadventurer.etsy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCrafty Adventurer\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah310/Amy_Decker/cas1small_zps6fzi5iut.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah310/Amy_Decker/cas1_zpssqyxe9m4.jpg\" style=\"width: 652px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePayments are received on a monthly basis (as opposed to per upload).

Everything else will happen when it happens. I\u0027m going to build this up over time. Please understand that it is fluid. Some months will be more productive, other months slower, but on average I will share several creative things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah310/Amy_Decker/skills1_zpshlkqt8jt.jpg\" style=\"width: 649px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me and my family dig ourselves out of house and college debt and buy me fun, new supplies to carry on my Craft Adventures with a clear conscience. Three-quarters of the total earned from supporters goes to bills and the remaining one-fourth to spend as I please on supplies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal for Patreon is to keep the motivation and inspiration coming. With the knowledge that fans, friends, and family are contributing to my artistic, crafty , and sometimes weird endeavors, it will help me keep my butt in gear, give me the excuse to do more fun things instead of guilt-tripping over chores not being done, and give me something to be proud about that I\u0027ve created and know there are people out there who want to help me along in my adventures. And I like hearing about other people who have tried or even thought about, got excited about, making a thing that came from their brains and their hands and their souls. I think everyone should make stuff, as long as it\u0027s something they like and are proud of, that can be the final product or the process or both.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah310/Amy_Decker/trianglegnomes1_zpsd2sacn08.jpg\" style=\"width: 662px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e**Each of the reward levels are subject to change.

I\u0027m a stay-at-home Mama whose child is in school, and I want to be a productive human being, make things, use my time for more than just chores because that is a waste of time and of life and leads down dark, dark roads, my friend. Dark roads, indeed. So to counter that, I\u0027ll spend more time making the things I want to make and try to sometimes share those things with you. And maybe, just maybe, you\u0027ll get inspired and want to make your own things. And also share them with others. (Please note: I refuse to live in a disgusting hovel so \u003cem\u003esome\u003c/em\u003e time will be spent cleaning and such. It\u0027s part of being a responsible adult.)",
