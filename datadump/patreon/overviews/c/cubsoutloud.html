    "summary": "Cubs Out Loud started back in 2008. It was just three bears talking about the topics that interested them. Originally, it was focused mostly on the bear community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, we have blossomed to include many different aspects of the LGBTQA community at large. Now our shows include discussions about articles that affect our health and daily lives, as well as ongoing topics from our Let\u2019s Talk About Sex and Let\u2019s Talk About Kink series.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we\u2019ve grown, today we include both audio and video versions of the show. We also created an online store selling original COL merchandise. And because of this growth, we are reaching out to you, our audience, for support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e By becoming a Patron, you will help us continue to grow.\u00a0Patreon lets you donate a small monthly amount that will help us purchase better equipment; and better equipment means a better show. Plus, we have short and long term goals to improve Cubs Out Loud. Joining Patreon will help out the podcast, AND you\u2019ll get in on the action as well. In return for your donations, you\u2019ll have access to original and unpublished COL creations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more you donate, the more you\u2019ll receive. From access to special content to guest hosting on an episode, we have a lot to offer you: our COL Entourage. We have fun creating the podcast, and using Patreon will grant us more funding to continue doing it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Your support allows our small scale podcast to produce content for the LGBTQ community and spreading the love of all things bear. With Patreon, you will\u00a0directly help us evolve into something great for the future."
