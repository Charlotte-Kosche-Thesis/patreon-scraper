Whether the story is comedic, sad, happy, or even just plain weird, I love to write stories, short or long. My problem is that I can\u0027t get ideas very easily, and that\u0027s where you come in! Your ideas are a major help to my recurring writer\u0027s block, and many of the things I\u0027d write (of which I haven\u0027t posted) are from ideas that stemmed from something else someone said or showed me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Current Schedule:\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003eSunday: Whodunit\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMonday: Commissions Open*\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tTuesday: Announcement/Update Post\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWednesday: Commissions Close*\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThursday: Announce Accepted Commissions\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tFriday: Upload All \n\t\u003cem\u003eFINISHED\u003c/em\u003e Commissions\u003cbr\u003e\n\tSaturday: Hunters Among the Flowers\n\u003cbr\u003e\t\u003cbr\u003e*This event may not happen every week, and I will say why it didn\u0027t in my Tuesday post if it doesn\u0027t happen.\n\u003cbr\u003e\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThis schedule, while I will follow it as much as I can, is subject to change. Nobody is perfect, but I promise I will do my best. Remember, all commissions are FREE, but monthly pledges (especially when done with a tier) will allow you to read more than half of the stories and commissions I post, along with giving special privileges to the higher tiers. As for Friday, I must say again that I will ONLY upload the commissions that I have fully finished writing, and I schedule their posting the moment I finish them. If your commission, while accepted, doesn\u0027t appear on Friday, it means I have not finished writing the story yet. I promise that I will NEVER forget to write someone\u0027s commission, and always say if and why I stopped work on someone\u0027s commission (which will rarely happen, if ever) in my Tuesday post. I will also personally notify the patron whose commission I stopped working on of the same information, so no need to spam someone with messages saying I stopped working on their commission. Finally, the uploading of all of my posts and stories, along with the opening and closing of commissions, will happen at MIDNIGHT CST/CDT of the designated day. Please, DO NOT give me comments saying things like \"first\" or \"midnight squad\" or anything of that nature, as it doesn\u0027t contribute almost at all to the page or post. These comments will be deleted when I see them, so don\u0027t bother putting them up.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant to support me in other places?
