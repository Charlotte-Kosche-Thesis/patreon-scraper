     "about": "I was crafted in Detroit during the waning days of the Nixon Administration and began my long career as a gaming geek around the age of 9, having been first introduced to Dungeons and Dragons at summer camp \u2013 whereupon my first character was promptly \u0026amp; ignominiously devoured by a purple worm. Comics and sci-fi were all over the place in there too. Since then I\u2019ve wandered from locale to locale, ending up at various times in East Lansing, MI, Dublin, Ireland, and Westchester, NY. Of late, I\u0027ve settled down in the Greater Eau Claire Area of WI to enjoy a quiet family life with my daughter, progressive short term memory loss, and a list of new hobbies I am trying out that is longer than me. Besides gaming, I\u2019ve spent most of my copious free time trying to get started as an indie filmmaker, a folk-rock singer-songwriter, or a long-order cook. Given enough time, I\u2019d also love to commit myself to mastering amateur astronomy, kendo, swing dancing, Civil War re-enacting and/or upscale cosplay, travel writing, running, gardening, curling, speaking Gaelic and/or Old Norse, and homebrewing. Also enjoy jelly donuts, sloppy kisses, and dancing with the Squealy Nord.",
