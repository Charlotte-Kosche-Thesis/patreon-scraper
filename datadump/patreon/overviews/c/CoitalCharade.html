W. Bush (and beyond). \u00a0Cell phones cost a buck a minute to use, the World Wide Web doesn\u0027t exist. \u00a0Plenty of pay phones, no helmet laws.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 Our two principals are Lenny Schneider and Bekka Luchessi. \u00a0When we start out, Lenny is a white suburban punk whose primary income is derived from dealing meth on a large scale. \u00a0He\u0027s also the still photographer for Inana Productions, a small adult video studio north of San Diego. \u00a0His best friend is Bekka, a performer at the studio, screen name: Becky Page. \u00a0They have the same fatalism and low-grade cynicism about the world ingrained in most Gen X types. \u00a0And that\u0027s all you need to know about them to start.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRead excerpts at\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://coitalcharade.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ecoitalcharade.blogspot.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome Characters Speak:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLenny Schneider:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 Aw, Christ. \u00a0So this dude Dean DuPont invents me and Bekka around 2014. \u00a0He was kind enough to not make me a total scumbag, but I\u0027m not the most sympathetic person in the world, either. \u00a0I\u0027m your standard-issue white suburban punk rock loser just out of my teens, and I figure shifting big piles of dope is as valid a career as any other, right? \u00a0When I was originally created, I was almost a monster: really mentally unstable, addicted to my own dope. a one-man riot. \u00a0Thankfully, Dean realized that was bullshit and toned me down, my life would have revolved around jail time and trials if I did the crap he set me up with.... \u00a0Although, as you\u0027ll see in coming stories, he\u0027s still got wild shit happening in my life. \u00a0At least I can\u0027t complain that I\u0027m bored.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBekka Luchessi:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 Hello all. \u00a0I\u0027m the daughter of Sicilian immigrants, war babies who emigrated in the early Sixties. \u00a0As a performer, I\u0027m hardly Cristy Canyon or Seka, but I do get recognized off and on (it\u0027s mostly the haircut). \u00a0Dean decided Lenny needed a best friend, so he created me. \u00a0(We\u0027re, uh, more than just \"friends,\" okay. \u00a0None of your business.)\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 Why do I do what I do? \u00a0Pragmatism, with a healthy dose of exhibitionism. \u00a0When I was twenty, my mother contracted leukemia. \u00a0To help care for her, I had to drop out of college and land a well-paying job, but one which would allow me to act as a caregiver. \u00a0Well, damn it, adult performance means $2800 weekly paychecks and sixteen hour work weeks. \u00a0I told my parents I was in \"sales\" and kept mum. \u00a0Mom passed away when I was twenty-two, never knowing the truth. \u00a0By then, I was completely relaxed with the work, it\u0027s the world\u0027s most singular form of acting.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 My favorite activity: blowing the minds of strangers by talking about work in an open and frank manner. \u00a0Then, I\u0027ll let them know I am a Christian, disease-free, have a loving family, am monogamous in my personal life, and like visiting \"no kill\" shelters to help pet the kitties. \u00a0It\u0027s rarely what they expect. \u00a0Their loss.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJane Osborne:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 Oh, hey. \u00a0You\u0027re not gonna really get to know me for a little while, \u0027kay? \u00a0But uh, I\u0027m a teenage girl who\u0027s gonna have a major impact in Lenny and Bekka\u0027s life. \u00a0For some reason, Dean took a five foot five punk rock girl and endowed her with excess amounts of brains, guts, and attitude. \u00a0(Excess libido, too. \u00a0I scare boys!) \u00a0And my goal is to rule the world by the time I hit menopause. \u00a0(I\u0027m not kidding, either!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTerry Patton:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u0027Sup, fuckers?

\u00a0Okay, a New York wop who makes porn... Any stereotypes coming to mind? \u00a0Let\u0027s just say I refer to myself as a Legitimate Businessman, and the honor of my, ah, Family is held close to my heart. \u00a0Me and my cousins, we got connections, okay? \u00a0See you very soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals and Dreams on Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 The \"Coital Charade\" stories started as a hobby in 2014. \u00a0I would share them with friends, and have my ego stroked enough, often enough, that I finally decided it was time to take the advice and publish them: God knows, I had a ton after three years of unemployment. \u00a0The stories languish as text and HTML files, and need to be edited, proofread, formatted, and converted to PDF files. \u00a0Serious grunt work, and lots of it.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 These are short (and not so short) stories which will be released in order, in books containing two to five stories at once. \u00a0They will be released sequentially and \"published\" as eBooks on Amazon, Barnes \u0026amp; Noble, Apple Store, etc. \u00a0The sales prices will be low --- $2 or $3 --- and, if you become a patron, totally irrelevant. \u00a0Patrons will have access to the books as they come out before the \"official\" release date, pretty much for free.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 Also, I\u0027m not done writing these stories. \u00a0A lot has changed in the universe my characters inhabit since the beginning, and will continue to change. \u00a0I introduced you to five of my characters, two of whom do not appear in the timeline for a while.... unless you\u0027re a patron. \u00a0You\u0027ll get to know them as people --- God knows I think of them that way --- in the \"Patrons Only\" section of my page.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 My most outlandish fantasy is to be the next Raymond Chandler or Jim Thompson, an author of stories, not \"literature.\" \u00a0I want the public to read my stories and have fun doing so, I want to provide diversion, make people smile, take them on an adventure with a load of thugs, weirdos, perverts, mafioso, libertines, yahoos, and random eccentrics as they thrash through Southern California, chasing the Big Money Deal, or just having fun. \u00a0Knowing I entertained people will make me happy.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 My goal is to have both sufficient patronage and eBook sales to stop being an ersatz welfare bum.... Okay, it\u0027s SSI, not welfare, but having self-sufficiency would be wonderful. \u00a0Even having a supplement to the Social Security payments would improve things greatly, enabling me to write at a steadier pace, with more thought to my continuing stories. \u00a0Having the government declare you \"disabled\" sucks, you\u0027re in a limbo between outright destitution and Just Scraping By. \u00a0And you\u0027re unemployable. \u00a0(Let\u0027s just say I have a higher interest in the recycle value of aluminum cans than most people.)\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 Will the series ever end? \u00a0Well... \u00a0\"General Hospital\" has been on the air since 1963. \u00a0I have an advantage of being able to manipulate how time behaves in my imaginary universe, I could simply have time stop moving when Clinton is inaugurated, and still keep busy for a while. \u00a0Or, I might spin off on a single character, having them be the focal point and the other characters (there\u0027s quite a few by now) be very peripheral. \u00a0Who knows? \u00a0All I know is I\u0027m not about to stop banging on this keyboard anytime soon, and I hope you\u0027ll enjoy the fruits of my labor.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u0027ve already been exploited most of my life. \u00a0Patronize me for a while instead.\""
