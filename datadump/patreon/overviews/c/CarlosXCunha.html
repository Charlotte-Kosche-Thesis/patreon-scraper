    "summary": "Thank you for the interest in The Five Cent Farm, and hopefully, you will become a patron when you see what we have going on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMrs. Cunha and I began this adventure five years ago with a breeding trio of rabbits and a dozen chickens from Tractor Supply on a rented half acre in northern Alabama. We have since plunged deeper into the Tennessee Valley in pursuit of our agrarian dream of providing as much of our own food with as few outside inputs as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe original goal was complete self-sufficiency, but as it turned out, we aren\u0027t completely terrible at homesteading. Excess production brought up interesting questions as to the overlap between homesteading and farming. After some introspection and experimentation, Mrs. Cunha and I have managed to strike a balance, where we maintain a homesteading spirit with an eye toward niche, artisan products, such as heritage breed pigs, non-traditional ducks, and meat sheep. It\u0027s more than the subsistence farming often associated with homesteading, but not the industrial-scale, monofarming of vast acreages, either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a writer with a farming problem, our animal misadventures began to find their way into print. We discovered a thirst for knowledge. I wanted to tell funny stories about nearly dying. Readers wanted to know how we achieved our results. So, I began writing more technical articles, but still in my usual style of willingness to admit missteps, incompetence, and failures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you receive as a Patron is access over and above what is available for free on our website and social media. This includes peeks behind the scenes, photos not widely released, and content exclusive to Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur philosophy is Patrons deserve more content, access, and attention than those who are passive consumers of content. If you are not sure about becoming a Patron, join for a month at the level that interests you, and cancel before the next billing cycle, if you are disappointed. That doesn\u0027t bother us at all. Our Patrons deserve to feel their support is remunerated.\u003cbr\u003e"
