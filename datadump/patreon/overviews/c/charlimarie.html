Learning design is tough, and learning to be a \n\u003cem\u003egood\u003c/em\u003e designer is even tougher. There\u0027s more to it than knowing all the Photoshop shortcuts, and it can be hard to learn on your own; but that\u0027s why I\u0027m here!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy videos will always be free, but if you become a Patron you\u0027ll get some extra ways to learn through my perks! From screen recordings of pieces of my process to downloadable templates to Google Hangout calls where we can discuss issues you\u0027re facing or critique your work. Just choose a membership tier with the perks you like best, and join!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEven if you can only support for a few months here or there, it would mean the world to me. At the start of 2016 I removed pre-roll ads from my videos (because let\u0027s face it, ads suck and they\u0027re a waste of your time) so if you\u0027ve been enjoying my content and looking for a way to support, becoming a Patreon supporter is the perfect way to do it!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support will help me invest in new software to try out and review for you, new assets to use in my videos to improve them, and in general allow me to put more time into my online teaching and vlogs. Plus, I\u0027m excited to get to know you better!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for reading and for checking out my page.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e- Charli\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
