    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThe Chalkboard Podcast is Micah Conkling and Eric Milner: former elementary school enemies who bonded as best friends over a middle school paramecium project, then years later started a podcast to talk about pop culture and good people doing the things they love in their hometown of Kansas City.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy \"The Chalkboard\"?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMicah and Eric were roommates up on the 3rd floor of a grimy Midtown apartment building.  It was a total dump: no A/C, creaky wooden floors, and eventually, one of their neighbors got bedbugs, which eventually forced all tenants to move out of the 6-plex unit. The apartment was garbage, but it was a space filled with great conversations and plenty of laughs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the memories that stands out most from their stint as bunkmates was a small framed chalkboard Micah\u0027s mom bought the guys to \"spruce up the place.\" I guess she didn\u0027t think Tarantino movie posters and old boxes of High Life counted as decor. Micah and Eric quickly made use of the chalkboard by writing down and arguing about power rankings: lists like best area breakfast joints, favorite Springsteen songs, and the most inspirational sports movies. That chalkboard was a space to discuss, debate, and develop beliefs about media, culture, and everyday life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe Kansas City pride is more than just wearing a certain brand of clothing or taking pictures in front of an Instagram-able mural. Kansas City is great because of its people: they\u0027re creative, talented, and kind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re having conversations from Kansas City, because they\u0027re worth hearing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to continue to bring listeners something they look forward to each and every episode. We\u0027re working hard at making the podcast better each week by booking more guests, covering more events around town and upping our production quality. We\u0027re excited to bring you conversations from Kansas City, and that\u0027s why we started a Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
