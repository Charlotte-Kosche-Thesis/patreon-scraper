    "summary": "You\u0027re here! Welcome! I\u0027m so happy you\u0027re checking this out, and I want to just begin by making sure you know that I\u0027m truly grateful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Catarina, or some of you may know me as BattlingBard. My bachelor\u0027s is in English Literature, and my focus was heavily in Middle English to Victorian literature as well as creative writing. My fiction shifts between genres, but they all have diverse and real characters. Well... as real as you can get when there are aliens or half tiger/half human beings. Over the past few years, I\u0027ve grown to have a sincere respect for fan fiction. Of course, those stories are purely for fun as those characters are not my property, but I\u0027ve written original pieces of fiction for various platforms. Novel writing remains my favorite media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreative writing is something I have dreamed of doing. I love creating worlds that people want to visit and characters for everyone. The creative writing courses I took at the University of Texas were one of the highlights of my college career, and, now, sharing my stories on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/BattlingBard/works\"\u003eArchive of our Own\u003c/a\u003e is one of my favorite things to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn full disclosure, I do have a full time job nowhere near my field; however, it\u0027s an overnight job that gives me plenty of time to write. One of my two babies is a web series,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/thebechshow\"\u003eThe Bech\u003c/a\u003e, and she takes up most of my overnight hours. My other baby is what inspired me to create this page. This untitled fantasy series (the plan is for a trilogy, but we\u0027ll see if more happens) is set in a world called Cralstar.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis fantastical world of Cralstar is ruled by a council of five members, the Ashdlai, who come from five different regions, Minmani, Apaha, Nchun, Nanis, and Detetos. They use the Mollia Knights, an order of highly trained people from all across the world, to maintain harmony, peace, and explore other worlds to gather resources and exchange knowledge. To become a knight, candidates must go through Molliany, a series of challenges in a quest they must conquer alone. While there are a number of familiar creatures, such as dragons and kitsune, Cralstar is bounding with original beings that will be throughout this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my two babies, I plan to work on short fiction while continuing my fan fiction. With your support, I can spend more time writing amazing content for you while still being able keep a roof over my head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to check this out, and I am extremely excited to read your comments and feedback and thoughts and reactions!"
