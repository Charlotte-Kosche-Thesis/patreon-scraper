    "summary": "At Cascade Writers, we\u0027re about three things... Creativity, Community, and Contacts. Making it in the writing industry isn\u0027t easy, and we want all of our authors to be successful in their careers. Therefore, we\u00a0provide educational seminars and workshops for the general public interested in writing and publishing original works. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur speakers and workshop leaders have included pros like Beth Meacham (Tor editor),\u00a0Claire Eddy (Tor editor), Ellen Datlow (editor), Sara Megibow (KT Literary), Lucienne Diver (The Knight Agency), Jennifer Azantian (Azantian Literary Agency), and authors like John Scalzi, Kat Richardson, J.A. Pitts,\u00a0Delilah Marvelle,\u00a0Todd McCaffrey,\u00a0Tina Connolly, Randy Henderson (who was once an attendee!), and many more. We\u0027ve also had illustrators like Mark Ferrari and Lee Moyer teach on book cover design and branding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we certainly have the creativity side down, the reason for our Patreon account is so we can create more in the way of community and contacts. We\u0027d like to reach authors that can\u0027t afford to attend our paid events or that live out of the area. With donations, we were able to fly John Scalzi in and he provided a free and open to the public workshop on writing at the Tacoma Public Library. We\u0027d like to do more like this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what will your donations cover? The chance for us to fly in speakers and industry pros to teach, speak, and/or critique our attendees. They will also enable us to give more scholarships to our paid events as well as get content to people that are unable attend.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother area your donations will help is getting our pros honorariums for the time they\u0027re putting in. Right now we can pay a small amount, but not what the authors, editors, and agents are worth. Your donations will also help us get these amazing pros paid for their time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a registered non-profit corporation in Washington state."
