You set the limit to how much you want to pledge as a whole, so you would pledge $1 a song up to $20 dollars or 20 songs etc. Each pledge amount has rewards which I send as a big virtual thank you hug :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUp to this point I\u0027ve been recording all of my music and videos at home with Garageband and a 10 year old Sony Handycam. I\u0027m working toward taking my music to the next level and getting an EP or full length album professionally recorded and produced. So the Patreon support I receive will all be going toward that goal, turning my vision for my songs into a reality. Thanks so very much for the support and the love!\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat Will I Be Creating?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWell for starters, I\u0027ll be releasing my newest ideas as raw demos, as they come out of my brain and into my Mac. I will make them available for download here, for you, first. Eventually I\u0027d also like to be pre-releasing finished songs here as I\u0027m further along with production.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n"
