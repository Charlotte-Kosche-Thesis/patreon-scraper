Mostly, the amount of money I have to spend in order to continue living has increased exponentially, and an alarming number of emergencies have left me without much financial security. I\u0027ve also had a lot less free time to indulge in my hobbies and projects, as I now work an office job. I still try to release at least one video a week and a podcast a little more than once a month, but editing takes a huge chunk out of my already reduced free time. Editing an LP video can take several hours depending on length and complexity, and podcast audio can easily take up a full week\u0027s worth of free time in order to release in a timely manner. With all of this in mind, I decided to buckle down and put together a Patreon, where you can help support me and my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not going to pretend like I think that I could make a living off of doing stuff like this as is, but it\u0027s something I put a lot of time into and I would love to do more. I enjoy making things in the hopes that they will make other people happy, and so if you\u0027d like to give a little back it would be much appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve put together some small goals for now that I can offer in exchange for your money, and hopefully as my life continues forward I can do even more for you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://otakutrashmachine.com/img/slime-hug.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
