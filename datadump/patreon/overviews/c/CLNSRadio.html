It is our intention to keep CLNS Radio\u0027s \nservices free while expanding our offerings and creating more premium, \nexclusive coverage of your favorite sports teams. Additionally, a mobile app for the Android and Apple markets will be available for our fans very soon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe only way we can accomplish these ambitious goals\u00a0is with your help!\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\n appreciate your loyal reading, listening and viewing of our content and\n we want to keep\u00a0 expanding our coverage for you.  CLNS Radio has \nmerchandise being designed and the previously mentioned mobile app in development.  We have \ngoals to upgrade our equipment to ensure that we give you the \nbest content to view, listen to and read in the blogosphere. With such \nhigh aspirations we need your support - but not without giving back!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Patreon Mission Statement:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tOur goal with this Patreon page is to offer you higher quality and \neasier ways to listen, read and watch our content. We need your help as these \ninvestments are costly.  You have the opportunity to take ownership in \nCLNS Radio by contributing however much you can afford. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur pledge to you is to put your donations to use in ways that will \nabsolutely enhance your experience here at CLNS Radio.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSome More Information about the CLNS Radio Patreon Mission:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\n\nThere are a number of costs associated with putting together a full-time\n blog, sports podcast network and YouTube TV channel.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose costs \ninclude, but are not limited to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaintaining the blog and YouTube Channel \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpkeep of network podcasts\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpgrades to our cameras, microphones and other equipment that allow us to continue offering excellent content and services.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith only main objectives, you may think that isn\u0027t a lot of work. \n However, the biggest expense is time.  Our roster of writers, on-air \npersonalities and producers put hours of work into their respective \nshows and articles.  Whether it\u0027s our Post Game coverage of every single\n Celtics, Bruins and Patriots game or our YouTube Shows that are shot on\n the TD Garden ice or parquet -\u00a0every single broadcast or written \ncoverage is meant to provide you with the most information \nand entertainment that we possibly can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWe\n do make money from our sponsors and affiliates, but Patreon allows your\n ongoing support to help fund our shows\u0027 monthly overhead while allowing\n us to invest in upgrades and premium service, such as our soon-to-be \nreleased mobile application.  If you feel like this is something you \nwould like to do, we urge you to become a Patreon today for as little as\n $4.99 per month. Keep in mind, however, you are free to donate as little, or as much as you can afford - no amount (not even 50 cents) is too little!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\n absolutely love supplying you with high quality Boston sports coverage \nand have been touched by your level of support over the past six years. \n We\u0027ve had some amazing moments over the years!  From supplying locker \nroom coverage of five Celtics playoff runs and an NBA Finals berth to \ncovering the Bruins\u0027 Stanley Cup Championship and Red Sox World Series \nChampionship it has been an amazing ride.  We were nominated for Celtics\n blog of the year in 2010.  On top of all that, we have had a post game \nshow after every single Celtics game since 2010 all while working with a\n volunteer staff!  \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith\n all that in mind, we couldn\u0027t have done it without you: the listener. \n You\u0027ve been our inspiration and you keep our coverage pumping.  It is \ntime to hand out the all-access passes and invite you inside the virtual\n studio yet again by asking you to help us build the biggest and best \nBoston sports network, where the fans\u0027 voices are always heard!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAbout CLNS Radio\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tCLNS Radio is a free service to Boston sports fans all over the world.
