    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to the Patreon page for Crazy Danish Hacker!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you\u0027re probably aware of, I create ethical hacking videos that demonstrate specific attack vectors, or in some cases, just cool things! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I try to do different, is as follows:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTry to start every video/topic from scratch;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDon\u0027t skip important steps, show all steps required;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHigh quality audio and video; and\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEasy to understand format.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are plenty of hacking videos on YouTube already, some are great and some are not.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn the information age that we live in, I\u0027ve noticed that it\u0027s becoming increasingly harder to find high quality educational videos about hacking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn most cases, it\u0027s because the highest quality content is either hidden in books, specific courseware by a few select providers, forums and websites that no longer exist, whitepapers that are not indexed very well, and so forth. In short, if you don\u0027t know where to look, or what to search for, it can be hard to start, or evolve as an ethical hacker. Especially if you want to become a professional penetration tester.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I decided to create Crazy Danish Hacker, a YouTube channel that shows how hacking is done, by a professional ethical hacker, i.e. penetration tester.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream goal for Crazy Danish Hacker, is to make these cool YouTube videos for a living in the future. Some of the videos, in particular the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRovDyowOn5F_TFotx0n8A79ToZYD2lOv\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGSM videos\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, were pretty much a full-time job for a few weeks of learning, researching, and then converting that knowledge into a video format that could be used online. (I used my vacation time in that case for example.)\u003cbr\u003e"
