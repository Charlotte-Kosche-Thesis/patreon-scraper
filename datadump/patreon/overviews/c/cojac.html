    "summary": "Hi there and thank you for visiting my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a latex fashion photographer from the Netherlands. Have been in the fetish scene since 2008 and been working hard to get the coJac name established. My main goal is to keep making better pictures with Dutch and international models and designers! I started out working with latex because i like how it shows all the curves of the models and how it shines ones lubbed. \u003cbr\u003eBut i also shoot other styles like lingerie, fashion and some art work that hangs in a gallery.\u003cbr\u003eNext to this \"hobby\" i still have a day job (4 days a week) as a barber...so my weeks are pretty much packed!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a Patreon page?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEver since my work became better i have been working on my own website which is pretty basic. Everything is free to see (in low res) and i try to update the page from time to time. But lately i have been so busy that i only have time to update Instagram and my 2 Facebook pages.\u003cbr\u003eSo why another page? I have been putting a lot of effort and money in my photography and got a lot of exposure in the past years, but never made any earnings to make new investments.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI know i have fans/followers that have contacted me in the past about buying high res images/galleries. So now i hope with this Patreon page i can provide that need and hopefully can invest in better photo equipment or hire models that fans wanna see in one of my latex shoots.\u003cbr\u003e"
