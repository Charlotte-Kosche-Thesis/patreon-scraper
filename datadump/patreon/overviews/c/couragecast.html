We haven\u0027t reached the download numbers yet to ask for advertising, so that\u0027s why we decided to partner with Patreon. With your support, we will be able to make this podcast better, grow our reach and have a large, thriving Courageous Community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the Membership Tiers to your right. There are a number of ways you can support us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we hit 100 patrons, we will begin to feature patrons on the podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we hit 500 patrons, we will have enough momentum to announce the first ever Courage Conference - where we can get together in person, hear great speakers and encourage one another together towards greater things! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so excited about the future of the Courage Cast and the Courageous Community.
