    "summary": "I\u0027m Calvin Rosser! I\u0027m on a mission to empower\u00a010 million people to live more conscious and fulfilling lives. To make that mission happen, I could use your help. But before getting to that, I want you to know who I am, how I got here, and what I\u0027m about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePoverty \u0026gt; Princeton\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up poor in Orlando, Florida. My dad was an alcoholic who wasn\u2019t around, so it was just me and my mom growing up. My mom and I did our best to make life work despite the steady stream of challenges we faced. Instead of getting me down, the adversity of my youth fueled me.\u00a0It created an insatiable drive to improve my life. And with lots of hard work, luck, and support from a mentor, I landed a full ride at Princeton University.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrinceton \u0026gt; Banking \u0026gt; Startup\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt Princeton, I got exposure to people from very different cultures and socioeconomic classes and had the opportunity to travel abroad for the first time. I left my four years with a deep curiosity of the world. I started my career working for a big investment bank in New York to find my financial footing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter getting to the point where I didn\u0027t have to worry about whether or not I could afford an afternoon coffee, I realized\u00a0that I didn\u0027t want to spend 15 hours a day in a cubicle doing work that didn\u0027t excite. Life is much too short for that. So I planned my escape from the cubicle. I took a role at a remote startup, got rid of all my stuff, and bought a one way ticket to Cartagena, Colombia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStartup \u0026gt; Today\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the next year and a half, I traveled to 25 countries across 4 continents. Along the way, I helped grow a business unit from 0 to millions in revenue, read dozens of books that uncovered new intellectual interests, spent lots of time in nature, meditating, and learning new skill set hundreds of awesome people and built a global network, and felt more joy and gratitude than any other period of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was amazing, but I wanted to contribute to the world on a much deeper level.\u00a0Here\u2019s the reality: I\u2019m just like everyone else. I want to live a good life, be happy, and contribute. I want to minimize pain, avoid unpleasant people, and do meaningful work. I want to look back and say that my time here left the world a slightly better place. Contribution and learning are what motivate and fulfill me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I quit my job to create a path where I could spend all of my time and energy helping others and paying it forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd that\u0027s how I got here on my mission to help 10 million people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvery week, I write about big ideas, unconventional living, practical achievement frameworks, and the art of fulfillment on \u003ca href=\"https://calvinrosser.com/\"\u003ecalvinrosser.com\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.quora.com/profile/Calvin-Rosser\"\u003eQuora\u003c/a\u003e. I also work one-on-one with\u00a0entrepreneurs and professionals looking to grow their businesses, accelerate their careers, and get more out of life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I move forward, I will expand into podcasting, public speaking, and partnering with other entrepreneurs with similar values looking to make a difference. I\u0027m always looking for new ways to reach people and scale my impact.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m here on Patreon for financial support to keep the mission pure and moving forward.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t need much and never have, but I do need to be able to cover the operating expenses of the mission. I need to pay my email marketing provider, buy a little food, and have a place to sleep.\u00a0But I don\u0027t want to do that with ads, spammy emails, or creating content that\u0027s not worth your time. I know that will muddy the mission. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you believe in what I\u0027m doing and want to help fuel this long-term journey, I would appreciate any support you can give. I promise to use that support wisely and to pay it forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003eCalvin\u003cbr\u003e"
