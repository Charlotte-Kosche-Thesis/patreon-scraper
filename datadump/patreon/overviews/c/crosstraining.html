For two years many viewers were encouraging me to go full time and offered to support the vids... so I bit the bullet!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want all the training vids to remain publicly available to all, and some of the ride vids (\u0027vlogs\u0027) too. But four of the ride vids each month will only be available to supporters to say thanks for making this all possible. :)\u003cbr\u003echeers, Barry\u003cbr\u003e"

I have social work and graphic design in my background, so have always enjoyed doing what I can to leave the world a slightly better place. Over the years, my paid employment and volunteer work has been in a range of areas - autism, psychiatric disabilities, refugees, brain injury, alcohol and drug dependence etc. For years I\u0027ve been an avid motorbike rider and have done a range of free websites, blogs and videos to provide information for other riders. We riders fully understand why dogs like to hang their head out of the car window.... :)",
