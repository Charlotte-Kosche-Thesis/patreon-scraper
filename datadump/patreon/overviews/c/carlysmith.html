    "summary": "My name is \u003cstrong\u003eCarly Smith\u003c/strong\u003e, and I write (\u003cem\u003etherefore, I am a writer\u003c/em\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hated writing until the second grade, when my teacher asked us to write a sequel to a book we read in class, unknowingly introducing me to the land of \u003cem\u003efanfiction\u003c/em\u003e! I spent lots of time in my teens writing both fanfiction and original stories, and it wasn\u0027t until high school that I discovered I also enjoyed journalism. So, I went on to college to get my degree in journalism, freelanced for three years, and then took a break from that to edit books. Yet the writing bug kept nipping at my ankles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this Patreon for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo motivate me to write and edit a short story on a regular basis (goal is one every month for now) for patrons to read\u2014and hopefully enjoy! Also included will be short \"drabbles\" (my cute way of saying free writing), looks behind the scenes at/previews of my in-progress longer works, and round-ups of my non-fiction writing. My articles focus on critical examinations (feminist perspectives, interviews, personal essays) of video games, cosplay, conventions, anime, fantasy, science fiction\u2014geeky topics all around. Each article will be around 800 words long (possibly more if I do a deep-dive on a topic).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor samples of my previous nonfiction work, check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.carlysmith.net/portfolio\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy portfolio.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNew to cosplay, video games, and other geeky topics?\u003c/em\u003e Don\u0027t worry; I aim for my writing to be accessible to people unfamiliar with the subject matter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, \u003cem\u003ewriting pays horribly\u003c/em\u003e, especially for freelancers. Any amount of money you contribute to me will help me keep up with writing that makes you think! Second, it\u0027s well-suited for recurring content. You\u0027ll be billed at the end of the month, and you can cancel it at any time if you\u0027re dissatisfied with my work or short on money. Feel free to suggest topics at any time! Patrons at $10 and up have the option of suggesting me a topic that I will make sure to follow through on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eme?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI\u0027m an experienced writer who\u0027s used to covering the niche. Because I\u0027m a member of the cosplaying community, I\u0027m well acquainted with the many sides of both the hobby and the craft of costuming. I\u0027ve also been writing about video games for several years. My work has been published in \u003cem\u003ePolygon, Paste, Women Write About Comics, Gamasutra, The Escapist, \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eFive out of Ten\u003c/em\u003e magazine,\u00a0and \u003cem\u003eWomen and Hollywood.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support!
