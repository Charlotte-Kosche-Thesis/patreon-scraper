    "summary": "We\u0027ve all been there: you\u0027re playing your favorite video game and can\u0027t quite seem to beat that tricky boss or wish that there was a way to get extra lives or skip to later levels to get to the end quickly. You\u0027re not sure what to do next, so you want to look for help to beat that game. Look no further, because Retro Jeff is here to show you the tips and strategies that you\u0027ve been looking for!\u003cbr\u003eBack in the 80\u0027s and 90\u0027s, it was a golden age of gaming when names like Nintendo and Sega were part of our culture and included in TV shows, music and even movies. Just about everyone had a console connected to their big bulky TVs alongside their VCRs.\u003cbr\u003eIt was a part of our routine to come home from school and start up your Sega Genesis to play some Sonic or when Saturday cartoons ended to invite friends over to have bragging right on Street Fighter II. Unlike most new games that have checkpoints every few minutes, back then, you would pray that you still had some extra lives or firepower to beat the last level.\u003cbr\u003eBack then, we had some awesome magazines filled with tips and tricks to help us including GamePro, EGM, Nintendo Power and so on. Each issue had awesome previews and reviews of games that got you geeked up to play them. Unfortunately, these magazines have disappeared and are no longer made.\u003cbr\u003eSo, to keep the spirit and to pay homage to those publications, Classic Gaming with Jeff was made!\u003cbr\u003eGamePro TV was a big influence for me and after feeling nostalgic for days gone by, it was time to recreate a similar program for today. There are different videos that are part of the show including some that have tips for randomly picked games, some playthroughs that are a game played from beginning to the end, and some special episodes dedicated to beating all of the bosses in a particular game.\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, we can continue to keep the spirit alive of this retro themed program to show older gamers as well as new ones, the tips to beating these games.\u003cbr\u003e"
