Every episode, we pick one topic to talk about, and we don\u0027t stop talking until we run out of words. Enjoy a closer look at the game, the way it\u0027s played, and the culture surrounding our hobby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCritical Wits is a side project for both of its hosts, which means that there are often substantial delays between episode releases. With your support, we\u0027ll be able to prioritize the creation of new Critical Wits content, including more frequent releases (from \"occasional\" to \"regular\"!) as well as written articles by both Tim and Chrispy, including various thinkpieces and examinations of tabletop game rules, history, and culture. We might even be able to create other, more involved projects, like videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge will go toward covering the costs of running the podcast, including web hosting and the cost of new equipment, as well as helping support its hosts, starving self-employed creative Tim and starving full-time academic Chrispy."

I\u2019m Chrispy! I\u2019ve been around the podcasting scene for a couple years now with the Wild Games Productions group as a host of the \u003ca href=\"http://saveordie.info/\"\u003eSave or Die Podcast\u003c/a\u003e, a podcast about Classic D\u0026amp;D. I\u2019ve also done a few guest spots on other WGPRN shows dealing with Old School D\u0026amp;D: \u003ca href=\"http://rfipodcast.com/\"\u003eThe Roll for Initiative Podcast\u003c/a\u003e and\u003ca href=\"http://thacoshammer.info/\"\u003e tHAC0\u2032s Hammer\u003c/a\u003e. I\u2019ve been an avid and active member of the Old School Renaissance (OSR) since around 2008 and I have a deep love for the earlier versions of the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m an anglophile, a wannabe linguist, a natural mimic, and a day dreamer. Sometimes I make music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo me, role playing games should help you tell a story, but it should be a story that is driven by the players\u2019 actions. The Referee\u2019s role should be a reactionary one; with the players actively pursuing their goals and relationships and the Referee handling how those decisions affect the game world. Sadly, the game seems to be played the other way around, with the Referee telling the players a story that they have a small impact upon. I like games with rules-lite designs or games that act as tool boxes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to D\u0026amp;D, I\u2019m also a fan of the Mouse Guard RPG, d6 Star Wars, Ninja Burger, and Munchkin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://criticalwits.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/CW-Tim.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTim Jenkins\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood day! I\u2019m Tim Jenkins. I\u2019ve been playing D\u0026amp;D regularly about as long as Chrispy has, and I\u2019ve enjoyed many needlessly heated arguments with him over the way the game should be run. As a game designer myself, I like to pick apart the rules and see what makes these game systems tick, and to see what does and doesn\u2019t work in each edition of D\u0026amp;D in order to understand how we can make the game encourage the kind of play that makes table top role playing such a unique and wonderful experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy table top role playing games because they\u2019re only limited by your imagination. Using the rules to describe your characters and resolve events, RPGs give you the unique opportunity to become a part of a dynamically changing narrative, a collaborative story that everyone tells with an ending that nobody is certain of. Not only are they a fun pastime, table top RPGs are a great way to meet new people, hone your own practical skills, and even explore new parts of your own personality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also like that most table top RPGs are flexible and customizable, allowing you to change the game and add new content to suit your needs and that of your group. I\u2019m an active homebrewer, and will freely generate pages of new rules and options for any system I get into enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve played just about every edition of D\u0026amp;D, but I have the most experience playing Pathfinder. My favorite edition so far is the D\u0026amp;D Next / 5th Edition Playtest, which has the most elegantly designed, simple, and versatile core rules out of any of them, in my opinion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
