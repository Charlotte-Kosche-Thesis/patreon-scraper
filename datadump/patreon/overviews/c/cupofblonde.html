    "summary": "You made it! Thank you for taking the time to check out my page and become a patron! I am so excited to be able to share my love for writing with readers and other writing enthusiasts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt Starts With a Single Bean\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCup of Blonde was inspired by my new love for coffee and my past love of writing. Ironically, coffee entered my life the same year writing for fun exited my life- freshmen year of college. Fast forward to today: more than two years after graduation and the only recreational writing I do is limited to 140 characters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was passing the time of my thirty minute commute with a TED Talk podcast about how it\u0027s now easier for artists to make money in the digital age with -you guessed it- Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDing! Click! Pop! Boom!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where it all came together for me. I used to love writing, and it was time for me to fall back in love with it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always dreamed of what my career would develop into after I graduated from college. Unsurprisingly, my cheery capstone professor was wrong- companies would not be fighting to pay me $50,000 per year as soon as I entered the workforce. My hopeful vision of a kick-ass career began to fade.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever I am part of the lucky generation with a vision for a more fluid career that reaches outside the 9-5 box. I want to build a career outside of the office, one that can thrive whether I\u0027m working in my home state of Michigan or fulfilling a lifelong dream of traveling across the world (Australia, Hawaii, Ireland, to name a few on my list).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCup of Blonde is me creating my own kick-ass career for myself with parameters set by me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Brewing\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCup of Blonde\u0027s blog posts are crafted to fit easily in your few spare minutes of the day. I post two blog posts each week, one on Sunday and another on Wednesday.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHump Day Thoughts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hump day thoughts are designed to help get you over the hump of your work week. They\u00a0are perfect little distractions while sipping your morning coffee before work, inhaling food on your lunch hour, or ignoring all incoming emails at work. I write about anything that\u0027s on my mind that week, from my awkward interactions with people at the dog park to how I managed to survive college. Do you have a topic you\u0027d be interested in hearing my thoughts on? I\u0027d love for you to send me a message about it!"
