    "summary": "Hello! Thanks for visiting my Patreon page! Patreon is crowdsourcing platform that is dedicated specifically to helping artists. After hearing repeated admonitions for years of \"you\u0027ve got to get your stuff out there!\" from friends and fans, I decided to finally try do something about it. Would you like to join me? If you are interested, please continue reading...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, You Are A Composer. What Kind of Music Do You Write?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI have written music for a wide range of ensembles and musicians. Everything from young concert band through professional symphony orchestra, for middle school students through adults. My goal with my writing is to create music that both casual and seasoned listeners can find interesting and enjoyable. People who like my music say that they can hear influences of:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eStravinsky\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBartok\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDebussy\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCopland\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdams\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFilm music\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eOne of my main interests is in sacred music, both for the concert hall and the sanctuary. Vocal and choral music (sacred and secular) are two of my strengths and I also specialize in instrumental music for any size ensemble.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Why Should I Be A Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou should only become a patron of my music if you are a fan of my music! I want to get my music \"out there,\" as many of my supporters have been telling me for years! The best way to get my music \"out there\" is through recordings and concerts. Patrons will help in financially supporting the costs of hiring performers, recording costs, sheet music production, conference exhibition fees, etc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Makes You Unique?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eWell, I\u0027m a regular guy! While I love classical music, going to museums, reading and supporting local arts, I also love watching (and arguing) football, baseball, hockey; and cheering on my favorite teams in the process!\u00a0 (Bears, Cubs and Blackhawks, from my Chicago roots) I think this balance of \"artist - normal guy\" really comes out in my music: you can hear the classical training, but you also can hear that I have listened to jazz, pop, soundtracks and folk music. I have tried to digest all of these influences from my background, and reproduce something new. At the same time, I want my music to be challenging and interesting, but not elitist. I want to invite lots of people around the table, so to speak, and join together in sharing a musical experience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo What Do I Get As A Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are four (4) levels of patrons with the following \"rewards\":\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eLevel 1 - $2/month\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor pledging this amount, I will shout your name from the rooftops with gratitude!
