Then Claire and Cislyn each go off and make a thing based on the prompt - Cislyn writes a story, and Claire produces a painting or drawing or other work of art. Along the way, we take pictures, do recordings, and check-in frequently with our patrons regarding our process and progress on what we\u2019re working on. At the end of the fortnight, we package up the art and story and send it off to you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re getting actual physical stuff in the mail, what you\u2019ll receive is a letter in the mail from both of us with some notes about our process, a small signed and mounted print of Claire\u2019s art, and a signed printout of Cislyn\u2019s story on high quality paper. There\u2019s a wax seal involved, y\u2019all. This stuff is quite fancy. It\u2019ll be delivered in a bubble-mailer to protect the goodies from damage by the elements or postal shenanigans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur email-only patrons will receive their story and art in their inboxes after a short delay - if you\u2019re getting both email and physical mail, you can wait to open your digital goodies so you can enjoy the surprise more, or go ahead and dive in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter we\u2019ve gotten everyone\u2019s stuff sent off, we start back up again with another prompt. And we keep doing that, for an entire year. Wheeee!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first prompt pick will be on September 1st, 2016!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho We Are:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe C and C in CC: Otherworlds belong to Claire Whitmore and Cislyn Smith, two creative humans who both happen to live in Madison, Wisconsin. We created the CC: Otherworlds project for two reasons: because we love making strange and wonderful things, and because we think there should be more strange and wonderful things that come in the mail - email, snail mail, whatever mail you like - to you. Strangeness and wonder are meant to be shared.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClaire is a visual artist who works with lots of different mediums - watercolor, gouache, pencil, charcoal, oil paints, and more. She takes inspiration from a wide range of contemporary artists like Dave McKeen and James Gurney. Her work tends towards the illustrative, the bizarre and odd and creepy, and she enjoys creating scenes that suggest a broad, weird world beyond what is on the page. You can see some of her work on her website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.clairewhitmore.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eclairewhitmore.com\u003c/a\u003e, as well as her instagram feed,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/seeclairedraw/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eseeclairedraw\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCislyn is a writer of speculative fiction who absolutely loves short stories and flash fiction. She enjoys retelling fairy tales, subverting tropes, defying expectations, and generally telling strange stories. Her poems and fiction have been published in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://flashfictiononline.com/main/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFlash Fiction Online\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sfpoetry.com/starline.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eStar*Line\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://remixtmag.wordpress.com/2016/09/12/remixt-volume-1-table-of-contents/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRemixt Magazine\u003c/a\u003e, Electric Velocipede, and Cthulhu Haiku II.

Together, we make art and stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re committing to doing this for exactly one year. After that, we\u2019re going to make a book. We might keep on going, if there\u2019s interest. We might take a little break, and then start it up again, having learned some lessons (no doubt we\u2019re going to learn a lot from this endeavor) and making smarter choices about things. The earlier you get in on this, the more you\u2019ll get out of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy You Should Pledge:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou should sign up if you want to support two independant artists collaborating together for the fun of it. This enterprise is just the two of us.

If receiving something in the mail other than junk or spam or bills sounds refreshing and wonderful, then CC: Otherworlds is your go-to source. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou should sign up if you think it sounds fun or challenging or interesting. You should sign up if you want to watch us flail at fortnightly prompts, get a sneak peek into both of our processes, and receive some really nifty pieces of art and fun stories in the bargain. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd when a year has passed and we\u2019ve made all these awesome images and stories, we\u2019re going to compile them into a book. That should be fun, too, and those who sign up will also be contributing toward that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re splitting everything in this project exactly down the middle. You\u2019re supporting both Claire and Cislyn when you become a patron of CC: Otherworlds, and your pledges will help us both to cover expenses and provide the time and resources to continue being creative and productive.\u003cbr\u003e"
