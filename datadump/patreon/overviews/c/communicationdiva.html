(Yes... I\u0027m one of those wayyy-back-when podcasters!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt first the show was created because I was teaching Human Relation Skills in college to healthcare students, and kept running out of time to cover all the communication topics I wanted to, so decided that there was \u003cstrong\u003ea need for GREAT communication in the world.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I set out to help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat ended up being a ton of fun and lots of people have been enjoying it and people STILL go all the way back to episode 1 to begin with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017 starting with episode 100,\u00a0 (after taking a break from production to finish my Master\u0027s Degree and publish a book), I decided to focus down my show to career-related topics and so added the tag-line: \u003cstrong\u003eget the job. love your work. advance your career.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, I am no longer teaching college, (which I did for 23 years! My last position that I had been in for 9 years went through a departmental downsize and half of us were laid off), I have turned to making Communication Diva my focus half of my working time and I am a church minister in a tiny (and I mean tiny...40 people tops, and about half that on any given Sunday) congregation.) I love being a minister too...my peeps there are amazing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I started this page is to firstly recover the costs that producing a weekly podcast incurs, then to upgrade/add to my podcasting equipment, and to allow me to focus my time making stellar content, rather than trying to figure out how to replace my lost teaching income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSOOOOO....\u003cbr\u003eIf you have \u003cstrong\u003eenjoyed this show \u003c/strong\u003efor a long time, or have just discovered it, please consider becoming a Patron at one of the Tiers listed here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am truly grateful to \u003cstrong\u003eALL\u003c/strong\u003e my listeners, and hey...thanks for reading this very long intro all the way to the end...you rock!\u003cbr\u003e~ Jenn\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS...here is the link to my entire \u003ca href=\"http://communicationdiva.libsyn.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epodcast show\u003c/a\u003e list over at Libsyn, where you can see the scope of the content...always free! \u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "The \"Diva\" part of Communication Diva is a little sassy and tongue-in-cheek because I don\u0027t think one can truly be a \"diva\" of communication...it\u0027s a practice, not an expertise. I wear many hats, and after years of working in healthcare and more than two decades of teaching college, I have turned to focus half of my working time on producing content at Communication Diva that will help others succeed. (I am a church minister and serve half-time in a tiny but big-hearted community.) Scott and I have four beautiful children between us and we spend any free time we have cooking dinners for friends and family, reading and watching documentaries on Netflix, going to concerts and theatre productions that our kids are in, recycling everything we can (yes, we have been accused of being rabid hipsters) and battling the endless onslaught of weeds in our veggie garden out back. It\u0027s a full life! \u003cbr\u003e",
