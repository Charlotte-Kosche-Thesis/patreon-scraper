    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHello all! Thanks for checking out our Patreon page. Castwave Studios has been together now for about 5 years, producing everything from podcasts, webcasts, Let\u0027s Plays, a modern old-timey radio play (one time!) and so much more. \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can imagine, running a website to handle this can be a bit much. Beyond all the various hosting fees, we also have equipment that requires repairs or needs replacing. We want to keep all this going, while adding new features and projects for the entire community!\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWe\nstrive and make it our above all goal to enrich the local communities with\nquality entertainment and advertising through the means of film, podcasts, and\nother web-based outreach.\u00a0Now,\nwe have multiple shows covering a wide variety of topics. We cover topics from\nfilm, gaming, comic books, as well as the cultures that surround them. We\u2019re\nalso considering upcoming shows covering topics like music, anime, and even\ncuisine (maybe)! The reason for these new shows is to appeal to, as well as inform our\naudience.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eCastwave Studios is also a creator of films and an\noutlet for artists as well. We take considerable satisfaction in being a host\nfor local films as well as other art\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e A short film, podcast or documentary can\ndeliver your message to the millions upon millions on the web. A picture\u0027s worth a thousand words, but imagine the value that a multi-media platform could bring your message.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith these donations, you would not only help us create a better product, but also help us do more. If our goals are reached, we will hold true to a few pledges made here and now:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.) All podcast/webcast content created by Castwave Studios, will be free to download or view via streaming services.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2.) We will always listen to our fanbase. If you have a suggestion or an idea for a show, send it in and we will either produce it or host it via our website \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(within the bounds of good taste)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3.) The funds received from this Patreon are only being used to either repair broken equipment, purchase a suitable replacement, or to create new material."
