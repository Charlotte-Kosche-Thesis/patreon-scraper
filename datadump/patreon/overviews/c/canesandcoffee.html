Basic stuff like web hosting, tech support, occasional graphic design and other costs directly related to hosting and managing a web site add up quickly. Then there are modest costs to buy lunch or coffee for the small team of writers and other professionals who are not compensated financially at this time. Finally, there is always a short list of cool things we would like to do and features that we would like to add to the site, but none of those endeavors are free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are committed to continuing to trade (sometimes too much) sleep for the Canes and Coffee and our hockey community. We would greatly appreciate your generosity \"buying us a monthly cup of coffee\" to help with the financial part of the site and also make it possible to add new features over time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEspecially with summer coming and more time to work on bigger projects, please consider contributing to the growth of our hockey community at Canes and Coffee."
