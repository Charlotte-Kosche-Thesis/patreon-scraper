    "summary": "Hello, friends, foes, and future persons in either category! \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Ceillie Simkiss, a small town journalist who can\u0027t seem to keep her head out of the fictional clouds. I mostly write contemporary novellas and novels that are great for teens and adults, with a hefty dose of queer characters and characters of color. I love to write happy endings for complicated people.\u003cbr\u003eI also love to write about current pop culture stuff on Twitter, on my blog, and on Culturess.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Why are you on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to share my writing with people who want it, and I want to be able to afford to make space to do it.\u003cbr\u003eAs you might guess, being a reporter isn\u2019t ever going to make me a rich woman, and it doesn\u2019t leave me a whole lot of time to work on things that aren\u2019t going to make any money or be shared for a while. With your support, I can afford to make time for my own writing, which means I can share more with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What can I expect to see here? Why should I support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, since I blog constantly, you can expect to see my blog posts here - but earlier than anyone else! They\u0027ll be up here as soon as I finish them, and then on the blog after that.\u003cbr\u003eI blog about books of all varieties, but mostly diverse in some way. I rate them with adorable fox emoji instead of stars, which you can read about \u003ca href=\"http://candidceillie.com/ch-ch-changes-and-foxes/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e! I also interview authors and characters of your next favorite books!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will also get to see snippets of whatever I\u0027m working on fiction-wise.\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, I\u0027m working on a novel that is a Southern as shit story about a botanist who loses her job and has to move back home with her dad. While there, she gets to be very good friends with a ghost, and figures out exactly who she is and what she wants, by going back to her roots. It\u0027s titled FantasyThingTM right now - Catchy, I know. I\u0027m also working on revisions of an also-untitled novella that I finished earlier this year. You\u0027ll get to see some snippets of both! You can see small snippets and aesthetics in my twitter thread\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets\u0026amp;vertical=default\u0026amp;q=%23fantasythingtm\u0026amp;src=typd\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou can also sign up for a weekly post of encouraging things \u0026amp; things that I\u0027ve enjoyed on the internet this week."
