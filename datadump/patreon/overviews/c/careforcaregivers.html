    "summary": "Let me introduce myself - My name is Michelle, and I am the founder of Happy Girl Cosmetics and Pause Beauty Boutique, both based in Toronto, Canada. I have been a makeup artist for over 18 years, and a spa owner since 2013. As a makeup artist, I have never taken myself too seriously - I am not one to follow the latest trends or obsess over celebrity gossip. I am most interested in helping people discover how much fun they can have with makeup and how to use it as a tool to make them \u003cem\u003efeel\u003c/em\u003e beautiful - because I truly believe that beauty is a \u003cem\u003efeeling, \u003c/em\u003enot a characteristic.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was that mindset that led me to launch the Care for Caregivers program at Ronald McDonald House Toronto back in 2014. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA high school friend of mine had a baby who was critically ill, which meant that she had to be hospitalized for almost the first year of her life. Thankfully, my friend could lean on the folks at Ronald McDonald House for housing and support during this trying time. I would visit her as often as I could, and I would sometimes bring tools to do her nails or clean up her eyebrows - anything to give her some sense of self-care. Being a new mom is tough, but being a new mom to a critically ill child is even tougher - I know this from experience. In 2007 my own daughter was born with a blood disorder that required regular hospital visits, many blood transfusions, and multiple surgeries in the first two years of her life. And when your life is turned upside down like that, the LAST thing you think about is taking time for yourself - but that\u0027s often just what you need.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter visiting my friend a couple of times, I had the idea to inquire about regularly volunteering my services at Ronald McDonald House, and the folks there loved the idea. And so, Manicure Mondays was born: one Monday a month, I visited the house to offer free manicures to the parents and caregivers who are staying there while their children are receiving treatment for critical, and sometimes terminal, illness. (read more about the program here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.rmhctoronto.ca/Our-Stories/spa.aspx\"\u003ehttp://www.rmhctoronto.ca/Our-Stories/spa.aspx\u003c/a\u003e )\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe program has been a massive success, and in January 2017 I increased my visits to once a week, with a plan to increase to at least 3 days a week by the end of 2017. I have moved from a table in the family lounge to my own room, which allowed me to add services like scalp massages, foot treatments, and eyebrow threading. I have funded this part of the expansion with a successful crowdfunding campaign, but in order to continue to grow, add more services, and increase my volunteer hours I need a sustainable funding model....And THIS is where I need your help....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e100% of the profit I make from Happy Girl makeup sales will go back into the Care for Caregivers program, but not everyone who wants to support the program wants to buy makeup... a friend suggested I set up a Patreon account to allow people to contribute to the program in their own way, so here we are...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will do my best to update this page as much as I can and allow you a look at just how much your contribution affects these very deserving caregivers. No amount is too small - thank you for visiting and I hope you consider becoming a Patron of Care for Caregivers!\u003cbr\u003e"
