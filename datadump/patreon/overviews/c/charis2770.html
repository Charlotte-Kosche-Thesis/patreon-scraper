    "summary": "I started writing my blogs and fanfictions several years ago because I consider the work a calling. That sounds kind of funny, doesn\u0027t it? I mean, all of my fanfiction is essentially porn, and there\u0027s plenty of it on the blogs as well. But I\u0027ve lost track of the number of messages I\u0027ve gotten now thanking me...whether it\u0027s for letting someone know that they\u0027re not alone out there in their freaky needs and desires, or in teaching someone a better and safer way to do something that could be dangerous if they didn\u0027t have access to the right kind of information, for de-mystifying BDSM, for being there...the list goes on. Safe, sane and consensual kink are bywords you hear more and more, and I\u0027m so pleased this is true, but even so, I\u0027ve seen some pretty dangerous stuff espoused under those terms, so it\u0027s going to continue to be my mission to educate and inform people AS WELL AS to entertain, titillate and make them smile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never really thought about being able to earn money this way, and I\u0027m going to try really hard to say this without coming off sounding whiny. Those of you who follow me know a little about my situation anyway. I\u0027ve been a single mom for going on 15 years now, having managed to escape an abusive marriage that yes, did include BDSM, and it hasn\u0027t been easy. I\u0027m disabled, and haven\u0027t been able to work for several years. There are people who love me who work really hard to help take care of me, and the thought of being a burden to them is one I don\u0027t care for much. At all. So when some followers suggested this to me as a way for them to show their support, I figured I\u0027d give it a try. I\u0027m not going to stop writing no matter what. If there are a few of you out there who think it\u0027s worth donating to, you\u0027ll have my undying gratitude, plus whatever other rewards I can think of to go along with your contributions!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough this page is set up for monthly contributions, any single donations are, of course, welcome, and I am also very open to accepting commissions if you\u0027re interested in having a story written on your behalf. Please feel free to contact me about that if you\u0027re so inclined.\u00a0"
