Most of my publications are short stories, but my second novel, \u003cem\u003eHearts of Tabat\u003c/em\u003e, appears this May from Wordfire Press. It\u0027s the second volume of a fantasy quartet and I\u0027m currently outlining the third book, \u003cem\u003eExiles of Tabat\u003c/em\u003e, as well as working on a YA space opera. Expect plenty of snippets and teasers from work in progress; but I\u0027ll also post some early drafts of stories that are going out in submission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also used to edit \u003cem\u003eFantasy Magazine\u003c/em\u003e, and in 2014 guest-edited \u003cem\u003eLightspeed Magazine\u003c/em\u003e\u0027s Women Destroying Fantasy issue. If you were a fan of \u003cem\u003eFantasy Magazine\u003c/em\u003e under my editorship or enjoyed \u003cem\u003eWomen Destroy Fantasy,\u003c/em\u003e I\u0027m taking advantage of the Patreon milestone as well to set a challenge for all the people who keep telling me they want to see me at the helm of a magazine again. Help me hit the $2500 mark and I\u0027ll be able to afford to start buying fiction from other people and putting together a publication known for excellence, experimentation, and diversity. If you\u0027re one of the people who come up to me at conventions and wistfully express how much they loved my rejection slips, well then... it\u0027s within your power to make it happen by donating and/or spreading the word.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis campaign arose as an experiment to use up the backlog of short stories I\u0027d accumulated and see what works better: traditional publishing or this model. Stories include urban fantasy, sword and sorcery, near and far SF, secondary-world fantasy, the occasional piece of lit fic, and who knows what else. Since starting this mid 2014, I\u0027ve been reasonably satisfied with the results, particularly given that I write a lot of short stories.\u003cbr\u003e"
