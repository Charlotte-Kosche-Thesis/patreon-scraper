    "summary": "Hi, my name is Stephen Findeisen and I\u0027m the creator of Coffee Break.\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 What a rush this past year has been, I\u0027ve been creating content for a while, but in February of 2017 when I decided to start making content about advertising, media, and other random ideas I had no idea what a wonderful world I\u0027d be diving into.\u00a0 Now, 20+ videos later, I have learned a million different lessons, met thoughtful people, and overall, fallen in love with this community that you have helped create. \u003cbr\u003eThe reason I\u0027m making this Patreon is because one of the many lessons I\u0027ve learned is that, making good, well-researched content takes time. Like, a lot of time. On average, a Coffee Break will take anywhere from 40-60 hours of thought, research, writing, editing and recording. So, while these videos are free to watch, they aren\u0027t free to make. Rent, food, mics, editing tools, licensing, ALL cost money. So this Patreon is just a way for you, if you want, to increase the number of videos I make per month as well as support me.\u00a0 There are two tiers of support and two goals I have.\u003cbr\u003eThis is explained more in the video, but basically the tiers are \u003cbr\u003e$1/month (unlimited) - Proletariat\u003cbr\u003e$5/month (250 slots) - Bourgeoisie\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy goals\u003cbr\u003e$150/month -\u00a0 \u00a0 Coffee needs are met\u003cbr\u003e$3,000/month - Coffee Break goes full time\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerks:\u003cbr\u003eDiscord and Reddit titles to lord over you fellow man/woman.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAccess to Patreon only videos. - not sure what this means yet, I want to do some AMA\u0027s or maybe do some google hangouts, as well as making some proletariat/bourgeoisie specific videos.\u003cbr\u003e"
