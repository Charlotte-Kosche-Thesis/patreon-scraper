I\u0027d eventually love to broaden the content on my channel in the future but we\u0027ll touch on that in just a bit.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eAbout my channel (CherryEpidemic)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI uploaded my very first let\u0027s play to my channel back in 2014. Back then I was really struggling with confidence and finding my \"voice\". My whole setup was borrowed -from the microphone I used down to the PC- due to the fact that I didn\u0027t have a capable setup of my own. The quality wasn\u0027t very good and I was constantly doubting myself and yet... I still ended up getting excited about working on my channel. Even on days where I\u0027d screw up during editing or my videos didn\u0027t get a lot of views, there was something so fulfilling about starting a task and powering through it until it was completed. For a person who has always struggled with motivation, it brought a sense of accomplishment that I think I was really missing out on.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eMy channel has made baby-steps towards improving from those earlier days. Once it was clear to me that I wanted to continue making videos, the next step was to upgrade my setup. After a lot of saving up I was able to buy myself a better microphone, followed by my own PC. I picked up a few more things here and there about editing videos whenever I could. I recently invested in a decent webcam (though I\u0027ll be honest, my ability to speak on camera is still pretty lackluster, ahaha!) and am continuing to try and learn new tricks to improve my channel. I get a lot of personal enjoyment out of \u003ci style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003emaking \u003c/i\u003evideos, but I\u0027d also like to feel confident that people get enjoyment out of \u003ci style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003ewatching \u003c/i\u003ethem as well!\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWhere to go from here?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eMy goals for the channel from here right now seem bigger than I am... but I\u0027d still like to try my hardest to make them happen. For a while now I\u0027ve been wanting to expand the type of videos I make available on my channel to go beyond just gameplay videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I could, I\u0027d like to eventually expand my content to include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn-depth commentary or discussion videos about games I enjoy (or don\u0027t enjoy!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnime/manga related videos (reviews, favorites, discussions, \u0026amp; fan theories)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCollaborative videos with friends!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWeekly or monthly Twitch streams\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHorror game/anime podcasting\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have a lot of ideas that I\u0027d love to be able to sit down and work on but unfortunately not an unlimited amount of time due to my unusual work hours.

I consider myself fortunate enough as it is for the time I already have to just make gameplay videos. But I do still have my dreams and any amount of loose change kicked my way can get me just a little bit closer to making them happen. Right now my schedule is often stretched thin between work, family, and then cramming in recording+editing as many gameplay videos as I can in between. Finding the time and energy to experiment with any other type of content is very difficult at the moment. Anything that can help lessen the load a bit and give me just that much more time to spend working on my channel would be greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWhy should you support CherryEpidemic?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eIf you love horror, anime geekery, video games, and other assorted nerd nonsense, I\u0027d be able to provide you more of that!
