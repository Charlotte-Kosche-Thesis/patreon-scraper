    "summary": "For 27 months I have made YouTube videos without generating any revenue. I did this because I enjoyed it and I thought that people would enjoy my creativity and effort with my videos. Recently, I have signed with a network and I am just starting to make money. I hardly make any at all because C-Luv Gaming is still a small channel but we are finally starting to grow! Some of my subscribers have offered to donate to me over the years and I refused them because I wanted to wait to give them something back in return for their generosity. Now I have created a way where I can give back to my subscribers and at the same time create unique content for my channel. The subscriber tower is a focal point for many of the different packages and this allows me to thank donators and show off new rooms on camera. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother way that this helps create new videos on my channel is recording hunger games with my subscribers. While I play hunger game matches, if the footage is good (I can\u0027t upload footage that I feel is boring on my channel), I will be able to create videos around these games and you in return are now in a video on my channel! Many of the packages allow you the unique opportunity to talk with me and get to know me on a more personal level. You may also have the opportunity to talk and play with my friends. No matter what package you sign up for, you will now have access to behind the scenes projects and you will know what I am doing the moment I press record. I will be able to post messages, pictures and short videos to Patreon members and get feedback from you guys before my main video is released! Feedback is very important to me and it helps me focus on the details.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t afford to donate that is alright by me! Don\u0027t stress if you cannot donate. I understand that some of my biggest fans cannot donate and I appreciate your support as much as I appreciate my Patreon members. If you are younger, make sure you talk with your parents before you make a purchase. Feel free to show your parents the Patreon video and the website so they understand what they are buying. These packages can be a great birthday or Christmas present for a friend and/or relative.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love all of you guys from the bottom of my heart and I have genuinely been humbled by the support and growth on the channel. I will remain humble no matter what success my channel brings. The goal of this Patreon page is to get to a point where I can make daily videos by upgrading my software and computer. One day, YouTube will be a full time job for me and utilizing Patreon is another stepping stone in achieving this goal. If you donate, I appreciate your kindness and I hope you enjoy the package that you sign up for. Now I need to figure out a way to close out this speech... Ah ha! I know what to say! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou guys have a beautiful, beautiful day. Deuces! :D"
