If you can become a patron that\u2019s great and I look\nforward to getting to interact with you more, but not everyone can afford to\nsupport work like this, and if that\u2019s you don\u2019t worry. I created a Patreon\nbecause I rather sell myself to my audience than sell my audience to\nadvertisers, but it\u2019s not the only way this channel sustains itself. Money from\nadvertisements is essentially nonexistent for the time being, but if you keep\nwatching and sharing these videos over time we can change that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nThank you,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nNick\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/4KK210A.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are things we are aware of not knowing, and then there are things we unaware of not knowing. Curiously makes video essays that concern themselves with the latter concept, the \"unknown unknowns.\" This means the videos cover a wide range of topics, but follow a consistent approach. An approach that always involves an open mind, curiosity, and learning cool things together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/7XLfAKy.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s just me. I research the stories, write the drafts, doodle the storyboards, sleep the nap, record the voiceover, animate the images, drink the coffee, edit the video, and pat myself the back. It\u0027s the cheapest way to do it, but it\u0027s time consuming to the point a video a month can be quite difficult. I want to put out twice that, and so I could use your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/KCKZfzI.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love this type of content and someone needs to make it. Of course there\u0027s also this sensation when some new piece of knowledge finally clicks that I\u0027m addicted to, and this is the best thing I could find to do with it. The truth is I often struggled to focus in classroom settings, and I mostly learned the things I know by finding online resources on it myself. This content means a lot to me, so I guess you could say I\u0027m doing this because it feels great to get to work on something I really believe in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NSyIro7.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe idea is to release videos every other week, but I may not always be able to do that at first. This is why\nI\u0027ve set things up so you pledge per video rather than per month. This way if for some reason I don\u0027t put something out for a whole month, then you don\u0027t get charged. I also won\u0027t be releasing more than two video essays a month, but you don\u0027t have to take my word on it as you can actually set a maximum amount for what you pledge a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/If1MHdl.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoftware subscriptions, stock footage licenses, fixing equipment, and books I often need to have imported. The first goal here is to just cover these costs so I don\u0027t lose money every time I make a video, but if there is enough interest we can do a lot more. We could upgrade the equipment and even fund original investigations, and so an overview of those budget plans and expenses will be made accessible to patrons as we move forward to ensure transparency.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/MxJXIJ8.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Super Secret Gift* is an idea I had to make the most out of the opportunity Patreon gives for audience interaction, and it involves me trying to devise a thoughtful gift specifically for you without ever letting it get creepy. However to make sure I don\u0027t lose money doing this and so that I can have enough time to come up with a cool gift these take a few months to send out, but that\u0027s in the hope that when they do the wait will have been worth it.\u003cbr\u003e"
