I\u0027m honestly a little surprised, humbled, but truly honoured :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the NotSoAncient ChineSecrets Show? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat started on Facebook Live as \"Dave Daily\" has become the NotSoAncientChineSecrets show! \u00a0 I\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://facebook.com/NotSoAncientDave\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebroadcast live weekly on Facebook here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the show about?\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started the show as a place where I can share tools, tips and advice just like I do with my closest friends and family. Through the years I\u0027ve learned to embrace my inner-Geek-people-pleaser self and, through the show, aim to add laughter, encouragement and enlightenment to your life in 3 main areas that are dear to me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003ephoto \u0026amp; video\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003efood \u0026amp; fitness and\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003efamily \u0026amp; faith\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s no denying I\u0027m both a perfectionist and a people pleaser.  I hate letting people down and have high expectations of myself and my work.  Not the best of combinations when starting a new format livestream show. Case in point: I invested every waking hour for two months of my life into creating and producing what has become the NotSoAncientChineSecrets Show. The reward of helping people fix their health problems (bad knees, back pains and diet), choose the right photo/video gear, and become a better parent and person has been deeply gratifying.  In it\u0027s short life, I\u0027m honestly amazed and LOVE what the show has done for people and see so much potential for where it can go. But sadly I\u0027ve also come to realize I can\u0027t continue to produce the shows when \"real\" work needs to be done to pay the bills.  During a recent Live show, a friend suggested creating this very Patreon page to allow people to support the making of it and continue the sharing of more NotSoAncientChineSecrets. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChineSecret Goals -\u00a0Laugh . Learn . Love\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough I don\u0027t take myself too seriously, I take my work - and this show - very seriously.  I truly want to create value in every episode and want each show to resonate in 3 ways: \u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLaugh: \u003c/strong\u003eBecause life is too short to be grumpy\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLearn:\u003c/strong\u003e as a professional photographer, media Geek, and international speaker/teacher, whether photography and film is your profession or passion (or both!), learn from my mistakes, bad purchases, research, special guests, and creative thinking\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLove:\u003c/strong\u003e creating true community and authentic engagement is something I appreciate most about the show and how the platform of Facebook Live has truly become a \"social\" media more than any other\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eWith your help I want to share more NotSoAncientChineSecrets to help your business, hobby, health, family and faith grow and develop in meaningful ways. And if there\u0027s enough like-minded NotSoAncient Patrons, I would love to produce more shows - bi-weekly?  Daily?? With more support I would also love to invite more guests - both live and remote - to dive deeper into topics that matter. And who knows? Maybe one day we\u0027ll take the show to \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e on the road or on a world tour :) \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe chineSecrets show is my biggest passion project and, with your help, I want to devote more time and effort to research, write, and produce shows worth watching that add value to your business, health and life at large.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for being here and whether or not you can contribute to the show, I promise to do my very best to make you proud :) \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eGod bless and see you in the next Show!! \u003cbr\u003e"
