    "summary": "I\u0027ve been on permanent tour since March of 2008, playing shows across North America and Europe. \u003cbr\u003eSince 2011, I\u0027ve also been running an independent music label called Obsolete Media Objects. The two really go hand in hand because one of the great privileges of being on a never-ending tour is the chance to hear so much new music from all over the world. Whenever I hear something truly unique that I think I can help get out to more ears, I release it on this label.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://obsoletemediaobjects.bandcamp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://obsoletemediaobjects.bandcamp.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eI started this Patreon account in hopes that some of my fans and supporters will make monthly pledges to this effort. This will help me be able to afford to put this new music out (much of which is not necessarily commercially successful, but nonetheless wonderful and worthy of an audience).\u00a0 This will especially help considering the hand-to-mouth, precarious existence that is life on tour, where I\u0027m always one potential van breakdown away from being financially wiped out.\u00a0 If I can get the monthly pledges up to a few hundred dollars, this will help me breathe easier, and allow me to keep putting time and money into my label, which has yet to ever turn a profit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the name might imply, Obsolete Media Objects has a focus on physical media. We\u0027re released 1 vinyl record, a handful of CDs, a mess of tapes, and the occasional release that doesn\u0027t quite fit into any of those categories.\u00a0 I\u0027ve always been committed to making the most gorgeous media objects possible, which can be pricey at times.\u00a0 I hope this campaign will help me take it a notch higher and put out more vinyl LPs, which I simply don\u0027t have the money to release at present. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides presenting a high caliber of music and visual art, I also want OMO to have a social consciousness that finds ways to effect change through music.\u00a0 Some of the releases that have overt political agendas are:\u003cbr\u003eOMO003: \"Like Badgers and Birds: A Compilation to Support Wikileaks\"\u003cbr\u003eOMO055: \"Running Up That Hill: Kate Bush Covers for Reproductive Rights\" \u003cbr\u003eOMO081: \"Baltmore or less\" (Nina Simone mixtape by DJ Too Slow) benefiting Legal/Bail Support for Baltimore protesters\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach of these releases was a fundraising tool for a causes I believed in.\u00a0 I\u0027d love to do more of these, and having a steady stream of pledges would help that considerably.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e  Of course, not every release will have a specific political or social purpose.\u00a0 The main purpose of the label is simply to share extraordinary music with my broader community of friends and listeners, which I think is a social good regardless of anyone\u0027s politics.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "I play around 200 shows per year, and most of them pay just enough to get to the next town.\u00a0 As a consequence, I tend not to be able to fix my van unless it is absolutely broken down.\u00a0 Preventative repairs, which are often less costly than waiting until a breakdown, are often just not an option.\u00a0 For instance, at the moment, my blinkers are intermittent. I\u0027d say they work about 60% of the time, which means I often decide not to merge or turn where I wanted to, for fear of causing an accident.\u00a0 I know what is wrong with the blinkers, but that repair is not one I have the money for now, so it has been on the long list of \"optional\" repairs (i.e ones that can put off without missing any shows) since January). If you\u0027re thinking, \"That\u0027s ridiculous. You need blinkers if you\u0027re going to drive thousands of miles every week.\", yes, I musi agree with you. Hence the Patreon.\u00a0 There are always things like this. Driving like I do, there will always be maintenance and repairs that need to be done, but that are not possible with my normal income from shows and selling records.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "Playing most nights of the week, and driving between cities most days, I rarely have time for composition.\u00a0 As a result, most of my shows feature songs I\u0027ve written some time ago, interwoven with improvisation.\u00a0 I love improvising and playing old songs, but with some more financial help, I would have time to write new music, some of which I\u0027d like to be for ensembles rather than solo.\u00a0 At the moment, I have been dreaming about writing an oratorio based on the Gulabi Gang, the group of Indian women who enact revenge on rapists and domestic abusers, beating them with bamboo sticks and whatever they can find.\u00a0 Ideally, that would be written for a choir with soloists, all of which would take a lot of time to compose, rehearse, and organize. That\u0027s just one thing I\u0027ve been putting off until I have the money to do it, but there are always projects like this. Probably before that, I have designs to write a piece that uses text from the personal account of a woman who has to travel to another state for an abortion.\u00a0 The story moved me intensely, and I want to set it to music. I have some ideas, and I\u0027ve found the perfect singer to do do the vocals, but I have yet to have the time to really work on it, or the money to pay for studio time to record it once it\u0027s finished. Your contributions could help that quite a bit. \u003cbr\u003e",

But so often the need to survive takes away from whatever time we would like to spend improving our society in general.\u00a0 Here are three activities I would like to enact as I can lift the burden of getting by:\u003cbr\u003e1. I\u0027d like to volunteer as an escort at abortion clinics as I travel \naround, offering a shield between patients and the hateful mobs that \nseek to make their decisions harder than they already are. \u003cbr\u003e2. I\u0027d \nlike to join the small but determined movement of men fighting against \nrape culture. There are already two very powerful organizations (Jackson\n Katz\u0027s \"Mentors in Violence Provention\" and Neil Irvin\u0027s \"Men Can Stop \nRape\"), to which I\u0027d like to pledge a substantial amount of my time and energy as as I tour \nthe US.  \u003cbr\u003e3. As we see a growing consciousness about the out of \ncontrol police violence all over the US, I want to join the folks \nfighting against it.  This fight is multifaceted. I have just released a mixtape that serves as a fundraiser for the bail of protesters arrested while \nexercising their first amendment rights in Baltimore.  I want to be physically \npresent at every major protest and event that I can (given the \nrestraints of the space-time continuum of course).  I want to continue \nto raise awareness about this on social media, and get more of the \nartistic community involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis list is just the tip of the iceberg.\u00a0 There are a thousand ways to fight against institutional violence, bigotry, and oppression, and I want to dedicate the work of the label to keeping these important fights in mind as I release new music. \u003cbr\u003e",
