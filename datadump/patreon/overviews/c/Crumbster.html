    "summary": "Hello, welcome to my Patreon page. My name is Nate, aka Crumbster! Because of VR Chat, and the people that I met, my life has changed for nothing but the better. I love this community from the bottom of my heart, it has become the light at the end of the tunnel. But, I feel like I should give you the full story of why I\u0027m making this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese past couples of months have been the best, yet the worst time of my life. About a month or two ago, financial\u00a0issues started to rise in the family. Past medical bills, living expenses, car notes, mortgages, a broken washer, a broken furnace, a broken dishwasher, and a 1-year-old little brother named Lorenzo. We have had no heat for almost two months, I had to spend my last bit of money on portable heaters upstairs so my little brother could have some heating.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy father has been working 7 days a week for 3 months, he\u0027s exhausted. My mother is working as hard as she can, at home and at work, just so that we can continue to live here. It makes me feel awful because I have no way to help. I had to drop out of school because my mother didn\u0027t want me going to Detroit schools, and we couldn\u0027t afford private or online schooling.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was recently informed that if this keeps going on at this pace, I\u0027ll have to move back to where I used to live in Detroit or live out on the street, and I don\u0027t blame them. But, before anything like that happens, I have one more thing I can try to do. That thing being the thing that I enjoy the most. Making content for you guys!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe VR Chat community became something I could immerse myself in, something to get my mind off of the problems at hand. The people I met became some sort of a saving grace, helping me socially and emotionally. The support I\u0027ve gotten from other content creators and the community on its own has really touched my heart.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading, and always remember that no matter if you pledge or not, just your support keeps me going.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love all of you- Crumbster\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
