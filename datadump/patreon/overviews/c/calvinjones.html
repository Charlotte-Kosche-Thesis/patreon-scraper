    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHow are these Psalms different?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you think of singing Psalms, do you think of getting a root canal or shoveling the sidewalk? Is singing Psalms something you might do at church if forced at gunpoint? Does Psalm-singing conjure up in your mind a bunch of old people who might just get hauled off to the grave after church...if they make it that far?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr is singing and listening to Psalms a highlight of your day? What if you had compelling Psalms you wanted to hear or sing available in your daily life: in your car, at work, during your exercise routine, at home by yourself or with family, in life\u0027s battles and more? What if the Psalms could be more relevant, stirring and addictive than the latest Adelle song?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGod gave us the words of the Psalms but he didn\u0027t give us any music.   In every age and every culture, men of God need to put the word of God into the common language of the people.   So also men of God need to put the Psalms of God into the common musical language of the people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI and my team (consisting of both Ukrainian and American talent)\u00a0are creating \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Addictive Psalms for the World\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. \u00a0 The early church down through the centuries sang these Psalms but in modern times they\u0027ve gone out of vogue. \u00a0 Instead, songs of abstract attributes of God written by men or repetitious cliche\u0027s fill the worship of congregations. \u00a0 The Psalms are the songs revealed by God that he has commanded us to sing to Him. \u00a0 They are the attributes of God applied to our everyday lives as we launch attacks against the gates of hell in the spiritual and physical warfare of the kingdom. \u00a0 They are the promises that only God can write and grant to His people and are thus the comfort and hope of salvation, deliverance, prosperity and victory for God\u0027s people today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Psalms unify.   Think about it.   Lots of music has been created to be used in worshiping God by men of many persuasions, but the Psalms were created by God to be sung by men of \u003cstrong\u003eall \u003c/strong\u003epersuasions. \u00a0 Their truth and relevancy for God\u0027s people today is obvious from God\u0027s command to His people in the New Testament to sing them \u003cstrong\u003ewith \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ethanksgiving\u003c/strong\u003e in their heart to God. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Let Christ richly dwell within you, with all wisdom teaching and admonishing\u00a0one another with psalms and hymns and\u00a0spiritual songs, singing\u00a0with thankfulness in your hearts to God\" (Colossians 3:16).\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ebut be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father...\" (Ephesians 5:18-19)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently we are creating new 4 part arrangements from the inspired Psalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs book of the Bible. \u00a0 These arrangements will be \u003cstrong\u003ecopyright free \u003c/strong\u003eso you can make as many copies for yourself, your family and your congregation including copies for family worship, copies for friends, copies for everyone you meet! \u00a0 We want these to go far and wide without ridiculous copyrights on God\u0027s Word. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve seen how simply replacing an older tune with a more contemporary one will allow the words of the Psalm to leap into our minds making it far easier to memorize and meditate on God\u0027s promises as we worship Him in praise. \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDual Purpose - Sunday and everyday\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we are creating songs that can both be sung by a lead vocal (i.e. YOU in the shower or driving in your car or walking down the grocery aisle) and at the same time are arranged for 4 part harmony so that you can sing them with your family or the entire congregation. \u00a0 \u00a0These are \u003cstrong\u003ecompelling \u003c/strong\u003emelodies that are \u003cstrong\u003ememorable and inspiring\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0 Our Psalms are equally at home in Sunday worship and driving tractor Monday morning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course we hope that many different folks in different congregations will join in this endeavor. \u00a0 In addition to the pdf that is freely distributable we will offer a finished audio track in .mp3 and .wav format so that you can sing along and quickly learn the Psalm. \u00a0 Further we will provide an instrumentation track with no vocal that you can use in your worship at home, in corporate worship or in the car or anywhere. \u00a0 They can also be sung with simply the piano accompaniment. \u00a0 No other worship music including most praise and worship is this versatile.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how does this work for you the patron? \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 We will aim for 1 new Psalm per month, with 2 being the maximum. \u00a0 Each patron pays for each completed work, NOT per month. \u00a0 On average expect to be a patron for 1 new work per month. \u00a0 So whatever level you sign up for, understand it is payment per completed Psalm. \u00a0 We will distribute upcoming Psalms whenever they are completed and ready for distribution to you at which time you will be charged your patronage level and you will receive your reward for which you signed up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently Psalm 6 is ready for download and printing (\u003cstrong\u003eyou can listen to Psalm 6 on the video above\u003c/strong\u003e). \u00a0 When we have a total of $1000 of patrons it will be released for download. \u00a0 Help us spread the word!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe rewards are based upon copyright free, royalty free music. \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e Think about this for a second. \u00a0 When a congregation signs up for the SILVER LEVEL and has 50 members, this means it is paying $1/person for the Psalm which is less than purchasing new music on Itunes. \u00a0 But you also get the 4 part sheet music which is worth another $5 per download, plus the instrumental version for personal and congregational accompaniment. \u00a0 But then every member is free and encouraged to share this with other friends, family and people across the planet. \u00a0 That is great! \u00a0 We want these to go far and wide! \u00a0 At the same time unless someone else helps and becomes a patron, we don\u0027t collect another cent off of this. \u00a0 Now if you\u0027re smart you are thinking, wow, just one person needs to sign up and then share this infinitely with the world. \u00a0 True, except that unless that patron is at the PLATINUM LEVEL (like a denominational patron), there won\u0027t be anything to share because we can\u0027t afford to give you anything! \u00a0 We believe in both the free distribution of God\u0027s word and in the principle that the worker is worthy of his wages. \u00a0 This plan combines both of these. \u00a0 We hope you will tell all your friends and pray that 100\u0027s of churches will return to the singing of God\u0027s word in the Psalms. \u00a0 If we get to higher levels say at the $3000 and $5000 level we can engage others to help in more languages and even do some accompaniments with live orchestra sessions. \u00a0 Why not? \u00a0 Why not make the Psalms the best music on the planet? \u00a0 Consider how much combining awesome music with the best content on planet earth, is worth? \u00a0 This may be the \u003cstrong\u003ebest music value\u003c/strong\u003e in our world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDid you know there is no complete Psalm book for singing for Russian speaking people?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are creating these Psalms for both English and Russian speakers at present but may add more languages in time. \u00a0 With your help we can provide Russian speakers with really cool inspiring Psalms and at the same time provide our English speaking friends with these same awesome melodies. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e But it won\u0027t happen without your support and help!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "The labor involved begins with selection of a Psalm, Hymn or Spiritual Song. \u00a0After which many hours are put into creating a melody that is inspiring, singable and fits the words of the Psalm. \u00a0Then the 3 harmonies need to be created. \u00a0 Next, work is done at creating a new version of lyrics if needed or selecting preexisting lyrics that closely match each phrase of the Biblical text. \u00a0 Concurrently, the Psalm is given Russian lyrics as well. \u00a0 This usually takes 1-2 weeks to get to this point. \u00a0 Next we arrange and produce the instrumentation. \u00a0 We then add both Russian and English vocals. \u00a0 Finally we mix down the Psalm in the instruments only and lead vocal version, as well as provide you with a 4 part notated song in pdf format. This is a lot of work and we pay those who help us. We easily have $1000 worth of man hours, artist and studio costs in each finished Psalm so this is how we\u0027ve arrived at our minimum level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first Psalm (Psalm 6 - see video for this Psalm that is ready now) will be distributed to all new patrons when we have met our minimum level of $1000.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we are at our minimum level we will launch more and more Psalms as we are able (usually 1 per month on average). \u00a0 All patrons will receive the finished arrangement \u00a0in 4 part harmony and, depending on the funding level chosen by the patron, will include a lead vocal with finished arrangement as well as a karaoke arrangement without the vocal so YOU can sing them everywhere you go!",
