In the publishing market, if you get paid for opinion pieces (you don\u0027t always), the publisher\u0027s offer can run anywhere from $25 to over $200, depending on relevancy, quality, your experience, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will be very nice to receive any amount for work that I can\u0027t otherwise publish, and you will have my heartfelt thanks. Reaching the goal of $25 per essay will help pay for the coffee and cigarettes I go through writing an essay.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, if this is successful, I may plan some future projects to devote your tips towards.",
