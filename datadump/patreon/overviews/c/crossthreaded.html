It helps us buy tools to use on the car as well as parts to replace the ones we broke by using proper tools incorrectly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d love to be able to use better cameras and recording equipment to get closer to the production value of a real show. As we refine our process, we\u0027ll start to look at longer episodes, then more frequent episodes, and finally, a feature length \"special\" where Jim tries to eat a Volkswagen Thing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust kidding. You can\u0027t eat a Volkswagen Thing. You\u0027d eat a Rabbit, obviously.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
