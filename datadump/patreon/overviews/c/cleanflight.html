    "summary": "Cleanflight is about creating awesome, FREE, flight-stabilization software which is used primarily for FPV Drone Racing and Acrobatic Drone/Quadcopter flying.\u00a0 It also supports model airplanes/fixed-wing and other model types too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can get Cleanflight and read more about it here:\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/cleanflight/cleanflight/blob/master/README.md\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://github.com/cleanflight/cleanflight\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the primary goals of Cleanflight is not just to make awesome free software, but also to make maintainable, easy to understand and work on code to encourage other developers and the community to contribute to the project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of community involvement has largely been achieved, as the 1250+ forks on Github shows, but now the sheer size of the community and it\u0027s popularity is a source of troubles, everyone wants everything and they all want it better, faster and yesterday!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to keep up with the pace of development demanded by the community we rely on equipment and donations from the users of the software.\u00a0 We also need a place where those in the industry that supply Cleanflight on their products have a way of giving back to the project so that more time can be spent writing code and supporting the users.\u00a0 Without donations we can\u0027t afford to spend as much time working on it as we\u0027d like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the world we live in free software still has costs, primarily in developer time, but also in other areas such as computers, batteries, props, frames, motors, ESCs, nuts, bolts and other kit required in order to test the software, we also have to pay bills for internet hosting, electricity and such like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy creating this page we hope that you will consider helping out the project - ask yourself this: \u00a0Are you happy that someone out there was able to design build and manufacture all your FPV and RC Model gear for you? Are you happy that with your purchase they can continue to design build and manufacture even more cool, new and better stuff for you?\u00a0 And then ask yourself if you think it would be nice to give something back to the developers that created the software that makes flying it even possible?\u00a0 After-all, without that software your shiny new race quad would be a lifeless hunk of carbon-fiber, plastic and metal, unable to bring you the joy we know it does!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
