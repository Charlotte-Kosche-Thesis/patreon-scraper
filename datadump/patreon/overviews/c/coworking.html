Once people were free to work anywhere, they largely decided to start working together.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the years, people who rallied around the coworking movement developed free, open source platforms to share their knowledge and discuss their ideas. Decentralized and managed by volunteers, these resources have helped to make coworking a household name.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, however, as the movement matures, more work must be done to help maintain and improve the incredible culture that makes coworking so special.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo that end, Open Coworking, was established as a nonprofit specifically to ensure these resources are preserved and continually improved.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(36, 64, 97);\"\u003eWHAT WE MANAGE\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eWe oversee the ongoing maintenance of the following core resources:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://coworking.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCoworking.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://blog.coworking.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCoworking Blog\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/coworking\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCoworking Google Group\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://coworking-leadership-slackin.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCoworking Slack Channel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://wiki.coworking.org/w/page/16583744/CoworkingVisa\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCoworking Visa\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://wiki.coworking.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCoworking Wiki\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nCollectively, these resources are visited by thousands of people every month, from all over the world.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(36, 64, 97);\"\u003eWHAT WE\u0027VE DONE\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition to developing the core infrastructure for ensuring these resources stay online and secure in the years to come, we\u0027ve also:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eRedesigned coworking.com to be a proper landing page for the movement\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eCleaned up the Coworking Wiki to make it more usable\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eRedesigned and reengineered the Coworking Blog, so it can be a better content platform for our future efforts\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eDeveloped an iconic starfish logo to symbolize coworking, for anyone to share\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eBuilt a site for our own organization, so more people can know who\u0027s behind these efforts and how to get involved\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eRaised over $5,600 in annual support from generous supporters\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(36, 64, 97);\"\u003eWHAT WE\u0027LL DO NEXT\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your support, we\u0027ll tackle the following and more:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e1.
