     "about": "Hello everyone! Nice to meet you. My name is Shawn Ray and I am an amatuer 4Dan Go player. I have been playing Go since Dec 2006 and I started teaching players weaker than me shortly after that. I originally became a teacher because so many people helped me out in the past that I felt I should give back to the Go community. I decided that since I\u0027ll never be a top professional player, I should do what I can to help other players achieve what I couldn\u0027t, thus why I became a Kyu player instructor. I have studied under many teachers, Jennie Shen 2p, Dsaun on KGS, Shygost on KGS, and many others. I also studied at BIBA (Blackie\u0027s International Baduk Academy) in Korea for 6 months. Throughout all of my lessons, I tried to take from them as many basics as I could and then tried to find a way that I could teach what I learned to other players. Throughout the years I have been playing, I have come up with many strategies and a list of basics to teach Kyu players to help them correct their mistakes and get closer to Dan level. I hope many people can learn from my lessons and hopefully one day, I will have helped someone become a Professional Go player!",
