I am Changer, lead developer of the game Adventure High, an artist and writer. I am running this campaign so that I can continue to provide frequent game updates, art, and short stories for everyone to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a sort of happy compromise between my mortal need for food, and my desire to not put my content behind a pay wall. This is a \u003cstrong\u003eper-post\u003c/strong\u003e campaign, which means that you only get charged when stuff is actually made. You can also set a cap on how much you pay per month as well, so you can be sure you won\u0027t pay more than you are comfortable with, even during highly productive months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdventure High\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://kek.gg/i/5XKQJX.png\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdventure High takes place in a world where the sudden introduction of magic and monsters have made travel and infrastructure difficult to maintain. The school stands at the center of your town, inviting all who might sign up to learn how to master their magical gifts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main character has the gift of control, which gives them potent support and debilitating spells. Will you choose to follow the path of a pure and righteous hero, allow yourself a little temptation, or use your power to conquer the school?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe themes of temptation and choice will be prevalent within the game. You will have the opportunity to talk to, and build relationships with a variety of unique characters; or use your powers selfishly instead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaid posts related to the game will include actual game updates, and full screen splash images. Smaller items such as icons, avatars, and backgrounds will not count as paid posts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work together with a couple other artists to make Adventure High better than I could on my own.

In it, you play as a would-be conqueror who has just suffered a crippling defeat at the hands of some of the world\u0027s heroes. At the last minute, however, a foolish Psychic looking to jump start her own career as an evil overlord attempts to steal your knowledge, resulting in you possessing her body.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, the two of you will have to work together to build an empire, restore your body\u0027s health, and create a harem out of the world\u0027s leaders and heroes. The game plays as a resource management game, with a puzzle aspect where you can adjust your captive\u0027s attitudes before allowing them to join your army.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaid posts related to Conquest will include full version releases, and full screen splash images; they will not include smaller graphics such as interface icons, avatars, or backgrounds. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArtwork\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://hypnohub.net//data/sample/80e9c782575bb6f475fd77dcc8c730f6.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do a fair bit of drawing, and have been working on getting better constantly. I\u0027ve made quite a bit of improvement over the last couple years and am hoping to continue to improve as I go. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons get two artwork bonuses. The first is that every patron at the one dollar or higher level will have access to high resolution versions of my art. Usually these are about twice the size that I usually publish my art. The second is that patrons donating at certain levels will have access to special patron slots. Just send me a message here with your request and I can add you to the slot if it\u0027s open or to the queue if it\u0027s not. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaid posts related to my artwork will be fully drawn, and colored pieces. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWriting\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou may have noticed that from time to time I include a short story on the side or under some of my drawings. These are often fairly short due to space limitations of being included on a picture. I do have story ideas that are too large to fit into the side of a picture though. Instead of just keeping them to myself, I\u0027ve decided to start writing them out as short stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will release these stories here a week before anywhere else, so If you find that you enjoy my writing, not only will your pledge get you my stories sooner, but they again will contribute to my being able to write more frequently. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaid posts related to writing will be either independent short stories of any length, or if the post is a chapter of a larger story, usually around 2000 words. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn conclusion\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve tried to match the milestone goals along with patron rewards so that you will not only be rewarded directly for your support, but so will everyone. The more support I have, the more time I will be able to dedicate to these projects, and bringing you new content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for your support. \u003cbr\u003e"
