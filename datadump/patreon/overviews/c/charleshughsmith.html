(\u003ca href=\"http://www.oftwominds.com/CHS-books.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYou can read samples of my books here.\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve given dozens of interviews over the past few years, which you can review on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/CharlesHSmith\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e. (All my interviews work as sleep aids if you have trouble snoozing.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am keenly interested in the role self-organizing opt-in networks, automation, social innovations, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies may play in what I term \" a radically beneficial world,\" that is, the emerging system that benefits all participants rather than just the few at the top of the wealth/power pyramid. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI address a wide range of topics on the free blog, from finance and self-employment to housing to health and fitness--subjects I group under the heading \"control what you can.\" I have written 10 non-fiction books, including \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.oftwominds.com/ARBW.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eA Radically Beneficial World: Automation, Technology and Creating Jobs for All\u003c/a\u003e\" \u00a0which outlines an alternative system I call CLIME: community labor integrated money economy. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps as a result of the seriousness of the topics I address, I try to maintain a sense of humor about my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReaders ask me what does \"of two minds\" mean, and I tell them it has two meanings: one is that I am open to changing my views when presented with new knowledge, and the second is the blog is the result of two minds--mine and the collective intelligence of my global readership.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery creator deserves the support of his/her audience. There are limits on how many creators each of us can support. (It would be different if we had the wealth of the House of Medici, right?) \u00a0What I offer is boring stuff like integrated solutions to the knotty problems of earning a livelihood, software eating the world and Degrowth. If you value boring stuff like this, I would be overjoyed to be the recipient of your patronage."
