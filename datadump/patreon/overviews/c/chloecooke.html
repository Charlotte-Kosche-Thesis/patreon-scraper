Growing up in the coastal town of Barry, her family and friends have played audience to her nightly impromptu living-room performances since she was five years old. Fast forward to the current day, Chloe and her band have created an irresistible live set of power pop songs and ballads that are truly compelling and relevant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChloe is a born entertainer who began songwriting at just ten years old. Early on she reveled in writing sessions with the award-winning and internationally recognized, Chris Braide, known for his work with Kylie Minogue, James Morrison, Robbie Williams and David Guetta to name a few. Ever since, she has honed and developed her songwriting skills building up a dynamic catalogue of material. \u003cbr\u003e",
