    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u2019ve seen leftist\nmobs attack Trump supporters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou\u2019ve\nseen the police disarm and then fail to protect them.\u00a0 And you have seen those Trump supports\narrested when they defend themselves and others. \u00a0But, violence doesn\u0027t only take place at demonstrations and other places where people might expect it. \u00a0There are also terrorist attacks and mass shootings. \u00a0Violence can erupt at any public event. \u00a0It\u2019s time we have our own policy to defend\nagainst violence by a crowd, from a crowd and within a crowd.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt should be obvious\nthat the enemies of liberty have a policy to perpetrate these attacks.\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003eThat policy includes: concealing identity,\nstriking and leaving, wearing the same color of clothes, etc. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eWe also need a policy that serves our purely, legal interests of self and\ncrowd defense.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVarious groups are taking on the responsibility of defending themselves and others.\u00a0 But, this responsibility should not fall on the shoulders of only a few. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eWe\ncan do more to organize in the face of an attack so that all defenders are on the same\npage to defend effectively.\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003eEveryone can be involved in\ndefending each other and minimizing legal risk.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCrowd Defense, under\nthe leadership of defense instructor and attorney Matthew Nolan, will develop\nthis policy in cooperation with trusted military and police who have a deep\ncommitment to training civilians.\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003eThis is not \u201cmartial arts.\u201d\u00a0 It is\na strategic policy for defense that is meant for speedy implementation with\nlittle to no training.\u00a0 In the same way\nthat \u201cstop, drop, and roll\u201d became a well-known policy, Crowd Defense will also\npresent a policy that is as simple as possible.\u00a0 It will, of course, be more complex than the fire protocol we grew up with,\nbut it will be as minimal as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePriority #1: Create a Draft Policy for Immediate Release.\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003eA draft policy must be released as soon as\npossible.\u00a0 Right\nleaning speeches will continue to face leftist aggression for some time.\u00a0 We must begin organizing these ideas immediately before actual recommendations can be memorialized.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePriority #2: Refine the Policy.\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003eAfter a draft policy is in place, Crowd Defense will continually refine\nthat policy in light of ongoing legal developments and current events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePriority #3: Compile Legal Resources.\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003eVery little scholarship has been done on\nissues surrounding use of deadly force in crowd situations, crowd defense, and\nrelated topics.\u00a0 Once the policy has been\nthrough several drafts, research on the tougher legal issues will begin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePriority #4: Moving Forward.\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003eOnce the threat of violence is substantially diminished, the Crowd\nDefense protocol will change slightly toward defending against terrorism and\nmass shootings.\u00a0 Much of what you will\nalready have learned from Crowd Defense for riots will apply.\u00a0 But minor changes will be made as necessary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow do you help?\u00a0 Here is how.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can become a monthly Patreon donor.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can make a
