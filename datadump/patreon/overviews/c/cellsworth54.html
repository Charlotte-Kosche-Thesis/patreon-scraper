    "summary": "Hello! For those of you don\u0027t know me, my name is Charles Ellsworth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a musician/filmmaker from the American Southwest that recently relocated to Brooklyn, NY. \u00a0Since graduating from film school I\u2019ve released a couple of albums, toured around the country multiple times, experienced some of the highest of highs and the most depressing of lows. It\u2019s been one hell of an adventure, and I can\u0027t say I regret anything. \u00a0What I can say, is that being a musician in today\u0027s climate is tough, and making a living at it is even more difficult. \u00a0With streaming services only paying a fraction of a penny per stream, it makes turning a profit on the time and effort I put into music nearly impossible, which is why i\u0027m so glad that I found\u003cstrong\u003e Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWait, what the hell is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform that allows artists to be paid for the work they produce. It\u0027s kind of like if I were to be playing music on the street and you walked by. \u00a0If you liked what you heard, you might drop a dollar in my case as a \"thank you\" for the music. \u00a0Well in this instance the internet is the street, and my Patreon page is like my guitar case. \u00a0If i\u0027m not out on the street performing, I can\u0027t make money, and therefore you aren\u0027t charged any money. Simply put, you pay me for the work I actually produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s to stop you from releasing a ton of content in one month and charging me too much money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou get to set the limit to how much you donate. \u00a0Say you want to contribute $5 per video I release, but you don\u0027t want to spend more than $15 a month, you can set your own limit at $15 a month. \u00a0So if I only release one video that month, you only get charged $5. If I release seven videos in a month, you only get charged $15. \u00a0It\u0027s a foolproof plan to make sure no one takes advantage of your kindness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this money going to?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m the type of person that gets stir-crazy and depressed if I don\u0027t have a job outside of my own creative projects to bring in money. Right now I mainly do freelance carpentry work as well as some freelance film editing work. I use this work to cover my bills and day-to-day expenses, but i\u0027m trying to make my creative endeavors self-sustainable and it becomes possible through your help and Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAll of the money raised through my Patreon page gets reinvested back into my creative projects. \u00a0It will help me purchase better equipment, pay people for their help, cover recording costs, pay studio musicians, and hopefully help me make it to you on tour a couple times a year.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to help, but don\u0027t know if I can afford a regular monthly donation, is there something else I can do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhile Patreon is more setup for financial support, there are tons of ways you can help me without having to spend money. \u00a0If you would like some ideas, please feel free to shoot me an email at \u003ca class=\"__cf_email__\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e[email\u00a0protected]\u003c/a\u003e\n/*  */\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
