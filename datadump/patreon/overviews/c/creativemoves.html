    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Julie, and my favorite answer to the question of \"What do you do?\" is \"I make stuff!\" Now, what \"Stuff\" you may ask? My training and background is largely in dance and theatre, but my creative interests range far and wide. Sometimes I\u0027m serious, sometimes (okay, a lot of times) I\u0027m silly and playful, and I am almost always curious. Right now, I am focused on creating dance for the camera, expanding my stop-motion animation\u00a0 and video creating skills, creating dance where there is not usually dance (site-specific works,) and setting up creative structures for other artists to collaborate and play within. (I like to think of myself as a \"creative enabler.\")\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I live in a small city in Idaho, where although there are many opportunities for community theatre and performance, it is more difficult to create a sustainable living in the arts. And, hey, a girl\u0027s gotta eat! (And feed the kids!) Although technology can at times be frustrating, it gives me the wonderful opportunity to share my work beyond a limited geographical area, and Patreon gives you the ability to help support an artist creating new work!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I am considering this whole first year to be an introductory year, and a year for experimentation with this new/old model of support for the arts. Since this whole Patreon thing is new to me, I am starting out with plans to create (at least!) one video or other creative project a month for a year, and offering the single reward level of $1 a month while I get the hang of it.\u00a0 You\u0027ll get behind the scenes information, access to all the Patreon blog posts, and get to watch the videos/see the projects before anyone else! I may try out additional perks throughout the year, and you will get access to all of them at the $1 level for the full first year. (You are always welcome to pledge more, and it will be deeply appreciated, but for now I\u0027m keeping things simple.) After the first year, I will re-asses, and the format may change - but remember you are able to cancel your pledge at any time!\u00a0 For the month of January as I get this started, all posts will be available publicly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I hope you will come on this adventure with me! \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
