What\u0027s that?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe Incident Response Team is meant to be a First Response to a consent incident at events or within organizations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eTheir role is based on the premise that the best understanding of a situation comes from multiple perspectives.\u003c/h4\u003e\nTheir methods and training are designed to help those involved in the incident\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ebe supported,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ebe heard,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ecome to a place of mutual understanding.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a solution; it\u2019s a means towards a constructive decision (by the participants and the event management) regarding what actions may need to be taken after the incident.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo far, the Incident Response Teams has been self-supporting - that means the members usually cover their own expenses and/or donate their time, training, and a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0of emotional labor to try and foster a better environment of consent at events.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThis is not a sustainable model.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe would like to have the IRT be an independent group that works at events where they are welcome without being a burden on either the event resources or the volunteers. You can help in this effort by pledging to support monthly. Check out our milestone goals, and see where we would use this money.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho is \"We\"? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently the development of the IRT process is led by Gray Miller, an event producer and presenter for fourteen years. His background as a volunteer EMT led him to think this kind of model would work.\u00a0The group was initially called \"Rashomon\" and the process was created through the collaborative work of five members of the communities including different genders, orientations, ethnicities, and nationalities. Everyone had experience in areas such as community leadership, social counseling, and survivor and domestic issues.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll of us found the then-current methods used to deal with consent incidents in the community to be less than adequate, and we used the ROPECRAFT event in Austin as a testing ground for the protocols we created. Since then\u00a0the IRT has served at several other events with very promising results. While Gray will be managing the site at present, the goal is creating a Board and having rotating leadership to maintain responsibility.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Demand is Large; the Demand is Now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWith present resources there is no way to meet all of the requests for IRT training, consultations, and presences at events - and that\u0027s the \u003cem\u003elarge\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0events that can afford to pay the base expenses of the IRT (who usually work for free). We believe that this process should be available to communities and events at all levels who need it, and that\u0027s why we\u0027re asking for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHelp create a consent culture where we can all feel welcome.
