He believes that knowledge, not fear, will be the only way to insure that man survives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCarrot is an orphan with some striking features. His ears mark him out as less than\u00a0human and a threat to all around him. In a world filled with people who want to capture, torture and even eat him Professor Albright is his only refuge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging to this patron you will help give me the time and resources to devote to making this comic the best it can be and share this story with everyone. With more support I can devote time to make more frequent updates, color pages and extra side comics and illustrations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all and I hope you enjoy the comic,\u003cbr\u003eMr. Cat\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
