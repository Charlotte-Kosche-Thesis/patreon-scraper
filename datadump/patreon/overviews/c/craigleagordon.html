Well, that\u0027s not strictly true. Actually, I\u0027m a Business Analyst. But more than anything, I\u0027d love to be able to write full-time, and that\u0027s why I\u0027m starting this Patreon page.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you create?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nI create everything from short stories to full length novels, and if you become a patron you\u0027ll be pivotal in being able to massively increase my current output. And that\u0027s what I want, to be able to create a hell of a lot more than I can at the moment. To get more stories into the hands of those who love science fiction. Stories about technology, the future and most importantly, how it affects us.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nMy main problem at the moment is that I don\u0027t have nearly enough time to write. Between working full time and having a family and a dog, I write whenever I can. But it means my output is a lot less than it could be. What I\u0027d love more than anything, is to be able to quit my job and write full-time. That way I can get even more stories into your hands. Patreon is the first step in being able to do this, to try and replace some of my income from my job. If the number of patrons increases, then I\u0027ll be able to work part-time, and write more. And then the next step is to finally quit work and write 9-5, Monday to Friday. Patreon gives me a stable platform to try and make those first steps.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt also gives me a chance to keep more of the money for myself, instead of relying on bookstores and them taking a big chunk. So I\u0027d get to keep 95% with Patreon instead of between 35% and 70% by selling from digital stores.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get in return?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nFrom only $2 per month, you can get every single eBook that I release for free. And you\u0027ll also get it 2 months earlier than anyone else. And because my books will be enrolled into Kindle Unlimited, it gives you a chance at getting access to them even if you don\u0027t buy from Amazon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u0027s even more rewards at higher tiers, so please check them out.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I get my books?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nAll my eBooks are DRM free and delivered to you using Book Funnel. It\u0027s a perfect way of getting your books onto whichever device you need. And they also provide support for helping you out too. It\u0027s just as easy as buying from Amazon and getting the book automatically delivered to you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you subscribe to the higher tiers, then I will personally hand write a note and post you a copy to anywhere in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does your release schedule look like?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nIf you want to see what my release schedule is looking like, please select Release Schedule from the the left or click here:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/release-schedule-15362106\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eClick here to view my release schedule\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhat else do I get?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.craigleagordon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Transmit-VSmall-Glare-No-Shadow.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eAs a thank you for supporting me, everyone will get a copy of my epic short story Transmit.
