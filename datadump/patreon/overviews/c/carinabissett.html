    "summary": "Hello everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u0027re here, you probably know how much I love to write. It\u2019s the main focus in my life. To discover that\nthere are people out there in the world who want to support my creative work\nhumbles me. And I\u2019m incredibly grateful. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAsking is a difficult\nthing for me to do. I am afraid of the rejection. I am afraid of being\ndismissed. I am afraid of appearing weak. Then again, I am also faced with the\nrealities of struggling to survive in a modern world where art is often\nconsidered as a luxury, if it is even considered at all. So here I am\u2014asking\nfor your help to create new worlds. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy backstory: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you search my name, you will find that I was \u201cborn\u201d in 2013. As a domestic violence survivor, I\u2019ve been slowly rebuilding my life\nunder my new identity. And although I\u2019ve been published extensively in the\nfield of non-fiction in my \u201cprior life,\u201d my true love has always been in the\nre-envisioning of fairy tales and myth.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s the kicker: I can\u2019t do it without your help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDue to PTSD and anxiety, combined with complications related to having a new\nidentity, I have not worked outside of my house since leaving my job as a\nLanguage Arts teacher in 2013. On a positive note, this change in circumstance\nhas afforded me the opportunity to pursue my work in fiction. However, it also\nmeans that I am lacking the finances to attend workshops and other\nopportunities which I need in order to enhance and improve my creative writing\nskills.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a patron of several Kickstarter campaigns, but I\u2019ve\nalso recently become more aware of subscription sites like Patreon. Although\nKickstarter and other sites such as GoFundMe offer opportunities for people\nsupport specific projects, they do not afford a method of sustainability. I am\nin a position where I need support, true patronage of my art, from you if I\u2019m\ngoing to be able to survive as a writer working in speculative fiction and the\nmythic arts. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eLinks to my published work are available for free on my website\nat \u003ca href=\"http://www.carinabissett.com,\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.carinabissett.com,\u003c/a\u003e but I want to do more than that. I want to share my\nresearch. I want to create community. I want to write about the weird and\nwonderful. If this work makes it into the page of all of the journals and\nmagazines I love so much that will be a wonderful thing. But what about those\nstrange and surreal pieces that just don\u2019t quite \u201cfit in\u201d with the mainstream?\nDon\u2019t they still deserve a place in this world\u2014an audience? I think so, which\nis why folks in my inner circle will be treated to poems and stories that won\u2019t\nbe available anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eEvery little bit helps and by stepping up to support the\nartists you love, you are creating a foundation for writers and painters and\ndancers and musicians to change the world. Will all of these changes be BIG?\nProbably not. But I think even a little bit of beauty can go a long way. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy work is being accepted by paying markets. Poetry markets\npay in the average range of $5-15 per poem and short story markets pay between\n.01 and .08 cents a word. I can buy a cup of specialty tea or a pint of craft beer\nwith a poetry sale. A short story placement might be enough for a week\u2019s worth of\ngroceries. It\u2019s not exactly enough to by on, but writing is the only thing I am\ntruly good at and I want to share my work with people who appreciate it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me on Patreon you will be giving me the gift\nof interaction, community, and commitment. (You can pull out any time before\nthe end of any month, which makes it sort of a risk-free commitment.) I want to\nwrite the stories that thrill me. I want to paint poems full of emotion. I want\nto create world with connections that transcend the reality we live in. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd I can\u2019t do it without your help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI want to create this page as a platform where we can\ndiscuss ideas and build community. I need this constant communication. I want\nyour feedback and I am glad you found me here. Whether you are supporting my\nwork with one dollar or ten or twenty\u2014I want to thank you. Let\u0027s do this thing! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAll my love, \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eCarina"

     "about": "I am a writer. I enjoy seeing the world through a creative lens. Most of all, I love making connections between seemingly unrelated topics. This penchant for research led to a twelve-year career in non-fiction. I even won a couple of awards. But after a series of tragedies and the difficult decision to leave my past behind, I began to focus my creative work in the field of speculative fiction. Since changing my identity in 2013, I have published my short fiction and poetry in various anthologies and journals including the \u003cem\u003eThe Horror \u0027Zine\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eJournal of Mythic Arts\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eMythic Delirium\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe NonBinary Review\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eTimeless Tales\u003c/em\u003e. I believe that art has value and I hope that my contributions will only add to that value.
