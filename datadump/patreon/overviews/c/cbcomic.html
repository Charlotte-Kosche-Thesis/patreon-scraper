So if you like bird aliens, superpowers, and/or agender folk not having their identity scrutinized, Crash and Burn is for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour support of our work through Patreon will allow us to spend more time and energy on Crash and Burn. This creator-owned comic is an indie endeavour: artist Finn Lucullan and writer Kate Larking both hold down full-time jobs while creating the comic and running all the administrative details.\u003cbr\u003e In return for pledging money, we not only offer our humble thanks but also Crash and Burn goodies! Each backing level has different perks we can offer while we work toward some of our milestone goals. Between the physical printed copies and adding more tracks to the soundtrack, there is so much more to Crash and Burn that we need your help to make possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill the comic still be free?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely. The main webcomic will continue to be published on the website.\u003cbr\u003eBut, by backing our Patreon, you\u2019ll get the chapters in advance of publication. You\u2019ll also get bonus art, minicomics, stories, and music that we want to make but presently do not have the resources for."
