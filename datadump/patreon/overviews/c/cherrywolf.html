Upriser and the Wayseers Academy helped me choose the path I wanted to follow in life, and all the learning I have done from there started with this youtube video. I will shortly start producing videos of my own, but I have some spring cleaning to do of my computer - and my finances - before I can get that working.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus is why I\u0027m here on Patreon. For the most part, any income from my Patreon will go first towards my living expenses, and then the costs of writing. I will very shortly be updating this with the full details of what\u0027s to come and how you can get the very best of content in certain configurations of characters and events. Only those with the full picture will understand how it all fits together though, so there might be quite a bit of content for you to follow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHappy reading!\u003cbr\u003e"

I long to create the same experience for others.

I\u0027m finding the freedom of following my dreams outweighs the stress of barely making ends meet. Thankfully I have a husband who covers rent and bills and doesn\u0027t mind me spending some time on this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I would like nothing better than to have other people see my work and decide they like it enough to contribute.
