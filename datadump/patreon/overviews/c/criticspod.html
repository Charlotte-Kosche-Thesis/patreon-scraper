I Hate Critics is a hobby podcast, Sean, Josh and I do the podcast because we love hanging out, we love watching movies and we love doing the podcast. We have very little interest in making a career out of this, but between the three of us we\u0027re spending between $300 and $400 a month to do this podcast.\u00a0\u00a0  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy\n supporting The I Hate Critics Movie Review Podcast you wouldn\u0027t be reimbursing us for the money spent you\u0027d be helping us add to the show. We would love to do screenings, move our podcast to Libsyn, get an app, see more movies and perhaps even go to Sundance or SXSW and cover those festivals. We want to grow the show, not profit from it and your donations would help us immensely with that. \u003cbr\u003e"

You can put that on a resume. You can be added to our weekly meeting planning Facebook messages. You can impact the weekly show. You\u0027ll have a say on the Undisputed Classic, the trailers. The other option is that we\u0027ll try to do our own little film fest or screening and you\u0027ll be key in deciding what movies are shown.\u00a0",
