I\u0027m Timber Kataigida. I am an independent artist who\u0027s currently working on their first comic series. A sci-fi/mystery/drama comic with just a dash of horror, called CYGNUS. By pledging whatever amount of your cash you want to me per month, you help ensure that I can release the thing quicker, as time is money, and getting money for this will allow me more time to work on it. That\u0027s how it goes.\u003cbr\u003eMy comic is not the primary purpose of this page! There are things I do that are unrelated as well, such as general pieces of art. The genres I work with primarily are fantasy and sci-fi, though I can and would draw just about anything."
