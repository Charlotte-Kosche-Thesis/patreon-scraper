    "summary": "A military veteran and rifleman from Clevedon, who suffered extreme and life-changing injuries after a motorcycling accident, now aims to race at the \u2018deadly\u2019 Isle of Man TT in 2023. Chris Ganley, 28, hopes to make history by being the first one-armed motorcyclist to race the circuit alongside some of motorcycling\u2019s most famous riders.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the accident, Chris\u2019 left arm was ripped off, and his right was broken so badly broken that the doctors questioned whether to rebuild it or to amputate it. He said, \u201cmy injuries were horrific. In addition to losing my left arm and coming close to losing my right, I also broke my spine in three places. The injuries have left me with severe nerve damage and weak muscles in my core and back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI also suffered a bleed on my brain, broken ribs and popped lung \u2013 I\u2019m very fortunate to be alive.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe incident didn\u2019t change Chris\u2019 passion for motorcycles. After being a mechanic for his Sergeant Major at a race weekend at Donington, Chris bought a Yamaha YZF 600 Thundercat and was hoping to race for his army\u2019s team. Unfortunately, he never got the chance to do so before being discharged from the army.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChris says, \u201cI tried so hard to come to terms with what had happened to me. I was in a very dark place, and I wanted the struggle to end. I didn\u2019t think I would be able to ride a motorcycle again.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u201cTo overcome my struggle, I started fixing my old bikes so I could sell them but I knew I had to try one last time to ride them. If it didn\u2019t work, at least I\u2019d know I had tried.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChris booked a track day to see if he could ride his motorcycle with one arm. He added, \u201cOnce I made it out on track, I felt alive again. Riding a bike around a track at high speed is something that you can\u2019t describe the feeling of unless you do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cIt gave me a new view on life. I changed my \u2018I can\u2019t\u2019 to \u2018I can\u2019.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChris now races in the Thundersport GB Championship. He travels the country racing against able-bodied riders of all levels. In his first race, he finished 3rd place \u2013 an excellent reflection of hard work and determination after experiencing life-changing injuries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChris now aims to race in the \u2018world\u2019s deadliest race\u2019, the Isle of Man TT. He adds \u201cThe closer I am to death; the more alive I feel. Racing at the TT will be a huge risk as it\u2019s renowned for claiming countless lives, but it\u2019s a risk I\u2019m willing to take.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, he has gained the support of various sponsors including Blesma, a charity which supports limbless veterans, a Bristol-based Motorsport PR Company, PR17, and Kingsize Photography, a company that photographs motorsport championship rounds such as F1.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollow Chris\u2019 progress on his Facebook page \u2013 \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ganleyracing/\"\u003eChris Ganley Racing\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
