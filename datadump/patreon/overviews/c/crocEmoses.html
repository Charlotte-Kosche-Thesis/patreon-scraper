This platform radically simplifies the value exchange for artists through a mechanism of micro-patronage. It is a form of \ncrowd-sourcing - \u003ca href=\"http://www.croc-e-moses.com/poems/memorys-black-fire/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWhere all sparks meet\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt combines many individual\u0027s ongoing monthly pledges into a \nsource of monthly cash flow for the artist/content generator. You can \npledge $1 or more at any time and stop or \nmodify your pledge at any time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn real terms, I am suggesting you\u00a0 will be \nable to freely access and share my past and future content online in return for an ongoing monthly pledge. You will also \nreceive a range of personalised interactions (see very bottom). This might be free entrance to live performances, workshops or other surprises - In \nother words we are tailoring all that I am, do and produce into an open resource in exchange for a consolidated source of regular \nincome.  A new middle ground opens up. Naturally, I already hear some of\n you saying! Others may be saying why?\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://crocemoses.bandcamp.com/track/which-way-to-what\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHICH WAY TO WHAT\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe live in a world where the financial system is central. In real terms this means, like everybody else, I have to interface daily with this operating system. I am constantly searching for a way to merge my life-blood-being and this money system sustainably, without further dividing myself. \u003ca href=\"http://www.croc-e-moses.com/poems/shrink-bigger/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI am here to get clear about our schizophrenia. The money party is over. We\u0027ve inherited a nuclear hangover.\u003c/a\u003e  The Patreon micro-patronage model opens up possibilities on this \u0027adventure\u0027. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTRANS MEDIA CREATURE\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mainly spend my time gardening words; sowing and growing songs \nthat I share worldwide. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy entire lived experience inspires and informs my creations. Conventionally I would be labelled \u0027artist\u0027; \nmostly \u0027poet\u0027. However I have chosen not to limit myself to just being a so-called \u0027artist\u0027 or identifying with the tag of \u0027artist\u0027, \u0027poet\u0027 or \u0027musician\u0027 even though these names largely point to what I do (see my street credentials below).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the context of Southern Africa where I live and create since 1988, I have found that my writing, singing and performances function on many levels.

This requires me to compartmentalise myself and operate as a series of products. Through this process over many years, I have had to adapt to sporadic money patterns that fluctuate irrespective of my otherwise seamless flow of creative output. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt hasn\u0027t taken me long to learn that just because what I create isn\u0027t always compatible with the money system, it doesn\u0027t mean that I do not have value to offer. Many people have in fact told me the opposite; that my work is priceless. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe challenge is that there are no global applications that allow people to value the \u003cem\u003einterrelatedness\u003c/em\u003e of all that I have to offer as a creative, in return for a stable income.\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have gradually identified what I would like from money; a value-exchange that considers the range of what I do as a whole, in return for a source of money that is an ongoing flow rather than a fluctuation of start and stop chunks.

We are so used to exchanging money for a product or service, that we want everything to fit into a \u0027product\u0027 or \u0027service\u0027 category. Some things just don\u0027t!
