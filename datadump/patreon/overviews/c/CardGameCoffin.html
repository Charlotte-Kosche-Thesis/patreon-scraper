Firstly if you are not already a member of CardGameCoffin donating at this or any other tier guarantees you membership if you so choose to join. The next reward is something that actually doesn\u0027t suck (lol) if you haven\u0027t joined CGC/arent going to you gain access to the CGC discord server, it\u0027s Donors chat, all tournaments we host, all of our in discord events, and access to a weekly poll about which direction the team should go in (all of these rewards available to people who join the team as well). You will also receive a text based shout out in our streams and at the end of all our videos, and either a Yu-Gi-Oh decklist based on your request made by me, a custom sleeve based on your request for any YGOPRO client (sleeve may be substituted for other editing project, if it can be done within the confines of gimp I will do it) , or a horrible rendition of your face (drawn by me). You may choose one of these every month for me to do!",
