It is a musical project I started when I was 12 years old. I found a program called TabIt, which let the user write tabs, and then played it back using a very low quality guitar midi. I created many short tunes that were primitive at best, but my interest in composing began there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Over the years, my music very slowly evolved as I continued experimenting with different styles and instruments, however I used almost exclusively virtual instruments at the time. I loved metal and was a lead guitarist as well as a top Guitar Hero player in my state (not anymore XD), so I made the songs filled with guitar solos.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Eventually I was able to get my music onto the \u003cem\u003eRockBand Network\u003c/em\u003e, where people could download and play my songs in the video game \u003cem\u003eRockBand, \u003c/em\u003eand from this I gained an internet following. As I entered college, majoring in Music Composition, my music grew more and more sophisticated. Like any kid, I had grown up playing video games, and the music from those games had always stood out to me. To this day, video games are my main influence.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 My goal in life has always been to live comfortably while doing something that I enjoy. Composing music is what I am most passionate about, and I know that with enough determination and support, I can and will make it happen."
