Because it\u0027s open source software, it\u0027s also fully auditable and if you\u0027re skilled enough you can you can compile it yourself and use it for free or even tweak it to suit your own needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to see what people said about it you can have a look at this\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://rancher.com/reducing-aws-spend\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog post by Rancher Labs\u003c/a\u003e, one of the major Kubernetes vendors who recommends it to their customers, or see some testimonials of other\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/79qnc2/ask_hn_how_did_you_significantly_reduce_your_aws/dp58xqf/\"\u003ehappy\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@RemindEng/operations-infrastructure-month-in-oreview-4-530d1b1d83ea\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eusers\u003c/a\u003e.

It would be great if you could contribute to offset at least some of this cost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything beyond this would motivate me to contribute more often to the project, so you get a better product next time you update it.
