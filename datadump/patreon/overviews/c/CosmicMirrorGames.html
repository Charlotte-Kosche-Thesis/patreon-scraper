    "summary": "We are Cosmic Mirror Games, a one-man and friends Table Top Role Playing Game maker. I am Dane Asmund, the everything for the group. While ideas are bounced off of some wonderful friends, and some visual designs and illustrations are done by others, the content creation, editing, lay out, and all the goodness lays on my shoulders.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I was in grade school, I\u0027ve always wanted to make RPGs of the video game variety-- however, as I grew up and encountered TTRPGs, I realized that so much could still be realized there. We entered our journey with our first book, Umbra \u0026amp; Mirn in 2016, from the start of the year to the mid point, where we had our first Kickstarter, to seeing it fulfilled and finalized by the end of that same year. Many more are coming in that series, and others besides, both large and small, complex and simple. It would be my greatest joy to see these games realized in physical books, professionally made, beautifully illustrated, and happily played.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo that end, I am seeking to spend more and more time on them, to realize the full potential there is in a new TTRPG journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can check out all of our current games and early playtest documents for them on our website, www.CosmicMirrorGames.com"
