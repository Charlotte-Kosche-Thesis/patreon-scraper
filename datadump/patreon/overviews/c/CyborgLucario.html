    "summary": "I\u0027m just a guy who makes drawings and tries to make videos (scripting is the hardest part, as every person making a video knows) and dreams of becoming a game designer.\u003cbr\u003eI originally didn\u0027t plan on relying on Patreon to get my money, but seeing as my economy is not so good so do I need some extra money to help me make videos faster, and could help in getting better equipment for filming and getting footage.\u003cbr\u003eWhat kind of videos do I do? I do reviews and impression videos of games I\u0027m playing for the first time (or let\u0027s plays if you want to think of it that way), and I will also make countdowns (something that has been on my mind for a time).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also an artist who draws on his free time, and who\u0027s work may or may not be safe for work. You can find me on deviantArt, furaffinity, weasyl, inkbunny, and tumblr if you want to see what I make for drawings. Though I can say that some of them are a bit fetishy.\u003cbr\u003eI will mostly do \u003cstrong\u003efurry\u003c/strong\u003e stuff.\u003cbr\u003eYou can find me in these places: \u003ca href=\"https://cyborg-lucario.deviantart.com/\"\u003ehttps://cyborg-lucario.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.furaffinity.net/user/cyborg-ninja/\"\u003ehttps://www.furaffinity.net/user/cyborg-ninja/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.weasyl.com/~cyborglucario\"\u003ehttps://www.weasyl.com/~cyborglucario\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://inkbunny.net/CyborgLucario\"\u003ehttps://inkbunny.net/CyborgLucario\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/blog/cyborg-lucariosart\"\u003ehttps://www.tumblr.com/blog/cyborg-lucariosart\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, whatever I\u0027ll do will be released for free. But people who pays me can get to see stuffs from me a day or two earlier than anyone else.\u003cbr\u003eMaybe even weeks too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what am I doing on Youtube?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31,73,125);\"\u003eLet\u0027s Plays\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt first meant to be filler until I got reviews and countdowns up, ended up being the bulk of my Youtube page. So yeah, I used to make let\u0027s plays, but not anymore because it\u0027s over saturated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m streaming over at Twitch though, and that probably counts as let\u0027s plays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/cyborg_lucario\"\u003ehttps://www.twitch.tv/cyborg_lucario\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31,73,125);\"\u003eReviews\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be making reviews of games, animations, movies, and probably comics too. If I have a strong opinion on it, so will I make a review of it. Though to be honest, so will the reviews mostly be humouristic like Jontron, AVGN, and Nostalgia Critic. But I WILL TRY to not copy them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31,73,125);\"\u003eCountdowns\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know what you\u0027re saying, and sure, how would I be able to stand up to other popular countdown artists like Joshschorcher A.K.A. The Feiry Joker, Rabbid Luigi, Quarter Guy, and etc?\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll just have an original idea that\u0027s how.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please consider becoming a patron to an artist, and video creator. Just a single dollar per month is enough or you can pay more if you feel generous.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI made it so you\u0027re charging up front when you first start supporting me. This is not because of greed but for safety reason so that cheapskates can\u0027t pledge and then stop pledging before the end of the month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
