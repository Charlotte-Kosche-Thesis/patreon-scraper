    "summary": "Well hello there, and thanks for stopping by :)\u00a0 I like to make videos about RC flying things (mainly) and FPV via my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/currykitten\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0which (for reasons of the names of my cats amongst other things) is called CurryKitten.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started getting into the RC hobby around 2012, and back then things were very much less \"off-the-shelf\" and much more \"make-it-yourself\".\u00a0 My various experiments in flying got my off the ground to view things in glorious FPV - but I had way more than my fair share of crashing into the ground... with vengeance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I started branching out and flying more models and trying different things, I was often frustrated at the lack of proper manuals, or instructions about how components should be setup.\u00a0 My day job was very much about problem solving, so I generally figured things out for myself with a bit of trial and error and experimentation.\u00a0 I started making videos about how I set things up, and they seemed to help people out who were stuck in the same situation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe progression\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHappily enough, in the last 6 years or so, the technology has moved on and there\u0027s some wonderful off-the-shelf components and ready-to-fly models available now - but it doesn\u0027t make things simple for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve met up with lots of new pilots and I\u0027ve noticed many of them struggle with certain aspects of first-time flying - so I started making tutorials to help address this.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimilarly, not all RTF models are created equally, and new guys can really get disheartened when they brand new model doesn\u0027t work quite how it\u0027s expected\u00a0to.\u00a0 So, aside from reviewing new models, I\u0027ve spent time trying to hunt down the problems and show how they can be fixed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why Patreon \u0026amp; how will it help the channel ?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn short, I enjoy making video content so much, I want to do this full time.\u00a0 I gives\u00a0me the buzz of problem solving\u00a0that my previous software engineering job wasn\u0027t doing, and fills a creative hole that I had.\u00a0 Of course, giving up my day job does give me more time to create content, but it doesn\u0027t pay for all the expenses in doing so\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI generate some income via affiliate advertising when I create reviews (at least in the case of Gearbest and Banggood)\u00a0 Hey, I can\u0027t complain, I love playing with new toys as much as the next guy, but what I would like to do is spent less time on pure reviews and more time some how-to\u0027s, tutorial, build and similar project videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you / Why become a Patreon ?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m hoping if you got this far, then perhaps you already saw something on the channel you liked, or found helpful.\u00a0 If that\u0027s you, then consider dropping a coin\u00a0into the virtual-hat, but also, please take the opportunity to have a chat, suggest things you\u0027d like to see covered, and ask a question if your stuck on an issue.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m lucky enough to be supplied with a selection of quads and other gear for review.\u00a0 But as time goes on, I\u0027ll need to remove some stuff in order to make space for more.\u00a0 My intention will be to move some of these ex-review\u00a0quads and things onto Patreon supporters.\u003cbr\u003e"
