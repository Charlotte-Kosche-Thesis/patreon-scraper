    "summary": "We are developing an Online Versus Real Time Tactics RPG called Battle is Key! Think of game-play similar to Fire Emblem or Final Fantasy Tactics - except there is no luck based mechanics because all the game-play (attacking, healing, dodging) \u00a0happens in real-time! You don\u0027t have to stand there and take the hit! - Move out the way! Every playable Unit on your team is given a Letter on the Keyboard or Controller that will give you control for as long as held. They have their own unique actions that they will preform when not under your control too so don\u0027t worry about idle Units!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=808104405\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWe\u0027ve Been Green-Lit on Steam - Thanks for the votes!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the code for Tournament mode, Ranking, Online matchmaking and etc is done.
