Consider becoming a patron!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is the deal; we make art! Mostly awesome music! We give it freely to whomever wants to have it. We do this because we believe that you get what you give, and we desire a more personal and direct commune with those who enjoy and get something out of what we make! Also, we feel that what we do is inspired and here for a reason and feel it to go against our ideals to horde it until the right amount of money comes for it.\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, here we are, asking you to help us. If our music, art or even our life adds to your existence somehow, and you feel inspired to give back,\u00a0 please do become a patron.\u003cbr\u003eOur hope is to, between people like you helping here, be able to have life be fully supported by our art and your love.\u003cbr\u003e"
