I am not fully myself when I am unable to turn what is in my mind, heart, and soul into something tangible that the world can see. In addition to the materials that I need to replace, I will need to be able to replace some of the time that I spend working multiple jobs while still being able to pay for rent, utilities, and groceries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, not only will I be able to take care of my family while creating, but I will also be able to spend time with my son, teaching him what I know, and encouraging him to express himself through art. For this opportunity, I am most grateful."
