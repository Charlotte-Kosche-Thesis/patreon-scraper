I hope you are here to consider supporting my dream of publishing this story!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently our goals and pledges are an on the go kind of thing, I don\u0027t want to stretch myself out or assume too much in the beginning. More things will get added and more rewards will be conjured as we grow in popularity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW WILL PATREON WILL WORK...?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you are here, you\u0027re probably wondering what to expect? Understandable! To be honest this Patreon currently only serves as little more as a tipjar, I work a full-time job as well as work on the comic so time is a limited factor for myself. By pledging to the comic you are helping me ease bills, equipment and stress, the larger the Patreon gets the better chance I stand of working more and more on the comic. Thats good for ME and YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEverything is also Public, there are no exclusive works, no behind the wall publications. Your decision to pledge is not one of rewards but one of because you would like to see me succeed. This stance will likely not change, but over time I may be able to branch out to other meaningful things, such as AMA\u0027s, pinups and other publications.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT KIND OF CONTENT IS THERE...?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently the comic it\u0027s self, any images I find time to upload and some concept ideas that I can try and throw up if I am happy with them. There will be both \u003cstrong\u003eSFW \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eNSFW \u003c/strong\u003econtent, which is why this patreon is labeled as such, the comic itself is also rated for nudity, blood, death and might be a little softcore sex in there. So make sure you keep those kids eyes away, I don\u0027t control what they look at.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS CKOM ABOUT THEN...?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ckom.jadephoenix.org/images/Misc/chibigias.png\" style=\"float: right; width: 332px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eCKoM is a\u00a0weekly comic\nthat follows the exploits and tales of a group of beings called\nCreators, people gifted with the incredible ability to weave\nthe elements of our world to create many amazing, and sometimes\ndeadly, feats of nature. Through their connection to the planet\u0027s\nMana, an energy that Earth radiates naturally and that we interact with on a subtle level.

While I cannot say I am a successful one right now, I like to believe I have some talent when it comes to writing a story. Creators: Keepers of Mana has been my one largest project I have worked on for many years and is the result of many re-drafts, changes and rewrites until I found a medium I was happy with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently I also took to the art side of things, and my skill, while fledgling I hope to nurture into a reasonable skill to bring the story of CKoM to the net. Weather or not is sucessful, my only motivation is to see the story put to paper.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you would consider helping us make CKoM an enjoyable read for all whom stumble across my tiny part of the internet. I welcome any feedback where possible as only through the readers and their kind (Or unkind) words help us improve our abilities.",
