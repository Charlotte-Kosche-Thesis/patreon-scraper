    "summary": "After 3 years of being a content creator for YouTube, I still love every single day i record, edit and upload a video for you guys! Never has fame or fortune been a goal for me, i just enjoy the fact that people out there love watching my content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately over the past year my fundings have gone dramatically down hill, for the people who do not know, i am a University student, with this comes some expensive bills, you may be asking \"Why don\u0027t you get yourself a job\" And this is why i am here asking for your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have just come out from a year jobs which i took inbetween my degree, i tested the waters of being able to balance my YouTube, Stream and Work all together at once, some of you may have noticed that this did not work. I suffered over that period extreme depression due to the weight of everything, with this came a lot of side effects, which if you are interested can message me about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver my summer, i really want to push my channel forward, bringing you guys some of the best content i can possibly create, i want to learn new editing skills and hopefully bring you all more entertaining content. But i cannot do this without your support, i have been given the choice, do i leave my YouTube passion behind and work in a supermarket to live, or do i take a chance with YouTube and your support and push through to success.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that you all understand, and that you can help me through these times, a lot of you will know i hate asking for help or support, but sometimes we have to give in. Thank You - Kipps"
