I would call myself a filmmaker, but that could mean a lot of things so I\u0027ll explain. I\u0027m a cinematographer (meaning I actually handle all of my camera work and compositions), a director, editor, and producer. Sometimes, if no one else is available, I\u0027ll even play actress. With the\u00a0exception of an\u00a0assistant\u00a0on set once in\u00a0awhile,\u00a0\u00a0some help here and there with audio and special effects, I\u0027m a one lady show.

It\u0027s a very liberating feeling, to know that what you\u0027re posing for is for something personal with purpose. Photography has been a great way for me to help out my independent designer friends and to take reference photos for fellow artists. An industry and a people I deeply care about. I hope to find the time to continue my self portrait work in the future!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F0BSkS1tJQQ/VmnIUTwvUgI/AAAAAAAAC6Q/pTE0zWorLXg/s640/_MG_4543%2Bweb.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/b850f66904cbd569d1aa9aa5c2058243/tumblr_o9p8lhHmUF1riayn5o1_500.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThe very best thing for me is traditional art. I can remember painting and drawing since I was maybe eight years old and excelling in the arts in high school and college. It wasn\u0027t until I reached adulthood that I realized I could make a living from something I actually really enjoyed versus something I could just manage (I was working my way toward a degree in psychology at the time - something I wasn\u0027t super thrilled about). I\u0027ve been working as an artist for several years mainly on a commission basis, but for the past couple of years I\u0027ve been focusing on my own style and portfolio, elevating print making and gallery exhibitions to the priority list.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/ebe5da6e1a83a5f9a2bd5bec83dd3f46/tumblr_o6bovxMlTI1riayn5o1_500.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003ePencils and film are my primary passions and I am so fortunate enough to be able to say that they provide a somewhat stable life for me. But trying to juggle \"making a living\" and \"making art\" has become a huge emotional and financial struggle. For any of you out there \"doing it all on your own\" you know that that sort of life is very isolating, draining, and even limiting. For an artist that makes films and art full time, \"full time\" really means making art maybe 10% of the time. The other 90% is hustle. Marketing, packaging, mailing, answering emails, advertising, planning, photographing products, managing product listings, running errands, ordering supplies, etc. Basically, making sure you have enough in the bank for the next project, or if you have enough in the bank to put hustling on the back burner so you can survive while only drawing 14 hours a day for two weeks and eating out for nearly every meal so you don\u0027t have to cook or get groceries and blah blah blah you get it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/262e349c56bc068fd59d734b889641ad/tumblr_odfbt0JsXF1riayn5o1_500.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eEssentially, I need time more than I need financial support. But, financial support will allow for more time to focus on creating, rather than a focus on selling. So instead of cutting MORE out of my spectrum of work, I\u0027m turning to you patrons for the little extra support I need to reach my larger, long term goals. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2727\u00a0Some of those larger, long term goals\u2727\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eFirst and foremost, I\u0027d like to hire a part time assistant to\u00a0alleviate\u00a0distractions and non-artistic workloads. An intern would be great too, but I\u0027d love to pay someone for their valuable time.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0-\u00a0I need a damn website. I\u0027ve been working on one for years, but I cannot find the time to fine tune or finish it. I\u0027d love to hire some help to fully launch and maintain it for better viewing of my work.\u003cbr\u003e- I\u0027d like to find a great screen printer and start printing my work on more clothing of various styles.\u003cbr\u003e- \u00a0A book! A sketch book would be wonderful, but I definitely do not have enough sketches at the moment to fill one (maybe someday), but more immediately, my husband and I have been planning a couple of art books and graphic novel books.\u003cbr\u003e- A studio would be a dreeeam. Space in Los Angeles is limited and moving from house to house like millennials do makes it so hard to be comfortable enough in a space to create.\u003cbr\u003e- A solo show! This isn\u0027t too far out of reach, but the \"time off\" it requires is absolutely not doable presently.\u003cbr\u003e- To take the time to learn to paint again. I started out painting in watercolor, but something happened once and I think a ruined a piece with color, so since then I\u0027ve been afraid to get back on the horse. Having a little time to stretch and to fail will be really helpful to get me over that hump.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e- Bigger, better quality, larger edition prints. I\u0027m on my way there, but I need another printer upgrade.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e*This goal has been met!! Thank you! Prints are now available here: casstronautphoto.etsy.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Flesh out and carry out several short films I\u0027ve had on the shelf for several years. These require a bit more resources than just myself, my camera, and my apartment - such as travel, actors, costumes, etc.\u003cbr\u003e- Show my film work at more festivals. This is a surprisingly expensive endeavor. Not just due to travel, but most festivals require fees for submission and certain costly formats for projections.\u003cbr\u003e- Hire\u00a0musicians\u00a0to score exclusive\u00a0pieces for my films.\u003cbr\u003e- And of course, to just sit down and make more art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you\u0027re still here, let\u0027s talk about what you get out of all of this. You get me. A little piece of me! Isn\u0027t that nice? But really, I\u0027d like to make Patreon a safe, transparent, educational, and supportive space for all of us. I\u0027d love to be more accessible to my supporters (something I admittedly fail at publicly), but privately I want to be here for you like you have for me. This intimate experience will include behind the scenes images and video, outtakes, question and answer sessions, google hangouts and/or private live sessions, discounts to merchandise, first looks for final products, exclusive looks at steps in a project\u0027s long progress, tutorials, time lapse videos, hi resolution images so you can take a closer look at my technique, private blogs, print proofs and product tests, commissioned work, advice and anything else you may come up with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for reading and I look forward to getting to know you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to follow along elsewhere?
