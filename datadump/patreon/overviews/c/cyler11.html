(welcome, by the way)\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a thirty-something that quit my career of 11 years to move to a country I\u0027ve never been to, that speaks a language I didn\u0027t know, to pursue the highest degree available. PHEW!! Seems like a melt-down, right? Well, it was a case of feeling \"stuck\" at my job for a few years, and deciding to finally do something about it. I\u0027m now fulfilling several dreams of mine. Living and learning a new culture, learning another language, and getting my Doctoral degree in Psychology.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo here I am! I\u0027m living in Portugal and am working on my research in positive psychology. My dream is to eventually return to the US and put my research interests into action by creating education intervention programs of various kinds. But before I come back!!!!!!! I want to take FULL advantage of living in Europe.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eLuckily, my passion is making and editing video.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eLet me be honest about something, I am not independently wealthy, and my income right now comes from sporadic jobs teaching English and editing papers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s where you come in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me, I will have the means to bring you more videos about traveling around Europe, discovering all the hidden gems that don\u0027t always make it to travel agents, and how to do it affordably. (Hopefully you also enjoy my art, my humor, my dashing good looks, and just want to support me making more videos.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHow will I use your contributions:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eUpdating my equipment. Hiring (frankly, more talented) people to help me make my content amazing. Travel expenses (note: on. a. budget.) But most importantly, I will use your contributions to help me pay my tuition, my rent, and to... well, eat. Help me achieve my dream, and I promise to bring you along on my journey, in the most entertaining way I know how.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you for just considering to support me. And for those ready to click the support button, Thank you for your sincere generosity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMost humbly,\u003cbr\u003eKeith\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you don\u0027t want to subscribe and just want to make a one-time contribution, here\u0027s my paypal account where you can do that!\u00a0paypal.me/KGissubel\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSubscriptions are per-video (between 1 and 3 per month)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can cap your monthly contribution (in case one month I get way too crazy with ideas).\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
