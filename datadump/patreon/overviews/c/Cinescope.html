    "summary": "November 2015, an extraordinary event took place. A\ntheatre company brought together a group of refugee boys\nwho had found temporary safety in the UK.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Home Office has been written and performed by boys\nwho arrived in the UK as children from afar afield as Afghanistan,\nAlbania, Eritrea and Somalia. All of whom were Searching for safe-\nty, without their families and bravely holding on to their hopes and\ndreams for the future.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Home Office was described by the Guardian theatre\ncritic Lyn Gardner after their successful Edinburgh Festival run as,\n\u0026#8216;Ragged but essential theatre.\u0026#8217; The play has given these young\nmen whose lives it records a voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe film of this unique play will allow it to be preserved while\ngiving a wider audience the opportunity to experience this unique\nand important theatrical event.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe play will be lifted from the confines of a traditional stage\nsetting and be relocated to a space that allows the work to expand\nand develop into a filmed experience, allowing the play to embrace\nthe language of the cinema.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe film will embrace other narratives, to complement and\ninform the overall story. From painters, whose work examines the\nplight of those who find themselves stateless, to rappers and barris-\nters who will give their own voice to what it means to be stateless,\nhomeless and in need of asylum. We will witness the boys as they\nspeak in their own words and who tell their moving stories. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0"

Based on the play of the same name, \u0027Dear Home Office\u0027 was created, and will be performed by a group of 8 young male refugees; this is their story.\u003cbr\u003eThe film will be directed by Ray Kilby (BAFTA) and will be produced and distributed by CINESCOPE Inc. We are looking to secure funding to support both pre production and distribution of the film, please find our funding proposal attached which should provide you with more information about the project, and where potential funding will be spent.\u003cbr\u003eThis story is a vital one to tell, and we truly believe this film is one that needs to reach as many individuals both in the UK and beyond, to provide a different perspective on an often discussed and debated issue. Any monetary support you can provide to help us reach that goal, and share this film with as many people as possible, would be a great help.\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon,\u003cbr\u003eWarmest,\u003cbr\u003eSergey Mihhaljov, Senior Producer Dear Home Office\u003cbr\u003eCinescope Inc.\u003cbr\u003e",
