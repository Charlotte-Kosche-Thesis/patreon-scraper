    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://i68.tinypic.com/jaz0va.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, I am Catlin Riddle and I\u0027d like to thank you for visiting my Patreon page. Currently, I am in the beginning stages of doing this. I\u0027d like to explain why I am choosing to write on Patreon. Eventually, I would like to write a book, or multiple books. I have great ideas that I have started noting down and mapping out, but while I get to the point of perfecting a good solid book, I\u0027d also like to practice and exercise my mind more doing short stories as well. This is where you come in. I would like to provide quality fictional stories to readers and supporters. Some of these may be stories that stemmed from dreams I have had in the past from childhood, to now. I also plan to have a more interactive role with you all by starting out with Discord being the main (non-story) reward in the beginning. I would like to perfect my writing skills, and use any critique and feedback as a learning experience, while also sharing new worlds with you all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i68.tinypic.com/2njg4e8.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m 28 and living in Kansas. Total nerd and usually awkward around people. I do marketing work as a full time job for a professional audio company. Although there is some creativity involved, there\u0027s still a standard company look and feel I have to stick with. As much as I like graphic design, I don\u0027t feel I can really express my creativity to it\u0027s full extent doing that job alone. I grew up doing a lot of art, primarily enjoying drawing rather than painting. But I also grew up with a love for reading. I\u0027m not sure any other childhood friend I knew, ever visited the public library as much as I did. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEducation-wise, I hated public school. Who didn\u0027t? I even failed my English classes and didn\u0027t graduate on time so I had to repeat a year. Doesn\u0027t sound like someone that wants to write right? I used to insist that I\u0027d go straight into the work world and never do college. Oh how I was wrong. After a year out of school, I ended up giving community college a try. There, I aced my English Composition classes and found I really enjoyed the descriptive writing portions. Though, I did quit that community college after the first year. It just wasn\u0027t for me. Soon after coming back home, I ended up enrolling into ITT-Tech. There I primarily learned all my graphic design related skills. It wasn\u0027t worth all the debt. I feel I learned more at my current job than I did there. After getting my Associates there, and working for about 3 1/2 years, I came to the decision to pursue more college, only this time, I\u0027d do online courses at a slower and more manageable pace. I\u0027m now pursuing English Literature and Creative Writing with a Focus in Fiction at SNHU Online. This isn\u0027t a change in careers for me, but rather a personal pursuit of knowledge that will help me do something I\u0027d love to do as a hobby. Although maybe if I love it a lot and do well, it could become a career. For now though, I would like to write out of my passion for creativity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i68.tinypic.com/35jauqe.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now aside from getting to read my stories as a patron, the reward system will be set up as a more interactive options from which we can talk/discuss, collaborate, and even just hang with like-minded individuals.

Leading up to this goal, I will happily accept ideas and input on the design, and will display a number of design drafts.
