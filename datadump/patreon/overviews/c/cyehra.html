I\u0027m a freelancing cosplayer \u0026amp; propmaker from Germany.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://foamperium.de/patreon/profil.jpg\" style=\"width: 305px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeside of making armored costumes \u0026amp; props i write books, tutorials \u0026amp; guides to teach others how to make awesome stuff by themself. The most content is available for everyone and for free. People who know me already, also know that they can ask me for any help \u0026amp; advices everytime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI care a lot for the cosplayers community. I post my stuff online to motivate, support \u0026amp; inspire other builders, crafters \u0026amp; cosplayers. Fellow Builders, Cosplayers, my Followers are very important to me. In this line i want to say: Thank you everyone for being awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.foamperium.de/patreon/kreuzritter2.jpg\" style=\"width: 647px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made this creators page for those, who want to support me \u0026amp; my work. I work with different materials and techniques. Currently, my way go into digital modelling and 3D printing. But my favorite material is still foam.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started cosplaying, there was no literature adressing it directly. There only were books about either sewing or handcrafting that actually didn\u2018t really help. There was no huge amount of materials that you could use and not a lot of helpful tutorials on the internet. With my tutorials, books, patterns \u0026amp; stuff, I want to support and help you to get into the world of building and creating costumes.\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Katharina K. and you probably know me better by my artist name \u201eCyehra\u201c. Cosplaying is a part of my life since 2004-2005. A long time, where I sewed more than I did handcrafting. I started building armors in summer 2014. My first project was my crusader from the video game \u201eDiablo III Reaper of Souls\u201c. I am wondering until today what got into me, starting such an insane (and very exciting!) project, but I am also very, very happy that I actually did it. Without this project, these words would not be written down here.\u003cbr\u003eI am fascinated by turning something fictive and often surreal, or at first hand impossible, into reality. Making the armors and clothing actually wearable and eventually presenting them. Bringing the character to life and performing is another aspect, why I enjoy this hobby. My costumes are known for their high amount of details, the variety and the love I create them with. When I started publishing tutorials, they were highly appreciated. That begans back in 2015.\u003cbr\u003eToday i\u0027m a fulltime cosplayer/armor/propmaker. I love my new life. Even if it is tough to handle.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
