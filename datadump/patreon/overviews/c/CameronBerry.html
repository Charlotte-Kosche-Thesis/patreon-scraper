    "summary": "A few years ago, I was diagnosed with severe, clinical depression. Through years of therapy, art and research, I crawled out of the hole. I experienced the recovery process and am impressed with how many support groups can be found online, not just for depression, but every disorder we know of.\u003cbr\u003eWithout the help of those reaching out to others with mental illnesses, the will to live would be nothing but a suffocating flame for those in need of that comfort and reassurance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to help others who are trying their best to help themselves; I know how difficult it can be without knowing someone understands their struggles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a professional photographer for 7 years, working with major corporations and fantastic people to help them promote their products and ideas. Even during the height of my depression, I would bring my camera everywhere I went. And during my time in the hole, I discovered the use of portraying my mental disorder through artistic means. \u003cbr\u003eIt helped me show people what it was like, but most of all, it helped other people not just know, but \u003cem\u003efeel\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0like they\u0027re not alone.\u003cbr\u003eAfter my recovery, I created the Mental Disorders Photography Project. The feeling and experience various mental disorders portrayed through photography.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to continue this project, because I know it will help. With my full time job and responsibilities, I\u0027m finding it difficult to capture the true essence of a disorder. I want to interview people, I want to research and better understand the different mentalities of those who need the help of others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny amount you\u0027d generously contribute will go straight to the project.\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003esmallgold.photos"
