I\u0027m Cass, a writer who lives in western Virginia with two cats and a lot of books. My debut novel,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://penguinrandomhouse.com/books/549673/from-unseen-fire-by-cass-morris/9780756412241/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFrom Unseen Fire\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, Book One of the Aven Cycle, is now available from DAW Books\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. The Aven Cycle is an epic historical fantasy series -- essentially, I gave the ancient Romans magic to see what they would do with it and what alternate world it would spawn. In Aven, elemental magic shapes history as much as politics, religion, and war.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/21636fe4bda7b87c994a7e437ff35f3b/tumblr_otbh0gnBGb1qbl6pxo6_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn April 17th, 2018, a dream more than twenty years in the making came true. \u003cem\u003eFrom Unseen Fire\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0launched, and I officially became the novelist and creator of worlds that I\u2019ve wanted to be since I was eleven years old.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a huge step, and it\u2019s so, so exciting. But it\u2019s certainly not the end of the road -- nor a guarantee of success. I am so fortunate to have a marketing and publicity team behind me, but there\u2019s still a lot that falls on my shoulders.\u00a0And, cards on the table?\u00a0I\u0027m a writer working without a lot of the safety nets that typically make this career possible (like a high-paying day job or spousal support), so this Patreon also helps ease some of the burdens of life. For more details about specifically what I\u0027m using Patreon money for, check out my most recent\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/state-of-patreon-18288684\"\u003eState of the Patreon Address\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so lucky to have such supportive friends and fans who have cheered me on through this journey. Whoever you are and however you got here, I\u0027m delighted by you. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/f3ca169b95766884f97ededf6d37d3e7/tumblr_otbh0gnBGb1qbl6pxo2_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat has me so excited about Patreon is the chance it gives me to invite you all a little closer into the world of the Aven Cycle. There\u2019s so much I want to share -- and not all of it will fit into the novels! Character sketches, background drabbles, information about side characters, deleted scenes, exciting research\u2026 I want to share it all! And Patreon seems a perfect way to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut my Patreon posts are not limited to that world! My creative journey has been a long and sometimes circuitous one, and what I put out here will reflect all of that. I am, as the Aven Cycle shows, a nut for classical history and mythology -- so I\u0027ll do some retellings. I\u0027m a medieval and Renaissance studies scholar (what with the Shakespeare), so I\u0027ve got plenty to talk about there, too.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0was my first real fandom and is my lifelong love, so you\u0027d better believe you\u0027ll be getting reaction posts as the new movies come out. \u003cem\u003eHarry Potter\u003c/em\u003e is probably the fandom that\u0027s made me the most friends over the years: I honed my skills writing fanfic there, ran an online RPG, contributed to the \u003ca href=\"http://americanwizarding.tumblr.com/\"\u003eAmerican Wizarding blog\u003c/a\u003e, and worked on staff for \u003ca href=\"http://misti-con.org/\"\u003ea fandom-focused convention\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0And if you\u0027re an aspiring author seeking insights into the mystical and often obfuscated world of publishing. I fully intend to shed what light I can on the process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeriodically, I\u0027ll throw the question out to the community: What do you want to know more about? Join the team, and you\u0027ll be able to direct some of what I share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/b925fde219d3daa4a6a4c506da56b886/tumblr_otbh0gnBGb1qbl6pxo3_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for being with me. I could not have gotten this far without the support and encouragement that so many people have given me over the years, and I cannot wait to see what the future will bring.\u003cbr\u003e"
