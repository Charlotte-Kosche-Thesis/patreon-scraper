Here I am creating my Patreon account to ask those who love my work, creativity, and spirit to help support me and my kiddo in both of our artistic endeavors and in our lives together.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI was to thank everyone who has purchased my work and shared my songs in the past. I want to extend my love and gratitude to every hand I\u0027ve shaken, every song I\u0027ve sung, and each painting I\u0027ve talked to someone about at art fairs.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter 20 years of content creation I have become strong and confident in my vision of the world. I have had the support of other artists, mentors, and friends. Year after year I am asked to create unique art for the home based on my previous work. The challenges have been many and the successes have been amazing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI would not have the sense of pride in my work that I do without YOU. If you are reading this, then it\u0027s you who keeps me going. Every like, every share, every buy, every entry fee, every art fair... all of it. Alone I am just spinning plates in the dark, with my community I am a valuable voice speaking to the beauty of the earth and the importance of connection. Thank you.\n\u003c/span\u003e"
