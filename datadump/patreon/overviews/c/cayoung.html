With your support and feedback, I can make more and better stuff.\u00a0 As a patron, you\u0027ll get regular updates from me on things like updates to my shops on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/DorkaelSkunkworks\"\u003eEtsy\u003c/a\u003e (jewelry, artwork, esoterica) and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/people/dorkael?asc=u\"\u003eRedbubble\u003c/a\u003e (housewares and apparel), as well as any events where I\u0027ll be vending, and other good stuff.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo get comfortable, have a look around, and see what you think.\u00a0 I hope you\u0027ll join me on this adventure!"
