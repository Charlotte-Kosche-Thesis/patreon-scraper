Growing up\n watching her father, songwriter Jeffrey Steele, perform in night clubs \nand bars she was naturally drawn to music, but it was the lyrics that \nspoke to her.  It was words, again, that initially drew her to film. \n She would spend free time watching old movies, studying and analyzing \nher favorite lines. She eventually put pen to paper, filling stacks of \ncomposition notebooks with teenage angst and creating quirky and \nslightly deranged short stories for her friends and family. Her passion \nfor writing and film lead her to a degree in Cinema Arts from California\n State University, at Northridge.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn late 2011, Le\u2019Vasseur released her debut novel, \n\u003cem\u003eSilence \u0026amp; Noise: one girl\u2019s journey into insanity, \u003c/em\u003ea\n coming of age story about a girl\u2019s struggle with mental illness. She is\n an advocate for mental health awareness and has made it her mission to \nuse her writing as a tool to help break down the negative stigma \nclouding mental illness. The topic of mental health is ever present in \nher works and serves as constant inspiration for her strong, courageous,\n and inquisitive characters.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn early 2015, Le\u2019Vasseur launched Wander, a short story podcast about the human condition.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nShe is currently biting off more than she can chew; managing a band, \nrunning a creative agency with her husband, and coordinating charitable \nventures in Nashville, TN.",
