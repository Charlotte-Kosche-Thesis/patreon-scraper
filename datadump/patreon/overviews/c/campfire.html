    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWe believe every student should have access to the people who inspire them and can answer their questions\u003c/strong\u003e. That\u0027s why we created Campfire \u2013\u2013 an experiential media company, to provide the tools, content, and spaces that enable students to first realize their greatness and then challenges them to fully live in it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eOur first product is Ask Campfire\u003c/em\u003e: a video newsletter where student questions are answered by the professionals shaping industries and influencing culture. We\u2019ve interviewed 10+ professionals\u00a0(e.g., Dir. of Development at ESPN Films; a 2017 Forbes 30 under 30; Chief of Staff to NJ Congresswoman Bonnie Watson) who\u2019ve answered 100+ student questions, helping 300+ students. You might\u2019ve seen these videos floating around the internet. If not, check them out below (Bryan is hilarious, as you already know). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eOur second product is a live event \u003c/em\u003ewhere we create a space for students to connect, in-person with diverse professionals who are thriving in their fields, like-minded students, and us! Here students ask questions and gain the insight needed to help make the next step.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eOur third product is an intimate dinner\u003c/em\u003e where students and professionals are hand-selected to participate to engage on topics they care about. Here we dive deep into discussions that cover race, gender, and cultural issues that affect their lives at work and at school.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith each product, we encourage honest discussion, debate, and most importantly action.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe need your support to help ensure Campfire reaches as many students as possible\u003c/strong\u003e. Currently, all costs are coming out of our pocket. But we\u2019d like to make providing access to students a community effort. Your support will go towards production costs (e.g., equipment, hiring an editor, taping our upcoming season), and towards our future vision of creating content that delves into what it\u0027s like to work in an industry (e.g., behind the scenes look at what it takes to put on NY Fashion Week or the Sundance Film Festival etc.).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWe love that you are on this journey with us and appreciate your support.\u003c/strong\u003e Your contribution will go along way in helping us achieve our mission.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace and Love,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAmy + Bryan"
