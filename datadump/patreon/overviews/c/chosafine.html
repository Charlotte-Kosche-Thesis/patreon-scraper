    "summary": "Howdy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStipes Radio is a podcast network about computers, culture and emotions. Our hosts talk about the things we like and how they make us feel. We\u0027re friends talking about the things we like. We\u0027re ad free and plan to stay that way. This is independent media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(146, 205, 220);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003eStipes Radio also needs your help.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003eWhat I\u0027m asking is for your support in helping the network! I need your help to grow and expand the network.\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eour tech stack is a little all over the place due to me trying to keep costs down. I want to also invest in better equipment to help improve the quality of shows. I am currently running the network as my second job, as I currently work a full time day job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of right now, I make the websites for our shows, I create the show art for them, I manage scheduling for each show, I handle promotion and our social media pages, I edit each of the shows and I\u0027m in dire need of a nap \ud83d\ude05. Running a podcast network is a lot of work! It\u0027s a satisfying endeavor though and I\u0027m grateful for the platform I\u0027ve been given.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what I\u0027m offering you for your support in the network is a Stipes Radio Membership. Once a month I\u0027ll share things like how to bits on podcasting, to special podcast episodes that aren\u0027t available to the public. Essentially a behind the scenes look at the network, things I\u0027m working on, and sneak peeks at new shows that I\u0027m working on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo for all of you who decide to become a member: thank you. You\u0027re supporting independent media. You\u0027re supporting diverse content in an era when everything is a little male, white, and venture funded. Even if you can\u0027t contribute financially right now, you just listening and engaging with our shows is what matters most to me. It\u0027s wild to have the support I do, and I\u0027m grateful for every single listener I have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting me, however you do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Cristian"
