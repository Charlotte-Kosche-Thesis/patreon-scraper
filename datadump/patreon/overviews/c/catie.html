    "summary": "First off, THANK YOU for your continued support. I have been overwhelmed by the response I have received both in person and online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created a Patreon page so that I can help more people. Religion has had a devastating effect on my life and recovering from religion has been a difficult process. I\u0027ve felt alone and had no place to go... no support... no one to talk to -- and simply put, I don\u0027t want others to have to go through what I did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the weekend I attended my first ever atheist conference (ReasonCon15). Woo-Hoo! The weekend started out with an incredible presentation by Sarah Morehead highlighting the Recovering From Religion Hotline. As she wrapped up her presentation, she closed with some transcripts of the callers that had called in. Hearing these stories reminded me of my own personal story and it seemed to do the same for many others in the room. As she continued, slide after slide, sharing the transcripts of the fear and pain associated with religion, the entire room was brought to tears.. not just small tears streaming down your cheek.. sobbing. --Despite the pain, it wasn\u0027t just tears of sadness. There was a blend of excitement and passion for what the Recovering From Religion Hotline was doing to offer support to these individuals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt really hit home with me. I was inspired and driven to be the change I wanted to see, so bad. In that moment, I had made the decision to pursue secular activism and do what I can to make reality a better place. I am ready to promote science and reason. I am ready to change the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have three kids under three: Brody (2.5yrs), Maximus (1.5yrs), and Sagan (4 months).. So needless to say, finding the time to do things like this while still paying the bills is no easy task.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s where you come in. I have the ability, the passion, and the desire. I am absolutely dedicated to making a difference, and if you know me by now, you know I WILL do it, :)\u00a0If you are in a position to encourage me along this journey, your support would be greatly appreciated! I can\u0027t do this alone! Even $1 makes a difference! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I will start making videos exploring as many different avenues of secular activism as I can; all while documenting the journey and sharing my findings with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to highlight the extensive amount of ways YOU can get involved and become a Secular Activist too! I will be blogging, making videos, participating in web shows, podcast, even participating in a support group (that starts tonight!), to name a few.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me in making a difference because together we can change the world!\u003cbr\u003e"
