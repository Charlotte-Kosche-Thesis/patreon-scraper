    "summary": "Hello there. My name is Lewis Bond, but you may better know me as the guy behind \u003cstrong\u003eChannel Criswell. \u003c/strong\u003eOver the past few months I\u0027ve devoted my time to creating content that examines the art of cinema.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have a set guideline or formula that I\u0027ve stuck by and I hope to maintain that work ethic so that my content remains fresh, informative and entertaining. So far; the topics I have covered have ranged from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R7R0JHvvgo\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe importance and influence of The French New Wave\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0DotIqOD-E\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003euse of perspectives in films\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhdEsyHwQjk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ecreating an immersive environment in your film\u003c/a\u003e, as well as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r23wOiCHK5E\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eover hour long analyses deciphering the themes of movies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThese are just some of the videos with many more on the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/30/1430388377739/4981d70b-3f3e-41df-a694-26567076a274-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620\u0026amp;q=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;sharp=10\u0026amp;s=47401e0b5a7bdbeb0de1250ada247550\" style=\"width: 642px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt takes a very long time to research and put together one of these videos. Patreon is a fantastic way to help content creators and I believe that it can help me maintain high quality of my videos and further expand the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, we have to remember that these patrons are people, donating their hard-earned cash. So the important thing is that no matter what, all of my content will remain free. I\u0027m aware that many people don\u0027t have the money to be giving to people such as myself, so if you are unable to become a patron, no worries. Just by spreading the word, you have done enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut for those that do want to donate; I\u0027m putting the power in your hands. As you may notice, there are no rewards for higher donations, that is because I don\u0027t want to incentivise people to pay more with material goods or benefits. It\u0027s completely up to you. Whatever amount you think is reasonable to donate, I will be incredibly grateful for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2015/01/13/blue-is-the-warmest-colour-is-the-film-that-made-me-body-image-1421174064.png?resize=1000:*\u0026amp;output-quality=75\" style=\"width: 639px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a few reasons as to why I make these videos. \u00a0One is that I want to create videos that are an equal hybrid of education and entertainment. Youtube is a fantastic platform for this and by creating these videos I hope to achieve a wide audience that enjoys my content. My slogan is \u003cem\u003eArt Manifest. \u003c/em\u003eThis is because my aim is to teach everyone (including myself) about the art of cinema and hopefully give us a better understanding of the medium that we love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other reason is a personal, more long-term goal. You all know the cliche: \u003cstrong\u003e\"I\u0027ve always wanted to be a filmmaker\". \u003c/strong\u003eBut as generic a statement that is, it also rings true with myself. By gaining an audience through Youtube, I am developing a fanbase of people (hopefully like yourself) that are interested in my work. Eventually I plan to create short films for my channel and hopefully, make my main occupation creating feature films. It\u0027s a long way away yet, but this is only the beginning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://filmlefou.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/pierrot_le_fou_66.jpg\" style=\"width: 655px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!"
