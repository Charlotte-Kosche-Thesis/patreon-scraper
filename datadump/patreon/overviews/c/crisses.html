If you don\u0027t become a patron/sponsor, please make sure you FOLLOW us (+FOLLOW button or \u2026 menu -\u0026gt; Follow on the app) and spread the word so people with invisible and very personal mental health issues have a chance to see that there\u0027s an insider\u0027s resource for them. If you\u0027ve been following us for (OMG!) over 20 YEARS!! online \u2014 we\u0027re thrilled and awed and we really appreciate your support in the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Story\u003c/h2\u003eWe had been there for each other as long as we could remember, playing games and singing together as children, defending each other from the crap we went through. \u00a0We thought everyone had different voices in their head all the time.\u00a0In 1986, we discovered that we \"had other people in our head\" \u2014 we started to introduce ourselves to each other by name, share stories with each other, and try to figure out how to run a shared life together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt just about the same time, our life crashed and burned. We ended up in a mental hospital for 9 months and coming out the other side, we decided we needed to get our act together. We devoured everything we could about recovery, self-help, self-improvement, psychology, spirituality, holistic arts, and more. We sought out help, we figured things out. \u00a0We knew we were already an old soul, and thought maybe we should start to teach people about their massive blind-spots. \u00a0But we figured that in our early 20s we were also not going to be given the credibility and respect that we would need, and we should probably wait for the grey hair and wrinkles so people would take us seriously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://kinhost.org/art/bubblemap32304.png\" style=\"width: 339px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eIn 1996, on our first AOL website, we started to put our stories and poems online. People found us, we got fanmail from people who read our stories and information \u2014 people found them inspiring, helpful, people didn\u0027t feel so alone, had questions, and needed answers and we\u0027d email them back with anything we could send them to help out. Around 1999, we became the co-founder of an email list by and for people who are multiple \u2014 people with DID. By 2000, the website had morphed into Kinhost.org, an enormous community resource that now has over 400 pages of resource materials and articles, by and for multiples/plurals/persons with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID or MPD), and related disorders (OSDD or DDNOS \u0026amp; C-PTSD). By around 2004, article contributions dropped to a standstill, we got a full-time job, and we just continued answering fanmail \u2014 we also tried starting a podcast but our equipment wasn\u0027t good enough and we were stuck. \u00a0Then in 2006, we lost our job and started running our own business.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe wrote the first book in \u003cem\u003eThe Crissing Link Series \u2014\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0our this-life autobiography titled\u003cem\u003e Poetic License \u2014\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0in 2009. Since then we have done part of the work (and released in-progress drafts on LeanPub) for other books that will be in the series: \u003cem\u003eUnited Front\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e(self-help),\u00a0\u003cem\u003eMultiple Choice\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e(manifesto),\u00a0\u003cem\u003eSplit Decision\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e(memoir),\u00a0\u003cem\u003eCase Histories\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(past-life stories),\u00a0\u003cem\u003eCore Discoveries\u003c/em\u003e (philosophy), and \u003cem\u003eMissing Persons\u003c/em\u003e (polemic - an argument with popular doctrine). There\u0027s more where that came from: in addition to directly related podcast episodes (with the podcast rebooted and tons of ideas in the wings), we have many online course ideas in various stages of planning, several fiction books that are unfinished, (external) physical community project plans to draw up, etc. \u00a0We\u0027re not done with helping either our tribe, or the world as a whole.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://kinhost.org/art/leanpub_drafts.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy We Need Your Support\u003cbr\u003eWe got most content and books done during serious dips in the economy (\"Well, no jobs are coming in during the holidays, might as well write....\") and with supplemental financial support from others (for which we are, and will always be, eternally grateful). Our job is 7-days-a-week, and there\u0027s no end in sight. If we take a week off, you can see it on the balance sheet. No vacations, no creativity-replenishing moments, no chance to get into a creative zone, and no chance to be ourselves.  We decided that had to stop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport or no support, we\u0027ve\u00a0changing our business to more and more life coaching, which means taking nearly all other money-making projects off the table. We can\u0027t be spread in so many directions. We coach multiples, people with mental health issues, writers and people looking to switch careers. We don\u0027t need that to be supported (we just need more customers). \u00a0However, to support the other full-time job of content creation \u2014 our free podcast, kinhost.org, and working on our books-in-progress \u2014 is where we need your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e12 years in business, and no end in sight \u2014 unless we make it end. \u00a0It\u0027s ended. \u00a0Tying up our final projects, reclaiming time for our tribe, letting us take our mask off and be ourselves again. \u00a0We need your support to be able to survive while being the pioneer our community desperately needs.\u00a0We\u0027re going to take a pot shot that there are people out there who are so interested in the cause, and the content we \u003cstrong\u003ehave to be fully ourselves\u003c/strong\u003e to produce, that they\u2019re willing to support a tiny portion of our full-time transition away from wearing the Criss-mask to run a design business 24/7.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat will we do with the money?\u003c/h2\u003eOur patrons will be freeing our time up to work on several exceptionally important projects:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFinishing \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Crissing Link\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e books - let\u0027s face it, what we get from \"presales\" while working on the book is pocket change. \u00a0We get 2-4 sales a month and that\u0027s about $40-60 at most. \u00a0We\u0027re not expecting to be on the New York Times Bestseller List. \u00a0We want to help real people with real issues \u2014 even if it\u0027s 1 person it\u0027s worthwhile. \u00a0We\u0027ve already helped hundreds if not thousands with our website. \u00a0But people in hiding are difficult to reach out to.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://kinhost.org\"\u003ehttp://kinhost.org\u003c/a\u003e - Encouraging Internal Community - community resources - is always a work-in-progress: with more support we can \u003cstrong\u003ework on completing unfinished and stub articles\u2026\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe United Front Boot Camp and the podcast all \u003cem\u003ealso\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0hosted at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kinhost.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\"\u003ehttp://kinhost.org\u003c/a\u003e we need more support so we can \u003cstrong\u003efully cross-index everything\u003c/strong\u003e with tags and cross-reference resources between different mediums.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWith your support we have brought back the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMany Minds on the Issue\u003c/em\u003e podcast\u003c/strong\u003e as a serious endeavor rather than something we tried recording in our car during commutes \u2014 but we need more support to make sure we can publish regularly! \u00a0All hosted at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kinhost.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\"\u003ehttp://kinhost.org\u003c/a\u003e!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://crisses.org\"\u003ehttp://crisses.org\u003c/a\u003e - stories, poetry, etc. - creative endeavors. \u00a0Got some great ideas for \u003cstrong\u003emental-health-positive and mental-difference-positive fiction\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0Need support to put it into writing though!!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOnline courses - like a prerecorded or live United Front Bootcamp \u2014 or better yet \u003cstrong\u003ethe full United Front program\u003c/strong\u003e that we\u0027re working on. \u00a0With your ongoing support, this type of work can become our full-time job....\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAttend conferences, trainings, and certification courses\u003c/strong\u003e to expand knowledge base and add more disciplines and information into the work that informs the movement. \u00a0Examples: selfcompassion.org MSC trainings, shamanic counseling, shamanic soul retrieval training, etc. \u00a0Bring a peer perspective to these forums as well as bring information back to the community and into our writing and practices.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRevive a \u003cstrong\u003ecommunity forum\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0for multiples\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreate the plans for community centers of Harmony \u2014 and create one or gift the idea to the world.

It doesn\u0027t usually put food in the fridge or keep the lights on. We\u0027ve already been able to free up a little time to fix up what\u0027s already there and make some updates and start creating. At higher milestones, we\u0027ll be able to become a full-time content creation machine and start unloading knowledge and ideas en masse. No, we won\u0027t run out of ideas, I assure you! \u00a0This world has only seen the tip of our iceberg of helpful knowledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we make it beyond the transition to full-time, then we get to start to delegate routine and mundane tasks to others. While we\u0027ve got a very diverse skillset in just about everything needed to create the content \u2014 graphic design, formatting, video and audio editing, captioning, getting it into the forums for display, etc. \u2014 other people can do that stuff instead and we can work on more content creation that only we can do: writing, speaking, recording, filming, teaching, answering questions, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecific expenses related to online content production: website hosting (I run a dedicated server, and we just upgraded to a new server), podcast and video hosting, internet connection (it would be nice to actually have a house or apartment for that internet connection to be in), equipment purchases or upgrades (like lighting for videos so I don\u0027t have to film outside or a real camera, a good webcam, etc. \u2014 hopefully for after taking care of our camera trigger), virtual assistant and per-gig services, software, webinar service, captioning services, etc. \u00a0Some expenses are recurring, others are one-shot expenses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have much content that needs to be made more accessible and updated, such as taking an article and making it into a video like this one:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H4WQUZv7JV0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Us\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\tNinja Swiss-Army-Knife or Revolutionary Brainstormer \u2014 you decide.
