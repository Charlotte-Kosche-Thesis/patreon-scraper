    "summary": "Hi. Thanks for reading my Patreon page. I wasn\u0027t going to have one of these, I feel a bit awkward about even the notion that anyone might like to pay me for my videos but incredible though it sounds, I\u0027ve had requests from viewers to set one up.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, no pressure whatsoever, no need to join in if you don\u0027t want to but if for some reason you enjoy my videos enough that you\u0027d like to buy me a virtual cup of tea by way of saying thanks then this is the page on which to do it. And if you do, then thank you very much indeed but mostly thanks for watching. Cheers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are some rewards listed on the right hand side of this page for various \"tiers\" of donation but please note you\u0027re not obliged to give any of those amounts - you can choose your own. It\u0027s just that those who donate at or above a specific tier then get the perks as listed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor absolute clarity, I should probably add that I consider Patreon just a way for people to let me know they enjoy the videos rather than anything else. There probably won\u0027t be much, if anything, in the way of extra content here beyond that mentioned in the $5 reward tier.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPS If you\u0027ve never done Patreon before, fear not - you can set limits on how much you spend and of course withdraw your patronage at any time (though of course you then lose the perks)"
