In the past I\u0027ve mulled the possibility of crowdfunding for one-off projects or reporting series that require more travel or time for research than I can afford. This is something I\u0027m still considering down the road, but I don\u0027t really have it in me to plan, market and execute a bigger project until I achieve more financial stability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me gets you regular access to everything I create (my month-to-month workflow varies -- I\u0027ll write anything between two and 10 pieces commissioned by editors -- but four to six pieces per month is pretty typical). If you pledge more, you can get access to essays, fiction and other non-commissioned work I create. In the future, this may include videos, podcasts, etc. I\u0027m also offering editing/consulting services to those who can pledge more and want feedback on their own work.\u003cbr\u003e"
