We started this bizarrely niche endeavor at the beginning of this season fully believing that no none would every listen to it. The fact that you\u0027re even at this page means you deserve our thanks. We can\u0027t tell you how much we appreciate the community you guys have started to build over the last few months. We\u0027re starting this Patreon simply to offset our operating costs. For now, we will offer simple rewards (extra audio, shout outs on the podcast, bonus episodes, a rant reel). As we expand, we\u0027ll use this as a vehicle to expand more exclusive features (building out our stat database, upgrading equipment, expanding our schedule). But ultimately, any money we get from this is going to be poured straight back into making CBC better for everyone."
