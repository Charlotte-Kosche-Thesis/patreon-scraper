    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is ClassicGlue:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot to long ago there was a pretty awesome website and app that offered cool FREE swag for participation. It was fun, built a community of members in the millions, and was promptly sold to another company in 2012. This transition to new owners was fraught with problems both with the site and the app, content would be cut, user support would decline, and promise made, would be broken. Within one year the new owners announced by year\u0027s end it would be shutting down operations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring this time of impending doom, a few dozen core members gathered together to discuss what could be done to save their beloved site. Well talk is cheap, and it was going nowhere. So I alone, took it upon myself to rebuild what was best about the site and community we shared together. Working in secret for six months, and with the help of many dedicated volunteers we slowly but surely cobbled together\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.classicglue.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eClassicGlue.com\u003c/a\u003e  our new home. With a team of beta testers hard at play, we would officially open in August 2014. When that \u0027other\u0027 company finally closed the servers and turned out the lights in Dec 2014, \u003ca href=\"http://www.classicglue.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eClassicGlue.com\u003c/a\u003e would be in operation 1 year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is ClassicGlue:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eMichael Satterfield, the creator of ClassicGlue, I am 50 and disabled, but I don\u0027t let that stop me from creating fun and enjoying life. In my fifty years I have worn many creative hats, from baker/Chocolatier; to graphic designer \u0026amp; prop maker; to\u00a0filmmaker, an animator, a writer, a director, and yes even actor, in where I have appeared in well over 500 productions from Star Trek: Voyager; to Seinfeld; to The Rock and Air Force One among others. I love creating, being creative and sharing that passion with others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is ClassicGlue raising money for:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSO HERE WE ARE in 2017, Thank you! And while it\u0027s has been a successful and I think, productive two years of beta operation, I also work fulltime Universal Studios\u00a0Hollywood and my time for ClassicGlue during those days is limited and I do my best. Unfortunately, during that time I was not able to save or raise the necessary funds required to fully complete several core features of \u003ca href=\"http://www.classicglue.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eClassicGlue.com\u003c/a\u003e , or to offer an App that so many have been asking for. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, let\u0027s get right to it: Today I am asking you to help \u003ca href=\"http://www.classicglue.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eClassicGlue.com\u003c/a\u003e?\u00a0First, so that I may hire more advanced tecnical staff to help me with those areas I, myself am not able to code myself. Presently your \u003ca href=\"http://www.classicglue.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eClasssicGlue\u003c/a\u003e team consist of two main people David Bloomquist Jr. who does most of the content creation with the help of occasional volunteers, and Myself, who does everything else. I handle all the backend technical aspects of the site; creating module that make it all work; processing content requests; to handling support requests. This is ALL FOR YOU guys!! For Gluers\u0027 by Gluers\u0027. There is no faceless corporation behind the scenes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo How will the money be used:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs soon as there is sufficient funds to begin farming out work, l will concentrate my efforts on completing each of these high priority core items:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* \u003cstrong\u003eUser Profiles\u003c/strong\u003e that can be seen by other users.\u003cbr\u003e* \u003cstrong\u003ePrivacy settings\u003c/strong\u003e to control what is seen by other users.\u003cbr\u003e* \u003cstrong\u003eFollowing Users\u003c/strong\u003e who share the same interests.\u003cbr\u003e* \u003cstrong\u003eFavorite\u003c/strong\u003e content which is different than liking it.\u003cbr\u003e* Improved Like-Dislike system, so you can tell when you have liked content.\u003cbr\u003e* \u003cstrong\u003eNotifications\u003c/strong\u003e, stay updated on the activity of users being followed; on replies to comments made; and activity of content favorited.\u003cbr\u003e* \u003cstrong\u003eLeaderboard Rankings\u003c/strong\u003e, see the top contributors to content of interest.\u003cbr\u003e* \u003cstrong\u003eStickers Program\u003c/strong\u003e, create system for awarding stickers, viewing sticker collections, and ordering stickers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow soon do we need the funds?:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile there is no physical deadline we are up against, I would like to get these core features completed ASAP! It has been to long without them, and that is not good enough anymore. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy does this means so much to me?:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, let me tell you what I discovered. That website, of not to long ago, was pretty dang terrific. It created a second home; a second family, for millions of users connected across the globe through a common interest. It did not dawned on me until it was gone that many of the great friendships and bonds I had made were with many whom are permantly homebound, injured or disabled in someway, and this site was their main point of social contact with the outside world. It is for these wonderful people that \u003ca href=\"http://www.classicglue.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eClassicGlue.com\u003c/a\u003e is dedicated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGetglue is gone, and it is never coming back, regardless of who owns the name. TVtag did not care about the users, they folded and sold it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.classicglue.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eClassicGlue.com\u003c/a\u003e is something special.
