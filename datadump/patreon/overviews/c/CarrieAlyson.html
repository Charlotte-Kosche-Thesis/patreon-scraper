    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just an artist approaching her 40s with a lot of wanderlust and a rekindled desire to return to making art into play. I have a creative job (that I love\u2014senior graphic designer for my local Girl Scout Council) so I spend a lot of time looking at art as work. Work that I genuinely enjoy, but work nonetheless, and it bears the sometimes tiring and stressful mindset of \"\u003cem\u003ethis is something I have to do to be an adult and pay the bills\u003c/em\u003e\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI missed doing art for fun. I had kind of forgotten \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e to do art for fun. Before my current design job, I did a lot of freelance design and illustration while working other full-time jobs. If I was doing art, it was saddled with the baggage of needing to make money on it. I never really made art just for myself anymore, I was always creating for the client or for what I thought my audience wanted. And while I had once thrived in this mindset, it just wasn\u0027t working for me anymore. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHappily, things changed. I was able to trade up to an in-house design position, with the luxury of a 9-5 schedule and an income that I can modestly live on. I suddenly had free time! To do my own art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I didn\u0027t, at least not right away, because it still felt like work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been spending the past couple years figuring out how to experience creativity and art as \u003cem\u003eplay\u003c/em\u003e again. Learning how to get away from the idea that my art has to make money, or be for someone else to enjoy. I\u0027ve made a lot of progress, but it\u0027s still a constant battle to keep myself out of the \"work\" mindset.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere am I at right now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current artistic path is actually a hiking trail. I grew up hiking with my family and friends and got an early appreciation for nature and being outdoors. I also love botanical art and drawing organic forms, so plein air sketching and painting were the natural conclusion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, on my year along this path, I\u0027ve sat at the local beach and painted the same rocky cove more times than I can recall. I\u0027ve explored three National Parks for unforgettable sights, hikes, and inspiration. I did a road trip down the California coast, and saw whales and landscapes of alien-looking rock erosion, and spent two days at the beaches just painting. I developed a new personal art style, and let it continue to evolve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not sure how much farther this path leads, or where I\u0027m going next, but I hope you\u0027ll come with me on my journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the money for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour financial support will allow me to travel to more locations outside of the SF Bay Area and find new sources of inspiration for both art and the paths I\u0027ll follow on this journey. Next year I\u0027m hoping to visit either Banff or Denali National Park, or possibly Iceland.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support also funds the purchase of art supplies, like watercolors, paper, and brushes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be posting photos of my finished paintings, my sketches, and my nature journal. I\u0027ll also post work-in-progress and behind-the-scenes photos and videos. I\u0027m also be available to chat if you have questions about methods or techniques, or anything, really. I love to share and teach, so feel free to start a conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you again for your support!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
