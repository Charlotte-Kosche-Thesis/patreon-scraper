    "summary": "Hi my name is Kate and I curate and lovingly tend a site designed solely to support new and existing mothers in my home town on Cheltenham in the UK.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cheltenhammaman.co.uk\"\u003eCheltenhamMaman\u003c/a\u003e (Maman being mother in French) is primarily a blog and a website where mothers from all over the world can congregate and contribute free from judgement. The mantra of CheltenhamMaman is that there is no right way to be a mother, only your way. So long as your child is loved, happy, healthy and safe you are doing an amazing job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI pour hours of my life into the blog and I know it\u0027s a huge resource for mothers locally. But with three children of my own (aged 15, 13 and 2) I worry that mums can rely to heavily on the virtual world to give them a sense of purpose, community and belonging. Without real, physical relationships with like minded women we can become lonely and fall into a comparison black hole. So it\u0027s for this reason that I create events to get mums together. I run a networking group for mums who freelance and work from home and I jointly lead a free walk around the park - Mums come with their pushchairs (strollers), toddlers, and baby bumps for some fresh air, exercise and the opportunity to make new friends and off load some of the pressures of holding it all together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron you will enable me to keep up this work and continue to support women as they adjust to their new lives as parents. Over time I hope to roll the service out beyond my locality but for now take a minute to read\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cheltenhammaman.co.uk/testimonials/\"\u003esome of the testimonials I have had from people I\u0027ve helped to date.\u003c/a\u003e I can\u0027t tell how grateful I am for any support you can offer.\u003cbr\u003e"
