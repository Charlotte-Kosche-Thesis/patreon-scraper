It makes installing and configuring game servers easier than ever before with its sleek and friendly user interface, complete with mobile support to let you look after your servers on the go. Use the scheduler to automate backups, easily manage your data with an in-browser file manager and editor, and keep your servers up-to-date with a single click.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt supports both Windows and Linux servers, you can even mix-and-match as you please! Soon you\u0027ll be able to manage all of your different game servers from one place regardless of OS or the type of server. (Centralised management is coming soon in a future update, help speed this up by supporting us!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this campaign is for our supporters is to help us improve the rate at which AMP is developed. The money raised will be used to hire additional staff or contractors and purchase additional hardware and servers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou don\u0027t need an AMP licence to support us, and some backer tiers even include AMP licences to go along with them! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe goal is to make sure that everyone benefits from this campaign. There will not be features in AMP that are held back exclusively to supporters. You don\u0027t need to worry about losing out because you don\u0027t want to be a Patron.\u003c/strong\u003e"
