Besides being huge amounts of fun to make, Cottonstar gives us a great platform to work from in terms of\u00a0encouraging and expanding the ready-to-explode comics scene in South Africa.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe launched Cottonstar in August 2011, and have never looked back. It\u0027s been an amazing journey. There aren\u0027t a whole lot of other webcomics coming from SA at the moment, and we\u0027d love to see that number grow. There\u0027s so much talent here - people just need to start telling their stories! Hopefully Cottonstar is only the first of many.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003eFAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Cottonstar?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCottonstar is a webcomic set in a post-apocalyptic, dystopian Southern Africa. The story follows the adventures of a moody lad named Renier, who accidentally got himself hired as a crew member aboard the pirate ship named Cottonstar. Things just kind of go downhill for him from there... or do they?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will you be updating (and what does that mean to my wallet)?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe aim to have a page up each Friday night/Saturday morning (GMT+2), so 4 per month. This means if you pledge $1 per comic, you\u0027ll be charged $4 at the end of the month. Sometimes, due to circumstances beyond our control, we might skip a page or update at odd times. You will only be charged for the content we actually put up, so if we miss a page and only upload three that month, you\u0027ll only be charged for three, and not the four we planned to upload.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I set a limit to how much I get charged per month?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes! You can do this by logging in, going to the creator\u2019s Patreon page, and clicking the blue \u201cEdit Patronage\u201d button.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis way, you can put a cap on your pledge amount, and don\u0027t need to worry about overspending if we upload more content than you were anticipating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOops, I need my money for something else!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I cancel my pledge?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, as long as it hasn\u0027t been charged to your card yet (usually the end of each month). You can do this by logging in, going to the creator\u2019s Patreon page, and clicking the blue \u201cEdit Patronage\u201d button. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you must. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ee-e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I do a once-off donation?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is looking into adding this feature, due to popular demand.

While the content of the Cottonstar site has been, is, and will always be free, we still incur running costs for the site, maintenance, advertising, art materials and such. We also spend a lot on printing each chapter and buying booth space at conventions and expos. Travel costs for two people also add up really fast if the event is far away! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCottonstar is a love project and takes up most of our spare time, but we would love to be able to turn it into a full-time project. That would be pretty neat.
