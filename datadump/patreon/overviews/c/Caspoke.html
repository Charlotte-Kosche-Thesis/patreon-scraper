    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWELCOME TO MY PATREON, EVERYONE!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Lucas, I\u0027m from Brazil!!\u003cbr\u003eI started \u00a0cosplaying back in 2009, when I was 16. Even though I graduated in Software Engineer, my passion for art has been part of my life since I can remeber. And that\u0027s what I want to do for life!\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was a kid, I was addicted to the TV Show \"Art Attack\". I used to make almost every crazy stuff I could from there.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also been drawing and creating characters since I can remember. Today I can make realistic pencil drawings and digital paintings - one of my secret dreams is to become a videogame concept artist! (ok, this is not that secret)\u003cbr\u003eMusic is also a kind of art, so it sure has also been a huge part of my life. I started playing piano when I was a kid and on my 15th birthday I got a violin. At 19 I started singing in a local Opera Group called \"Canto Dell\u0027arte\" (love you, Glaugosto!), and this whole opera thing gave me oportunities to experience\u00a0real stages. And it was AWESOME!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO, WHY COSPLAY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCosplay simply put together all my artistic passions. I can draw, I can build armors, weapons, I can sew my own clothing, I can make my own wigs, I can be ON STAGE! Everything in just one cosplay!\u003cbr\u003eSo far\u00a0I\u0027ve won 16 cosplay national and international competitions. In the past years I\u0027ve been invited to judge some cosplay contests around Brazil and it has been amazing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027M ALSO KNOWN FOR MY WIG-MAKING SKILLS!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the end of 2016, I started taking wig commisions and created \"CaspokeWigs\". I\u0027ve been studying a lot since then and I\u0027ve learned so much after every wig I made! I even started developing my own techniques.\u003cbr\u003eI love making custom lace-front wigs and feel so proud and happy when someone wins a cosplay contest wearing one of my wigs!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT CAN I OFFER?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m creating new stuff all the time. And as I do it, I take pictures. Here on patreon I\u0027ll be posting progress pictures of what I\u0027m doing, so you can see the construction, materials and techniques I use. I also make video tutorials of all kinds, from sewing to makeup and wig making.\u003cbr\u003eMost of content is wig related, so expect a lot of progress pictures, mini-tutorials (for all tiers), complete wig tutorials (for Wigmaker tiers), and even downloadable patterns that you can use when making your own gravity defying wig!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI want you to know that you can do whathever you wanna do, the way you feel more confortable with, using materials you can afford! What really matters is the final result. And if you understand the foundation of things, you can do anything in the most creative ways!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW AND WHEN DO PATRONS GET THEIR REWARDS?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eProgress pictures, patterns, and all cosplay, makeup, sewing and some wig tutorials are gonna be posted on patreon\u0027s feed. That means you get access to them as soon as you start pledging! You also get access to the same kind of content from previous months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhysical rewards and rewards sent to you by email (like high res photos, prints and photo/video wig tutorials) are gonna be sent by the 5th of the following month, when all the payments should already have been processed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH THE MONEY?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m sure you guys know that cosplay is an expensive hobby.\u003cbr\u003eI make everything from scratch, so all the money I receive from patreon will be converted on tools \u0026amp; materials and, hopefully, better photo/video equipment. This way I can always give better quality content every month!\u003cbr\u003eOne of my dream jobs is to become a\u00a0professional wigmaker, creating crazy stuff for Hollywood or Broadway. For that, I believe I still have a lot to study and practice. And that\u0027s why your support is so much important to me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledging starts at $1 and means A LOT!! I hope all of you guys learn a lot and enjoy your time here on my patreon!\u003cbr\u003e"
