For the past five years, producer/host Chip Walton, Bryon Adams, Don Osborn and our crew of chopping and brewing friends and co-hosts have taken you into homebreweries, craft breweries and home kitchens around the world. We want to keep the party going in 2018 and beyond with more videos, blog posts, and recipes for food, beer and other fermented beverages. But we need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Patreon patronage directly supports the show and will help us offset costs of production, equipment upgrades, and ingredients. While we truly love producing the show and supporting the community that has been built around it, the time and cost of making sure the production maintains a regular schedule and high-quality content requires support from those who most appreciate the effort. If you have enjoyed our videos and shared in our joy of discovering new libations and cookery, please help us keep the show strong and moving forward into new realms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, we hope to build a dependable budget for production including travel expenses to get us to more places inside and outside of the U.S. to tell the stories of homebrewers, craft brewers and lovers of good food. Please see our Goals and Rewards sections for more information on what we can offer our supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are deeply appreciative of our fans and patrons.\u00a0 CHOP FOR CHOP, BREW FOR BREW!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KKNpIjH.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
