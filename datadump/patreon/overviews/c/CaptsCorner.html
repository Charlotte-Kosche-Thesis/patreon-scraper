    "summary": "First of all... a big THANK YOU for being here. Even if you decide not to donate, the fact that you enjoy the content we produce on this channel to come check out this page means a lot to me. So THANK YOU again for your support of the channel. I aim to continue to produce content that keeps you coming back to the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started this page when the channel hit 1000 subscribers. For many of you, we\u0027re still very near that milestone, for others, you (hopefully) find it hard to fathom when the channel was that small (hey, a man can wish, right?). I do not produce content on YouTube for the money, and frankly, any YouTuber who does is foolish. 90% of YouTube accounts have fewer than 100 subscribers, and at the time I launched this page, I had made a total of 113.96 USD from YouTube... and have put out 96 videos! That\u0027s roughly 1.19 USD per video... with each video taking several hours to record, edit, render and upload. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI say all this to show that YouTube is not about the money. It\u0027s about the feeling you get when someone comments on your video and tells you how much they love what you\u0027ve created. It\u0027s about having an outlet to share something you love with complete strangers. It\u0027s about setting and reaching goals, building friendships and enjoying gaming with people I never would have met otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it is this last topic, the meeting and gaming with new people aspect of YouTube that has set me to launch this page. I want to create dedicated servers for the games we, as a community, enjoy playing. And with the launch of Space Engineers\u0027 new multiplayer code, the time is right for us to join together in this game we love so much. As the community grows, we can expand into other games and continue to play together as a community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make this come true, I\u0027m asking ya\u0027ll to help foot the bill. For the cost of a 20 oz coke every month, you can help this poor cop fund the servers. For now, we will rent a server, but once certain goals are met, I will purchase and run dedicated servers off of a physical server here in my house (eat your heart out Hillary!). So please, donate today, and join this wonderful community as we continue to grow! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for your interest in and support of this channel!\u003cbr\u003e"
