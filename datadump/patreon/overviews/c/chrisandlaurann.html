    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eHi Friends!\u003c/h3\u003e\nWelcome to our Patreon! Thank you so much for being here! We are both violinists living in Los Angeles and met each other while doing a recording session for the Black Eyed Peas. Based on discovering our similar musical abilities and passions, we decided to start a group together and named it Chris and Laurann (creative, right??).\u00a0We are both very passionate about our craft and feel that everyone can experience joy, emotion, and healing through the power of music. We want to be able to share this with as many people as possible and hopefully contribute to making the world a better place through our music! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat do we create??\u003c/h3\u003e\nWe mainly enjoy creating exciting and fun arrangements of popular songs (but also plan on producing some original material soon as well!). We love making videos for our music that is entertaining as well as visually compelling. We are so grateful to have the opportunity to share all of this with you and truly appreciate your consideration to be a Patron! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere will your money go?\u003c/h3\u003eWith your help we will be able to enhance the quality and production value of our music and arrangements. You will help us to be able to take the ideas in our minds and make them into a reality! The money we raise will go towards things like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003egear to enhance production quality (cameras, recording software, microphones, editing software, etc...)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003erecording studio time\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003efilming locations\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003etravel fees\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003einstrument maintenance\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCD/album production\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003emerch production (hopefully we can get this going sometime soon in the future and make available to you all!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003elicensing and copyright fees (to be able to safely distribute our music to you) \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eEventually we would like to raise enough money to be able to hire a crew to help us as well!
