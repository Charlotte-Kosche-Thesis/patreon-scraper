    "summary": "The Real Batman Chronology Project (www.therealbatmanchronologyproject.com) examines the complexity of serialized multi-authored superhero comic books by tracking the narrative continuity of DC Comics via the lens of Batman, plotting each of his appearances into detailed timelines. This is no easy task because superhero universes exist in comics as a vast collection of interconnected serialized fictions\u2014and all of these titles tell an ongoing \u00fcber-story in which the events and characters of said titles all exist in the same shared world, directly influencing each other. Despite this, DC doesn\u0027t tell you in what order to read them. This forms an intricate puzzle that has to be pieced together. I\u0027m very proud to say that the Real Batman Chronology has become the premier destination on the internet for all questions related to figuring out this Batman continuity puzzle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy the Patreon, though? I\u0027ve been doing the Real Batman Chronology and companion disCONTINUITY blog since 2009. The server isn\u0027t cheap. Having received very little ad revenue, it has been a struggle to keep the project up to date (and hosted online), especially with so much content. And if you\u0027ve been on my site, you\u0027ve seen that there is a TON OF CONTENT\u2014an almost never-ending stream of content thanks to the very nature of the beast that is timeline-building. Over the years, the site has grown exponentially\u2014as has the workload. The Real Batman Chronology Project is and always has been a labor of love for me,\u00a0but maintaining the site takes considerable time, time which takes me away from other ventures that provide me with a living wage.\u00a0If you value the Real Batman Chronology Project and wish to see it continue into the future at the same pace and with the same quality, please consider giving a little donation. It would be much appreciated. Even offering $1 a month would go a long way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCollin Colsher\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
