And that\u2019s fine with us, because we\u2019re the awkward creative-types who prefer to stay behind-the-camera (if you see us acting, it\u2019s because the production ran out of money or someone went home sick with explosive diarrhea. Sometimes both!) \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFor over 17 years, we\u2019ve produced content in the Philadelphia area with the goal of opening peoples\u2019 mouths with laughter and filling their bellies with wisdom. We write strong female protagonists, LGBT heroes, and diverse ensembles. Many of our cast and crew members have received their first paychecks as artists from our projects, and a few of them have even moved on to win Academy Awards and work on\u00a0\u003cem\u003eOrange is the New Black, Master of None,\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eCreed,\u003c/em\u003e to name a few.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you are new here, we encourage you to click on our writing reel above or visit\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.cinevore.com\"\u003eCinevore.com\u003c/a\u003e/\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://YouTube.com/CinevoreFilm\"\u003eYouTube.com/CinevoreFilm\u003c/a\u003e to watch the hundreds of hours of award-winning content we\u2019ve produced, including \u003cem\u003eNerd vs. Geek, Moot, OverAnalyzers, \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eSuper Plumber Bros\u003c/em\u003e, as well as select episodes of \u003cem\u003eLiving in 8-Bits \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eVictorian Cutout Theatre.\u003c/em\u003e We\u0027ve released most of our work for free online, with the occasional Kickstarter to fund the manufacture of DVDs/books and exclusive merchandise for our most loyal fans.
