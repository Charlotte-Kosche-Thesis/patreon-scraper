    "summary": "I write music that celebrates the natural world, through a slightly psychedelic lens. I started a band in 1997 called Gaia Consort and we morphed into Bone Poets Orchestra. All of my ten released cds have been outside the label system. I\u0027ve been writing music since 1976. We started our own Adopt-A-Song plan in 1992 and people along the way have seen fit to allow me to make ten cds. It\u0027s always my hope that what we do is adding something to the soundtrack of people\u0027s lives, the way so many great musicians have added to mine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe just finished a\u00a0 collection of new songs under the title \"Edge of the Western World\" and now I\u0027m trying to move into a new focus on on my effort - to get the music into films and television shows, as well as record compositions outside the scope of the band - including orchestral pieces,\u00a0 and to use the basic tracks that we already have to make instrumental versions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on the arrangement, it usually costs me about $1,200 to record a song. I\u0027ve been really fortunate to work with outstanding, world class musicians over the over the years. I put all my music up on the website for free, in mp3 format. You can hear it at \u003ca href=\"http://www.bonepoets.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.christopherbingham.com\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best way to see if you think this music is worth supporting, is to go have a listen - either on the front page video, or at the website. In any case, enjoy the wonders!\u003cbr\u003e"
