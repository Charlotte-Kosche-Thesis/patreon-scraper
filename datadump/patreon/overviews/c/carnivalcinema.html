He discovered circus as a young teenager and by the time Hamish was 14 he had decided that it was what he wanted to do with life - He was training with the genre-pushing Rock n Roll Circus from Brisbane and going to the National Circus Festival (Hamish didn\u0027t miss one Tassie Festival from 1996 - 2013). In 1999 Hamish attended the first NICA (The National Institute of Circus Arts) Training Project and worked for such companies (as either a performer or trainer) as Circus Oz, The Flying Fruit Fly Circus, Strut n Fret Production House, Spaghetti Circus and The Happy Sideshow whilst performing around Australia and festivals around the world. At the age of 21 Hamish came off a tall unicycle and broke his arm. Badly. With his good arm intact, he picked up a video camera and started documenting the world he lived in and the incredible people within it: his tribe. That was 2002.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.carnivalcinema.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/7-doights-MCF-2015.jpg?resize=1170%2C813\u0026amp;ssl=1\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHarley Mcleish \u0026amp;\u00a0Anne-Marie Godin, Mullum Circus Festival\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then Hamish has been documenting the Australian circus community, as \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarnival Cinema\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, it has turned into his lifelong project. In the place of funding from government film or arts bodies he learned his trade and paid the bills making promotional material for companies and performers. This, and his strong\u003cbr\u003erelationships within the circus and broader arts community allowed him to capture incredibly intimate interviews, jaw-dropping unguarded moments, touch-and-go \u0027behind-the-scenes\u0027 footage and beautifully candid still photographs.\u003cbr\u003eHaving \u0027grown up\u0027 in the circus world - Hamish gets unique access and perspective to tell its stories from the \u0027inside\u0027.
