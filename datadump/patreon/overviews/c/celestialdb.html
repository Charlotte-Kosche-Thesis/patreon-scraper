    "summary": "I\u0027m building the largest open source Altium Database, it\u0027s becoming pretty popular but it\u0027s getting rather expensive to run! I\u0027d love to be able to spend more time updating the database and improving the desktop application that supports it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e Why Support the Database?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to be able to add a whole bunch more features, like automatic local replication to MySQL, more suppliers, auto-updating of in-stock parts and prices, and much much more. As I work for myself, I don\u0027t have a lot of free time. However, with your patronage, I can set time aside every week to work on the database and desktop management application as well as keeping the Azure instances paid for. As long as my time is paid for, it doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s client work or work on the database.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Can You Support the Database?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re able to support the database at just $1/month it will help cover the operating costs, you\u0027ll also get to see patron only posts, which I intend to use as a blog for the database. I\u0027m offering high reward levels to those who can spare a little more money each month - which give you the option to either have footprints added for parts you need each month, or have me work on a specific feature/issue you want to see added.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of users are students, so I completely understand that $1/month can be a stretch for you - any contribution is extremely welcome and I\u0027m thankful to have you on board.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a community, we\u0027ve successfully crowdfunded a code signing certificate to make it safer and easier to use the desktop software, however, with this is going to come even more expenses for me as the Azure instance gets more and more users. A year ago we had just 50 users, today we have over 1000.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for just taking the time to read this page, if you are using the database and are in a position to fund its growth and development - \u003cstrong\u003ethank you\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Mark Harris"
