    "summary": "Hello everyone! My name is Nick Campbell and I started the podcast Christ is the Cure in October 2017 and have found the rapid growth to be amazingly surprising. Needless to say, there has been a lot of support in terms of subscribers, listeners, and downloads as I average roughly 2,000 plays per week. In the midst of all this, the podcast has somehow been moved into iTunes top 20 in the Religion and Spirituality charts on more than one occasion. For a split second on a Sunday, I found the show in the #1 position! Alongside all of this came requests for other features such as the episodes being videos, more activity on facebook, vimeo, live, etc. This quickly made me realize that there was more happening here and that left me with some things to think about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVision\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe vision of the ministry and podcast is to create content that is accessible to many who don\u0027t have the time or resources to study theology, and apologetics as in depth as they would like. Additionally, the ministry has a focus on growth, and hopes to encourage others to dive deeper into scripture and know the Lord more! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe live in a time when theology is being warped, apologetics are disappearing, and growth is minimal, and Christ is the Cure aims to be a means by which some individuals are given aid in these areas. From episodes on defending the deity of Jesus Christ to learning what the Bible says about suffering, Christ is the Cure tries to support Christians in a balance of academia and practicality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll three of these focuses appear to be in demand as the top episodes have consisted of Theology (Knowing God through the Wisdom Literature), Apologetics (A series on Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses), and application (Paul and Marriage; Growth and Faith). However, all three spectrums appear in most episodes!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGo to the Website to see the podcast and to learn more about the show and myself:\u00a0\u003ca\u003echrististhecure.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\u00a0Financial Support?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was the idea of many to find a way to accept financial support for my ministry as I work to expand its reach, and the content. That lead me here! Patreon is a website where individuals support creators through monthly contributions. There are financial considerations for expansion and long term continuation of the ministry. With that being said, I want to ensure that those who contribute know what their contribution is accomplishing, and I have prioritized how funds will be used. What is important is that your contribution works to ensure that all of my material remains free for those it can reach.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e(1) Ensure every episode is available at all times. \u003c/strong\u003ePodcasting, surprisingly, isn\u0027t free! In order to retain all of the episodes I have produced so far, I must pay for hosting. It is basically digital storage space. Funds will ensure that listeners have access to every episode I have ever made, and in the future I may be able to jump onto more reliable hosting platforms. If this particular expense isn\u0027t covered, I would have to delete nearly all of my episodes at some point or another!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e(2) More Content.\u003c/strong\u003e Your contribution will help me produce more content. Namely through giving me the ability to afford the necessary equipment to provide more content in various forms such as videos, live episodes, interviews, etc. Equipment is the biggest barrier, and your contribution will help a lot! The first focus is on getting what is necessary for video episodes as well as live episodes!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e(3) Expansion and Reach\u003c/strong\u003e. As a ministry, one of the goals is to reach more people. Your contribution will allow for us to reach more individuals through providing the tools necessary to go onto new platforms. We have expanded from iTunes, google play, stitcher, youtube, and I-heart radio. There are many more platforms, and you can help us reach many more people! This category also includes some finances for general marketing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e(4) Tools for Content.\u003c/strong\u003e The tools are important and this includes programs needed as well as research access I cannot afford on my own. One of the ways I have been able to provide quality research is through various tools. By contributing you help ensure that everyone gets well researched work!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote: \u003c/strong\u003eI am not considered non-profit so contributions are not tax-deductible at this time.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eAdditionally, to make a one time contribution you can email me at\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca\u003enick.campbell@christisthecure.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is Sample Video that shows some of the additional work I would like to do:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/christthecure/videos/2034233483259057/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/christthecure/videos/2034233483259057/\u003c/a\u003e"

     "about": "I am Nick Campbell, the host of \u201cChrist is the Cure.\u201d I am married to a lovely physical therapist, Rebekah and we have a wonderful daughter, Amelia. Currently I work in pharmaceutical production while I earn my degree. This podcast is one of the various ways I use the tools of today to minister to those that I can within my crammed schedule!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI once was a very aggressive atheist, probably more accurately defined as an anti-theist, who hated religion and of course Christianity. I made it a point to attack the faith and I enjoyed doing so. Logically, my atheism took me down to nihilism in which I hit a point of deep contemplation and after three years of painful research, toil, and turmoil, I found relief in meeting Jesus Christ. Plagued by the one question reminiscent of Pilate, \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d I met Christ. Being fully aware of my sin and the truthfulness of scripture, I found myself relaying that classic saying, \u201cnothing in my hand I bring, simply to the cross I cling.\u201d I am currently working for my degree and will be getting a PhD in Theology and will be a professor of theology while I hope to be an assistant pastor in order to preach occasionally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI pray that my work blesses you, and I always enjoy feedback. God bless you all!\u003cbr\u003e-Nick\u003cbr\u003e",
