    "summary": "Expansion writers Coffee Pilot and MerkavaIV have joined forces as CoffeeTank! Now there is double the author power behind giving you the stories you crave.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been writing BE and other expansion/transformation erotica for several years now. Each of us also functions as the others primary editor. While it is primarily a hobby we do put a LOT of time, effort and research into trying to make it some of the highest quality expansion erotica out there, with extremely detailed expansion and sex scenes. We both started out posting on Overflowing Bra and then on Deviant Art, but we\u0027ve decided to start posting on Patreon both so fans can help support our work and so we can post free of DA\u0027s content restrictions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goals are threefold:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Create\n and distribute/sell high quality media for the genre. Stories that are \nmore than an erotic romp, but also something that gets the reader \ninvested in the characters and immerses them in a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Much of the money we raise from this Patreon account will be put towards commissioning high quality illustrations from expansion artists. We believe the best form of expansion story telling is the illustrated story. This account will fund the high quality illustrations we\u0027ve wanted to commission for some time but lacked the personal funds for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Have\n a place where feedback is useful. Finding out what people like, don\u0027t like, and want to see more or\n less of. Knowing that people enjoy a story is what has kept us writing \nlong before we dreamed of potentially making any money from it. We hope this will be a good forum for us to communicate with our audience and that you will grace us with not just your monetary patronage but your comments and thoughts as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs folks with several competing hobbies donations will also help to keep us motivated and focused on creating content for you to enjoy. Donations will tell us that the many hours we spend at the keyboard are indeed justified and that we should continue to do so. We ask that if you\u0027ve enjoyed our stories in the past and want to see more in the future that you please contribute whatever amount you feel is justified.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks! - CoffeePilot \u0026amp; MerkavaIV\u003cbr\u003e"
