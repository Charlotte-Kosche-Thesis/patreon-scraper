    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eI want to help make you a better athlete. The current model is flawed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe the human body is capable of more if we allow it to develop in the right way. This involves looking outside the conventional boxes while at the same time looking inside the non-conventional one\u0027s.\u00a0I want to reconnect us to our innate design as the current path is disconnecting us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe essence also lies in entangling ourselves with the laws of nature. This entanglement is becoming lost and due to modern ways, in some cases obsolete.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was once a chemist. I then returned to university to complete a masters in sports and exercise nutrition. I then became a disciple of performance nutrition and started my own practice. This led me to working with some of the worlds best athletes. I also lived as an athlete myself, training and competing in triathlons and distance running.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a BSc Chemistry and an MSc in Sports and Exercise Nutrition. However, I have learned more outside of university than in. I work as a Performance Nutritionist. I compete myself as a runner of 5k\u0027s up to 200k. I work and train with all types of athletes from pro cyclists to team sports. I have noticed a demise in what defines a healthy athlete in recent years. I see many of the modern developments in sport as inhibitors. This has created fragility causing a reduction in performance and more importantly a reduction in health. In many cases today we have high performing athletes but sick ones.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy own learning started to also cross over to other science disciplines. I started to study more physiology, biochemistry, physics, genetics, medicine, psychology and philosophy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat happened then is I started correlating things from one area with another. Dots started to connect. I slowly started to learn how the science of human function cannot be isolated. We are wired to everything. Everything is connected.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe mission then is to choose the right dots and make them connect for you. At the same time, you need to avoid certain dots and prevent breakages in the linkage. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the path to becoming a Connected Athlete. It enables you to reach your potential but crucially allows you to develop as a healthy human being. It is becoming a more difficult path to follow or find in this modern era. Something needs to be done. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I starting this now ?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve already started and written blogs, articles, recorded podcasts and worked with many teams and athletes. However, I just don\u0027t feel quite right declaring myself to the masses. I just get disheartened with time wasters and trolls. I then just want genuine interest rather than having a certain amount of followers and \"likes\". I\u0027d rather have 10 genuine folllowers than a 1000 random ones. Thats the way the internet is set up these days but then I discovered Patreon. I never thought I\u0027d be happy with an online development but Patreon means that I get to avoid the masses and really only work with genuine folk. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how am I going to create The Connected Athlete ?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI will write blogs and articles on performance/health topics but how they apply in the field and how things connect.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI want to bring in like minded athletes, scientists, doctors, coaches and researchers for blogs,video\u0027s and podcasts.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI want to start recording a podcast with a co-host.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI want to write books (currently 2 in progress).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI want to create and run a Connected Athlete HQ where we can meet, discuss, live, train and connect the dots, in person, not online.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
