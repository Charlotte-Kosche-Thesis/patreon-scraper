    "summary": "Hello everyone! And welcome to my Patreon page. I\u0027m an author, currently holding one published work to my name titled \"Asylum\". The next series is in the works\u00a0(a trilogy, to be precise),\u00a0and I can\u0027t wait until I can get it out for you guys to enjoy. Besides writing, I have several other artistic hobbies including, but not limited to drawing, singing, and figure skating. I\u0027m nowhere near as skilled in any of these as I\u0027d like to be due to the fact that it\u0027s difficult to find the time to pursue excellence in so many interests. What I\u0027m looking for is an opportunity to spread inspiration and entertainment to as many people as possible. And that\u0027s where you come in. By supporting this page, you are helping me to achieve that dream.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn this page you will find story snippets, character sketches, favourite quotes, and hopefully a few special surprises along the way. This is a journey. Who knows how far the road goes? It is ever changing and evolving, and we adapt to pursue its transformation. Join me in this adventure and together we can create something amazing! I can\u0027t do this on my own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for all your support. And I don\u0027t just mean financially. If you can\u0027t afford it, that\u0027s totally understandable. Stay a while anyway and enjoy what I\u0027ve prepared for your explicit entertainment. Tell your friends. And who knows, it might just be because of you that the characters you meet will be able to find their place in the world.\u00a0 :)"
