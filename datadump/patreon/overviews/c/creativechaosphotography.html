    "summary": "Hi there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Victorio Milian. I\u0027m a Human Resources Consultant, father, partner, and firm believer that New York City (my hometown!) is the center of the universe. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.creativechaosphotography.com/Collections/Color/Color/n-grMSqf/i-SSTnSfg/A\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-SSTnSfg/6/4af8013a/M/i-SSTnSfg-M.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had a love for photography since I was a kid, but I started taking a more serious approach to it in early 2014 when I bought a Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) camera. Purchasing a proper camera was a leap of faith and I wasn\u2019t sure if it was wise one. As my partner said to me shortly after I bought it, \u201cThat may be too much camera for you.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was nervous that she might be right, and so I practiced. A lot. I consistently studied, both the technical aspects (e.g., aperture, shutter speed, ISO) of taking good photos, as well as the **art** of photo making. Being inspired by those who came before me, along with contemporary photographers, helps to keep me focused on being the best photographer I can be. And I got better.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a while I started transitioning from just shooting and posting online to producing actual photos. There\u0027s something pretty cool about taking an image you took and making it \"real.\" There really \u003cstrong\u003eis\u003c/strong\u003e a difference! With this in mind, I created my first book of photos in November 2015 entitled, \u003ca href=\"http://www.blurb.com/b/6663817-new-york-city-the-quietest-place-on-earth\"\u003eNew York City: The Quietest Place on Earth\u003c/a\u003e. It\u2019s my first effort, and I\u2019m proud of what I was able to accomplish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the Spring of 2016 I, along with 15 other photographers, was selected to participate in a project entitled Bronx Photo Stories. The aim was to lend our photos for display at the construction site where Roberto Clemente Plaza is being built in the South Bronx. The Plaza is a collaboration between \u003ca href=\"http://www.sobro.org/\"\u003eSoBro\u003c/a\u003e, a community organization focused on revitalization efforts in the South Bronx, the NYC Dept. of Design and Construction, as well as the NYC Dept. of Transportation. It was pretty cool to see my photos  hanging in public!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u2019s next for me? I want to create more photo works offline. As I stated before, I will probably produce another photo book. I want to see my photos on display--in homes, galleries, and other spaces--so people can be inspired by my work. I would also enjoy meeting and collaborating with other photographers and artists. I\u2019m here to learn and grow. I can\u2019t do that in isolation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where this Patreon page comes into play. Patrons give me the capital to produce more photo works, such as books and prints. Depending on your reward level, patrons will get a discount on the works I produce, or receive for free (depending on the tier). Contributions also enable me to invest in equipment and training that will help me to become a better photographer, which will lead to better work to share with patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy sharing my photos, and the stories behind them, with interested parties. It could be the start of building a creative community. Your patronage helps me in building and sustaining one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for spending a moment to learn about me!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
