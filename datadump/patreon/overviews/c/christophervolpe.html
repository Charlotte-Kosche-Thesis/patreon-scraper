    "summary": "As you probably already know, I\u0027m an artist, writer, and teacher interested in sharing the processes and fruits of \u003cstrong\u003ecreativity\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eself-knowledge\u003c/strong\u003e with as wide an audience as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis platform helps artists connect to patrons who believe in them enough to help them make their art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy supporting me through this site you make it possible for me to make the art I believe in most.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving patrons also allows me to pursue projects that are super important to me but that I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to do otherwise (projects such as the book on creativity I\u2019m collecting notes for, and an artist\u0027s book that\u0027s already finished but languishing for lack of time and a scanner).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI thought hard before doing this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s where I\u2019m at with it. I\u2019ve hung back from crowd-sourcing sites like Kickstarter because I don\u2019t work like a musician, say, who needs a pile of money up front to fund a costly recording project. The overhead for what I do is considerable, but it\u2019s spread out over months and years, and the work gets made, piece by piece, the same way - over time. Gallery sales and teaching are my mainstay, but I\u2019m thinking about the \u201clong game.\u201d For me that is probably always going to be about having multiple revenue sources (sales, private and group lessons, workshops, writing, editing, speaking gigs, and the occasional grant or award), including sources that are ongoing, like this one, that provide sustained support over the long haul for all I do all the time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past, artists were always supported by patrons, only patrons had to be rich. Now it\u2019s possible to spread the cost of patronage so that it\u0027s affordable (like $1 or $5 a month affordable). As patrons, you guys get intimate, backstage, VIP access to my process, my ideas about art and creativity, my work and what goes into it, and the business of art - what it takes to support oneself as an artist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons come here to \u003cstrong\u003elearn, interact, \u003c/strong\u003eand be \u003cstrong\u003einspired. \u003c/strong\u003eWe can interact via the patrons-only feed, Q\u0026amp;As, exclusive process documentation, possible live events, creative challenges, sneak previews, monthly drawings for original paintings and works on paper, behind-the-scenes peeks and special offers. You can always change your patronage tier or stop becoming a patron whenever you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to promote art as a way for individuals to experience \u003cem\u003ebeing \u003c/em\u003ein a different way\u00a0and,\u00a0in these fractured, tumultuous times,\u00a0to think more deeply about who we are and our position in the world.\u00a0I intend to do this not just by selling paintings/promoting myself but also by raising awareness of the value of expression through writing and workshops specifically designed to engage those searching for a path to create work deeply of the mind and spirit while very much grounded in reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Patreon model has us offer \"rewards\" to entice you to donate, but if we\u0027re going to be honest, you\u0027ve read this far because you understand what I\u0027m working toward, and you think the mad dedication and many hours I put in, not just to painting but to the business end that allows me to keep doing it, are worth it. You \"get it.\" You see what I\u0027m trying to do and you\u0027re willing to take an active part in making it happen - and that\u0027s awesome.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo THANK YOU. \u003cbr\u003e"
