Since the channel got a huge surge I think I should look at moving my tiny home office into the big bedroom and move my bedroom into the smaller room. Sure my living space will be...compact but it would be great to have a larger area to produce videos in with so many more options open too. This amount will let me invest in changing the rooms to accommodate this switch!",
