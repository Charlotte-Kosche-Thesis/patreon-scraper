There is not always time to study and meditate right now. It gives me great happiness to know that\u003cstrong\u003e TEL\u003c/strong\u003e (formerly \u003cem\u003eDYR\u003c/em\u003e) acts as a sort of substitute for those times when you are just too busy to commit much time to your esoteric studies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor this reason the show will always remain family friendly-- so you can play it in the car with the kiddos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also like to create massive and comprehensive series on things like Kabalah, Alchemy, Hermeticism, Rosicrucianism, Body Energy, Astrology, all the World Religions, and Spiritual Science.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso long discursive esoteric readings of classic works. Dante\u0027s \u003cem\u003eDivine Comedy\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0for example, a work that deserves an esoteric parsing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also like to make in-depth shows about the lives of the Great Masters of Occultism. Imagine an Esoteric version of Dan Carlin\u0027s \u003cem\u003eHardcore History\u003c/em\u003e. ( I\u0027ve had a particularly shocking Rudolf Steiner Biography rolling around in my head for a while now-- just lack the time to make it.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor signing up you get the full archives and the super secret bonus content club. That means you get the weekly episodes, plus usually an extra episode every week. That means Patrons get about twice as much show. The Inner Circle shows are even more esoteric than the public ones haha!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMay The One Guide Your Steps\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Christopher \"C-FREE\" Fremin"
