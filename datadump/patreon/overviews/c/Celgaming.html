    "summary": "Live gaming stream with live commentary, started in 2009 on Justin.tv and now this year in 2014 still going on Twitch.tv and for over 5+ years Celgaming has entertained and amused Kappa enthusiasts such as yourself who have enjoyed my live streams, graphic designs, YouTube videos, written reviews, E3 podcasts every year with viewers, awesome Steam giveaways, and my super awesome cynical personality. I say things as I see them with humorous intent, even if it goes against what everyone else says and I\u0027ve stayed true to who I am and sincere about how I see things, and what I do throughout the years. In the beginning, for a couple of years even, I didn\u0027t even accept donations at all as I didn\u0027t want anyone thinking I\u0027m charging for my shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy live streams and work is for everyone to enjoy, for free and I still hold true to this belief. I do make a tiny bit of money from the channel on Twitch, and even less from the YouTube videos which has helped me fund the equipment needed to stay afloat and keep bringing new live streams, but Celgaming is still something I do in my part time and often even at the expense of real life duties. I\u0027m not complaining and I hope this doesn\u0027t come across as that because I truly do love doing the show and entertaining you folks and creating new content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine however if I could run the show with actual funding; I would have more freedom to dedicate more personal time to the show and money to pay for all the expenses that come with running a live stream, and if enough funding was reached, do it full time! With funding I would be able to do more live shows a week, host more pod casts about other video game events with viewers, host a website and write detailed reviews about the games I complete and perhaps start a whole video reviewing series that isn\u0027t a parody and of course do a live streams full time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve received support from fans throughout the years and I am eternally grateful for what you all have done for me, to keep me afloat and for keeping the show alive. If this Patreon campaign is successful it will pretty much force me to put a lot more effort and work into the show than just treating it as a part time hobby for a select few. I will be doing dedicated graphics work for the contributors behind the scenes and work toward giving the contributors content they deserve rather than only my heartfelt thanks. I will most likely never do private live streams for contributors only, but there is a slimmer of possibility for that to happen. I want to keep Celgaming free for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe more contributions the show receives, the better it will become. I\u0027ve been donated in the past many times and I\u0027ve always treated donation money as something I only use for show to make it better. Equipment such as brand new graphics cards, mics, mixers, consoles, games and numerous other hardware would have never been purchased if I wasn\u0027t so strict with the donations given. Many a month I went hungry without spending a dime of donation funds on my food expenses as a simple example. This is my vow about the Patreon contributions that the funds will only go for the betterment of the live show and the extra content that comes along with it is my thanks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eCelgaming still is an independent live stream. I\u0027ve never sold out, even though I\u0027ve had many opportunities given by pretty much game developers, headphone manufacturers and websites alike via e-mail and Twitch PMs. I\u0027ve always rejected them, because I want this show to be truly free to express itself without limitations. My voice, nor anyone who visits the show as a guest, wouldn\u0027t be restricted by sponsors or anything else. Our thoughts on games wouldn\u0027t be dwindled by corporate \"donations\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy partnership with Twitch was something I didn\u0027t want to do either at start but my fans pretty much convinced me it\u0027s a step in the right direction and I felt like you guys wanted the show to progress towards a more dedicated path. \u003cstrong\u003eA path of success\u003c/strong\u003e. You guys want the show to succeed and I heard you loud and clear. This is why I\u0027m taking the next step in using Patreon as a way for us to possibly begin a crowd funding for Celgaming and keep it independent and alive for many more years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf everything I\u0027ve said rings true with you then become a patron for the show. Give the bare minimum of 1$ a month and I will do the live shows I\u0027ve always done and do a YouTube video now and then with the addition of highlights being updated to the YouTube. I\u0027ll change and update graphics of the show at the same pace as usual and for 12$ a year that doesn\u0027t sound too bad does it?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: \"You only stream once or twice a week, that doesn\u0027t take so much time, does it?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery stream is actually well planned and thought out before I begin them. There\u0027s a possibility of graphics that need to be made for the live stream and of course I have to ensure I have time enough to play them, that they work flawlessly, sometimes for 8 to 12 hours in a row, non-stop with minimal breaks. No show is a spontaneous thing, but as things are right now I cannot plan these shows more than a couple of days ahead due to personal time taking up my freedom to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI put a minimum of 3 or 4 hours a day of interacting with people on the show by answering e-mails, tweets, reading YouTube comments and then trying to promote the show via social networks or Reddit, watching my past broadcasts for possible edits and montages. Finding good and interesting games to stream too sometimes can take a lot of time. I tend not to go with what is popular, but what might be interesting and ageless. All of this has to be done by me alone and as such it all takes hours upon hours and sometimes I don\u0027t have enough time to do it all and this can be both frustrating for me but for viewers too who wonder why I didn\u0027t stream on a day I promised to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMany times a lot of the ideas I have get scrapped as I don\u0027t have enough time to do them. For example I had a wild idea of playing both Silent Hill 2 and Metal Gear Solid 2, because of the recent news about Konami making a new Silent Hill game with Kojima, on live stream at the same time, one running on PS3 and the other on PC and then switch between them but have both games on the screen at the same time. The time I\u0027d need to make sure this would work flawlessly on the stream and still look presentable and good would take days. Graphics would have to be made, I\u0027d have to make sure the PC version of Silent Hill 2 works and is updated with community graphics etc. to look its best.  I\u0027d then plan out how long approximately it would take to finish both games, when to pause them, when to swap them etc. etc. etc. all of this requires time and effort that sometimes doesn\u0027t come across on the live streams at all and that\u0027s kind of the point. Just know that it takes a lot of time to do the show I want to do it as I am a bit of a perfectionist on these type of things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: \"So, do I need to pay to watch Celgaming now?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNot at all. The show is still 100% free and has always been free. You simply have the opportunity to contribute and help the show and become a monthly patron and ensure future shows keep happening and possibly increase in size. If you can\u0027t donate then don\u0027t feel too bad, just enjoy the show for free like you always have. I\u0027m still just happy to have people watching and enjoy the show for what it is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: \"I don\u0027t like this Patreon thing at all!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can still donate normally via PayPal by visiting\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick\u0026amp;hosted_button_id=M3AVZFVWQTN7E\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis link\u003c/a\u003e. I don\u0027t support Bitcoin however but PayPal does have credit card payment support so pretty much anyone should be able to donate as wildly as possible. There are various donation rewards on this Patreon so keep on reading forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: \"I don\u0027t have any money / can\u0027t donate. How can I help?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can help in many, many ways. The best way is to spread the channel like an STD or like the word of God. Relentlessly and with passion. Let your friends and family members know, share it on your social media outlets or put random cryptic papers with my logo in your neighborhood. Actively participate in community related stuff and leave comments wherever you go. Be creative or contact me directly via e-mail at celsfeed@gmail.com with your own ideas or if you want to directly send me hardware or games just let me know and we can sort it out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: \"Will you finally have a schedule now?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this Patreon is a success and reaches a specific goal I will begin doing the show full time. The problem is that I don\u0027t live in America and where I live the living costs are higher and not simply because of currency conversions and fees alone, so I will need more than it would seem for simple living expenses. Rents aren\u0027t cheap and you can\u0027t eat drywall, but if indeed I\u0027m able to actually live off of the stream I will make a dedicated routine schedule, which will feature multiple streams a week. This is my dream, to do this show as a living and a schedule would obviously go hand in hand with that dream."
