Book 1 in my next series is coming out soon. I\u0027m estimating summer, but praying for spring! I\u0027ve also already got book 2, Discord, in the works.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, on to my story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI started my writing journey working from home back in about 2008 or so. Before that, I cleaned vacation homes for a living. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve ever cleaned someone else\u0027s toilet \n\u003cem\u003e(or heck, even your own toilet)\u003c/em\u003e you know that there are many things in this world that are infinitely more enjoyable to do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTotally a God thing, but I somehow stumbled my way into my calling with writing. I started out writing articles for clients at $6 a pop, and morphed into blogging for myself. I found I had stuff to say and I wanted to say it with no restrictions on how I chose to say it, so that\u0027s what I did.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe blogging thing lead to more clients\u003cem\u003e,\u003c/em\u003e and more blogging. All extremely fun endeavors, and way better than scrubbing toilets.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFast-forward several years and multiple pay raises later, and I decided to dive into the realm of fiction and indie-publishing. I currently pub under my pen name C.B. Stone. I\u0027ve always been a voracious reader, so the transition from reader to indie author was pretty natural. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNowadays, I prefer to spend as much of my time as \u003cem\u003epossible\u003c/em\u003e dreaming up stories. I tend to veer toward Dystopian, Urban Fantasy, and Paranormal genres, although that\u0027s not set in stone. \u003cem\u003e(Ha, stone... see what I did there?)\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of my stories come with some kind of romantic bent and some\u003cem\u003e (though not all)\u003c/em\u003e offer the occasional God-theme threaded in. And of course, lots of action, and as many plot twists as my little brain can conjure up. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also always open to new ideas, so feel free to share if you have one!\u003cem\u003e (Constructive) \u003c/em\u003ereader input is fun and invaluable. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnyhoo, I\u0027m super excited to share my art and my heart with you, and hope you get as much enjoyment and value from \nreading my works, as I do in creating them. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n::raises glass:: \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eCheers to our future word-filled shenanigans, Stoners! There\u0027s \nno way I could do what I do without the motivation and support I get from fantabulous readers like yourself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.cbstonebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/What-do-I-want_-1.png\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eGlad you asked, dear Patreon.

It\u0027s always either feast or famine. Though writing has been good to me these last several years, until my fiction can support my family, I still have to write for clients.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis means that I have less time and energy to devote to writing stories. Writing takes brain power and deep thinking, whether it\u0027s for stories or clients, and unfortunately, client work is taking up the lion\u0027s share of my time and energy. Gotta feed my kiddos and pay the rent, right?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of kiddos, I have three boys.\u00a0Two of them top 6 feet and have nearly surpassed my hubby in height. And my 7 year old is creeping up on the height of a nine year old! We grow \u0027em tall \u0027round here. I blame the water. Needless to say, they eat.

No sushi, just wanted to see if you were paying attention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons that pledge $5 or more will get some fun digital downloads each month, whether it\u0027s a short story, a teaser chapter from my current WIP, a clip from something I\u0027ve got gathering dust on my hard drive waiting to be brought to full fruition, or something else I dream up that you might enjoy getting a glimpse of.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeep in mind that much of this stuff will be raw material and unedited, and may or may not be scheduled for future publication.
