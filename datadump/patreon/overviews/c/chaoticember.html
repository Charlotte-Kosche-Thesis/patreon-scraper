I have been working on a few separate comic ideas and now I\u0027m going to be making one to be posted on Line Webtoon. Higher levels such as 3 and 4 get premium access to comic information, but 1 and 2 are mainly everything else. Sketches and finished pieces reside in the first two tiers and they can make requests on my discord server (Embers Lair) and participate in polls when I host them. It\u0027s thanks to my patrons though that I can make some of my creations because every penny counts (and I have an expensive taste in supplies) and my job is this-- Creating for others to enjoy. If you join me as a patron, you\u0027ll find out more about my plans for future creations and how far I plan to go."
