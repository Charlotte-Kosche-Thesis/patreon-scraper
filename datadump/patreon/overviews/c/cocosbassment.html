    "summary": "Who am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Colin Cunningham I am a full time musician and music teacher. I\u2019m also the creator of the website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.cocosbassment.com\"\u003eCocosbassment\u003c/a\u003e, a free online resource website for bass guitarists. The primary function of the website is to provide aspiring musicians a place of encouragement and inspiration through my own musical journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Cocosbassment all about?\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.cocosbassment.com\"\u003eCocosbassment\u003c/a\u003e was created through my love for transcribing music and learning. In my college days I was constantly trying to understand how basslines and solos function within chord structures. I would sit for hours and figure out how to play all my favourite songs and bass solos. I would scribble out rough notation of my favourite songs then go back and analyse why they work over the given chord progression. It became an obsession but through my hard work it really made an impact on my bass playing. It really helped my understanding of how lines are created and it also helped develop my ear. I have countless folders packed with transcriptions that I\u2019ve written over the years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI later found, as I began teaching that a lot of students heavily rely on the internet as a resource of learning especially for beginners to self teach themselves their favourite songs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem I found is that some of these tab sites have songs notated by beginners who have misinterpreted what has been played. This then starts a snowball effect of students learning material wrong, which in turn diminishes any form of ear training and ability to progress productively.\u003cbr\u003eThere are some good sites out there for this but I believe that students should gravitate towards Published books to begin with or gravitate towards websites that include the notation too. \u003cbr\u003eThis means they can also figure out the notes the rhythm as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u003cbr\u003eI create weekly bass lessons and transcriptions (in both notation and tab) that are accessible to any one that subscribes to my website, which is completely free. These weekly lessons and transcriptions are uploaded in various forms, everything from downloadable pdf\u2019s to videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I get out of this free resource?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve created a website that offers quality note for note bass transcriptions in both standard notation and tablature. These transcriptions also feature chord symbols so you can also use the material for your own individual study and see for yourself how these bass lines function.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a membership platform that makes it easy for artists and creators to get paid.\u003cbr\u003eFounded in May 2013 and based in San Francisco, California, Patreon was created to enable fans to support and engage with the artists and creators they love. Empowering a new generation of creators, Patreon is bringing patronage back to the 21st century.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I doing this campaign?\u003cbr\u003eProviding free online material is time consuming as you can imagine. Even though I do this for my own personal development, it is becoming ever more costly with website maintenance and materials for filming and recording. Not only that but sending out monthly emails to my subscribers is also very costly. This is why I need you Patreon support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTranscribing tunes can be tedious work but the most tedious part about running a site is all the promotional work you have to do in order to get your material out to the masses. Even if you can\u2019t afford to give a regular donation, but want to contribute, you can drop a one off donation on my site. If that is still difficult for you, after all there might be a reason as to why you need to rely on a free resource, a little like, comment or more importantly, a share can go along way in gaining more support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith regards to the website I have never expected anything in return. All I\u2019ve hoped for is that it becomes a place that bass enthusiasts may consider using to help them on whatever your musical journey might be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
