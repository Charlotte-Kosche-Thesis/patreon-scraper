Forgive the audio/visual quality in that video. At the time, I was unaware of \"screen recorder\" software, so I recorded the computer screen with a handheld camera. I\u00a0had little knowledge of the technical stuff back then, but did know I loved to teach, and had a passion for the great game of chess. YouTube, I soon realized, was a perfect platform for these two worlds to collide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNearly 7 years after the creation of my 1st video, I did a remake, embedded below, because the poor quality of the 1st always bugged me. The remake can still be improved upon, but it\u0027s certainly miles better than the 1st. You may be surprised to know that the production of the remake acts as the single-most time consuming ChessNetwork video. Not only myself, but also 15 others had a hand in its production. In the video\u0027s description you\u0027ll see the names of each who have offered to spend several hours of their time to freely translate its English Captions. To this day, it\u0027s the video I\u0027m most proud of. Our great game can now be appreciated by speakers of 15 other languages, namely Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. Have a look sometime, and maybe you\u0027ll even learn a thing or two about one of the above languages you find of interest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SM2fcenx7KU\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a self-taught National Master from Pennsylvania who was introduced to the game by my father in 1988 at the age of 8, and it was in 2004 when I reached my childhood goal of becoming a National Master. I have been a promoter of our game online since circa 2004 via the social media platform Myspace (known as \"ChessEducator\"), an active producer of chess content\u00a0on YouTube since May of 2007, and have been\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitch.tv/ChessNetwork\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebroadcasting/livestreaming\u003c/a\u003e chess since May of 2011.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you may find interesting is that when streaming started to become a thing in the online world, I believe a, to quote Bob Ross, \"happy little accident\" occurred with the content I was producing. Let me explain... Before streaming, most if not all of, my content only ever had a serious/instructive tone to it. With streaming however came an added element of excitement. There was now an audience watching my every move live, and an avenue to interact with viewers via chat. Because there were those there to watch live, it made the \"in the moment\" gameplay more fun for me. Instead of the content having always a serious/instructive tone, there was now some personality and laughs that started to come through little by little,\u00a0whether win,\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK5QdJ715zw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK5QdJ715zw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elose\u003c/a\u003e or draw. So this \"happy little accident\" I speak of was the unplanned humor that began to be injected into the content because there were those there to watch. Viewers of the live content are what helped play a big part in making the content more enjoyable not only for me to produce, but also for those who would watch. This has allowed me to confidently describe the content I now produce as \"fun and educational\". It\u0027s one of those win-win\u0027s I guess we can say.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a place where fans can support content creators. I\u0027ve created this page for those who would like to support me for my work as an independent content creator, whether it be as a producer of chess videos on YouTube, broadcaster\u00a0of all things chess including World Chess Championship Match coverage, or however else my work and time within the chess community over the past 10 years may be seen of value to you. A patron of ChessNetwork can pledge any $ amount on a monthly basis as a token of one\u0027s support of my work. As it is now, and aside from only patrons being permitted to make posts to this page, there are no additional rewards for becoming a patron beyond my simple gratitude to those who help to keep me doing what I love. Rewards may surface, but for now my work, and the energy and time that goes into it, will remain on providing free fun and educational chess content for all, doing the little things well, and finding ways to improve.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m honored to have a community of chess enthusiasts who value the work I do. So thank you very much for that, and for taking some of your time to read a little bit of my story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJerry"
