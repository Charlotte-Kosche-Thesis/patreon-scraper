I still have that optimism but the naivete has been replaced with callused fingers and experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat began as a fun little hobby has become the driving force in my life. Over the past few years I\u0027ve penned four novels and more short stories than I can count. So, I find myself looking at a file folder full of tales ready to be told, they\u0027re just waiting for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is this weird sort of thing you do alone, quietly. It\u0027s a silent act of creation, sending whispers into the world. This Patreon allows me to whisper into your ear and, if you want, to whisper back. Or yell. Whichever you prefer. Either way, I\u0027m grateful that you\u0027re here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t wait to see what worlds we\u0027ll visit together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHEN WILL YOU RECEIVE STORIES?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eShort stories will be delivered at the end of each month.\u003cbr\u003eNovel chapters will be delivered mid month, between the fifteenth and the twentieth.\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve pledged at a tier that includes physical books, those will be delivered once they are published. I\u0027ll be sure to keep clear lines of communication so you\u0027re always up to speed with what\u0027s going on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you ever have any questions, please reach out, and thanks again for being here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCass\u003cbr\u003e"
