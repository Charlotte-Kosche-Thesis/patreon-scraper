I\u0027m truly humbled people actually reach out to content creators like myself. You guys are Awesome!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/D0jfCcX.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eCapp is a nickname I\u0027ve had since high-school era. Because my real name is Andy, and my friends called me \"Andy Capp\", like the comic-strip? After that it just kinda stuck.\u003cbr\u003e\nAnyway, I\u0027m a content creator on Youtube, VidMe and other similar sites. Gaming, Tutorials, Tech Tips \u0026amp; Reviews, Vlogging, and anything else I find entertaining.\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m also an educator of sorts in that I do a lot of tutorials for games I enjoy playing.

Support from other people has to be taken with a grain of salt. Being a growing content creator is not easy. Making fresh content takes a lot of time and work in the background that isn\u0027t seen in the videos. Scripting, planning, recording, editing, art-work, new assets, etc.. all just to get the video ready to upload. It\u0027s a passion I have and enjoy doing it and love the creative process. It is something I\u0027d love the opportunity to do more of. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/but-why.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\nMy Patreon is setup on monthly contributions. You pledge a specific amount each month that goes towards the content. The rewards are setup in a tier system, with each tier offering something new, but also includes all the previous tiers. So if you contribute $5 a month, you get everything in the $5 tier, plus everything in the $3 and $1 tiers. Reward tiers are shown on the right side of the page.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you Get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eFor those that want to join the exclusive community, get early access to videos and projects, have direct input and feedback on new content, provide suggestions and have a higher impact on the creative process, that is what the Patreon is for. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is your schedule? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRight now, I put out a new \ngaming video every Monday and Friday, and a new Tech video every \nWednesday.
