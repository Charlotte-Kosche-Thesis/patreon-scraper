I love jazz and songwriting in different genres.\u00a0I\u2019m co-writing an original musical about Civil Rights icon Marian Anderson \u0026amp; I have a fun indie duo project called Roseport with singer/songwriter Shani Rose. This year I recorded 324 song ideas on my phone, wrote the bones of 74 new songs, and completely finished 38 songs. I did 85% of that work in a 6 month window when I wasn\u2019t teaching and could focus 100% on writing. When I returned to teaching 5 days a week, my time became a lot more limited and so was my creative output, as a result. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSongs are stories that resonate in our bones. Music and words that put sound to our deepest human experiences. I want to create music that transfigures our relationship to ourselves and the world. Right now, I\u2019ve got 100+ songs in the queue to record, and I\u2019m writing more every week. My best songs haven\u0027t been written yet.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI crowdfunded my last project on Kickstarter, thanks to 271 Backers who made that music possible.

In the next 3 months, I\u0027m going away for several weekends to write. My cat is particular, and last time her litter box was dirty, she peed on my carpet right under the piano. (Vindictive much?) I don\u0027t really like playing the piano with cat urine in my nostrils, so I\u0027d like to avoid that again and make sure everyone is happy. =D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://petconvenience.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/scoopfree-5.jpg\" style=\"width: 321px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8.

I love to work collaboratively and I get the most done that way! Most of the writers I work with live 1-1.5 hours away (without traffic), and getting together is challenging when I\u0027m teaching all the time. This level of support would give me a 1-2 days\\week where I wasn\u0027t teaching, so I can say YES! and invest in collaborative relationships. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.newgeography.com/files/imagecache/Chart_Story_Inset/latrcong2.jpg\" style=\"width: 324px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
