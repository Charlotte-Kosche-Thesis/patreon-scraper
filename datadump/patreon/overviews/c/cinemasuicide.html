    "summary": "I used to be a blogger. Didn\u0027t everyone, though? For six years I ran this website called Cinema Suicide and in that time it got to be pretty popular but I burned out and stopped blogging. My solution to the ennui that comes with running a high\u003ci\u003eer\u003c/i\u003e profile movie blog for six years was to move it to Youtube and make it into a weekly show and as it turns out, I love producing the damn thing.\u003cp\u003eEvery Friday I publish a new episode of Cinema Suicide to Youtube and in it I swear a lot while talking about independent horror, science fiction and fantasy movies. I do reviews and editorial and I have a lot of fun and people seem to like it. However, the gear I use to produce the show is either really crappy or borrowed and not always available to me and what I hope to do with patron support is upgrade my gear and buy the stuff that I borrow to make a better, higher quality show like those that the Youtubers who inspired me to do a Youtube show in the first place have.\u003c/p\u003e"

That right there was the flashpoint for a life long obsession with horror movies.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e",
