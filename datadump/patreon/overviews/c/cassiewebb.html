    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eTL:DR \u003c/strong\u003eversion: I am a community minded person and am constantly trying to build community. In particular I facilitate and actively organise PolyVic events and community. Support me so that I can do more awesome things like expand our facilitator team and bring back themed socials like boardgames and dress ups which are great ice breakers. \u00a0You will get the knowledge that you are supporting me and therefore supporting the community! Oh and awesome things like updates and maybe a postcard :P\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI create community!\u003c/strong\u003e I know that Patreon is mostly designed to support artists, musicians and content creators. I love that they are being paid in more than just \"exposure\" these days. I hope to see it shift a little further for community leaders and organisers. It is often taken for granted that people who step into leadership roles do so because it is integral to their personality, that they are naturally gifted. But a lot of it is happening behind the scenes, learned through trial and error. We participate in courses and read books to learn all that we need to do these amazing things. A lot of it is emotional labour which is starting to be seen and appreciated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI am a facilitator, an organiser, a change maker.\u003c/strong\u003e I work to support the PolyVic events and community and I think it is just as valuable as making a music video or comic.\u00a0It takes a great deal of skill to facilitate discussion groups on difficult topics and to welcome newcomers to the socials. To hold space for all the nervousness of attending an event for the first time and for those who have finally found what might be a home away from home, or somewhere they can get advice on difficult issues. To see what the community needs and to try to bring that about, inclusivity, transparency, changing the culture around consent, and different ways to connect to like minded people. People come and go from PolyVic as they need it, I work to make sure it is still there for those who need it. I am also working to create and develop other spaces for polyamorous people to socialise in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThings I\u00a0 do for the community:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFacilitating and organising PolyVic Discussions and Social (for 4-5 years)\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eStarted running regular get togethers/ trainings for PolyVic facilitators\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThings I would like to work on further:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eMore training and support for PolyVic facilitators\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eI would love to put more energy and creativity into PolyVic events, following up on feedback and ideas we get. Themes for the Socials- they can be good ice breakers and ways for people to connect over specific interests (eg. boardgames, Harry Potter, facilitated get to know people night)\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eWorking to develop a stronger Consent culture in our community\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eEvents that are accessible for people- be it wheelchair accessible, or location based\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eSuper stretch dream:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eOrganising for a new PolyVic website to be created, particularly content around what to expect at our events etc.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nI\u0027m not really sure just how much money is going to help me make these things happen. The less time I need to spend thinking about making money in other ways, the more time and energy I can spend on community things. So the goals I have listed are more about how the money helps me. One of my big goals is to get enough for regular counseling sessions, I can\u0027t support the community unless I am supported myself and that is a big help to me. Every little bit helps.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am open to suggestions as far as things you would like to see as rewards, so let me know :)\n\u003cbr\u003e"
