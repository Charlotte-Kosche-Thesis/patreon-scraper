    "summary": "For the last year and half, The Complete Developer Podcast has offered simple, straightforward podcast episodes to help aspiring software developers work their way into a new career. We\u0027ve also helped loads of established developers with making their careers better and improving their quality of life while having a successful career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStepping up our game\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that we\u0027ve been at this a little while, it\u0027s time to make it all much better. But we can\u0027t do it alone, as what we\u0027d like to do to improve the podcast is costly and time consuming. Currently, we\u0027re paying for everything out of pocket or making due ourselves. To get this thing to the next level and to continue improving the value we provide to our listeners, we have to stop doing that. Think about what we could do if we could focus most of the time we spend on the podcast on the actual production of content, instead of the numerous little things we have to do in order to ship, things that don\u0027t add value for you, the listener, but still have to be done anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJump in and help us out\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve kicked out a brand new episode every single week since we started this podcast back in September 2015. We want to keep doing that and making our show better as we go. We believe that The Complete Developer Podcast has enormous potential to help both aspiring and established developers to have better careers. And we want you to join us in the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur Patreon goals will be used to for the goals we specified on the left. This includes things like a better, dedicated recording machine, hosting costs, audio editing costs, and other tools we need to improve audio quality and delivery.\u003cbr\u003e"
