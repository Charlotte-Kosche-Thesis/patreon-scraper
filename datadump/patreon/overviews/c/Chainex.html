I, alongside making animations, upload a variety of games to my channel, mostly being Five Nights At Freddy\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, due to my computer breaking, I am stuck using a laptop. This means I cannot create animations due to the program lagging and not responding on my low spec laptop and I cannot make as good quality gaming videos as I used to be able to before.\u00a0Because of the lack of animations and having to change my content due to not having a suitable computer, my channel has been on a downfall ever since which has greatly unmotivated me from doing this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny donation that you give, big or small, helps me fund my new computer and also motivates me to keep on going as I see people still want to see my content and like what I do. Donations also help to generally improving equipment, as well as helping me have money for the future in which I hope to be able to do animate and do YouTube as a part of my career, as well as having a good education at university and succeeding in my goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am very grateful to any Patrons that I may get and I hope to be able to offer you the best rewards in return! Thanks so much \u0026lt;3 (VIDEO COMING SOON!)"
