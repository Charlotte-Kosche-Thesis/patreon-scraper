    "summary": "The Monarchist League of Canada is a group of your friends and \nneighbours from across the country who are united in their interest in and \nloyalty towards Canada\u2019s constitutional monarchy. We are a national non-profit organization.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSince its inception in 1970, the League has gained a national reputation\n as the leading voice of \u003cem\u003eintelligent\u003c/em\u003e monarchical opinion in Canada. Our \noverall task is to promote the full expression and a better \nunderstanding of the history and real benefits of a uniquely Canadian \nconstitutional monarchy. We present the positive face of the Canadian \nCrown as an essential part of national identity, and as the central \npillar of our parliamentary democracy. We frequently work with MPs and \nmembers of provincial legislatures of all parties to further cement the \nrole of the monarchy as a \"big tent\" under which every member of a \ndiverse society can find an equal and respected place. We emphasize\u00a0the monarchy as a \u003cem\u003eCanadian\u003c/em\u003e institution\u00a0- we are not \"Royal watchers\" - we don\u0027t usually\u00a0hold\u00a0tea parties give us some ale and maple leaf cookies any day!\u00a0\u00a0We are proudly as diverse as is our country. And we have a sense of humour; we take the cause very seriously, but never ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePROJECT:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main focus of the Monarchist League of Canada is\u003cstrong\u003e education\u003c/strong\u003e. Over recent years, we have effected free distribution of well over 40,000 colourful all-ages-appropriate booklets in English and in French editions, designed to explain Canada\u2019s Crown in a direct way no longer taught by the \u201ccivics\u201d classes of yesteryear. These appear on our website at \u003ca href=\"http://monarchist.ca/\"\u003emonarchist.ca\u003c/a\u003e for your reference, and were revised\u00a0in late 2017 and early 2018\u00a0for re-issue\u00a0to reflect in their imagery the appointment of Julie Payette as Governor General and the interaction of Prime Minister Trudeau with members of our Royal Family since the last revision some 2-3 years previous.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe League discovered long ago that offering sample copies of\u00a0 these booklets\u00a0\u003cem\u003eOur Canadian Crown/La Couronne au Canada\u003c/em\u003e  to school principals and social studies\u2019 teachers by postal mail, and inviting them to order the amount needed \u2013 though at no charge \u2013 was a fool\u2019s errand, expensive as well as unproductive.  Indifference, hostility, mandated texts and other preoccupations all meant little return on our efforts and our members\u2019 generosity.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eBut then we hit on a much superior alternative: all MP\u2019s visit classrooms in their constituencies, and like having something in their hand to give to the students. Offering these legislators sight of our booklets, with copies free of charge on request, has produced many orders from representatives of all the federalist parties, and the great bulk of the distribution during the last 5-7 years. Many also stock copies in their constituency offices.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eOur goal, with your assistance, is to continue this effort, and expand it to provincial and territorial legislative members, as well -  adding 750 potential to new partners to our distribution on top of the 338 federal MP\u2019s.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe cost of printing, initial mailing and emailing to kindle legislators\u2019 interest,  and then sending bulk orders across the country (only First Class lettermail is free to MP\u2019s, not parcels!) and the cost of mailing to all provincial legislators\u00a0\u00a0constitutes a significant expense, especially as we expand the distribution. To add to League members\u2019 generous gifts and and other revenue through modest bequests, we seek a new income stream through crowd-sourcing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe know that amidst busy lives, many of you may not wish to be a \u201cmember,\u201d receive our literature, attend meetings and so on \u2013 but we believe there are a lot of good folk who appreciate the Maple Crown as foundational to Canada\u2019s polity and way of life \u2013 so we\u2019re offering you a chance to support it by the important educational work of the League \u2013 for\u00a0now in its 48th\u00a0year\u00a0as\u00a0Canada\u2019s leading rational monarchist organization. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Thanks for your consideration and support! We really appreciate it - and we\u0027ll do our best to make sure we get the most monarchical bang for every buck you give us.
