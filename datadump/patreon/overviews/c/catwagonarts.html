    "summary": "I\u0027ve wanted to be an artist since I was very young. \u003cbr\u003eGrowing up, I spent a lot of time alone. I was always lost inside of the worlds of great stories like Star Wars, Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, the Legend of Zelda, and \u00a0A Song of Ice and Fire. My mom occasionally used to catch me still up, secretly reading next to my night light well past 4am. My best friends were animals and books. I got my first tablet when I was 14, and online communities like Deviantart and ConceptArt.org gave me access to my first real audience. \u00a0After that, I was hooked. I got to know fantastic artists I never would have dreamed of being close to. I made it into the gaming industry and started designing backgrounds, but after a mass layoff of my entire department, I felt burnt out. It was at that moment I knew for sure that someday, I wanted to build my own world-- not someone else\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I knew someday, I\u0027d have my own stories to tell. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution of as little as 1$ a month gets me that much closer to realizing my goals-- one of which is my fully illustrated, animated graphic novel\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://whitebirdcomic.tumblr.com\"\u003eWhitebird\u003c/a\u003e, which you can read by clicking on the link. Funding enables me to spend less time worrying about making ends meet and more time creating content, tutorials, process videos, prints, and preparing for gallery showings and conventions.\u00a0"
