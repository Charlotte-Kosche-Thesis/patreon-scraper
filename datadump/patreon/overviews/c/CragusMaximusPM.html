    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eA Quick Hello\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHello and thank you to everyone that has come this far! My name is Craig and I am a short story fiction writer. The reason I am now on Patreon is so that I can offer my fictional writing at a lower price than some of the leading self-publishing sites allow me to. Every patron will receive an e-book before they are published on Amazon. The books will be either fantasy or science fiction with elements of romance, detective or mystery thrown in too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Bit About Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who don\u0027t know me, here is a bit about who I am. My name is Craig Simpson, I have just finished studying creative writing and mythology at the Open University in the UK. I have studied a wide variety of subjects from general IT, to computer game design, to live performance and now writing and mythology. I have also been a content writer for EncounterRoleplay and a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://cragusmaximuspm.wordpress.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eflash-fiction\u003c/a\u003e blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Beauty of Short Stories:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThey are readable in one sitting, this means that you can read this while you are on the commute to work, during your lunch break and so on. You don\u0027t have to worry about putting too much time into getting your money back either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Does This Mean for Me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, alongside feeling good about myself and my writing, it also means that I can use the money to either back other creators on Patreon or to enter writing competitions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to look at my page and to any of you that are generous to back me on this venture!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCraig\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS: I won\u0027t spend all the money on doughnuts.\u003cbr\u003e"
