I have acquired a broad range of professional skills so I am able to self-fund and create my work, but I receive no compensation, and sustaining this work is difficult. Financial support would allow me to also focus on distribution. Currently I am creating new work on issues of trafficking from a sex worker rights perspective, which is certainly an issue that has not been addressed in the medium of video to any extent. I have done a great deal of research over the last decade, and aquired my footage.\u00a0 The work-in-progress has screened internationally.
