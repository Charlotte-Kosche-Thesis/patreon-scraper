    "summary": "Welcome to my musical journey to make the world a better place! Thank you so very much for flying in for a test flight with the Hawk Flock!\u00a0I\u0027m a song writing guitar playing Uber driving single mama of 4 beautiful children. I also play a little ukulele, bass, percussion, kazoo, and other traditional and unusual instruments... and even toys and TRASH. I long to sing some love and gratitude into your heart, breathe sweet healing breath beneath your wings, and help to clean up this beautiful paradise we call home. Music is my favorite medicine, and I would love to help you mend those wings, to help heal your heart, to help lift you up when you have fallen from the sky, and to remind you that you are not alone... we are a flock that flies together in this flight we call life.\u00a0Oh, sweet LIFE... I\u0027ve been singing all my life, on and off stage since I was 4 years old...\u00a0when I used to make up songs, pretending that there was a little microphone in one of my buttons that allowed the whole world to hear me sing, to help them feel better, to love life, and to LOVE each other. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell now, I\u0027m on a worldwide mission... would you like to help to clean up the world? Are you tired of seeing trash on your favorite private beaches, along the paths you walk upon to find peace, along the railroad tracks where you love to balance on the rails and hop from plank to plank? Well, I wrote a song some time ago when I was in Aruba for an annual beach clean up event. It\u0027s going to be available soon on a Global Clean Up Treasure Hunt Gaming App named after the song, \"Take Care of Paradise\". The song will only be available on the app until World Clean Up Day, which is September 15th, 2018. On that day, a video will be released that will include folks from all over the world, cleaning up trash, recycling it, or making it into instruments to make music! I will be posting details about the app and other clean up information here on my page, so please do Follow this account, or even become a Patron, which will guarantee you an appearance in the Take Care of Paradise video!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to hear many of the songs I\u0027ve already released into the wind, which is 3 full length CDs and numerous singles of original music on my independent record label, SunHawk Records, \u00a0my creations can be streamed for free and downloaded for a fee (unless you become a patron) at \u003ca href=\"http://www.ReverbNation.com/CherylannHawk,\"\u003ewww.ReverbNation.com/CherylannHawk,\u003c/a\u003e and can be found on Spotify, iTunes, and Amazon. And now, I have 3 more CDs worth of original music ready to record for YOU... Alternative Folk Pop, Country, and Children\u0027s Songs. I plan to release each song as a single as they are ready, and will create a video for each release! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome fly with me and the exclusive Hawk Flock community, and get access to these creations before they are released, be a part of the creation and production process, get\u00a0free MP3 downloads of previously released CDs, and more. Check out the rewards I\u0027m offering for more details. Stay beautiful and spread those wings sweet family! Thank you so much for listening!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\tPeace, Love and fLight,\u003cbr\u003e\n\tCherylann Hawk\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPs.... Introduction video coming soon. For now, please enjoy this song of love that I wrote last year after a life changing surgery that reminded me that I am here to share these healing, inspirational, and educational gifts of music with you, to make the world a better place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/tZlIJZq1aUM\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/tZlIJZq1aUM\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW PATREON WORKS...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m so excited to be a creator on this platform. I believe in the  patronage model with all my heart, and I\u0027m honored that you would want to support what I do! Please consider supporting a dollar (or more!) per month, and eventually per music video that I upload to YouTube - I intend to soon post a new video every other week. I will create the absolute best production and quality work that I am capable of creating, which will continue to get more and more amazing as I learn more about how to do so, and connect with more wonderful creators and supporters such as you. If you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, you can set a monthly maximum for 1 video/month during the signup process.

I am currently assembling a video production team to help create higher quality videos than what I currently am able to create myself with my iPhone and MacBook. Your support makes it possible for me to work with these talented people, and allows me to focus on making great music for YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCOMMON QUESTIONS...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars? \u003c/strong\u003eNO - Pay in any currency!
