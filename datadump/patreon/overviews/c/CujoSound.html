Noire, about how sounds in the game work and how it helps your players and why informant audio is important to your gameplay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Cujo Sound\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eMy name is Bj\u00f8rn Jacobsen - I sound design AAA, AA and indie video games for a living, I wrote blogs and articles for various websites, give lectures and talks at various conventions and schools and I really enjoy creating all the material that I couldn\u0027t find myself when I started my own career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy credits include \u003cstrong\u003eCyberpunk 2077, HITMAN, DARQ, EVE Online, Dust 514, World of Darkness, A Mother\u0027s Inferno and more.\u003c/strong\u003e If you have any questions about any of these games - just ask.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy back this site\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen you support this Patreon: You gain access to all my material and depending on support level you gain access to more, such as: personalized mentoring, guidance and supervision of your material and projects, requests for specific reviews of tools or explanatory videos of any issue you might have. You also help me afford the time it takes for me to create all this content as this takes a lot of time to both do and research.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI aim to add material to the website every week, sometimes more and if a week is skipped, then the next week will have more.\u003cbr\u003eWhen you back this site with more than 1 dollar per. paid post you also gain access to the Cujo Sound Discord channel where we can discuss sound design, you may ask any question you like, engage with other sound designers backing the channel or simply just enjoy the content posted there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much do you have to pay\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003efor as little as 1 dollar per. month you gain access to everything here and you help me immensely. The funding works like this, that whenever I create something for the site which I charge for - you will be charged, so set your basic funding tier and your maximum per. month spending - Setting a 1 dollar support and a 5 dollar per. month maximum, means that you will be charged 1 dollar (ONE!) if a paid article is posted - and 5 dollars if five paid articles are posted. It\u0027s all up to you. I do not always charge for my posts, only the ones which I believe are worth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo for a 1 dollar tier, you will not miss out on anything here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy the other tiers?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eThe tiers above one dollar are meant for you who specifically want to not only look at the material here, but also require personal mentoring, guidance, supervision of your project, have a specific question or need help with something, or if you just believe that what you get is worth more than the lower one or five dollar levels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll support here is received with maximum gratitude and it means the world to me that you have decided to help me out. Anyone support this Patreon has my biggest gratitude and respect."

Most of us struggled hard to even stand out as worthy of even being considered for the job and I personally spent years and years struggling to break into the industry (for companies that I have now worked for), I also fought hard to get through to various schools from which I was rejected for many years, (schools I now teach and is an external examiner at).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s far from a glorious path with no obstacles, but it made me stronger and made me believe in what I do, and what I now do for a living.\u003cbr\u003e",
