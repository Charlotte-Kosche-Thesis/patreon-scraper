    "summary": "Hi everybody,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Carole Bouchard. I\u0027ve been a sports journalist (and mostly a tennis writer) for exactly 13 years now. I was a staff writer at L\u0027Equipe (one of the biggest French media group) and I\u0027m back being my own boss since the end of 2014. It was my decision and I couldn\u0027t have taken a better one when I see where it\u0027s been leading me so far. I\u0027m now working for French and International newspapers, magazines and radios as I travel the world to follow tennis all season long. I\u0027ve also written a book, \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Quest-Djokovics-chasing-Roland-Garros-unlocking-ebook/dp/B06ZZQFJ56\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Quest\u003c/a\u003e, about Novak Djokovic\u0027s historical win at Roland-Garros in 2016. I\u0027d have never done all of this without being a freelance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I here talking to you? For many reasons! First of all, I\u0027m getting tired to throw in the bin so many good content week after week as they don\u0027t make the cut for my traditional clients. Tired also to have to give up on many features ideas. And not because all of the above isn\u0027t good, but because nowadays there\u0027s often not enough space in the pages, or not enough space in the magazine, or because the editor doesn\u0027t like the topic or because it\u0027s deemed not \"bankable enough\" to take a chance and put a tag on it. Yet, each time I\u0027m sure readers would be interested. Frustrating, right? And then one day I\u0027m reading an article about Patreon and how it works and I\u0027m like: \u003cstrong\u003ewait, I can go directly to readers?!\u003c/strong\u003e That sounds like a plan. And that\u0027s why I\u0027m now here: \u003cstrong\u003eas you would subscribe to a newspaper or a website, you could now subscribe to a writer.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSure I could put all of this content on \u003ca href=\"http://theyellowballcorner.blogspot.fr/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e but I don\u0027t consider that blog as a job: it\u0027s a hobby. You rarely make money with a hobby ;) If I dedicate time and effort on a journalistic work, it can\u0027t be for free. Free doesn\u0027t get you to go on reporting and writing. \u003cstrong\u003eHere I\u0027m going to give you exclusive and professional content as I report on tournaments and professional tennis life all season long. \u003c/strong\u003eWin-win situation, no? I feel journalism is at an exciting time where the channels to reach out to the audience have multiplied like wow. You can get lost in there and struggle to make a living, or you can embrace it, adjust and go on with your career. That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been doing, and I want to keep my trust in it. Quality job still gives you a career. And pays the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnother reason I\u0027m here: I want to do more and better. \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m my own business for years now and it\u0027s working, so here I\u0027m starting another branch of this business by providing premium content directly to readers. I\u0027m often baffled by the support and interest my coverage receive on social media, but that\u0027s the proof that you guys are all here for content. Content has a future. To provide it, one has to dedicate hours and hours, and also be where the action happens. And nowadays being on the ground is a luxury for every journalist, freelances even more. So here I am trying to create another side of the business that will also contribute to make the whole system working as a whole for years and years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting that\u003cstrong\u003e book\u003c/strong\u003e along with keeping all my daily work also proved to be quite challenging. I had to turn down some work, to stop pitching features to some clients: I had to \u003cstrong\u003emake choices\u003c/strong\u003e. Here I\u0027m also trying to see if there\u0027s a way to make those choices more easily as other projects are on the way. So if you trust the quality of my work, join and subscribe to what should be an entertaining adventure!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
