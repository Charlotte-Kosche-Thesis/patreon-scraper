I love putting together maps, cultural analyses, clothing designs, orders of battle; everything that makes a fictional world seem more like a real one. Judging from the sort of feedback I get from my fans, they (or perhaps, you) love reading about those worlds just as much when I make them publicly available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem is, I only get paid to do one of those things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it stands now, I\u0027m required to prioritise turning out published work over worldbuilding because that\u0027s the only way to pay the bills. As a recent graduate with plans to start a family, living in a city with one of the highest costs-of-living in the country, I will not hide the fact that I need to prioritise paying work over non-paying work. Unless I can find a way to make it help pay for my living costs, I may have to stop doing in-depth setting and worldbuilding content altogether. That means no more uniform sketches, no more character profiles, no more cultural commentaries, or mechanical discussions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnless I can enlist your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do I Get Out Of This?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return for your generous patronage, I\u0027ll be creating new content examining the settings of my works, starting with a series of articles on the \u003cem\u003eInfinite Sea\u003c/em\u003e of \u003cem\u003eSabres of Infinity\u003c/em\u003e and\u003cem\u003e Guns of Infinity\u003c/em\u003e. The more money I receive, the more time and effort I\u0027ll be able to justify spending on this new content, and the more expansive and extensive they will be. If I get enough funding, I\u0027ll be able to write further series, based on the \u003cem\u003eConcordat\u003c/em\u003e of \u003cem\u003eThe Hero of Kendrickstone\u003c/em\u003e, and on the processes of writing and worldbuilding themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll content will be made openly available on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cataphrak.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e for free, but patrons will receive advanced access to new content via Patreon, with the ability to see content a week before it is openly avaliable!"
