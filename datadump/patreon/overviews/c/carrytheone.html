    "summary": "Carry the One Radio needs\nyour support! Right now, our science podcast is funded by the scientists (all Phd graduate students) who run the show. Obviously, this is not sustainable and our lack of funding\nhas limited what we can do. That\u0027s why we are asking for your help through this\ndonate-per-episode crowd-funding program.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Carry the One Radio?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nScience is\none of the most powerful influences in our lives. The medicines we use, the\nfoods we eat, the technologies we have \u2013 they are all products of the\nscientific process. But many people are disconnected from that process. They\nsee science as something foreign, done in secret labs by strange people. And\nthat\u2019s wrong! Science is an open discussion, and scientists are regular folk\nwho happen to be curious about how things work. But how can scientists show that to the public?\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u2019s where\nCarry the One Radio comes in.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCTOR\nis a podcast designed to bridge the gap between scientists and the general\npublic. We give scientists a platform to talk about their work, their\nmotivations for being scientists, and what gets them out of bed in the morning. We try to find researchers who are\npassionate about their work, and who are operating at the edge of their field.\nThat way, listeners get to hear about cool discoveries directly from the researchers\n(sometimes even\u00a0\n\u003cem\u003ebefore\u003c/em\u003e the discoveries are\nmade public). We post 2 new episodes each month, along with information\nabout the scientists we interview. And because we let the scientists speak\ndirectly to the public, listeners get more than sound bites and pretty\npictures; they get the whole story. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll of our\nepisodes are available for free. You can download them as mp3s, subscribe to\nthe show via\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/CTORiTunes\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eiTunes\u003c/a\u003e, or stream each episode directly on \u003ca href=\"http://carrytheoneradio.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eour website\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e----Take a listen to Karuna Meda\u0027s interview with Dr. Susan Voglmaier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003ciframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/137407245\u0026amp;color=ff5500\u0026amp;auto_play=false\u0026amp;hide_related=false\u0026amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e---- Episode 48: \"Chimeras Are People Too\".

Also, you\nwill NOT be charged\n\u003cem\u003e immediately \u003c/em\u003eafter we release a new episode.

But during the start of 2012, we tripled the\nnumber of people on our team and, since then, we have interviewed some of the country\u2019s top scientists and\u00a0continuously\nuploaded one new episode each month. And, recently, we have also started producing our\nepisodes for radio. But, as you know, running an operation like this takes up time, money, and\nsweat. We need your support to make this a better podcast. So please help us get more\nscience out of the lab and into the public\u0027s ear.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks so\nmuch!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSama,\nKaruna, and Bryan\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFAQ:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is so cool about the Patron-Only Stream?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe\nPatron-Only Stream is the place to get the inside scoop on the show.
