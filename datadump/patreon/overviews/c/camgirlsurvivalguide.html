    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWay back in 2013 I started webcam modeling and fell in love with the job. In the first few months of camming, I was thirsty for tips, tricks, pointers or advice, but found few outlets for this kind of conversation. In response to this, I started writing what I was learning on an anonymous tumblr, hoping to share my experiences with anyone who had the same curiosities - and thus was born the Camgirl Survival Guide.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the years since this project was born, I\u0027ve grown a lot and learned an immense amount about what goes into being a webcam model, and I\u0027ve always thought that the writing I produce offers a unique perspective on the job: one that\u0027s open, honest and blunt about some things that others may shy away from discussing. I want to share articles that brand new camgirls can use as a resource, as well as articles that seasoned camgirls can relate to or connect with. I\u0027m interested in writing instructional \"how-to\" pieces, but also pieces that reflect some of the deeper aspects of cam modeling, particularly from a behind-the-cam point of view.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tossed around the idea of writing an e-book or starting a website, but never really felt a \"click\" with either platform - a \"click\" that I finally was struck with today! The Camgirl Survival Guide Patreon page will host the writing I make publicly, as well as offer an avenue for financial support from anyone interested in donating. My thought is that a fresh new host site will help re-inspire me to work on articles about webcamming, as well as possibly get some support from people who enjoy the things I have to say. Whether you\u0027re a newbie camgirl, a tired old hag like myself, a camsite member or just someone who gets a laugh or two out of my writing: thanks for reading, and if you so choose to, thanks for your support.\u003c/div\u003e"
