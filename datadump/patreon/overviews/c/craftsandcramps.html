So this is super exciting and\nscary at the same time. The good kind of scary of course - the kind\nwhere you really want to put yourself into an idea, something that\nyou are passionate about while simultaneously being anxious of how it\nwill turn out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd\nsince I really hope this will turn out great: I am looking forward to\ngetting to know you. Before I can do that you have to get to know me\nand what I am doing of course. \u003cbr\u003eMy\nart focusses around the human body, it\u0027s about equality,\nmenstruation, mental health, self love and self destruction. \u003cbr\u003eThe\nmedium I am mainly using to express myself is \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/craftsandcramps/?hl=de\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehand\nembroidery\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e-\nbut I also love to play around with paint, pens, paper and so much\nmore. \u003cbr\u003eI\nlove art that is slow and works on many levels, I am inspired by\naccessibility and new ways to reflect.

That is amazing! You\ndecide how much you are willing to donate to my art every month\n(starting at 1\u20ac). Each tier has different rewards, like behind the\nscene footage, pictures, tutorials, videos or even real life\nsurprises from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\nhappens with your money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf\nyou decide to become a monthly patreon your help will be going\ndirectly into my work: supplies like embroidery hoops, thread, paint,\naquarell paper and so on. And if we manage to reach a certain point:\nIt will also help to pay a small part of my rent *can\u0027t even imagine\nhow good that would feel*. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\nelse?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf\nyou have read this far I am already super excited because it means\nyou care enough to read through all of this! If you like what I am\ndoing but are unsure of supporting me financially, that is totally\nunderstandable. If you want to support me through a different way:\nSpread the word, share and credit my photos on\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/craftsandcramps/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003einstagram\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, write\nme a message with your thoughts, collaborate with me on your next\nproject, connect me to people you know who would enjoy my work.
