    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s time to go for broke! \u003c/strong\u003eAbout a year and a half ago I started doing commissions on FA (furaffinity) for a temp job while I searched around for a real one. To the point where it became my only job XD I had to work harder and harder to keep up with the fact that I didn\u0027t have a normal job like others. At some point along the way the fun I \"was\" having became tiring and exhausting. I couldn\u0027t keep up, my body couldn\u0027t keep up. At this point it was time to take different measures, PATREON! I heard about this waaayyy back, and kept bringing it up with my family and friends. Recently I have taken serious practice on doing animations unlike before, because back then I was impatient on trying to animate. With the help of my followers I was finally able to buy Clip Paint Studio, this is where I started to learn to animate even more. Animation takes time, it takes patience, its raw emotional energy; the things I didn\u0027t have or time for when I started pushing out more commissions these recent months. With your help I\u0027ll be able to practice my craft and make AMAZING things! I can make what I enjoy and hopefully what you enjoy also :D In the end I wanna be able to use my animations and art to make people forget about their worries next to maybe even being able to understand them and or resolve them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere are no paywalls to see what I make! This is more of a glorified tip jar so I can get support to create more content\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe art/animation content consists of the things I find joy from to the things I find \"joy\" from uwu\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis also means I won\u0027t be doing as many commissions outside, trying to mostly focus on my own work\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere will be streams, I\u0027ll post links here or on these sites if I am streaming (I might forget to also so forgive me if I do!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI will draw possible free doodles in stream for fun! Don\u0027t force me to draw anything for you as well as make it something I owe\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFA account --\u0026gt;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/crashwolf/\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/crashwolf/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTwitter Main --\u0026gt;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Kumalobo\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/Kumalobo\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTwitter Alt --\u0026gt;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/TIM3RUNN3R\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/TIM3RUNN3R\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
