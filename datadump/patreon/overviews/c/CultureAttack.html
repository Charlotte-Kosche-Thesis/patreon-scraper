But I get a lot of help from my friends and with music.\u003cbr\u003eI made Aces Wild: Manic Brawling Action and am currently working on Citadel Deep--a dungeon diving character action game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.tylerdoak.com/CitadelDeep/aniwip172%20%282%29.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of Culture Attack is to create hardcore, niche games with intense action and deep systems. I strive to support the creative community with a free and open sharing of techniques, code and assets. I value self empowerment and community empowerment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7YVjBLCDXs?start=456\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I have a part-time job that, along with game sales, keeps me afloat.\u003cbr\u003eHowever this isn\u0027t much to let Culture Attack grow and the time spent at my part-time job could be spent working on games and with the community. Student loans are also keeping me down and that will be our first milestone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe types of games we make aren\u0027t very mainstream, but they have a passionate fan-base. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fzAjjRNb3tA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope to make more and more action and fighting games and your support not only improves their development time and quality, it makes you an essential part of the work.\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s get Wild and make some games!\u003cbr\u003e"
