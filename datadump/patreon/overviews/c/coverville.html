    "summary": "Since I started Coverville back in 2004, it\u0027s moved from being a hobby to a full-time job. Working with labels and artists, helping develop cover albums for Coverville Records, finding the best music, and of course, producing a weekly show! All this means I get the pleasure of doing what I love, but as the cost of limiting other freelance obligations. This is where I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to keep doing all these things, but more importantly, I want them to get better and better. One cover album a year? NO! Let\u0027s do more! Interviews? Let\u0027s bring \u0027em back! A faster, bigger and more robust website with instant access to a cover database and a library of shows? Let\u0027s do it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCoverville isn\u0027t just a podcast or a website, it\u0027s a community. There\u0027s a reason I try to make it feel like a fictional geographic location where all this stuff happens. It\u0027s the small town where you\u0027ll grab a coffee in a cafe where a cool indie band is playing their version of \"Seven Nation Army\". It\u0027s the bar on the outskirts of town where every night there\u0027s a new band that doesn\u0027t perform \"Free Bird\". It\u0027s the dusty old record store next to town square where the owner always has that new UK import of the single where the b-side is that amazing version of \"Shine on You Crazy Diamond.\" And you\u0027re not just listeners, you\u0027re Citizens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks in advance for your support - I look forward to everything we can do together!"
