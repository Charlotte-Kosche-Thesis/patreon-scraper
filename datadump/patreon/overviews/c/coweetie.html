Ha ha.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest, I already tried that by overworking myself in my work, as well as in private (learning source filmmaker or blender after 10 hour shifts in late night, or right after standing up until work). I thought, the only way to get out of the job I could not stand anymore was to quickly learn everything I was interested in, so I can earn a little in that area. I had that feel because I already had overworked myself into burnout and depression.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI originally started Patreon to have at least some little, tiny straw of hope for financial safety in the time where I thought everything is over, since I had to quit my job a year ago and had no idea how to continue.\u003cbr\u003eLater I made a therapy and now I can look forward to some more normality in my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a chance for me to achieve my dreams. And every little coin you are willing to share is the biggest motivation for me to continue and to hold on to my goals. I maybe can get an education some time, or even cooler, I could spend most of my time making models for you some day, instead of working full time somewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith every single person that is willing to pledge me, I feel so much more worth and motivated to continue doing what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I decided to give you something back. For everyone who pledges 5 or more bucks, I give you some extra models which aren\u0027t for public access.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAlso I name every single patron in my videos.\u003cbr\u003eThis is my thank you for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003echeers, coweetie!"
