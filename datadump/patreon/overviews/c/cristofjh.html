    "summary": "I\u0027m a storyteller.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is different from being a writer. Writing is awesome - I do a lot of it, over 50,000 words a month (think \u003cem\u003eThe Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe\u003c/em\u003e, every month) - but there are lots of writers out there that don\u0027t know how to tell stories. As I\u0027m sure you have experienced your very own self.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhereas I don\u0027t really know how good a writer I am, but I can tell a story. Live, on paper, by text,\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7774031/Photos/20150324_135654.jpg\" style=\"width: 307px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003ewhatever medium you can think of, I like weaving a yarn. People tell me they enjoy it when I do. They also tell me to do more of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAy, as Hamlet says, there\u0027s the rub.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a day job. Well, two. They pay the bills, and that\u0027s a good thing, which I am grateful for and don\u0027t (well, hardly ever) take for granted. I\u0027d like, however, to tell more stories, and to do that, I need ways to keep the day jobs from overrunning the storytelling time. This is one of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7774031/Photos/Author.jpg\" style=\"width: 167px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eI have three published books, and two collections of shorts coming out this fall (2015). As the publishing industry goes through its convulsions, however, new opportunities present themselves, and one of those is the return of the patron model of creative work. Patreon is, I believe, the most innovative and forward-looking company in the patron space, and that\u0027s why I\u0027m here. I hope it\u0027s why you\u0027re here, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not exactly a \u003cem\u003enew \u003c/em\u003ething. Up until the arrival of mass-market paperbacks, everyone published this way. \u003cem\u003eA Tale of Two Cities\u003c/em\u003e was a subscription novel, paid for prior to publication (and even prior to writing) by those who wanted to have Dickens\u0027 latest novel in their hands. Composers have long worked this way; Wolfgang Mozart sat in the court of Joseph II in Vienna and wrote stuff for him, because he was getting paid to do so. It was a feather in Joseph\u0027s cap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I propose to be a feather in yours. No, really. As a patron, as \u003cem\u003emy \u003c/em\u003epatron, you\u0027ll get stories no one\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7774031/Photos/Please.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eelse gets. You\u0027ll have access no one else does. You will be able to read the stories before anyone else, to discuss them, even to affect what I write and how I write it. You call the tune; I dance. After all, you\u0027re the patron.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s going to remain true no matter how many patrons I have. I take this very seriously. I\u0027m grateful\u00a0to you for taking the time to look over my work, and I hope to see your name on my list of patrons very soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s do this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. This is explicitly spelled out when you go to become a patron, but you can\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cli\u003ePledge as little as $1 a work and\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCap your contributions by month\u003c/li\u003eTherefore, you can support me with a single dollar every month if you like, no matter how prolific I am (and I\u0027m kinda prolific, so consider that carefully).
