    "summary": "Hello readers! I\u0027m Cliff Threadgold, a creative writer and contributor with Poisoned Heart Productions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the inspiration of my wife, Monica, (The Owner and CEO of our new company) We have started a little project called Richard the Dragon. Over the last year or so, I have been putting together a humorous coming-of-age story about a dragon in a way I haven\u0027t seen as of yet. As you become acquainted with Richard in the coming months, I hope you enjoy the sometimes subtle and at times not so subtle story of Richard and his pursuit of love, happiness and gold. Along with the story will be some artwork created by our artists, Wayne Rieve and Rosie Wells. Two tremendous talents that are integral to our development. They add color and personality to all our works in a way that perfectly align with our vision.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little background on me: I\u0027m a life long day dreamer and philosopher (Untrained) but I\u0027m always thinking about it in one way or another. By \u0027it\" I mean my personal philosophy which I affectionately call Klyphism. I\u0027ve since broadened the idea to be a little less centered on myself, and now I call it Infinitism, which allows for anyone to dub their own individual \"ism\". The philosophy boils down to these four rules, and one unifying tenet; Be Nice. Be in the know. Have fun. Have love. Do something. I have elaborated on these points in one way or another on several other media, such as YouTube, Blogspot and various social medias. I try to live my life by those concepts on a daily basis, and encourage those who get to know me to do the same.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from dreaming and philosophizing, I did some semi-professional theater for a time; acting in a few places in Orange County and Long Beach. Most prominently at the Garage Theatre in Long Beach, but also at a couple of colleges in SoCal and I even did the Summer Conservatory at South Coast Repertory. I have appeared in a smattering of student films as well. Over the course of the last couple of decades, I\u0027ve dabbled with that while keeping jobs at Blizzard Entertainment for 10 years as customer support, and concurrently performed as a show guide for the Ghosts and Legends Show at the Queen Mary for 3 years. I did fulfillment (Glorified envelope stuffing) at CaliforniaChoice/Word and Brown for nearly 6 years. I\u0027ve had several other smaller jobs as a Driver, Courier, Delivery man, Inventory manager and at one point I was even getting paid to put stickers on walls. Yeah, it was a thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile those jobs had various levels of tedium and frustration, they all provided me valuable experience and tons of inspirational ideas. Many of those ideas I have at least jotted down here and there, and I have reached a time in my life where those ideas should really start to come to fruition. That brings me here to share with the world, my story ideas starting with the one that brought me here, Richard the Dragon. This idea was initially kind of a joke by my Wife, Monica, who encouraged me to put a story together about bumbling through dragon maturity with a slightly comical and metaphorical eye.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI definitely need to point out that this project is part of a greater company vision. Poisoned Heart Productions is still in it\u0027s infancy and on the same day this is launching we also have Monica\u0027s first published book ready for purchase, called Poisoned Touch. We are just a small company for now. With a small team of 4 other than ourselves, that help create the artwork, and add the administrative support that we need. For more info on our company you can check out \u003ca href=\"http://www.poisonedheartproductions.com.\"\u003ewww.poisonedheartproductions.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHere at Patreon, we intend to keep Richard the Dragon\u0027s story going until it reaches it\u0027s natural conclusion, and once we get there, we will move on to more ideas. So keep coming back! We greatly appreciate you, the reader, for coming by our page to explore the stories as they unfold. We look forward to seeing what kind of response it gets, and will watch it grow with the rest of you. Thank you so much for coming by and we hope you enjoy reading about Richard\u0027s journey and any other future stories that make it here for your reading pleasure.\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Thank you so very much! \u003cbr\u003eM.
