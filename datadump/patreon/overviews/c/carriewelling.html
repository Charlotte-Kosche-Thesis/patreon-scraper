It\u0027s been a life rich with incredible experiences and personal fulfillment. I can\u0027t even begin to tell you how wonderful the journey has been.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNevertheless, making music and supporting yourself in this independent day and age can be challenging.\u00a0 I\u0027ve held down a number of different jobs in order to support myself and my career as a musician in New York City and now Nashville.\u00a0 From working in the restaurant industry to playing cover gigs and teaching voice lessons, the hustle has been real! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"God! Why\u0027s it so hard to say these words out loud\u2026\u201d (New Song Sneak Peek #1!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy? Because music is my calling. And even when the fire inside me feels as if it is nearly extinguished, and my anxiety leaves me paralyzed and overwhelmed, a tiny flicker of light persists, fighting to keep that one last coal ablaze.\u003cbr\u003eI identify that as Hope.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recognize that if I let go of my ambitions, I\u2019ll be tormented by this regretful sensation for the rest of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u0027ve set new goals for myself in 2018.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve learned so much about the music industry and more importantly about myself. I\u0027m inspired and I am determined. With the help of a great team, I\u0027ve outlined a plan and feel reinvigorated. I can\u0027t wait to share what we\u0027ve come up with.\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings me to PATREON - an exciting platform that offers a new age solution to the challenges of independent artistry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you guys come in.\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform where my closest supporters may assist me with my craft. By engaging with me, we\u0027ll share the many new stories and songs that are burning within me. I believe this platform will provide a home where I may hold myself accountable for my work. I need that. When a patron subscribes to my page they will receive access to exclusive rewards and unreleased content. And I will receive a necessary fuel to keep burning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou are free to donate as much or as little as you can afford.\u003cbr\u003eAnd your subscription is always under your control. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery bit brings me one step closer to creative freedom. Patreon is a community where my supporters and I will interact, chat on live streams, and share the wealth of fresh ideas my team and I have been working on. I\u2019ll share behind-the-scenes footage, and the real, raw experience of life as a musician through innovative projects. And you can be my little cyberspace family ;).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI promise to remain honest. I vow to be authentic and genuine.\u003cbr\u003eI pledge to deliver my experiences through song at least once a month and patrons will be the first to hear my latest work. I\u2019ll even be offering some groovy merchandise and prizes. Needless to say, you\u2019ll receive a piece of me.\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will join me in this next chapter of my career. Thank you for believing in me. I am excited to begin and can not wait to meet with you in this compelling space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my love and gratitude,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCarrie\u003cbr\u003eXOXOX\u003c/div\u003e"
