I\u2019m Suzie, AKA Critical Lit Games!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCritical Lit Games was devised by myself as a means of exploring text based games in different realities (VR, AR and MR - virtual, augmented and mixed reality respectively). My primary focus is on AR; enjoying the middle ground of the tangible and the digital. I\u2019m making AR Gamebooks, Cards and Models (the latter of which are toys that have AR narrative elements) - and I hope you enjoy what experiments I\u2019m whipping up in the lab (or, more accurately, Unity). I\u0027ve always enjoyed drawing (especially charcoal and ink), and after doing Inktober this year, I\u0027ve decided to hand draw a lot of my assets and cards. Inking really relaxes me and I adore the monochromatic aesthetic!\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to see behind the scenes of Critical Lit Games, as well as receive Art Prints or AR story cards (that update every month), then this is the place for you! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://criticallitgames.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/image_6483441-2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://criticallitgames.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/img_1690.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cimg\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Time Model:\u003c/strong\u003e Having been a fan of playing and making games (or pretty much art), I know how long it can take to create an immersive/fun/engaging/solid/coherent/experimental/emotional experience (check off the ones you find the most important in a game). It\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint; even when you create something in the flow. There\u2019s always a build up, an amalgamation of ideas and processes that goes on behind the scenes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Personal Model:\u003c/strong\u003e Because of the indie nature in which I\u2019m making these AR experiences, I\u2019m creating a lot of written and illustrated art - some of which might not make the finished game. Some of them might just be stored away for a rainy day. Some of them might be made for a nice monthly gift! :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThis also allows me to be more personal when creating a larger project: I can show you where my mind space is each month and create a space where we can share all sorts of ideas and experiences rather than just shoving the final book/card/model online. This is the main reason why I chose Patreon over Kickstarter. We can spend time on getting to know each other between projects and discuss things longterm!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Support Model: \u003c/strong\u003eSupport is always helpful. Money *Gulp*, of course, is always helpful. Making AR experiences for mobile usually requires some licensing in order to be deployed and sold (for example, my gamebooks are being made with Vuforia and Unity). The support can be as much or as little as you\u2019d like - and I hope we can all enjoy the Critical Lit Journey for as long as possible!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Pretentious Model: \u003c/strong\u003eAR is about making the implicit explicit, and maybe the same is with Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://criticallitgames.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/image_6483441-3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg style=\"width: 246px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://criticallitgames.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/image_6483441.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg style=\"width: 253px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI\u2019m a writer, first and foremost! I\u2019ve written and produced plays, poetry and short stories (mainly in the SF and Fantasy genres). I even studied Creative Writing for my BA, MA and even my PhD (which is in Science Fiction and Theatre, that popular subject). However, Critical Lit Games allows me to combine both of my loves of writing and gaming.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout rambling too much - I wanted to be a writer at age 6 and a games designer at age 8. I was raised on the SEGA megadrive, playing Sonic 1/2/3 (and Knuckles), the Streets of Rage trilogy, Street Fighter etc. I also loved Simon the Sorcerer and the Discworld game adaptation of \u003cem\u003eGuards! Guards!\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eThose probably helped to shape my love of text based games. For more recent influences, I\u2019ve particularly enjoyed the Hotel Dusk series, Phoenix Wright (although I\u2019ve actually preferred the Edgeworth series) and Welcome to VA11-HA11A. I also grew up with gamebooks (I have to thank my older brother for a lot, judging these earlier paragraphs), enjoying the Fighting Fantasy series, the Sonic Gamebooks and the Cyber Warriors from the Eternal Champions series (although I couldn\u2019t find the sequel). I\u2019ve got a blog post that goes into this more here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a lot of emotional ties to video games and books, and to be making a combination of the two is wholly satisfying to me! Thank you for reading this novel of an introduction - and let\u0027s get this CritLitCollective on the road!\u003cbr\u003e"
