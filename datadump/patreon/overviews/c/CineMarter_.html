    "summary": "Hello there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for checking out this page! That means that, at the very least, you\u0027re thinking about donating to my Patreon - or you\u0027re here by complete chance. In any event, welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been writing movie reviews on the internet for several years now, most recently during a two-year stint at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/moviesandtv/reviews/cinemarter\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Escapist\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. My time there has now come to an end, and since the movie-reviewing business isn\u0027t exactly in its greatest state, I decided that my next step would be to head down the crowdfunding route. It\u0027s now easier than ever to support people whose content you enjoy, after all! And I\u0027d like to continue reviewing movies for you. This is where we are now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve launched\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cinemarter.com\"\u003eCinemarter.com\u003c/a\u003e, which is where my reviews will now be found. I will continue to review new-release movies here, in addition to some classic reviews of movies that I think are interesting enough to talk about - or are requested by Patrons. I\u0027ll also be retrofitting my old $2.50 Reviews series, which is a slow and arduous process, but one that I\u0027ll be glad to have done. This site will house all of these, as well as a few other things that are in the works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe plan is to get a minimum of two new-release reviews done a week, Classic reviews will be published during the week on a less consistent schedule, which will be determined primarily by Patreon support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you would like so support me, it would be wonderful if you would donate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those unaware, the way Patreon works is that you give it your Paypal or credit card information, and every month it is charged the amount that you decide. Patreon takes a small cut and the rest goes straight to the person to whom you choose to donate - in this case, me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will you get if you donate? Well, a $1 monthly donation (the minimum) will get you a \"thank you\" on the \"Support\" page of Cinemarter.com. A $5 monthly donation will get your Twitter account a follow from mine,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/CineMarter_\"\u003e@CineMarter_\u003c/a\u003e. $10 monthly donation will entitle you to pick one movie for me to review every half-year, assuming I haven\u0027t already reviewed it and it\u0027s reasonably accessible. A $50 monthly donation will entitle you to request a review every month - again, provided I haven\u0027t reviewed it already and it\u0027s reasonably accessible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have suggestions for other rewards you\u0027d like to see, please send them my way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is already getting wordy, so I\u0027ll end it with this: Thank you for reading this and thank you from the bottom of my heart if you decide to donate!"
