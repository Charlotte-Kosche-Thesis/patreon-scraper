    "summary": "Hi guys!\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, let me explain to you how Patron works:\u003cbr\u003ePatreon was created as a way for musicians to share their music, present their best products to the public, and give their fans and supporters of the arts the opportunity to support them through tips. You can choose a tip amount per video made and ONLY when that video is produced and uploaded is the money taken from your account. You can also set a max limit per month of what you are able to tip, in case you\u0027re worried about going over your budget. For each tip amount, I offer some kind of reward as a thank you to you for your support. That might be a free download of the song from the video, a limited edition copy of my single, or a 1-on-1 Skype sesh where you will have at least 60minutes of my attention to do whatever: talk, teach you stuff, drink tea, share photos of our cats, whatever. This provides a safety net to you guys: I promise to not post a video that I have not put my 100% effort into creating to be worthy of your support. I plan to post a video about once or twice per month, so this can help you budget with how much you want to tip per month. For example, if you wanted to tip $10 per video, that would be $10-$20 a month, but ONLY if I upload a video. Also, you don\u0027t have to pledge anything to watch my videos, they will ALWAYS be free. But if you want to, that would be incredible, super duper nice of you, and you would immediately gain membership of the coolest-people-in-the-world-of-Cassie club.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow about why I\u0027m doing this:\u003cbr\u003eLike all of you, I have a dream (Tangled, anyone?). My dream is to be happy and successful doing what I love, turning my passion into my job, my career, my life work, and using my musical talents to impact people the way music has impacted me. Music is the universal language. Something that everyone can connect with right down to the core of a song\u0027s rhythm, no matter what language you speak. My favorite artists that I admire, that inspire me, and that I try to emulate have saved my life with their music, given me hope, helped me find myself when I didn\u0027t know I was lost and express myself when I had no words. Music has given me so much, and I want to be apart of that and give back to the world what music has given me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs many of you know, any career path that is art-based is a difficult one, and competitive. Piracy of music is prolific, it can be difficult to get your music out there and into the hands of people, equipment, instruments and traveling to venues chalks up cost fast, and so making a living doing this profession is not without its obstacles. But if you can\u0027t afford music, you shouldn\u0027t have to be without it. I still want people to be able to hear me sing, and to share my songs that have touched them with their friends. I want it to circulate. That\u0027s why these videos will always be free. However, if you can afford to tip even a $1 or more to support me, that is AMAZING. There are not enough words to express my gratitude to you, I am so thankful. Every little bit helps and knowing that you feel my music is worth your support is an incredible, all-consuming feeling that I can\u0027t even begin to express in words, but that makes me smile a LOT. Musicians cannot make a living and do what they do without their supportive, loyal fans. But YOU and your loyalty mean more to me than your dollars. I will work hard to make quality videos worthy of your tips and support, and will use money earned toward better equipment, instruments and other musicians to produce a better quality end-product and to do more shows, videos and albums.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way I intend to use Patron is to continue to make videos that will always be free to watch and to circulate my music, getting into as many hands and ears as possible. But if you feel like my material is worth the cost of an MP3 or more, if you want to support my passion for music and my dream for making this a successful career, you can give me the freedom to really focus on music rather than focusing alone on making a dollar to make it through the next day. I want to make my music worthy of your loyalty and patronage. It is a privilege to share my heart with you through music and to try to capture the hearts of others and their experiences through song. I hope you\u0027ll join me, I\u0027m excited to see where this new adventure will take us! LOVE you all, and THANK YOU! xo -Cassie\u003cbr\u003e"
