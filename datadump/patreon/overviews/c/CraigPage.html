    "summary": "Who I Am\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eMy name is Craig Page. I\u0027m a freelance writer born and raised in the Bronx and currently living in Jersey City, NJ. I am a trained Mental Health Counselor with a Masters and Bachelors in Psychology. I\u0027m a member of Phoenix Outlaw Productions, developers and runners of tabletop and live action role playing games, and have run games in several states in the US. When not writing, I discuss and teach lightsaber combat (seriously) with stage choreography group Rogue Alliance and online Martial Arts program Terra Prime Light Armory.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy I\u0027m Here\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI\u0027ve been writing fiction in some form or another since I was in freshman year of high school, bored out of my mind. I realized that I was better at it when I had an audience, deadline, and a reward at the end. This Patreon is meant to keep me going, both mentally and financially. By becoming my Patron, you are supporting me continuing my craft as I begin to look for better equipment, editors, and to be honest, help with groceries and day to day expenses.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I Write\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eThe fiction I write is mostly urban fantasy in nature. I am a fan of Jim Butcher\u0027s Dresden Files, Seanan McGuire (and Mira Grant)\u0027s October Daye and Feed series as well as Kate Griffins Matthew Swift series. I\u0027ve grown up in New York City all my life, and you can feel that there is magic in the modern cities as much as in the ancient ruins. It\u0027s a different kind of magic, unsure and mercurial. It changes depending on the places one goes, the people who live there. You can go to one neighborhood and feel the power of a liberation movement, and move in to the adjacent and feel the movement of nothing but money and power. There is magic in the streets, and I like to search it.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat You Get\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\nAll Patrons will get access to my works, with each post being a short story or chapter of my novels.
