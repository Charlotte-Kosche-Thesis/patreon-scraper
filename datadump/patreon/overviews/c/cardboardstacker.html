I love board games and I\nproduce video reviews and tutorials about board games on my channel called \u201c\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/thecardboardstacker\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Cardboard Stacker\u003c/a\u003e.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\nsupport the Cardboard Stacker?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been making videos on board games for just over 2 years. I love to make\nthem but I need your help. By supporting me, it would allow\nme to buy new equipment, the latest games, and hire staff to help make this\nchannel possible. In order for The Cardboard Stacker the reach top grade\nquality, I need to get better stuff. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027re plunging into Patreon this year during our 3\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;rd\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt; season. Since\nFall of 2012 we have produced over 40 videos with little to no budget. Every bit of\nhelp will go into making even more video and being released more fequently. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/15DWrytY5XU\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout\nThe Cardboard Stacker\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI made the Cardboard Stacker so I can tell people about the amazing games I\ndiscover. I also wanted my videos to focus fully on the game right down to the\nboard, and give the viewer a good and clear explanation of what the game is all\nabout. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI currently do five different series on The Cardboard Stacker. \u201cThe Cardboard\nStacker: Main Series\u201d is all about modern board game overviews \u0026amp; reviews.\n\u201cThe Stacker\u2019s Stockpile\u201d is about older and unique or odd board games. We open\nsome packages in our \u201cUnboxing Series.\u201d \u201cQuick Start Tutorial\u201d is a series\nabout teaching board games and gives a head start for those learning the game.\nAnd \u201cCardboard Check\u201d, our newest series, is where I give an overview on the\ncomponents and materials that come in a game box. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow Your Money Will Be Used to Cover\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eGames: \u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYes, I need games. Lots of them. Not just to play, but most importantly for me\nto review and tell you what you need to know so you can decide if this is the\nright game for you. And with your support, I will be able to get new and hopefully\nbetter games. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eEquipment for the production:\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOne\u003c/strong\u003e: New Microphone.

Lighting is\nimportant in our videos, but we need an upgrade in this as well.
