    "summary": "Simply put, we absolutely love podcasting. We are addicted to good conversation \u0026amp; interesting people. We are in love with our community and see this as a way to preserve, promote, and highlight it. As of now, we all work full-time jobs in addition to working for Citizen:Earth. We would like to invest 100% of our time in to Citizen:Earth so that we can turn it in to something really amazing.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Citizen:Earth Media?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nWe are a talk show based on\nexploring important topics and promoting the culture of Morganton, NC of which we are so proud to be a part. We regularly invite people from the community on the\nshow for a variety of reasons. We have had conversations with pastors,\npoliticians, city employees, local activists, farmers, painters, musicians, and\nfriends. We often talk about those two topics you don\u0027t bring up at the dinner\ntable: politics and religion. We talk a lot about other topics that interest\nand inspire us such as movies, history, technology, science, and consciousness. We\nstrive to create a medium championing our first amendment rights, exploring all\nsides of any topic, and reaching across the aisle to those that think\ndifferently from us. We have also provided on-site coverage for special events\nwithin the community such as beer festivals, comic book conventions, and\ndowntown protests.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Citizen:Earth Media?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nOur show was created in 2015\nby brothers Isaac and Sam Crouch. Today,we\u0027re fortunate to have added Grant Houston, Zach Riddle, and Marty James.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Support Us?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nCrowd funding is the way of\nthe future. Most podcasts, including ours, have reached out to businesses both\nlarge and small to create revenue by offering advertisements. However our\nvision is to be a media outlet beholden only to our listeners. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPodcasting is a lot of work\nwhen done right. Much time, production, and dedication is put in to the process\nof securing interesting people for interviews, maintaining an online social media\npresence, keeping the website up to date, recording and editing the episodes, creating YouTube videos for each episode, being on site\nfor news-worthy events \u2013 you can see how it adds up fast.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe will always post our\nepisodes for free for all to hear, but supporting us through our Patreon allows\nus to invest more time on quality content, improve our services, and reach towards higher goals.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat are our goals for the future?\u003c/h3\u003e\nOur vision is to become a legitimate organization that fuses\npodcasting with traditional forms of media like magazines and news outlets. We will continue to pursue interesting topics and guests to join us on the\npodcast, but we will expand our work by producing quality videos and writing\nwell-researched, insightful articles that address topics and issues relevant on\nboth a local and state level. We will attract more talented people to our team\nto contribute content. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEventually, we hope to be an independent media outlet for\nMorganton and beyond that produces thought-provoking and informative content across a variety of digital\nmediums, serves as a voice of compassion and reason, and highlights the unique\nthoughts and perspectives of the amazing culture we share in this community. A small measure of support from you can help us accomplish that.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your support, we will strive to bring you diverse quality content on a regular basis. For each of the areas below we envision separate and dedicated podcasts, with additional articles, blog posts, and video series. Eventually, some of our podcasts will be vodcasts as well. At first we will produce these projects ourselves, but as we recruit more talented people to the C:E team, the variety of our hosts will increase.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePolitics\u003c/strong\u003e - We will continue our work interviewing and profiling local candidates and reach out to more representatives on a state and federal level. Staff writers will contribute regular news and opinion pieces. We will connect the people of our community with their local representatives so that government becomes transparent and citizens become engaged.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent Events \u003c/strong\u003e- We want to keep you informed and up to date on news that matters locally, regionally, and nationally.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eScience \u0026amp; Tech \u003c/strong\u003e- We will utilize our love of science and technology in a weekly podcast series. Isaac is eager to use his graduate studies in science education to communicate science to the public. But even with his background, science reporting takes a lot of time to keep up with and even more time to understand the findings and advances. There is more communicating this information effectively. We want to create more time to bring science to you in an understandable and entertaining way.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReligion\u003c/strong\u003e - We will continue the \"Conversations with Christians\" series and expand it to include guests of any religion, philosophy, or spirituality.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusic \u0026amp; Art\u003c/strong\u003e - We have many artists friends and know how difficult it is to promote your craft. We will have a dedicated art series that regularly interviews and advertises for local artists. We love the local and regional music scene, from punk to bluegrass to folk and metal and beyond. We want to have a regular video series that gives exposure to the local music scene, much like larger stations such as KEXP and NPR\u0027s \"Tiny Desk Concerts\". We are already working with Bombhouse Studios in Morganton towards this goal.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMovies \u0026amp; Music Reviews\u003c/strong\u003e - We will have a regular series talking about our favorite records and films to keep our listeners up to date with new releases we find notable.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSports \u003c/strong\u003e- We will have a dedicated sports team that doesn\u0027t just tell you who won what, but examines the lesser known, more interesting aspects and stories of the sports we all love.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOral History\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e- \u003c/strong\u003eWe will have a podcast series solely about capturing an oral history of Morganton and Western NC which will consist of interviewing those that have lived here and experienced our shared history firsthand.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
