    "summary": "Cobra TV wants to \u003cstrong\u003eEXPAND!\u003c/strong\u003e We want to go beyond what we are doing now. Our passion is covering the development of games, most of the time these are Independent games. We are not limited to that, we also love AAA games, as well. \u003cbr\u003eWhen I look to the future I envision a Cobra TV in the likes of IGN. We want to provide honest, and, passionate\u00a0 reporting, interviews (as we have done in the past) podcasts, Let\u0027s Plays, Subcasts ( a podcast we do with our subscribers) Closer look videos, where we pick apart published details about a particular game, and so much more. What makes Cobra TV different is that we focus, and include our community, by sharing fan art of the show, and of your favorite games. Having you come on the show to talk about gaming and your outlets, such as your YouTube channels and other things. Recently we have been visiting buildings for rent to make this happen. I am shocked at the cost this would all take. I want to do this full time, and want to go in 100% to have no regrets looking back. If we fail, we will know we gave it our strongest effort. I will eventually be adding more staff, more personalities to the show, people to send to events such as E3, and more. An actual studio with cameras better equipment, stage props, and so on. We need your help to make this happen. Thank you for taking your valuable time in reading this, or watching the video! Now let\u0027s get back to gaming, shall we?\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
