    "summary": "Hey everybody, my name is Patrick Lee and I write and illustrate an essay series about video games called \u003ca href=\"http://caspiancomic.com/gametheory/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGame Theory.\u003c/a\u003e Before we continue, important note: I\u0027m not affiliated in any way with the Screwattack show Game Theory, the name is just a coincidence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGaming is a young medium, and is just hitting its stride as a means for \nartistic and creative expression. Games journalism and games criticism \nare both even younger than the medium they cover, and have even less \ndefined voices. Game Theory is my attempt to participate in the shaping \nof games discussion and the development of the tone surrounding games \ncriticism. It\u2019s my attempt to treat games criticism like\n film or literary criticism, and take for granted the idea that games \nare as academically robust as any older or more entrenched artistic \nmedium. I think games are capable of exactly the sorts of depth that has\n already been achieved on the page and on the silver screen, but that \nthey access and generate that depth through mechanisms completely \nunheard of until about forty years ago, and so every voice that helps \npeople to understand the language and potential of gaming is going to be\n valuable to some degree. I think games get a bad rap as colourful \ndistractions for children or violent fantasies for dangerous nutcases, \nand I want to demonstrate that games are capable of delivering the sorts\n of beauty and honesty that we expect from any other storytelling \nmedium.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the time of writing, Game Theory articles have taken the form of \u003ca href=\"http://caspiancomic.com/gametheory/?p=18\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ecomprehensive critical overviews,\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://caspiancomic.com/gametheory/?p=305\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ein depth literary style analyses,\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://caspiancomic.com/gametheory/?p=393\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003especulative post mortems,\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://caspiancomic.com/gametheory/?p=471\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edissections of the systems and play languages common to all games,\u003c/a\u003e and even \u003ca href=\"http://caspiancomic.com/gametheory/?p=102\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe occasional stint of fantasy game design,\u003c/a\u003e and I\u0027m always looking for ways to engage with specific games and the medium as a whole in ways that nobody else has. Really the only thing that Game Theory articles truly have in common is that I\u0027m always trying to broaden and deepen the conversation surrounding games in ways that I haven\u0027t seen done elsewhere, whether that means \u003ca href=\"http://caspiancomic.com/gametheory/?p=197\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eexamining a specific game through a lens I haven\u0027t seen used before\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"http://caspiancomic.com/gametheory/?p=490\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eattempting to personally create a body of critical literature for a game about which very little of substance has been said.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the research, writing, illustrating, and webmastering stuff for Game Theory is done by me alone, and in order to keep the site up to the standards I hold for it I necessarily sink a lot of time and my own money into the project. That said, writing about, analyzing, and criticizing culture is what I\u0027m good at, and it\u0027s one of the things I\u0027d like to do professionally in addition to creating content myself somewhere down the line. By supporting Game Theory, you\u0027ll be helping to keep the site from being a burden on my resources, you\u0027ll be keeping ads off the site, and you\u0027ll be enabling me to create content for the site more regularly. It would be a dream to be able to write Game Theory and work on my other projects full time, and I\u0027m hoping to take a step towards that goal by generating some income for myself through Patreon. I also intend to reinvest as much as I can back into the creation cycle by using the money to cover the cost of games to discuss, improving my web hosting situation, and eventually even branching out into video content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I\u0027m able, or at least mostly able, to update the site with a major, substantive article about once a month, so if you\u0027re going to support the site you can expect your pledge to be collected on a more or less monthly basis. I decided to accept pledges on a per article rather than per month basis because occasionally an article will take longer than a month to complete, or I\u0027ll happen to go a calendar month without updating, and I didn\u0027t want to be charging people for a month\u0027s worth of no content. In addition to this, I\u0027m trying to post smaller \"Minigame Theory\" updates more frequently to fill in the spaces between major updates. What this boils down to is that if you choose to support Game Theory you will be hit up for your pledge a minimum of zero, but a maximum of two times per calendar month. As an incentive, I\u0027ll be posting behind-the-scenes stuff exclusively for patrons right here on Patreon, including sketches, hi-res versions of illustrations used on the site, sneak peaks at upcoming articles, and exclusive written and illustrated content. I\u0027m going to try to get something Patreon exclusive up at least once a week, so if you\u0027re interested in the process of creating articles like mine, it\u0027s a great insight into how this particular sausage gets made.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll that said, thanks very much for reading, and I hope you\u0027ll consider supporting Game Theory.\u003cbr\u003e"
