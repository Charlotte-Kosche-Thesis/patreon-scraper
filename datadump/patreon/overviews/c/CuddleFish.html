     "about": "My name is Katarina, but my friends call me Kat for short. I\u0027m a huge fan of anime and I love to cosplay. I have a huge passion for it, I love being able to be a character I admire and yet at the same time continuing to be myself. I\u0027m a digital artist and if your interested at seeing my work I can link you my art profile. I\u0027m a gamer girl and I love to play league of legends and aura kingdom. I do stream when in game so I will have that linked somewhere on my profile for anyone who wants to see. I do have cosplay nights on my stream and if im gifted something on league I do make a picture of whatever you gifted me and add your name to it so your name will forever be on my stream. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIm a full time hostess at a restaurant trying to make a living on what little of an income I have, as well as work I\u0027m a full time student at college trying to get my arts degree. It is a struggle but somehow im barely managing. With in 2014 I lost my mother, she was on her death bed for 2 weeks and then she passed away. After that was when I was thrown out on my own with no clue as to what to do. I was a very sheltered girl with littke knowledge but im fighting to make it ^-^ . I\u0027m not alone though, 3 days prior to my mom going to the hospital she got me a gift. An 8 week old siberian husky puppy. She has been a hand full and I was unable to take care of her due to money issues but now that I have my job I have been able to care for her. Her name is chloe and she is my pride and joy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI haven\u0027t been given many options since my mom passed away. I had to move from my home and find another. Since my puppy is a husky most places have refused to take her. After 2 months I found a place and im saving money for furniture to decorate my new home. And get more toys for chloe x3. Although she doesnt have a backyard. So I hope I can find somewhere with a nice size yard for her to be able to run freely and play in, but this is hard because of money issues. I hope to be able to afford one for her one day soon.",
