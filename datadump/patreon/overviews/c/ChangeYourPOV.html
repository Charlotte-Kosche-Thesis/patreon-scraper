    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello! Thank you so much for making your way to our Patreon page!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have some really big plans for the future and we are asking you to be a part of it all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur names are Eddie and Bennett and we are both military Veterans trying to make a difference in the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe figured what better way to do that then to create a Podcast right? So... Change Your POV Podcast was born! The ability to Change Your \"Point Of View\" we discovered was the secret ingredient needed to becoming as successful out of uniform as we were when we were in.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://changeyourpov.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Eddie-and-Bennett.png\"\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe have some amazing Sponsors and other Affiliate programs that help defer some costs of running this show, but we realized two things:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1)\u003c/strong\u003e In order to take this venture as far as we can - including hosting conferences, meet-ups, and creating workshops and to better give back to the Veteran Community - we need additional tools, training and resources that cost money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) \u003c/strong\u003eWe also found that a lot of folks just want to support the work we are doing without any strings attached just because they love our content. How Awesome Is That?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon now gives you and us the opportunity to do just that!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t expect or assume anyone will contribute any more to our show than simply listening to our podcast. We really appreciate that by itself more than you know! But if you feel like contributing more, it\u0027ll all go back into creating more great stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChange Your POV has had a great start and we\u0027ve developed an enthusiastic listenership in our first year. Since launching in 2016, we\u0027ve published over 150 Podcast Episodes (along with a handful of short blog posts and free downloadables), and Change Your POV has become a collective 30+ hour/week job for us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe know two things now: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1)\u003c/strong\u003e We want Change Your POV to go on for a long time. The beta test is over. It works. We have listeners and super cool fans. I\u0027m obsessed with Change Your POV Blog and Podcast\u2014it\u0027s the most fun we\u0027ve ever had doing anything. This should continue for a long time, in some form or another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2)\u003c/strong\u003e We need to make Change Your POV self-sustaining for this to work. The \"fund Change Your POV with out of pocket + savings + other company\" plan was fine for Phase 1, but it\u0027s not sustainable. Our savings are unimpressive. In order to grow we need every dollar to invest in itself. If Change Your POV is going to go on for a long time, it has to be able to support itself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLong Term:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThinking about the long-term, self-sustaining plan, we decided we don\u0027t want to use ads. Ads are annoying and hurt the user experience, and we can come up with a better way to do it. So far, we have two methods:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1)\u003c/strong\u003e The few affiliate sponsors we have promoted on the show has definitely helped, but it doesn\u0027t even get us half of the way to self-sustainability. Maybe when we have more time to further develop additional affiliates, it\u0027ll do the job, but it\u0027s not enough as it is now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2)\u003c/strong\u003e Donations. We\u0027ve received donations from generous listeners that have reached out to us very thankful for the work we do and value we\u0027ve brought to them in their life. A lot of those donors, along with other listeners, have suggested that Patreon is a better way for listeners to support the Podcast. So we\u0027re trying it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way Patreon works is a listener can donate whatever they want per month and the donation is recurring each month after that. So anything, from $1/month up, is hugely helpful to the cause.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://changeyourpov.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/plan.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We\u0027ll Use the Money For:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur initial goal is $1,000/month as a starting point.

Change Your POV is different in that we meet you where you are.\u003cbr\u003eThat day when you take off the uniform for the last time comes to all of us. However, not all of us are ready when that day comes! We all want to be just as successful once we are out as we were when we were in. This can come as a significant challenge for many of us, we are here to help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eUnderstanding Your Place\u003c/h1\u003eThere are several things we struggle with once we are out like Converting Military Experience into language Non-Veterans can understand and find value in, Writing a resume, Interviewing, Finding our higher purpose, Connecting with a community, Our Health and Fitness, and the list goes on and on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is very common to just feel lost and confused and not know what to do, where to turn, what to ask and to whom. We get it because we have been there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eHelping Non-Veterans Find Value In Veterans\u003c/h1\u003eHelping Veterans become successful often starts with educating Non-Veterans to recognize the Unique Value Proposition (UVP) that all Veterans can bring to the table.\u003cbr\u003eEveryone has seen \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/blackhawkdown/\"\u003eBlack Hawk Down\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/zerodarkthirty/\"\u003eZero Dark Thirty\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0887912/\"\u003eThe Hurt Locker\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418763/\"\u003eJarhead\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2179136/\"\u003eAmerican Sniper\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eand so many combat action war movies.
