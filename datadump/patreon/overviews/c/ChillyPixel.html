Here is a story of sickness and power, of demons and desperation, but most of all, here is a story of survival.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce upon a time, there lived a kingdom. Prosperous and wreathed with green, the kingdom enjoyed the bounty of the land and of life. And at the head of the kingdom\u2026 as its guiding light\u2026 was a strong and righteous king.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/417532111243837450/427718871966023680/nianitecastlecomplete.png\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 75px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut abundance does not spring from nowhere. In order to expand his kingdom, the king raised enormous armies and conquered neighboring lands, one by one. Glittering with steel and dyed crimson with the blood of his enemies, the king began to show a ruthless nature the likes of which nobody had ever seen. The more that other countries yielded at the king\u2019s feet, the more twisted he became, the more his greed for money and lust for power grew.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe evils planted inside his heart flourished and, eventually, a demon of the underworld was attracted by its tantalizing aura. It manifested itself inside his body and fed on suffering. The king was soon confined to his bed with his illness, becoming weaker with every passing day. Many doctors came and went, but all failed to see why the formerly healthy king was now crippled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDesperate and fearful for his life, the king finally called for the aid of an unlikely healer - a shaman. This man knew arts that had long been forgotten, faded to obscurity through the ages and eyed with suspicion however it was used: magic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe shaman drew the demon\u2019s energy out from the king like poison from a wound, storing it in a substance known as nianite. The powered nianite could then be used as a potent power source for the kingdom. The king was cured - and his subjects rejoiced - but to keep the illness at bay, the king would have to continually draw the demon\u2019s energy into nianite. If ever he failed, or forgot to do this task, then the demon would win, and unspeakable things would happen to him and the kingdom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the blade of this disease looming over his head, there was peace for a while. But eventually\u2026 an accident occurred.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe shaman called upon his ancient magic\u2026 and drew out the demon itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/396036265088253954/427319655536001024/image.png?width=303\u0026amp;height=301\" style=\"width: 302px; height: 300px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHorrified, the shaman barely managed to seal the demon into an amulet. It was dormant once more, but for how long?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoon, the king\u2019s lapse in strength was enough for the people he had conquered through death and cruelty to band together. It was time to reap the hatred the king had sown. They burnt town after town to ashes and soon came for the capital itself... how the mighty had fallen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnwilling to let go of the life he had fought long and hard for, the king gathered his brightest engineers, the mystical shaman, and what remaining nianite he had. They toiled for 7 days and nights, knowing that failure meant death, to forge the most magnificent weapon the kingdom had ever seen. Its name was \u201cValhalla\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUncertain if they he would live to see the next day and filled with grief for his wife, who had been killed in battle, the shaman entrusted the cursed amulet to his son and instructed him to run from the upcoming fight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/417532111243837450/417532717454983181/shamansaber.jpeg?width=252\u0026amp;height=300\" style=\"width: 251px; height: 300px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the sun rose the next day, two armies met on the battlefield.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eValhalla absorbed the power of countless amounts of nianite\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd exploded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt blazed like the midday sun, searing both friend and foe with flame and ash, expanding and surging like a wildfire. The explosion was so great that no one in the kingdom, not even the king and the shaman, was spared a fiery death.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExcept for one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe shaman\u2019s son. Young and less wise in the ways of magic than those who preceded him, he had unwittingly become infected by the demon in the amulet. He would inevitably succumb to it\u2026 but in the face of Valhalla\u2019s consuming blast, the demon\u2019s power protected itself and, consequently, the one it had possessed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe son found himself in an unfamiliar world, the ruins of a kingdom, with no knowledge of what had happened at the battle.
