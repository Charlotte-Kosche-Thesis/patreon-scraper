    "summary": "I\u0027m Karl Haro von Mogel, and I\u0027m a plant geneticist with a passion for science communication. For eight years I have been helping people understand the science of plant genetics with \u003ca href=\"https://www.biofortified.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBiology Fortified\u003c/a\u003e, with articles, infographics, web resources and our plush mascot \u003ca href=\"https://www.biofortified.org/support/plant-plushies/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFrank N. Foode\u003c/a\u003e. There are some amazing things going on with plants and biotechnology today, and even more amazing things we\u0027re discovering about how plants have changed in the past to become our food today. Is there a better way to explore this than with the food itself?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re embarking on a new project - an experiment if you will - to bring the science into your kitchen for you to explore. Cooking with Frank N. Foode is a web series that explores how food is transformed by humans, with recipes that you can make and discussions of science and how it connects to society. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m drawing on the amazing knowledge and talents of scientists, artists, musicians, and dietitians to make this video series a reality, which is why we\u0027re on Patreon. We need money for studio rental, software, equipment, props, ingredients, travel, and time to bring all the elements together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like these videos, please pitch in $1, or $2 - or any amount you want per episode - and I\u0027ll keep them coming! I will publish 1-2 episodes per month, and your donation will go to Biology Fortified to support this work. If you contribute more, you can get access to special rewards like extended interviews, a postcard, and more. More support will unlock goals like free Frank-focused episodes live chats, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s start Cooking with Frank N. Foode together!\u003cbr\u003e"
