(keep coming to those, too! thank you!) in exchange you receive poetry, stories, interviews, process peeks, and surprises! your support goes directly to my expenses for exhibition and performance work. your support helps me buy supplies for my visual art, update my technology for new media work, pay for rehearsal space, and publishing. ok.. $2-10 may not pay for all of these but it shows your love and support and i get to give you things!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei appreciate your interest in my word | dance | art -making. i\u0027m grateful for the opportunity to share my work and to help others do the same. i make because i am; it feels like a blessing to and may it bless you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethank you so much!\u003cbr\u003enico"
