I draw webcomics about depression and living with mental illness and put them on the internet. These comics aim to try to understand the illness from the perspective of not only someone who has lived with it but from the perspective of their family and friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough all my work is on the web for free, I do need help with hosting, supplies, art classes, and the copious amounts of coffee needed to compete this work. I also keep the website completely free of advertising and gimmicks to keep the page as readable and accessible as possible. Because of Patreon, I can host it without requiring ads, pop ups, or selling stuff, and this allows me to concentrate on bringing you the best comic I can do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you\u0027re interested, one strip is published a week (four to five, depending on how many Fridays there are in a month).
