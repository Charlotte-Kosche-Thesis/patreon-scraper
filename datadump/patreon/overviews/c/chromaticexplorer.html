Long before Instagram filters and smart phone apps, I manipulated images on paper to explore altering reality to reveal my hidden self. I began to scratch, draw, mark, tear, and paint over magazine pictures and family memories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI discovered that beyond the shallow pixel I could manipulate materials in response to my chromatic and textural observations. Memories could be reborn by my hand and capture the feeling of that moment. Emotions could be revealed at a safe distance and displayed in public. Living, creating, destroying, scratching, rubbing, layering, and pushing materials on the surface to reveal beauty.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI share these interventions, transported from place, captured in a moment, and display before you as a biography of my queer experiences of the world.\u003cbr\u003e",
