The basic concept was to share one of the 52 ways in each podcast. Since then, I\u2019ve added other topics as they occur to me, either because I just read about them, or they came up during a client appointment, or just otherwise caught my interest. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I enjoying doing my podcast, it was getting a bit lonely. :) Setting up this Patreon site is a way for me to reach out to listeners and engage with them more. I want to know what you want to know, what you need help with. I\u2019ll use that information to make my podcasts much more valuable. I\u2019ll share the \u201cgreatest hits\u201d from my members-only Twitter chats as posts here for everyone to read.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is for the podcast, but you\u2019ll notice that I produce other stuff too. The Level 2 reward is a product I\u2019ve been wanting to create for a long time and this is a perfect way for me to get it out there. Who knows? I\u2019ll probably think up groovy new things to test out on you guys!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven $1 a month will help. Good ideas and good work need support. The greater my patronage level, the more time and energy I can spend on putting out the best work I can. Thanks for visiting my page. I hope my work helps you be better organized and more productive, not because I say you should be, but because it makes your life easier and more fulfilling.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are welcome, of course, to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.organizeyourlifepodcast.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elisten to the podcast for free here\u003c/a\u003e. If you like it you may decide to pitch in and support it and that would be fantastic. Thanks! \u003cbr\u003e"
