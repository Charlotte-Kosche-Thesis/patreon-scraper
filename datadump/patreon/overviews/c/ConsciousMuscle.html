The majority of you already know who I am and what i\u0027m about (Instagram\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/conscious_muscle\"\u003e@Conscious_Muscle\u003c/a\u003e) . Besides spreading Veganism in every facet of \u00a0my life including bodybuilding I am an animal rights advocate. Over the last couple of years I started rescuing animals and have built out my own animal sanctuary/rescue (Instagram\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/lilyandfriendsrescue\"\u003e@LilyAndFriendsRescue\u003c/a\u003e) \u003cbr\u003eI do what I can for these animals and would like to do more. I have plans within the first 6 months of 2018 \u00a0to purchase a minimum of 5 acres so I can start rescuing more animals as well as larger ones such as horses and cows as opposed to the smaller critters I am already taking care of. Once land is picked out and specifics are known in terms of exact costs I will post everything to share with all of you as it arises as you are as much a part of this as I am and I am so grateful for this!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I have donated $1000\u0027s of dollar to other sanctuaries with my Conscious Muscle Sanctuary donation program every month all the while funding mine from my own pocket. This Patreon is for those of you who want to help me take care of the current Conscious Muscle critters and tend to their needs. Anything raised monthly beyond what is needed to take of all of the animals will go towards the purchase of the larger property and construction of it moving forward. When it comes time for that I will be completely transparent with everyone as I always have been and every single dollar spent from this campaign will be documented via receipts and invoices. Ranging from things as small as food to as large as vet bills, fencing, barns and land or whatever may be needed. That being said I want to give a big thank you to everyone who has been a part of this journey up to this point and send nothing but gratitude to those of you who are joining this compassion driven crusade now!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith good vibes and gratitude, Jordan/ Conscious Muscle\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
