On November 23rd, 2013, 250 Meetup members attended the live screening of \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eDay of the Doctor\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0on the show\u0027s 50th anniversary. \u00a0We hold monthly events at a north side comic shop, a cafe on the south\u00a0side, and regular social gatherings.

Chicago holds a very special place\u00a0in the history of Doctor Who fandom (after all, we saw \u003cstrong\u003eThe Five Doctors\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0in 1983 before England did), and we believe that our Meetup community should better reflect the diversity of this city. We also want to stay true to our core belief: \u003cem\u003ewe are an inclusive, grassroots, nonprofit community that serves as ambassadors for \u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0fandom and encourage further exploration, creation and appreciation of the\u00a0franchise.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo to the brass tacks: where will donations go? Here\u0027s a list of current and future expenses:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay our twice-a-year hosting bill on Meetup.com\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchase portable speakers and projector for future screenings\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAcquire amenities for attendees (such as purchasing food, beverages, etc)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchase Incentives for current/potential volunteers\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRent larger halls/venues for events\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTransportation for members to attend events in the suburbs\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAlthough member donations help offset the cost of running the Meetup, it means that we are limited in our scope and ability to reach a more diverse audience throughout the Chicago area. In an age where more corporate-driven enterprises are driving out fan-run events, it is important to see fans as part of a greater community, and to make events accessible for anyone who wishes to become part of Chicago-area \u003cstrong\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0fandom.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
