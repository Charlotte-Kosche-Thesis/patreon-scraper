    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me and My Projects\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHey! I am a self-taught game developer who has a lot of games ideas! I also love telling stories, specifically in-depth world building type stories. While the project I focus on strays from time to time, my main desire is to create a 3D platformer. I am a huge fan of Spyro, and love similar games like Ratchet \u0026amp; Clank. While other games can include anything from puzzle games to first person shooters to RPGs, I hope any content I make interests and entertains you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Development And This Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGame development is a challenging but fun process. There are a lot of steps that people like me love to observe and even contribute to. I created this patreon to give access to anyone who is interested. Find inside information like game development documents, roadmaps, process images, sneak peeks, and demos. Contribute to development with player insight, and help pave the way to a finished, polished product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Video from Old Art Tests - Update Coming Soon\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7ySlfsbhcE?rel=0\u0026amp;controls=0\u0026amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m Asking for Support\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI know I may not have the best setup to encourage patrons, but I find any support helpful. I can use these funds for things like assets, Unity subscriptions or other costs. One day I do hope to game dev full time, but I believe I will earn that thru a finished product, or a larger scale crowdfunding campaign. This option is to get in on the ground level, early, and help build the foundation. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon give me the ability to give back to those who choose to support me. With some tailored perks, you can participate in my project closer and with more exclusivity. View to the right for what you can receive!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eConclusion\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eAll contributions are greatly appreciated but never required. All community members are all loved! I hope that if you \u003cstrong\u003ecannot \u003c/strong\u003esupport monetarily, you support with your interactions and ideas! Visit my Twitter for updates (and probably bad jokes, hot takes, and political arguments)\u003cbr\u003e"
