    "summary": "Hello and welcome to my page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a collage artist, painter, and musician. Recently I have tapped into a boundless source of creative inspiration pushing me to better myself and my talents, seeing every day as an opportunity to do so. I\u0027m simply bursting with inspiration! \u00a0Upon completion of my recent projects, two hexagon-shaped furniture pieces, myself and others have been impressed with my natural artistic eye as well as the variety of themes executed on these tables.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 I am self-taught and have taken many art history courses which have steered me into the direction of surrealism as a major influence of my art. A few years back I graduated from UCLA with a history degree and have been taking a break from searching for a career to truly discover\u00a0my natural-born talents and\u00a0what will make me happy and fulfilled in the face of disillusionment from false idols which we are taught to look up to. What I have discovered is my desire for freedom to pursue creativity. As humans, we are the only living creatures (that we know of) that can create meaning out of mundane stuff, whether it be art, music, rituals, philosophy, or innovative inventions. I find peace and happiness in engaging in this magical act of creation. I was born with this ability, I better work to perfect it, I owe it to the world and my community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWith this new found belief and confidence in my work, I am starting a business to support my simple life out in Joshua Tree as an artist.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease take a look at my projects and support me if you wish! With your help I would be able to dedicate more time and resources towards making even better furniture projects and commissioned pieces! I will keep you updated with all the progress I make on these projects plus the silly antics of playing around with collage ideas before permanently pasting!\u003c/div\u003e"
