Piano lessons came at age 4. Making up my own melodies and musical doodles was one of my favorite activities. I would often spend hours \"entertaining\" our neighbors with little musicals that I would act out and sing for them. I talked my violin teacher into letting me play a made up musical doodle at the end of each lesson.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDance classes (ballet, tap, jazz, acrobatics, modern dance) began when I was 4 also. I danced en pointe for two years (age 12-13). I had to stop taking formal dance classes in high school because I had too many other musical activities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been involved in many plays and musicals, starting in middle school.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eLion in Wizard of Oz\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAunt Polly in Tom Sawyer, Himself\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMother Abbess in The Sound of Music\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThird Shepherd in The Second Shepherds\u0027 Play\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTilly Slowboy in a musical adaptation of \"Cricket on the Hearth\" by Dickens\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA live playing Fiddler in \"Fiddler on the Roof\"\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFruit Seller in \"Joseph the Carpenter\"\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eChorus of \"Amahl and the Night Visitors\"\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI learned to do theatrical makeup for \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,\" \"The Fantastiks,\" and others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve played in the pit orchestra for \"Brigadoon,\" \"Bye, Bye, Birdie,\" \"Hello, Dolly!\" \"Fiddler on the Roof.\" \"The Pirates of Penzance,\" \"Amahl and the Night Visitors,\" and many more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI studied violin and voice performance at Wichita State University, where I became interested in 20th Century Music and 1960s counterculture. I\u0027ve played many Irish fiddle tunes for St. Patty\u0027s Day gigs. I had the great honor to be St. Lucia in our local Swedish Christmas festival twice, and now I support the children by playing Swedish fiddle accompaniment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wrote and produced my first album in 1998 called \"The Seasons of Change.\" Production quality is quite poor, as I recorded it entirely on my own Compaq computer using Cakewalk Pro Audio, and didn\u0027t know thing about audio production. It would be super cool to redo the entire album someday in a proper studio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating art is my life! Whether it\u0027s music, poetry, yarn, paint, chalk, or even macaroni, I jump in with both feet."
