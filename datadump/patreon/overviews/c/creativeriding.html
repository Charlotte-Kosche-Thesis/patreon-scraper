    "summary": "Hello there!\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been waiting for you.\u003cbr\u003eWhen Creative Riding started late in 2015, the idea was to expose local riders and racer friends of mine who are also extremely talented ________ (you name it). As it turns out, unless you\u0027re a pro competitor or in \u0027the industry\u0027 somehow, you don\u0027t get any recognition for just being a creative person who likes to ride.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo, yes, while we do strive to expose the drag racer who is also a teacher, or the Harley-Davidson employee who mentors a girls motorcycle-building team in her spare time, we also have other goals:\u003cbr\u003eTo provide listeners and Patrons alike with funny, insightful, helpful, and historical podcasts that can help you pass the time on those long rides, or long days in the office chair.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope that we can continue to improve and bring you more informative, funny, anecdotal and engaging content. We want to create some cool gifts and offer prizes for competitions. Unfortunately, most people don\u0027t like the free junk that we give out! (Especially those aluminum foil brake levers). So we need to ask for your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn return, we\u0027ll offer a few levels of extras and try to come up with some quality content for our Patrons... you. The riders we\u0027ve been waiting for."
