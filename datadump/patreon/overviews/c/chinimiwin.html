Of many Nations and practices, we collaborate together through shared resources, knowledge and skill to create unique and innovative works of art. With your help, the Chinimiwin Collective will be able to gift the works we create to respected members of our communities, individuals who we would like to recognize for their cultural generosity. You would also be helping us provide arts workshops to engage youth and their families in the preservation of traditional Indigenous textile and nature art forms, including quillwork, featherwork, beadwork and more.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSacred objects, clothing and regalia are essential to the retention and reclamation of Indigenous ceremony, cultural pride and practice.  These objects cannot be purchased through mainstream outlets and are made exclusively by hand. They are not manufactured or mass produced. This work is highly labor-intensive, some pieces requiring many hundreds of hours to complete.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe work created by the Chinimiwin Collective is intended to remain within our communities as living culture embedded with spirit.  The difficult socioeconomic realities of a majority of Indigenous people dictate that spiritually motivated artists producing intricate and empowered cultural pieces are rarely able to generate a living wage, and are thus forced to pursue alternative means of support for their families in the 21st century.  Enormous creative potential and brilliance is not realized. Our membership are dedicated to successfully navigating the many colonial obstacles currently experienced globally in the retention of Indigenous visual culture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArtist Roster\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRespected Elder/artist and traditional knowledge carrier \u003cem\u003eDan Commanda\u003c/em\u003e (Nipissing FN) is an Anishinaabemowin language speaker, Eagle staff carrier, dancer, singer, drummer, textile and nature artist, regalia maker, painter, musician and lifelong advocate for the retention and practice of Indigenous worldview. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMid-career artist \u003cem\u003eAura\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(Oneida on the Thames) is a gifted painter, printmaker, dancer and textile artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEmerging-artist and cultural knowledge carrier \u003cem\u003eChief Lady Bird\u003c/em\u003e (Rama/Moose Deer Point FN\u2019s) is a painter, printmaker, muralist and beadworker. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMid-career artist and cultural knowledge carrier \u003cem\u003eSamantha Mianskum \u003c/em\u003e(Nipissing FN)\u00a0is a traditional dancer, hand drummer, singer, textile artist and beadworker who brings thirty years of experience to her practice.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEmerging-artist \u003cem\u003eEvelyn Pakinewatik\u003c/em\u003e (Nipissing FN)  is a traditional and digital painter, photographer, videographer, traditional textile artist and musician who has been exposed to Nipissing cultural arts and ceremony from birth. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSusan Fitzmaurice\u003c/em\u003e is a senior textile artist and member of the Nipissing FN community who has apprenticed and taught with Dan Commanda for over 25 years. \u003cbr\u003e"
