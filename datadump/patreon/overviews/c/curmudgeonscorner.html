It started as a public affairs talk show from 1991-1994 or so on WRCT Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon\u0027s college radio station. After the hosts graduated and moved on with their lives, the show went on hiatus until 2007, when they decided to bring it back as a podcast. It has been going strong with a new episode every week ever since then.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u00a0do you talk about?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBasically, we talk about whatever is going on in the news in any given week. That means there is a lot of national politics, but we also talk about other national and international affairs. We talk about tech news as well, and occasionally even about things going on in pop culture that rise to our attention. And all along we sprinkle in the random things about our daily lives that strike our interest.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are the Hosts?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSam and Ivan are old college friends who met at Carnegie Mellon many years ago. These days they live on opposite sides of the country and rarely see each other in person, but they connect every week via Skype to do the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSam lives in the Seattle area with his wife and two kids. He works at a large tech company helping to keep people from abusing that company\u0027s systems. Aside from Curmudgeon\u0027s Corner, Sam also runs the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://electiongraphs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eElection Graphs\u003c/a\u003e presidential election analysis site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan lives near Miami with his wife and son. He works at a large electronics company doing something related to sales. He travels for work a lot. In his spare time, he yells at clouds and other inanimate objects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth Ivan and Sam are amateur news junkies, and use the Curmudgeon\u0027s Corner podcast as their outlet to discuss the news of the day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do we need support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, we have done the show for many years without support, and do it because we have fun, not because it is going to ever make us money. But it does consume quite a lot of time each week. And since we have been trying to grow our listenership, it is also consuming money for marketing costs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe put a lot into the show, and would do it even if we had no listeners at all. (For years, that was close to the truth.) But if listeners appreciate the show, we certainly wouldn\u0027t mind the support to cover the basic costs and to help us grow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd even very small donations\u00a0help tell us that this is a valuable use of our time and we should continue to do it rather than any of dozens of other things we could be doing instead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you do if you are wildly successful?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWe\u0027ve been growing slowly, but we\u0027re trying to expand our audience and take the podcast to the next level. With funding we can expand our currently very limited budget for promoting the show and increasing our listener base.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond that, with sufficient funding we will be able to consider improving the production quality of the podcast itself by upgrading our equipment or even getting additional production help. We will also be looking at doing more \"special\" shows where we do live original reporting on events or interviews with people of interest. With sufficient interest we would also start looking at occasionally getting Sam and Ivan in the same physical location with local listeners invited to attend the recording session as a live audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course, we\u0027ll be honest, with enough Patreon support we\u0027d seriously consider quitting our day jobs, doing more shows per week, and making a full time gig out of this. That is not the expectation though. We know we live in the real world. :-)\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is your intro and outro music?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Curmudgeon\u2019s Corner theme music is generously provided by \u003ca href=\"http://www.raylynch.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRay Lynch\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0Our intro is \u201c\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QQ2JB6/raylyn-20\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Oh of Pleasure\u003c/a\u003e\u201d (Amazon MP3 link).\u00a0Our outro is \u201c\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QQ2J9S/raylyn-20\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCelestial Soda Pop\u003c/a\u003e\u201d (Amazon MP3 link).\u00a0Both are from the album \u201c\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/deep-breakfast/id3242445\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDeep Breakfast\u003c/a\u003e\u201d (iTunes link).\u00a0Please buy his music and support his\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/lynchwildfirehelp\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGoFundMe\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
