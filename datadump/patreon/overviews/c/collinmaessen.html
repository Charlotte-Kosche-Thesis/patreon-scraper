    "summary": "Hi, it\u0027s me, Collin.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m editor for Real Skeptic and I create YouTube videos and articles about environmental science and science in general. For my YouTube videos I interview a lot of great scientists who explain what the scientific literature says. My articles tend to be more aimed at debunking misinformation. With the occasional guest articles written by experts, scientists, or someone who has a unique perspective on scientific skepticism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might not yet be one of my Patrons, but just that you\u0027re here tells me you\u0027ve thought about the time and effort that go into the content that I create. Thank you! If you\u0027re already supporting me: you\u0027re awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I need your help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing my videos and writing my articles are often time-consuming and can be very costly. Just interviewing scientists at the AGU Fall Meeting can cost thousands of dollars to hire someone from the San Francisco Film Union (without it I\u0027m not allowed to film). Besides this software licenses, equipment, and hosting is over a thousand dollars per year. I love what I do, but these costs restrict what I can do as I have a very small budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to help me out with these costs it means I don\u0027t have to worry about how I\u0027m going to pay those bills or justify the time I spend on my projects. The more people help out the easier it becomes for me to work on my content. Which means more regular content, better quality, more interviews with interesting scientists, and much more. As a Patron you pay a fixed fee per month, but with this set up you get more bang for your buck as more Patrons join over time!\u00a0Plus as an added bonus you get rewards from me.\u003cbr\u003e"
