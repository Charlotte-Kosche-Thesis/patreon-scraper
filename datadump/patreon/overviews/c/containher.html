I also feel like, especially on Patreon, I may be exploring the art of the \"cover song\", paying tribute to artists that I admire. Regardless, I\u0027m singing all the time, every day...and I feel most alive when I\u0027m inside the music. It seems like my songs want to live in music videos, so I\u0027m supporting them in their flight. I\u0027m wildly creative and absolutely sure that its a contagious part of me..so if you want to catch the bug, here I am!"

     "about": "I love, love, love to sing and to write music. I started quite young in a very untrained and secret way, and now I share it with the world. I produce my own music and I love weaving melody into words. Along with music, I love art. I\u0027m a big fan of all kinds of art. I\u0027m a natural promoter/fan girl of the creative people around me...so I own a little shop where I can sell their things and talk about what everyone is up to in my hometown of San Jose. I\u0027m a dreamer. I go completely wild with my utopian fantastical visions for the world, and I try my best with what I\u0027ve got and the people around me to make my little slice of life quite warm and pretty. I went on my first European tour earlier this year, and I felt quite at home while being so far away from my actual home. I guess, I just had this sense that I have a family wherever I go..because I\u0027m an artist, and there\u0027s always a place for me. I guess I have lovely weird cousins everywhere through the greater family of music and art makers. I\u0027m still not quite sure how to use Patreon, but i\u0027m going to figure it out eventually. I can finally see that it\u0027s just another way to connect with people that are refreshed by creativity.",
