Since then, a lot happened, I got worse and worse until then, one month ago, my health started to improve significantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\nI would say I\u0027m now daily being between 50% to 70% (on the very good days) of my old self. \n\nStill, the fight is not over. I don\u0027t know whether the amelioration will last, if it will continue to\u00a0improve or draw back. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo one knows since the treatments I\u0027m taking bring different results on each person.\n\n\n\nEvery of this has been possible because of the people supporting me which\u003cbr\u003emeans : YOU and all the other kind persons who helped with money, medication, advises or on my crowdfunding .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Without money, I couldn\u0027t have had access to 30% of everything I did so far. But the good news is that it\u0027s finally working ! \n\nYour cheering also\u003cbr\u003ehelps me on the very bad days and I must fight for everything you did for me would be useless.\n\n \u003cbr\u003eYou believe in me and I want to show you I\u0027m worthy of your faith\u00a0!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\n\n\nI\u0027m still not bringing back this Patreon\u00a0to what it was before. I don\u0027t feel capable enough to follow a regular planing of posts. The amelioration is still too fragile and too recent and I don\u0027t want to lose my chances by putting too much stress on my body yet. \n\n\n\n\n\nSo there will be no tiers for as long as I don\u0027t feel like I\u0027m able to assure\u003cbr\u003e100% of the content of\u00a0this account. \n\n\n\nYou can still pledge the amount you want if you will and I thank you for every $ you allow me. They all are used for my numerous and expensive treatments and supplements and I hope someday it will only be used to produce creative content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMerci\u00a0beaucoup\u003cbr\u003e\n\nClef\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEDIT // may 2017 : Because my health has declined, I\u0027m actually not able to post anymore content. Your support means a lot to me and I thank you \u00a0from the bottom of my heart to stay with me and help me with kind words and money for my treatments. \u00a0I\u0027m downgrading my Patreon to 1$ and no tiers until I\u0027m healthy enough to be able to submit anything and pick-up my life where I left it off.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA dear friend of mine launched a crowdfunding to help me reunite enough money to go to a Lyme clinic in Deutchland. The stay is so expensive that I can\u0027t even dream of going there by my own means.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.leetchi.com/c/solidarite-de-laurence-clef-atelier-la-petite-feuille\"\u003ehttps://www.leetchi.com/c/solidarite-de-laurence-c...\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wish I could keep sharing with you cosplay and drawings . I hope is is just a matter of time. Because no matter what: life is beautiful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease take care. Enjoy every little moments / days of your life.
