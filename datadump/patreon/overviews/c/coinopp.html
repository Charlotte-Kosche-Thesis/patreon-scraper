Coin Opp features education error and variety coin videos featuring images and information. \u00a0The coin world is very vast and when it comes to error and varieties many novice collectors confuse non mint errors as true errors and true doubled dies. We strive to be as informative as possible and as helpful as need be. We answer any and all comments that are coin related and tailor videos on particular coins to viewers with questions about said coin. We also offer our time through email and various forums to help collectors properly attribute their error or variety coins. We also direct collectors to various reference sites discussing their exact coin related question, in order for them to verify our information and to show them great places to educate on coin related topics.",
