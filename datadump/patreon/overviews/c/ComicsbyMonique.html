Recently, I have been doing more painting, and display my work at Brookside Gallery, a co-op gallery in Fredericton. My biggest influences in comics work have been Alex Toth, Will Eisner, Milton Caniff, Osamu Tezuka, Frank Springer, Berni Wrightson, Al Williamson and Wally Wood. Of late, I have worked on several self-published projects and several webcomic series, and since 2001 have been partnering with writer Darryl Hughes on three titles - GAAK, The Continentals, and Chevalier.",
