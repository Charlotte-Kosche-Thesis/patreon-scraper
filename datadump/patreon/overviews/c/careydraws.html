I\u0027m Carey Pietsch, a cartoonist and illustrator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been extremely fortunate in my career to get to work with a host of brilliant creators! \nYou might know me as the comic artist on Marceline Gone Adrift; \nLumberjanes 29-32; the Mages of Mystralia webcomic, or the upcoming TAZ:\n Here There Be Gerblins (which you can preorder \u003ca href=\"http://theadventurezonecomic.com/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e!). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55818c88e4b041b423de8e5e/59823f64b8a79bd4e85f6c86/5a5147dce4966ba79af25a58/1515276265684/collabs.jpg?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my free time, I write and draw my own comics, and work on illustrations and item designs. You might also know my work from some of my completed solo minicomics and zines: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55818c88e4b041b423de8e5e/59823f64b8a79bd4e85f6c86/5a5147c553450aea17007701/1515276240110/mycovers.jpg?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had a lucky and wonderful and extremely busy professional year!\u00a0 The only thing that could make the next one even better would be to get to make time to work on my own projects, too. With your help, I\u0027m hoping to do just that, and I can\u0027t wait to show you all what I get to make with that time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI love working as a cartoonist! I\u0027ve been able to take on dream jobs, collaborate with creators whose work I truly admire, and hone my own craft in the process. However, freelancing full-time also incurs a lot of expenses-- from paying flatters and letterers to covering software subscriptions and buying my own health insurance-- that mean I have to hustle to find and take on additional gigs to fill in the gaps. I\u0027ve learned a lot from one-off projects, but the time it takes to look for and manage them adds up fast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is for this patreon to build more flexibility into my schedule and allow me to invest more time in longer-term solo projects. This is only a starting point! I look forward to being able to expand into more tutorials and writeups on process as this patreon grows and I can devote more time to it.\u00a0 By being a part of my patreon, you\u0027ll be supporting my solo work, allowing me to create more of it, and getting access to behind-the scenes looks at it that I don\u0027t post anywhere else. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m so glad to have you as part of this patreon, and I can\u0027t wait to share more of my work with you. You make that possible, and that means the world to me! Thank you!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55818c88e4b041b423de8e5e/59823f64b8a79bd4e85f6c86/5a5147fa53450aea17007f51/1515276301500/promo+pic+big.jpg?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
