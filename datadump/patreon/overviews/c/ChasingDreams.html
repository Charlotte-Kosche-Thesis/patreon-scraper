I would love to be documenting the entire journey to share with you all as the adventure unfolds. With your support, I can get some internet time to post videos, put some fuel in the tank and feed myself at the local fooderies making the video editing a bit more relaxing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way I hope to find ways to support the needy. I don\u2019t want to assume I know the answers and will rather wait until I get there to hear what they themselves are wanting help with, if any.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA huge thank you to all of you out there who are following my adventure, especially to our Patrons! It is YOU who make these movies possible. I hope you enjoy the series. Stay tuned...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers, Dane\u003cbr\u003eChasingDreams"
