The stories you tell and the community you\u0027ve made never fail to amaze!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of you have asked how you can support Commaful further or help spread the love of reading. This is one of the ways! Your contribution will DIRECTLY impact the speed we release features and the reach of the stories!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s why we started a Patreon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) To date, we have not put any ads on Commaful. Ads, the way they are done today online, tend to be annoying and hurt the user experience. While we may do ads sometime down the line, we want to find a better way to do it. Commaful has been up over a year without a single ad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Currently everything is free to our community members. We decided that we wanted to create an open place for people to share and create stories. Supporting the creator tools, reading tools, and our special story trailer generator all cost us money and are features that many companies charge for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way Patreon works is a users can donate whatever they want per month and the donation is recurring each month after that. So anything, from $1/month up, is hugely helpful to the cause.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour Impact\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything you are able to contribute will directly contribute to our mission of bringing these written word stories to the world. You will be supporting the love of reading and writing. The millions of people who have read stories on Commaful. And the many thousand writers and creators sharing their deepest passions with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We\u0027ll Use the Money For\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour money will go directly to improvements to the design, website, and app. These include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eNew Features.
