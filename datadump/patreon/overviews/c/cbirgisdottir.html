    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my Patreon page! My name is Chelsey Birgisdottir and I am a full-time professional rugby player with the National Women\u0027s Rugby Team. October of last year, I was offered the opportunity to train full-time with the National team in Southern California. With playing in the Olympics being my ultimate goal, I chose to seize the opportunity whole heartedly as a step towards that dream. In January 2018, I left my full time job in Seattle and moved my life to San Diego. The transition has been challenging yet rewarding in so many ways. On my Patreon page, I\u0027ll be posting updates about my experience training at the Center, what issues I encounter as a Black female professional athlete and more. To support me in my pursuit of Olympic glory, become my patron and follow along with my journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuick FAQs:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow long can I be a patron for? \u003c/strong\u003eAs long as you would like! You can begin or end your patronage at any time. The longest amount of time a patron can give is 31 months (from February 2018 till August 2020). After the 2020 Olympics, I will transition from my rugby career to attend grad school. So if you pledge a $1 per month starting February 2018, that means by the end of my rugby career, you will have paid $31 towards supporting my career.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t feel like keeping track of a monthly patronage. Can I give a one-time contribution?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eIf you prefer to give a one-time contribution, I can receive payments via venmo (@chelsey-birgisdottir) or via Paypal (cbirgisdottir@gmail.com). Please include your email in the payment info so that I can send you a thank you note!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I know if you are any good? \u003c/strong\u003eYou can watch me in action via these links!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.therugbychannel.tv/videos/310985/women-s-club-7s-championship-seattle-atavus-v-san-diego-surfers#!\"\u003eClub Nationals 2017\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.therugbychannel.tv/videos/287965/club-final-women-s-d1-chicago-north-shore-v-seattle-saracens#!\"\u003eClub Nationals D1 2016\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/k7nqny9lyCY?t=3m34s\"\u003eNext Level Rugby Summer of Hits\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
