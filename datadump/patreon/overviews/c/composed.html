As first-time\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://composeddocumentary.com/the-filmmakers/\"\u003efilmmakers\u003c/a\u003e it was important to create something that looked professional while offering an empathetic look into a very personal issue. We spent two years producing and editing the film and used personal savings to make sure the film was completed in a reasonable amount of time. 80% of the funding for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://composeddocumentary.com\"\u003eComposed\u003c/a\u003e came from personal savings, but with an opportunity to make something special we knew it was worth the investment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eKickstarter Backers, Boston University, and ICSOM* contributed the remainder of production funding and we could not have done it without them.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon offers us the opportunity cover ongoing costs to both share\u00a0the feature documentary but also all the content we captured not in the film. Over 120 hours of interview footage was collected over 18 months with some amazing musicians, authors, and mental health professionals.

Screening fees have so far covered most of our travel and living costs but require a lot of time and care putting together. The cost of getting Composed on platforms like iTunes, Amazon, Vimeo, and Netflix also looms for the end of 2017 when a wide release of Composed is scheduled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons pledging funds for this extra content allows us to dedicate the required focus on a more regular basis but also motivates us to keep doing what we\u0027re doing. Knowing you\u0027re out there and have our back is so important to why we do this and why we set such a high standard for what we create. Thank you in advance for your support and attention. We always look forward to the next video and hope you\u0027ll join our team of backers and patrons. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCOMPOSED\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough the lens of professional classical musicians, Composed explores the many ways we experience and can address performance anxiety. Faced with the judgment of peers, audience, conductors, and worst of all themselves, these musicians spend years trying to understand and overcome the physical and mental manifestations of their anxiety. Through their stories, we learn valuable lessons learned over a lifetime of professional performance; and we find that we are not alone in our quest to overcome the fear of failure and embarrassment. For anyone wanting to feel strength over fear and compassion over judgment, or simply seeking a closer look at anxiety and what makes us tick, Composed opens the door to a world of high stakes, high pressure, and peak performing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://composeddocumentary.com\"\u003ecomposeddocumentary.com\u003c/a\u003e for more information\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
