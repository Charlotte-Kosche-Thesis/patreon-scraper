    "summary": "Chris Broach plays solo, in SNST, Mass Energy, Braid, The Firebird Band, and runs City at Night Records. He is currently working on releasing a few volumes of unreleased solo material, as well as a new record for SNST.\u00a0 In addition, he\u0027ll be updating you on live dates, giving exclusive performances for backers at certain levels, and continuing to write and more importantly, release, new music for you to listen to. As a backer, at some levels you will get early access to new material, and starting at $2 a month, you\u0027ll get all digital releases from Chris Broach and his bands from the time you pledge onward. The patronage perks only go up from there - some include vinyl, some include meet and greet / photo ops / free show entry.\u00a0 Any amount pledged per month is helpful. Even at $1 a month, it\u0027s more than Broach makes per 10,000 listens (streams) on Spotify. So you\u0027re directly helping him to be able to create and sustain his music for you and everyone you know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003eChris"
