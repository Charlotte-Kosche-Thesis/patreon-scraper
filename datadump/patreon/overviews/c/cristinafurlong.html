In fact, she may be a part of the\nbike craze, having spent many years advocating for cycling in the city. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn\n2013, she founded her own advocacy group for pedestrians and cyclists in her\nhome borough of Queens, the United States most diverse zip code. She does\noutreach and advocacy on safe streets issues with many different groups,\npromoting biking to kids, families, seniors, and those who\u2019ve yet to feel the biking\nlove-the motorists. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHaving recently earned a M.S. in Social Journalism with a\nconcentration on community journalism around safe streets issues, there is\nhardly a time she isn\u2019t connecting cycling organizations with policy. Lobbyist,\njournalist, activist- and in her spare time, she organizes bike tours \u2013 she\ncan\u2019t seem to turn down an opportunity to show off New York City by bike,\nespecially the outer boroughs and beach rides. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUnusual in the US, but not in NYC, Cris and her family are\nstaunch bike commuters, and look forward to teaching her own son to ride a bike\nsometime soon. \u003cbr\u003e"

Many school communities don\u0027t know how to start advocating for traffic safety. It delays projects and causes huge angst there.

Often traditional news uses victim blaming headlines or quotes only one party and this affects public opinion and policy on issues such as what is considered an accident, how a traffic violence crime is or isn\u0027t prosecuted or whether the average cyclist will become a victim of road rage. In 2015, I hosted a forum titled The Media\u0027s Role in Traffic Safety. It brought together reporters, victims and community groups to discuss the misconceptions and consequences of poor reporting. I would love to build momentum by making it an annual event. 3",
