    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIn the spring of 2014 my world sank \u003c/strong\u003eand I\u2019ve spent the last two years writing a memoir about it. While crossing the Pacific Ocean on our 36\u2019 sailboat, our youngest child fell ill. Activating our rescue beacon meant saving our baby and also losing our boat (and only home). We hit the button and survived a dramatic at-sea rescue but returned to international media criticism about our parenting.\u00a0While the world debated our child-rearing choices, I wrestled with the trauma of the rescue, the loss of our dream, and whether or not my relationship was strong enough to survive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current manuscript is\u00a086,000 words and a compelling read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u2019s where you come in.\u003c/strong\u003e In order to get the Rebel Heart book into the hands of agents, and then publishers, I need to pass some financial hurdles, like paying for a final developmental editor and for a book proposal consultation. I\u2019m reaching out to my loyal readers, and new fans too, to help me get this book published and I think Patreon is the best way to achieve this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GvPcyyn.jpg?1\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eMe and my family before setting sail for the South Pacific.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Goals.\u003c/strong\u003e My goal is to both publish the Rebel Heart book and to be a paid writer, writing books full-time. That\u2019s why I dig Patreon. Unlike Kickstarter, where you give once for a big project, Patreon allows fans to send smaller, consistent donations every month. This gives creators the freedom to create while also connecting them directly to their fans. Patronage as a writer means I can effectively work on my upcoming books and pay for the expenses associated with writing like hiring developmental editors, or doing research and travel related to my projects. It also gives me a platform to interact with and engage my supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the Rewards.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4N7glPb.jpg?1\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI will now be exclusively blogging on Patreon (as opposed to my blog over at charlottekaufman.com).

There are more fun things, like personalized Valentines, Google Hangout Q\u0026amp;As, signed copies of my books, and getting your name into my books too! I love interacting with my readers and Patreon makes that interaction a collaboration for fans who want to support Creators. I look forward to connecting with you no matter what level you pick. Imagine if a few hundred people donated \u003cstrong\u003e$2/month\u003c/strong\u003e. That would be huge towards accomplishing my long-term goals as a writer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUpcoming Projects.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0In addition to the Rebel Heart memoir, here\u2019s what I\u2019m working on and what your support through Patreon will help me to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAction Adventure Novel.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0After writing memoir, I\u2019m enjoying the creative freedom of fiction. I\u2019m a long-time fan of action and post-apocalyptic books and film. This novel allows me to put a woman as a main character in a genre that usually has men take the lead.\u00a0I\u0027ve fully outlined the entire story and already written 12,000 words. I cannot wait to finish!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFantasy Series.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0I\u2019ve got the first book and a half written of a three part fantasy series. Fans who contribute at the \u003cstrong\u003e$5/month level\u003c/strong\u003e will get access to drafts of my writing and learn more about who these characters are as I write about them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMemoir.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eI am in the planning stages of my next memoir about my brain, my out-of-the-ordinary childhood, their links to my mental health, and the journals I\u2019ve kept about it since I was eight. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/fedrcstHPhA46MErqf/giphy.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoin me on Patreon.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?c=1483066\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eClick here to become a Patron\u003c/a\u003e.

For \u003cstrong\u003e$75/month\u003c/strong\u003e I will personally thank you by email or phone or both. I will also send you random postcards from places I find myself in. As an angel investor you will have access to all the rewards and everything my Patreon has to offer. All the thanks!",
