    "summary": "Hi everyone, my name is David Liew aka Chocofalcon. I had been playing with gunpla since 2012. I am from Singapore where there is only two season - wet and dry. \u003cbr\u003eI enjoy customizing my model kit and creating models that I can call my creation. I love going back to basics periodically, learning from the mistake I made and iterate the process.\u003cbr\u003eSince 5 years ago, I have put in a great amount of effort to research and develop techniques that improve the quality/aesthetics of my creations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i460.photobucket.com/albums/qq327/chocolatefalcon/gallery%20wall%20picture/intro_works_zps0l7hx6pl.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e WHY PATREON? \u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to take my interest to another level where I use Patreon to share my knowledge and let you benefit from my mistakes and skillsets. Using Patreon helps me organize my contents and allow you to see stuff that I wouldn\u0027t share in open public. \u003cbr\u003eMy content will be most beneficial for: \u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0newcomer who wouldn\u0027t know where to start from\u003cbr\u003e- beginner who want to try new things\u003cbr\u003e- intermediate want to push themselves \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eWHY SHOULD YOU PATRON ME? \u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI learnt my skills from ground zero. I understand perfectly what are the common worries and what mistakes beginners/intermediates will make. Be it the concern of budget, which tools to get, fear of doing a modification, not receiving valuable feedback or simply no idea of what to do - I believe my Patreon\u0027s content will be able to help you. \u003cbr\u003eI am not the best modeller and there are tons of professional videos for you to follow. However, I believe my work speaks for myself and that set me apart in the gunpla scene. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you. \u003cbr\u003eRemember to like my page for updates. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ChocofalconPlayground/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/ChocofalconPlayground/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ChocofalconPlayground/\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
