You\u0027ll see some of my process and be involved in ideastorms and creation. You\u0027ll get insight into life as an artist and writer. Art is completed by audience, and you\u0027ll be part of that cycle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy joining me here on Patreon you\u0027ll be side by side with me in the creative process and discovering worlds I\u0027ve only just made up, or getting comfy back in old favourites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who want more Hobverse, this will be the place where I bring those characters kicking and screaming back to pain (and maybe I\u0027ll allow them some glimpses of love and happiness....).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also be sharing my other work - my fiction that\u0027s weird, dark, obsessive, bitter, sharp-eyed and needle-toothed. If you\u0027re a visual person, then you\u0027ll be happy to also see the art that goes with the words - everything from character sketches and brainstorming doodles to final pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support not only keeps me in art-juice (tea), but it gives me a reason to make things. I want to share my work with you and to keep you entertained - all for the price of a drive-through burger.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo come join me in this new venture, and let\u0027s make art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
