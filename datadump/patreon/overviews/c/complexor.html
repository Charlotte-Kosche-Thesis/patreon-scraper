I intend for Zote the Mighty to provide a basis for amateur Python and Discord developers to learn to use the API.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also carry on a variety of other projects such as the cellular automata paint program Spectrum8, as featured in the intro video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBehind the scenes I am constantly improving my algorithms, documentation, and thesis on select mathematical topics.
