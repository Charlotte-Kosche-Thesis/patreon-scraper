    "summary": "#Pareidolia is a psychological phenomenon involving a stimulus wherein the mind perceives a familiar pattern of something where none actually exists.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e  I am, as an artist, inquiring into nature\u2019s orientation as the basis of form in living design. In the Pareidolia series, I am developing different processes to enhance subtle sensibilities that arise during Pareidolia. I am also exploring the question of how form arises from nature; meta patterns (patterns within patterns), and the interactions/interrelationships between the edges of form and pattern. Patterns and forms are so much a part of us; arising in all things, sometimes seen, and sometimes beyond conscious awareness and comprehension. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  My aim here on Patreon is to assemble and outline a space where interactions and creative events can be seen more clearly as part of natural processes arising in pattern and form. This includes the interrelationship between a diversity of elements including patterns, edges, people,plants, and structures orienting within our environment and our very nature. (Here I am defining artist and design as an interactive,integrative, and orienting pattern in and of itself, between edges increative events that are already happening.) \u003cbr\u003eI am deeply interested in developing ways of approaching an open space between narrative and through this work ;in an obvious way, bridge the distinction between the observer and the observed by developing more advanced modeling that helps us to navigate what is arising in the world around us. This will include the development of tools that immerse us in the truth of what is arising and allow intelligence itself to be the primary orator of expression. This is in part the intention of my work. I am finding more and more that the process of expression without knowing informs itself, this form becomes a byproduct of this unknown, which informs Self.\u003cbr\u003ePareidolia Facebook page,  is a new evolving news source that is collectively developed by people like you. Our mission is to create a synthesis of individuals and collectives at the involutionary and evolutionary edge of consciousness and culture. Indeed, this inquiry demands that more and more of us come together in conversation and productive relationships that include individuals, groups, and organizations, so that the creative impulse can express itself in ever more complete and perfect form.\u003cbr\u003ePeople have reported a dream like effect seeing intricate scenes. (People,gestures,animals,plants,trees,elves,aliens,ect) wile gazing at these. Please share your experience at Pareidolia on Facebook and tune in to my FB page for live feed Pareidolia demonstrations and current studies/art work. I am collecting data on an ongoing basis in regard to the development of this phenomena. \u003cbr\u003eThe news stream on pareidolia is recording the unfolding current events regarding consciousness, evolutionary and involuntary development. We are looking at our authentic experience in this unfolding event that we call life. Unknowns are the catalyst of discovery. Changing, Growing, Evolving, Creating. In a natural hierarchy, natural leaders reveal themSelves as the cutting edge of human intelligence; this is a natural adaptation of our human intelligence and evolution of the species. ~Christopher Padgett Hunnicutt\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReview by, Alex Danilowicz!!\u003cbr\u003e\"Chris Hunnicutt\u0027s Pareidolia works at once reveal the scintillated nature of the self and unmask a detailed topography of the psyche. \u003cbr\u003eThey reveal a primordial language, of which a syntax can be at times vaguely, and at times quite clearly sensed, as our view, our Mind, undulates across the tableaux. The works illuminate myriad beings, landscapes, narratives and intelligences, entities we have heretofore only dimly sensed--like whispers from the shadowy hallway of dreams. Chris has uncovered, through continuous inquiry, a means by which to explicate the unconscious, a process of liberation through Witnessing.\" \u003cbr\u003ePareidolia Review by Alice Sanders\u003cbr\u003e\"At first, I wonder where it\u0027s going to go. I start to \"see\" things as you draw, - a donkey, a small bear, a human fist. Then these things begin to change, the part that is still moves no longer trying to \u201cunderstand\u201d the technique. Now I\u2019m inside it, and it feels like long ago in a distant land.\"\u003cbr\u003eObservation by, Buzz Vaughn \u003cbr\u003e\"Christopher, the thing about your work, to me, is that depending on how I feel, I can see all kinds of things, or most anything I want to see. And I love that! But if I look long enough, the vision resolves itself into what appears to be a well-conceived image. Bravo!\"\u003cbr\u003eObservations by, Germaine Comeau. \u003cbr\u003e\"When I look at this one, the colours seem to evolve through my eyes, they seem to move, getting more vivid, as if some kind of subtle time lapse. Very cool!\"\u003cbr\u003eObservation on Pareidolia study by Germaine Comeau. \u003cbr\u003e\"I see bones, flesh, birds, animals, fish in semi abstract forms in the process of birthing life. I read recently that no life form has really become extinct, that they all still exist in other states of vibration or realities and that they might reappear in one\u0027s reality (vibrational frequency/density). This series evokes such thoughts.\"\u003cbr\u003eObservation by, Cathy Perry. \u003cbr\u003e\"Amazing. i see star fish on the beach and grains of sand, and i see a city. i can keep looking and keep seeing so much...\"\u003cbr\u003eComments by, Francine Hunnicutt\u003cbr\u003eChris, Thanks so much for the explanations of your work. It is so intriguing. My mind keeps saying this could really help people observe their inner life in ways we have not explored? There was the Rorschachs in the past with applied interpretive meaning from the outside(not by the client themselves) This is more helpful and interesting that we can see representations of our own inner life as the brain (possibly not always the mind) as distniguished by Dr. Dan Siegel who says the brain is a physical entitiy in our body and the mind is where we learn to make decisions as the brain feeds it content.\u003cbr\u003eThe mind regulates the flow of energy and information. \u003cbr\u003eComments by Christopher Padgett Hunnicutt\u003cbr\u003e\"#Pareidolia series, I have wondered if Parietal art cave painters saw the Pareidolia effect and that they were actually projecting what their minds related to. Perhaps this was some sort of evolutionary potential that is now a fundamental in our image making capacity. \u003cbr\u003ePart of this process involves the extraction/rendition of pattern from perceived chaos. I have found, in working spontaneously, without preconceived notion, allows the painting to paint itself; the painting then informs me. It\u0027s like getting out of the way so that the fingers of our fundamental nature can inform. I do acually get into a deep meditative state while discovering this process. These studies are an ongoing inquiry into the nature of what is arising. This inquiry invites as many perspectives as possible to develop the work so please feel free to give a review of your experience with the Pareidolia effect.\""
