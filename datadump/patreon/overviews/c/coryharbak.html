I\u0027m otherwise known on the internet as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DemonStrayVGM\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDemonStray\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m here to make music and hopefully become a better musician along the way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a musical hobbyist for a long time; well over a decade, in fact! I\u0027ve also been making video game arrangements since 2009 as well as writing original music. Some of the projects I\u0027m known for include the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://spectrumofmana.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpectrum of Mana\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (also available on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://spectrumofmana.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBandcamp\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e),\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.chroniclesoftime.net/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChronicles of Time\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tributealbum64.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTribute Album 64\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e compilation albums.

Unfortunately, I lose my ability to make as much music as I\u0027d like when working full-time, unrelated jobs. I really believe that Patreon could be the best solution for that, and would like Patrons to watch me grow as an artist and create content to the best of my potential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut wait -- there\u0027s more! My future goals and prospects include: creating tutorial videos and articles, making custom software instruments and presets for patrons, teaching specialty music production and compositions skills, and being 100% available for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundbetter.com/profiles/79722-cory-harbak\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eaudio contracting\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and collaboration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first checked out Patreon, I did so because some of my favourite artists, animators, musicians and teachers needed help. I felt like I was making a difference in exchange for a small fee. I never considered it a viable option to seek help for myself, but I sat down with some friends of mine and we agreed that I should at least put a page up, even if it doesn\u0027t take off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith patron support, I\u0027ll be able to accomplish tons of goals. Even at a basic level, the more support I can get, the more time I can put towards\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://coryharbak.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eoriginal music\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and video creation. This means that you\u0027ll end up getting more content as the number of patrons swells! Next, I\u0027m planning on upgrading my recording gear and eventually my video lighting and computer equipment in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for considering me for your next Patreon pledge. I promise to stay active and deliver something that all can enjoy!
