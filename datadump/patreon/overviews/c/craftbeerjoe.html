If you are here it\u0027s because you care about craft beer just as much as me and you\u0027ve enjoyed the articles on Craft Beer Joe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo help me provide more content and continue to operate Craft Beer Joe, I am asking for your support. While I have the passion to continue to bring you more great articles and discussions about craft beer, I can\u0027t do it without offsetting the costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe internet provides a lot of things for \"free\" but the reality is ads and other programs pay for all of it. My goal is to avoid the ads. They clutter the site, alter my focus and can prevent me from being unbiased. So instead, I am asking for you to fund the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I will promise you is to continue to provide great content. Some of it will be educational as we get to learn about craft beer together. Other content will be easy going and all about experiencing great beer. While other articles will focus on the industry and where we are headed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy desire is to be able to do more, go more places, try more beer and learn more then give all of that back to you. So support Craft Beer Joe and help craft beer become a larger part of our culture."
