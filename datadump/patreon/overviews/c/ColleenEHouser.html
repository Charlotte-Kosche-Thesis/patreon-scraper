I am a novelist! If I could keep it short and sweet, I\u2019d be a short story writer selling to magazines, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve written one short story in my entire career just to see if I could, and while it was award-winning, it took me forever to get it under the 4,000-word limit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy pride and joy are my four novels that make up the \u003cem\u003eWing\u00e9d\u003c/em\u003e series. It\u2019s a fantasy/metaphysical fiction combining the epic demon battles of death with the heart-wrenching internal struggle of life. Currently, I\u2019m working on a full-color supplemental guidebook to the series\u2019 world and sixth novel. So, I\u2019m also an artist. I mostly do illustrations of my own series, but you might see me working on merchandise too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jwethne.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/why-am-i-on-patreon.jpg?ssl=1\u0026amp;w=450\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of Patreon profiles say they want to quit their full-time jobs in order to create full-time. I\u2019m different. When I was fifteen years old, I was diagnosed with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis commonly called Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS/ME). Personally, I would love a full-time job. It would be easier. Then, I could write and invest in myself because I\u2019m awesome. But the last time that I had a full-time job, I was sick constantly and ended up in urgent care. And applying for disability with CFS/ME is difficult and complicated especially when you can/have to work part-time like I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage would allow me to invest in my writing business. There are a considerable amount of costs to make a book series a success. I need reader reviews, professional reviews, editing, inventory, advertising, funds for conferences and conventions, and so much more to put out a great product and receive a little visibility.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u2019t want to have enough money to quit my job. I want to have enough money to contribute by doing what I love. And moreover, I want to share my work, my experience, and my world. I live in my head. I want to be able to put it out there and say, \u201cThis is where I live. Isn\u2019t it amazing? I made it for you.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i2.wp.com/jwethne.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/how-will-you-be-rewarded.jpg?ssl=1\u0026amp;w=450\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the $1 pledge mark, you will gain access to all my patron-only posts which will include exclusive peeks behind the scenes, not yet released images and material.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the $5 pledge mark or above, you will gain access to my private Facebook page where I post research, word count progress, and works in progress.

While earning my Bachelor\u0027s in English/Language and Discourse and working at Sylvan Learning Center, I supplemented my time by reading about dragons, going to Renaissance faires, and writing about death and angels. After I graduated, I did something really scandalous. I married a man I met on the internet and left it all behind to move to his hometown in West Virginia. Here, I\u0027ve held a few titles including\u00a0tutor, data entry specialist, and author, but my favorite will always be, \u2018Hey you, move.\u2019\u00a0",
