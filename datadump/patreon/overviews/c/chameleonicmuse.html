    "summary": "An artist since I was a child, I have decided to branch out into the modeling world and express myself in front of a camera with other creative artists. From painting, to acting, to cheerleading and dancing, I\u0027ve always been involved with art. Besides singing; i\u0027m a TERRIBLE singer. So I played instruments instead.\u003cbr\u003eAnd now, I model! Something I am SO passionate for, especially artistic nude, and intimate modeling.\u003cbr\u003eSo, Why join my Patreon? Besides by helping a fellow artist out...\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Here you will find my exclusive work you won\u2019t find anywhere else, along with being able to support a signed to freelance model. With instagram rules and other website restrictions, you will find all of my work I want to post here, instead. I don\u0027t have to feel so freaked out to have pictures i am passionate about be removed from websites or taken down because my nipples are showing, or be freaked out my high school personal trainer will also find my pictures.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHere, I will feel safe sharing with TRUE fans here, and not have these worries in the back of my mind posting elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, you will also find every month behind the scene videos and pictures, tips I use for prepping for a photoshoot, my night-before (before a photoshoot/workshop) routine, recommendations for aspiring models, ways I do certain eyeshadow/makeup looks, share my favorite lingerie sets, post my DEPOP page where I will begin selling old (and clean!) photoshoot pieces I\u0027ve worn in too many sets, and more!\u003cbr\u003eEvery month I will be donating 10% of funds to a charity of my choice ! Your patronage will not only help myself, but others in need \u00a0by supporting my art.\u003cbr\u003eThis page will be beneficial to all models, photographers, fans aspiring models, and artists who pledge! I am trying this time around to make it very useful for others to use, and make it more engaging for the fans I also have who are supporting me through here!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf you ever have any suggestions please never hesitate to send me a message of what you\u0027d like to see on here! This is a page not only for myself, but for people like you, my patrons, supporting me and my art career!\u003cbr\u003eXO,\u003cbr\u003e-A"
