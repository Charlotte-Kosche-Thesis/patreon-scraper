After over a decade creating video content, I\u2019m focused now on being a DAD, collecting TOYS, and talking about WRESTLING. I still have my childhood toy collection from the 80\u2019s, and I still collect today. I also love making YouTube videos and podcasts, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing! I have the Kyle is Napping podcast, which all about being a dad to my 2 year old son. My other podcast, Wrestling \u0026amp; Toys with 2 Jersey Boys, is all about my love for pro wrestling \u0026amp; toy collecting. My goal is to have content creation become my full time job AND to help those less fortunate (more on that below).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"281\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4196/34584714460_f19ba3505d.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy am I using Patreon?\u003c/h2\u003eI want to make videos and podcasts for a living, while also helping others. My wife works full time. I work freelance and I\u0027m a stay-at-home Dad with my son, Kyle. I enjoy freelance, but I\u2019d rather work for myself. My goal is to produce 4 videos a month and 2 podcasts per week. That\u2019s a ton of content, but I love making it! I love connecting with other collectors and talking about Funko, wrestling figures, vintage toys, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"281\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4272/34162113623_da06dddb91.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhere does your money go?\u003c/h2\u003e\nYour support helps in two ways: hosting \u0026amp; marketing. Hosting 2 podcasts is an expense. I\u0027d also like to develop my own website at some point. Then there\u0027s marketing, which I need to do to grow. Whether it\u0027s Facebook or Instagram ads, merchandise, going to shows \u0026amp; networking, it all costs money. With your support, I can market my content, AND I can start giving back to an amazing charity. I\u2019ll be donating 20% of my monthly earnings on Patreon to Toys For Tots. I\u2019ll also donate 100% of my Patreon earnings in November to Toys For Tots to make sure less fortunate kids have an awesome Christmas and holiday season.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cimg height=\"299\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4227/34840352671_57a0ea56b7_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHere are some awesome rewards!\u003c/h2\u003e\nAs a Patron of mine, you\u2019ll have access to my Patron-only feed. I\u2019ll be posting exclusive photos, videos, and even short podcasts. I\u2019ll also be giving shout outs on my videos, podcasts, and social media. And for the top tier, you\u2019ll be a guest on one of 2 podcasts! How cool is that? I\u2019m starting out with 4 Reward Tiers, since I want you to get the most bang for your buck. I want to offer as much as I can to everyone who supports me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"281\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4228/34129639094_96df631196.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
