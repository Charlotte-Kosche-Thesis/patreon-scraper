    "summary": "Growing up without a father is difficult,  to say the least. Like many, I did not have a consistent, strong male figure during my childhood. When I became a father I found myself emotionally, financially and mentally ill-equipped to be the type of dad I desperately wanted to be. \u003cbr\u003eIf It were not for the help of a higher power, strong men (and women) and a supportive wife, I would have never made it this far. \u003cbr\u003e I can confidently claim to be a strong, consistent and nurturing dad today, maybe  even a great dad!  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is to share my experiences, mistakes and wins that have helped me become the father I am today. I believe that mentors sharing their experience and wisdom is a priceless tool for success. \u003cbr\u003eListen as I connect fathers, step-dads, grandfathers, uncles and older brothers...young and old to people far more intelligent than I. Come with me as I dive into topics not normally covered in \u201cParenting 101\u201d. You know that book on how to be a dad? Yeah, I didn\u2019t get a copy either! \u003cbr\u003e I believe we all struggle and are searching for ways to be better fathers, husbands and men. \u003cbr\u003eYou don\u2019t have to struggle alone. \u003cbr\u003eJoin me,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

When I had a child of my own I found myself emotionally, financially and mentally ill-prepared to be a strong, available and nurturing Father. Through a power greater than myself and the help of strong men (and women) I can now say with confidence that I am a great Dad! This podcast is to share what I have learned, mistakes I have made and provide interviews with people much smarter than I.
