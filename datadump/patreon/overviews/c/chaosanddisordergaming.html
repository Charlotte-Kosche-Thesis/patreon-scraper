We broke into D\u0026amp;D just prior to the launch of 5th Edition, and we\u0027ve been playing in said system since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a group of experienced gamers and role-players dedicated to producing content for consumption and, in some cases, use by our fellow gamers and enthusiasts. As a part of this we maintain a community on both Discord and Reddit that is exclusive to our vetted membership and those who wish to contribute towards helping us achieve our goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve established this Patreon to create a system that allows anyone to pledge support to help us with our expenses (you\u0027d be surprised how much goes into it) as well as save towards future concepts and ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsidering our ambitious goals and projects, as well as the recurring expenses, all of your contributions go into CnD Gaming\u0027s PayPal account, not our pockets. It\u0027d be great to make enough that we can have individuals dedicated full-time to CnD, but we\u0027re not there yet - and for now all of our funding is going towards building the ship and keeping it floating. We appreciate your support for CnD.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
