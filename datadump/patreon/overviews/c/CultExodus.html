    "summary": "Thank you to anyone who has landed on this page; your interest in helping current and former cult members is amazing and deeply appreciated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few months back, I decided to launch \"\u003ca href=\"http://apostatemonthly.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eApostate Monthly\u003c/a\u003e,\" a magazine designed for those who have come out of cults and other high-control, abusive religions. Offering the electronic, online edition was simple enough, but my colleagues and I soon discovered that you cannot print a \u003cstrong\u003ephysical copy\u003c/strong\u003e of full-color, glossy magazine for cheap. (The most affordable print-on-demand company I could find quoted about $20 \u003cstrong\u003eper issue\u003c/strong\u003e for printing and shipping in the U.S., with even higher costs for Canada and Australia.) As we are just launching the magazine, we have no real advertisers to help offset those printing costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe then got the idea that we could offer a physical copy of Apostate Monthly at a Patreon page, as a reward for certain patrons, and any additional funds brought in would help offset increasing costs for activism. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese current costs include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePackets of information and press releases about Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses sent to journalists.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTri-fold brochures that summarize the issue of child sex abuse and Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses.\u00a0These brochures were distributed during a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://jwvictims.org/2017/04/26/reveal-news-hosts-a-conference-about-jws-and-child-sex-abuse-the-world-is-finally-noticing/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003econference hosted by Reveal News\u003c/a\u003e in London in 2017, and have been freely provided to others who have given presentations to lawyers, volunteer groups, and lawmakers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://questionsforjehovahswitnesses.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/preview.jpg\" style=\"width: 217px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrinting and mailing the 188-page \"\u003ca href=\"https://jwvictims.org/jehovahs-witnesses-and-child-sex-abuse-a-brief-handbook-for-attorneys/\"\u003eJehovah\u0027s Witnesses and Child Sex Abuse - a Brief Handbook\u00a0for Attorneys and Other Legal Professionals\u003c/a\u003e\" to attorneys, to assist them in litigating against Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses for cases of child sex abuse.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://questionsforjehovahswitnesses.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/handbook.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are also costs for maintaining the URLs for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://CultExodus.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eExodus\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://jwvictims.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJWvictims\u003c/a\u003e, and the website for the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://WatchtowerVictimsMemorialDay.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWatchtower Victims Memorial Day\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFuture activism, which will involve other activists worldwide and which will add to these costs, include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFree or at-cost webinars for attorneys and journalists who would like to know more about the hurtful practices and policies of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFree or at-cost webinars or seminars for\u00a0ex-cult members\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrinting\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://jwvictims.org/flyers-publications/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eflyers\u003c/a\u003e and anti-cult information packets to be distributed at booths set up at various events and locations (i.e., universities, public fairs)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCost of booth rental for such events\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrinting packets of material to be sent to TV and movie producers, to get interest in a professional documentary or docu-drama about Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrinting materials for our annual \u003ca href=\"https://watchtowervictimsmemorialday.com/cards-and-flyers/\"\u003eWatchtower Victims Memorial Day\u003c/a\u003e (flyers, cards, signs, banners) for worldwide use, and to send to media\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://questionsforjehovahswitnesses.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/mary-poppins-2.png\" style=\"width: 246px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with costs, my personal time spent in activism is also increasing. Currently, in addition to maintaining the site JWvictims.org and its corresponding\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexandraJamesJWvictimsorg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e, I also:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaintain the website and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WatchtowerVictimsMemorialDay/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e page for the Watchtower Victims Memorial Day\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpdate the attorney handbook mentioned above\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePersonally contact attorneys to see if they would be interested in receiving the handbook\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCompose information to be sent to journalists, producers, and lawyers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCompose flyers and handouts used for activism\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePublish Apostate Monthly\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCoordinating all the above future goals and endeavors with other activists, and covering their work through my website and social media, also takes many hours every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s also been suggested that the website and YouTube channel for JWvictims.org expand to include surveys and interviews, as outlets for victims to express themselves, but those updates are very time-consuming. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eParticipants have also discussed having a ribbon of some sort designed for the Watchtower Victims Memorial Day, and having the cards on the website for the day translated into other languages. If I can\u0027t do this myself or find volunteers to assist (so far, no luck), I would need to pay a designer and translators to get this done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI personally am also helping first-time writer Rachel Goren complete an anti-cult fiction novel, \"It Was Cold In The Backseat Of His Car,\" and am working on my own self-help book, which we all know will blow chunks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis work, along with talking to journalists, attorneys, cult victims, and others, is done in addition to my own freelance writing work, which pays the bills. It\u0027s gotten slightly unmanageable, however, especially now as Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, Scientology, and many splinter cults are getting more media coverage and attention from clergy abuse lawyers, and we need to \"strike while the iron is hot.\" What started out as a few hours every week composing blog posts has now turned into a 50-hour per week mission, which cuts into my freelance writing, right when it\u0027s getting more expensive for me to keep up with these activism projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrust me when I say that no one will be funding a vacation for me; I live in Florida so I don\u0027t need money to visit the beach. While anything you contribute is deeply, deeply appreciated, please understand that patronage helps with costs but not incentive; I will always be an activist against cults and Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses in particular, and will always speak up and speak out for victims, and will do whatever is necessary to meet those costs. Your generous donations keep me from having to take on extra freelance writing to meet all those goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, if I can get enough subscribers and advertisers to the magazine, ad revenue from my sites, and products on the CafePress stores for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://CafePress.com/ApostateMonthly\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eApostateMonthly\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://CafePress.com/JWvictims\"\u003eJWvictims\u003c/a\u003e, this page will go away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s it. Anyone who has read this far, you deserve a medal, but I really wanted to assure everyone that every dollar goes to effective, proactive activism that can get more legal cases filed and more media attention on cult victims and their stories, and that will help those victims move forward in a happy and healthy way. Thank you to anyone who decides to donate any amount, it\u0027s deeply appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e"
