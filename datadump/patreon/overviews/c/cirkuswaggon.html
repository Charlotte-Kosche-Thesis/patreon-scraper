    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\"Arielle Rose is a truly unique individual. An individual who lives according to her own rules and standards. While living and traveling in her personally renovated mini bus, Arielle sews one of a kind garments and accessories with her solar powered portable sewing machine. All of her creations are made under her brand, Cirkus Waggon Inventions. In her bus named Rosie, the designer tours around the west coast, accompanied by her two cats, inspiring and being inspired by everyone who crosses her path.\u003cbr\u003eArielle never received formal training in fashion design, and this can be seen as an advantage in Arielle\u2019s case. Without ever learning the basic design rules taught in a fashion college, Arielle\u2019s mind is in some ways better able to experiment and think without restrictions. This is especially helpful with her up cycling approach to fashion. She does not use patterns when she sews, but instead invents them as she goes, using her manikin to drape and pin all the pieces, which she then stitches with her machine. Arielle solely uses recycled clothing that she finds or receives by donation from people in the midst of spring cleaning or simply from enthusiastic supporters. When I asked Arielle why she only sews with recycled materials she said that \u201c\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u2019s important for me to inspire people to make beautiful things out of whatever is around them, and to show them that other ways of being are possible. There is so much waste and over production in the world, it\u2019s time to use what\u2019s here instead of buying new things\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e. Making her clothes out of recycled clothing forces Arielle to constantly challenge herself with an unpredictable supply of new fabrics and materials. Having this ongoing flow of old clothing and textiles also guarantees that each new design she makes is a one of a kind piece.\u00a0Arielle has a vivid and quick imagination when it comes to design, and this imagination shines brightly through everything she makes.\u003cbr\u003eArielle\u2019s collections made for the 2013 Big Sur Fashion Show at the Henry Miller Library (you can find a video of the runway on Youtube) and more recently, the West End Fashion Show in Seaside. Her eight look collection for the Big Sur event consisted of only upcycled materials. Things that are often seen only as waste, like wine corks, ivy, driftwood, seashells, bones, orange peels, and crocheted plastic bags. Out of these materials the designer created highly unique textures and patterns. For the show in Seaside, Arielle made a dress entirely of assorted found feathers, another of lichen, another of old books, and more of woven tree branches. Her collection for the West End Fashion Show was made with the goal to make garments from whatever she found in abundance in the Nature surrounding her. For example dresses made by weaving branches together were inspired by her r desire to not waste what was cut after pruning fruit trees in the spring. Finding the tree branches to be extremely malleable and pliant she wove them by hand to create a stunning work of wearable art. The collections look almost like a hybrid between Alice in Wonderland and Lord of the Rings with a nature theme.\"\u003cbr\u003eFrom A\u00a0Feature in Plenilune Magazine\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.plenilunemagazine.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.plenilunemagazine.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWritten by\u003cbr\u003eRachel Anne Gottlieb\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.rachelannegottlieb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.rachelannegottlieb.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003emore about Arielle Rose at \u003ca href=\"http://www.cirkuswaggon.com\"\u003ewww.cirkuswaggon.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
