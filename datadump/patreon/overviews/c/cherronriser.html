With her family being\nmilitary, she spent a lot of her early childhood traveling all over the\ncountry, giving her a lot of new and different experiences she would not\notherwise have been given. When she turned ten, however, her family settled in\nthe small town of Ozark, Alabama where she finished her high school career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAfter high school, Cherron began college, however she also found\nherself in love with her old high school crush. The two of them were married in\nJuly of 2002, and welcomed their first child in October of 2003, after moving\nto Knoxville, Tennessee. In December 2008 the welcomed their second child and\nfound themselves headed back to Alabama. They have now been married for over\nthirteen years, and Cherron has returned to school to finish what she had\nstarted all those years ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll through her life Cherron has been drawn to the arts. As a child she\ndanced and sang all of the time, often driving her family crazy. During middle\nschool, a group of friends and Cherron started \"The Outcast\" a club\nestablished for building a love of writing. Once the club was formed, Cherron\nwas never seen without a spiral notebook and pen. She wrote daily, developing\nsilly stories for her friends. After high school, Cherron began to write more\nserious stories and develop more original plot lines. It is a talent and love\nCherron has developed over the years, filling her computer with story after\nstory. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs\nan author, Cherron began her career as a self published author, releasing the\nbook Defying Destiny in March of 2015. Now she has published five books, and\nauthored four. She gives a lot of credit to her husband, children, and friends\nfor inspiring her characters and worlds and looks forward to showing them to\nall of her readers in the near future. Cherron can often be seen at\nconventions, both for readers and for geeks, as she is and will always be a\ngeek herself, and proud of it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
