    "summary": "I\u0027ve thought about what to do here for a long long time. In the end, I think the most interesting thing I can do is to share my creative process and take my patrons inside my struggle to find that space where creative flow happens. I think this is a universal struggle for anyone invested in a creative art form (or even just a fulfilling life) and I hope sharing my progress and frustrations can be valuable to others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not lost on me that this kind of sharing will require a great deal of vulnerability on my part. While this can be at times extremely intimidating and maybe even terrifying I believe it\u0027s a profound part of unlocking and inviting into being the parts of us that are deeply authentic and long to be in the world and affirmed as valid.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment my heart is pulled powerfully towards creating music that I love. This means working with other fellow travelers on the musical path as a producer in my studio here in Redlands. It also means working alone on my own material and even finding the courage to somehow sing with my own voice. Maybe. Hopefully.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, my intent is to share both writings and video content. This content will cover anything from potential lyric ideas that come to me in the middle of the night to video explorations of how certain tunes came together where I will go into detail about gear and process and even intent. I\u0027ll probably also do live-cast video from time to time and engage in exploratory discussions with patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you find value in this and I hope you\u0027ll join me on this journey. I look forward to exploring the process of opening up authentic creative flow with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarmest Regards,\u003cbr\u003eCarey"
