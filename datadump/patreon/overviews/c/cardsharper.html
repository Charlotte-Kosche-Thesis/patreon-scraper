My customers did not impose their visions, I was (mostly) able to design the way I wanted. Unfortunately, money got in the way \u2013 the budgets were small and I wanted to create unique motorcycles. I lowered the labour costs, I designed for free, and I had to pour my own money into some of the motorcycles.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI also accepted too many motorcycles at one time, so the time of completion became longer and longer and I had to pay the employees, the rent for the garage, etc. Before I realised, I spent my savings, my employees left, and I was on my own. That was almost a year ago. The motorcycles are still being created, but the process is terribly slow \u2013 I have to create all the elements, choose and buy the parts, design the parts on a computer, visit the subcontractors.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI finished my last three motorcycles on my own and I think they are the best I\u2019ve made so far, and you won\u2019t believe how many great ideas I had to put on hold... because of the time pressure, because of the budget. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/148zlo1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI need your help.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\tI want to create more motorcycles \u2013 not ordered by the customers, but for you. Seeing the motorcycles I made in a shed with cheap basic tools, on small budgets, under the pressure of time, imagine what we can achieve together. Motorcycles made with even better care for details, with even better manually created elements, not just waterjet-cut, elements made on 3D milling machines like swingarms, engine covers, lamp housings. Let\u2019s use 3D printers. Let\u2019s make vintage \u0026amp; modern motorcycles. Combining styles and playing with them. Just let me spread my wings. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThanks to your support I\u2019ll be able to bring back a helping hand. Buy better tools. We will work on a motorcycles that, once completed, will be available to you (see the prizes). \n\t\u003cstrong\u003eI would like to finish the first Patreon motorcycle within 6 months. It\u0027s up to you if I am going to make it.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eWith help, I\u2019m going to have the time for a weekly report on the things that have been done \u2013 what I\u2019ve bought, what I\u2019ve broken, including photos. I will also answer your questions about custom motorcycles, to the best of my knowledge. From time to time I\u2019m going to share with you my ideas and thoughts on motorcycles, describe how to make a particular detail. \u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/op8okw.jpg\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tSome of you (see the prizes) will be able to download files that will allow you to waterjet cut the same detail I designed and made (with descriptions on the material that should be used, with photos showing where and how I used it). Of course you can also modify them at will...\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMy projects were never based on ready accessories, which you can buy in a store. In my motorcycles the accessories that are bought and unmodified by me can be counted on the fingers of one hand \u2013 almost everything is made or adapted to my vision. Each frame and each swingarm is modified. The bodies are made manually out of plate, the accessories are designed and waterjet cut, etc. I will show you what you can do and how to do it. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMaybe I\u2019ll finally be able to go to motorcycle shows, championships and all kinds of custom motorcycle events. Let\u2019s see if we can win something. I\u2019m going to provide daily reports from the events, including photos and videos.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"http://pl.tinypic.com?ref=1zytypy\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i68.tinypic.com/1zytypy.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nPatreon is a way to help support me if you enjoy my work.
