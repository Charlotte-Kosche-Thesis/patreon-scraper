It is based on the collaborative writing experiment \u003cem\u003eThe SCP Foundation\u003c/em\u003e,   and includes many of the artifacts, entities, and events contained on the official wiki.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story is told from the perspective of a D-Class personnel (test-subject) who is forced to participate in dangerous, horrific testing procedures until the morning all hell breaks loose in a full-fledged Containment Breach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game\u0027s goal is simple - Survive, if you can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/385862358914039818/417551724077907968/screenshot003.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a Unity Remake?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eThe original game was a smashing hit, but that was back in 2012 - the engine the old game was developed on hasn\u0027t been upgraded in years. Remaking the game in a modern engine will ensure better graphics and framerates, allow for the latest and greatest coding technology, and ensure that the game is supported well into the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote to early Patrons: SCP: Containment Breach was originally advertised as little more than a remake using the Unity Engine. Due to the overwhelming support we\u2019ve received we have since pivoted and the game is a spiritual successor to the original game. This means that we will add and remove from/to the original game to accomplish the scope of our vision.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs this project just screenshots?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eNope!

I\u0027d like to make it easy for people to add their own content, whether that be new levels, SCPs, or even gameplay elements!
