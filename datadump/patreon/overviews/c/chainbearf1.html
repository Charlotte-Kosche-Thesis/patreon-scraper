    "summary": "Hi F1 and motor sports fans!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m creating videos explaining some of the ins and outs of the F1 (and hopefully some other motor sports too, where relevant!). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFormula 1 is a complicated sport with lots of technical, strategical and political machinations happenings behind the very simple concept of \u0027drive fast and get to the finish line first\u0027. Even mega fans of the sport want to know more about all the details that make the sport interesting and that\u0027s where I come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim is to simplify a lot of the complications of F1. Commentators, TV presenters and journalists will often breeze over WHY things are the way they are in F1 or how they work, but a lot of people want to know more. I\u0027d love you all to know more. And so, I\u0027m creating videos to break it all down simply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know a lot of people don\u0027t understand heavy technical stuff - the engineering, physics and mathematics that go into winning a race and building a car, for example. But they\u0027re also not idiots and don\u0027t want to be patronised or for explanations to be over-simplified to the point that nothing has been explained at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI come from a mathematics, physics and design/communications background and I want nothing more than for everyone to understand the sport they love. Complicated hybrid engines? Complex strategies? How the rules are made? I\u0027ve got your back!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also be adding more opinion content, some argument-based video essays and more discussions around the goings-on in F1. The direction of the channel will be guided by YOU the viewers and patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMaking videos takes time and effort! I had a long hiatus because I couldn\u0027t devote time to these videos. I need to research the topic to make sure everything is accurate, write a script that makes sense and carefully articulates all the ideas involved in each topic, and find a way to convey everything visually and animate that. Each video has many hours of work behind it and it needs to be sustained.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love making these videos and don\u0027t want the quality to slip."
