    "summary": "Hello everyone! My name is Cody and thanks for taking the time to visit my Patreon page! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout my life I\u0027ve had three main passions: racing, gaming, and making videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first started my YouTube channel nearly a decade ago, it was beyond my wildest dreams that I could ever make so much as a dollar combining my passions into making videos and doing what I love. Somewhere along the way I discovered Nascar Racing 2003 Season aka NR2003. Although being nearly 15 years old, NR2003 is still regarded as one of the most realistic oval racing simulators ever made. It\u0027s realism mixed with it\u0027s extensive online community that\u0027s still constantly putting out new mods, tracks, paint schemes and more makes it accessible and a blast to race at essentially any track with countless types of cars. Somewhere along building my YouTube channel I discovered I had a knack for using this simulator to create \"reenactments\", to recreate famous finishes, wrecks, and other moments throughout racing history\u00a0using with the games realistic racing/crash physics combined with\u00a0the thousands of tracks, cars, and paint schemes available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last couple years in particular, I\u0027ve spent multiple hours every single day planning, scheduling, recording, live-streaming, editing, uploading, and publishing these videos/streams, meeting more and more viewer requests throughout that time. I\u0027ve basically put every single spare moment that I wasn\u0027t otherwise working or sleeping into building my YouTube channel. As enjoyable as this is to do, it\u0027s a double-edged sword. The more time I spend making videos, the less time I have for my other jobs to ensure I can pay my bills, and vice versa. If I\u0027m working multiple jobs to keep the lights on, I\u0027m left with almost no free time to create videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where Patreon comes in.\u00a0It\u0027s incredibly gratifying being so passionate about making videos while knowing that there are people that genuinely enjoy the content I create. I enjoy this opportunity to be able to give back to those that have helped support my channel over the years.\u00a0You\u0027re awesome if you contribute to my channel simply by watching my videos. \nBut if you would like contribute more, here\u0027s your chance to do so and get some cool rewards in return! Whether you\u0027d like to donate $1 to receive a shout out/thanks in my video descriptions, $3 to receive access to exclusive patron-only content, or $15 to receive a sticker and a handwritten thank you note along with a bunch of other goodies, know that your contribution will be greatly appreciated and go directly towards improving the quality and longevity of my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e So come and join me on my journey to accomplish my dream of creating videos full time for a living, and let\u0027s see how big this channel can get! Thanks so much for your support and have a great day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
