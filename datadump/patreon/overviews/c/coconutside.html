    "summary": "Hello, my name is Johann Deneux, aka Coconut\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am passionate about programming and simulation-oriented games. My current project combines these two interests by providing a dynamic campaign system for IL-2 Sturmovik.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIL-2 Sturmovik is a combat flight simulation staged during WWII. It offers both offline and online gameplay. Online matches are played on missions that are traditionally built manually using the mission editor provided with the game.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe dynamic persistent campaign I\u0027m working on takes this one step further by generating missions automatically, depending on the outcome of previous rounds. It simulates a complex system of logistics supporting ground troops. These troops fight over territory control. Players can take part in these battles using tanks or assist and protect ground troops and assets.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOne problem with the traditional online mode of IL-2 is that it is not easy to provide meaningful roles to planes others than fighters. If the objectives are too big, bombers can\u0027t win the round. If they are too small, rounds are over too quickly. A persistent dynamic campaign system solves that issue by providing long-term objectives that give meaning to bomber roles. Even the support role carried by the Ju52 finds its place in this virtual war.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDeveloping this system takes substantial continued efforts and time. It also requires dedicated hardware to run the server, a high-quality internet access and electricity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support is vital and helps me keep my motivation and dedication to this project.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJump into my server, look for \"Coconut EXPERT\" and \"Coconut NORMAL\" in the server list.\u003cbr\u003e\nManual is available on \u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UrZmjnvghTrf-dSfGhV0hV7ZTg4y6xE0nb_-46kBM3E/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egoogle docs\u003c/a\u003e (no login or account needed). There\u0027s also a \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/QBCpE9j\"\u003eDiscord server\u003c/a\u003e available.\u003cbr\u003e"
