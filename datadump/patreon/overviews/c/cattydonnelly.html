    "summary": "I\u0027m Catty Donnelly, and I\u0027m a voice actor! And for the past five years or so, I\u0027ve moonlighted as Henry Halloway, a \"famed orator\" who performs readings of Poe\u0027s work on Youtube (youtube.com/henryhalloway). These postings have been on and off throughout the years, though - as much as I love the material and bringing it, in my small way, to your ears, it doesn\u0027t really pay. Until now!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I\u0027d like to start producing these mini audiobooks with more regularity. Right now, the plan is to produce one Poe short story in audio format (mixed nicely with sound effects and music) every month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eFAQs\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill the readings be exclusive to subscribers?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, the majority of readings will still be made available for free on the Youtube channel. However, there may be some exclusive content in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf the readings are going to be free anyway, why should I support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, first of all, \u003cem\u003erude\u003c/em\u003e. Second, I won\u0027t be able to continuing producing these readings without support. Typically, all of my time is dedicated to producing voice over for paid gigs - hence why the Youtube channel typically only sees substantial updates once per year. \u003cem\u003eBut that could all change with your help!\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0In addition to the monthly readings, you\u0027ll get:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Free access to downloadable verions of my 3 previous albums of readings, including \u003cem\u003ePoe: A Collection\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003ePoetry of Horror\u003c/em\u003e (EP), and \u003cem\u003eDeep in Earth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003c/em\u003eAccess to multiple versions of my future recordings. This is good for anyone who \u003cem\u003ejust\u003c/em\u003e wants to hear my melodious voice, without the sounds and music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- The main readings ahead of time. As an added incentive to Patreon subscribers, I\u0027ll be staggering my uploads of the readings to Youtube, such that subscribers will, on average, get access to a reading 3 to 4 weeks before the internet at large does.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Extra content! This could take a few forms, such as readings of poetry exclusively for supporters, downloads of music written specifically for the readings, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- The ability to suggest new pieces to me and vote on which I do next!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Credit in the recording for the month you subscribe!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you be reading?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs mentioned previously, right now I\u0027m going to focus on producing a small audio book of every one of Poe\u0027s short stories - one per month. Considering there\u0027s quite a number, this should sustain me for awhile! For variety\u0027s sake, I may intercut these readings with others, however (perhaps some H.P. Lovecraft?). This is another area where subscribers can help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA tentative schedule of readings:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2015\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOctober: The Cask of Amontillado\u003cbr\u003eNovember: The Sphinx\u003cbr\u003eDecember: William Wilson\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2016\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJanuary: The Black Cat\u003cbr\u003eFebruary-onward: ?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, I can suggest things for you to read?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs a subscriber, yes! I will consider all suggestions, provided they meet the following criteria:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- They are squarely in the Horror genre\u003cbr\u003e- They are within the public domain\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, this means that I won\u0027t be reading any modern fiction, nor anyone\u0027s personal work. Not only would this be a potential rights issue, but it also falls outside the intended purview of my work - sorry in advance!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd just who are you, anyway?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAgain,\u003cem\u003e rude\u003c/em\u003e. But to answer your question, I am a voice actor and illustrator from New York. My voice has popped up in a number of places, from independent films, to regional television, to animation and games. Most recently, I was cast as The Inventor in Osao Games\u0027 \u003cem\u003eChronology\u003c/em\u003e, as well as in \u003cem\u003eVoices Over the Water\u003c/em\u003e, a PBS documentary still in production. I am a great fan of Poe, Vincent Price, black (and in fact, all) cats, Scooby-Doo, and various other silly and spooky things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
