    "summary": "What I used to be: a writer, critic, game designer, programmer, activist, martial artist and speaker.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then came the Multiple Sclerosis. Over the past twenty years, I\u0027ve become primarily bed-bound, losing the ability to walk and most of the use of my hands. Let\u0027s not forget the cognitive fun and games, including the bit where my speech is slurred to the point where speech recognition is improbable \u00a0-- which means that the worst of it, for me, was going from typing 160 WPM to typing 1-2 minutes per word.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, how have I stayed sane? Well, I only lost most of the use of my hands, not all -- and although I never thought of myself as an artsy-crafty type, I always loved beauty and the visual arts. So when I found myself with many hours a day on my hands, I started exploring what I could still do. Turns out that if I had a partner to serve as a pair of hands, I could design and build jewelry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve spent the past several years studying color theory and playing with beading, which has lead to also exploring basic metal-smithing techniques\u00a0alongside my partner, Colin Gerbode. Folks like the results, and when I\u0027ve had the time and energy to market the results, they sell. Not well enough to actually make a profit, but well enough to justify the investment in materials and time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I\u0027m creating again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027d like to do is to keep learning, and keep creating. Using copper, silver, glass and semi-precious gemstones in place of words, I\u0027ve found a way to bring beauty into the world. With your help, I\u0027d like to share my creations and inspirations with my patrons and the general public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027m either in my bed (98% of the time) or in a wheelchair. The \u003cem\u003ethird\u003c/em\u003e thing they notice is my jewelry. If I happen to leave my house (which happens about once a month), I always wear some of my jewelry -- and it\u0027s a damned rare occasion that I come home without having sold what I was wearing that morning plus a few commissions. My Etsy store (\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/BeadingAndBeing\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBeading and Being\u003c/a\u003e) handles my seasonal sales, which help keep me in jeweler\u0027s supplies and tools.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027d like to be able to do is turn use Patreon to help support my partner (Colin) and me as we turn my seasonal/occasional pieces into a steady production/job. There are a dozen small and not so small things I can do to make my work better, up to and including hiring an assistant to to help build pieces and another for handling marketing. And although I pride myself on using the best materials I can afford, I often daydream about what would happen if I could afford just a little more... or maybe a little more.... or a lot more. (Gold! I dream of gold, I admit.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
