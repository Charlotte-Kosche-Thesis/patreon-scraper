It requires instinctual movements that occur in fractions of a second. In the middle of a touch, you don\u2019t have time to think about how you\u0027re going to move your body; your movements need to be automatic and reflexive. The best way to train your brain and body to execute these movements instinctually is through lots and lots of practice and repetition!
