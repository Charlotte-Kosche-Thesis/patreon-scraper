My name is ElizA (Chibigurla on YouTube) and\nyou\u0027re probably wondering about who I really am. Well. . . Let me tell\n\u003cstrong\u003eyou!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eEver since I was a little girl I loved music.\nMusic was everything to me and to no surprise, it still is! Sadly, to pursue a\nmusic career it can get quite pricey. But now there is Patreon! Patreon has\ngiven me the courage to keep trying because it is an outlet that can help me\npursue my dream.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS\nPATREON?\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nPatreon is a site where content creators, like artists and musicians,\ncan use to raise money for their projects. When you become a patron, you pledge\nper video and in return you get a gift from me. You can choose to pledge any\namount you\u0027d like per video ($1, $3, etc). Patreon also has a \"cap\"\nlimit where you can specify how much you\u0027d like to give per month, no matter\nhow many videos I make.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nMy dream is to create music that can help motivate people to pursue\ntheir own dream(s). To see\n\u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003ehappy makes \u003cstrong\u003eME\u003c/strong\u003ehappy! With a little help from you through\nPatreon I will create more and better content on YouTube.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou may be wondering what kind of content I will\nbe creating. Right now I am creating song covers from music within different\nanime. To put a little twist to it, I make my own English rendition of the\nsong, that way those who do not speak Japanese can also sing along. In the near\nfuture I will start to create other types of covers from other genres, like\nK-Pop and Video Game Soundtracks, and also original music. To go along with my\nsong covers I like to host livestreams to better connect with those who support\nme, my channel, and my dream. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLet me leave this link right over here --\u0026gt;  \n\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/J5QTIC-mHnQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eShirushi English Cover\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is my most popular song cover that I have\nuploaded thus far.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNo matter what amount you decide to pledge,\nevery dollar counts. All the money will go into the projects I create. If you\nare unable to give anything here on Patreon, no worries. As long as you keep\nwatching my videos with a smile on your face, that is worth much more than any\ndollar amount.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for stopping by and I hope to\nsee you again soon. ^_^\n\u003cstrong\u003eKeep smiling!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
