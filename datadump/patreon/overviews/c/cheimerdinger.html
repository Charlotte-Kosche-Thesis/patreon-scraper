By becoming a subscriber on Patreon \u00a0you will receive access to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.\u00a0Chapters and segments of my latest Tennis Shoes novel--as it is written!--in serial form. These will be distributed at specific times every few weeks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Exclusive sections of my new website, foreverLDS.com, including my Professional Storyteller\u0027s Workshop. This Workshop is unique among other writing classes online because I include an invaluable angle--that of a faith-based artist who seeks to create novels and other artworks that celebrate the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Audio clips from other public speaking events and teaching forums. Subscribers will be automatically informed as these features become available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. Audio clips of the \"Chapter Notes\" from Tennis Shoes Volumes 8-12. Those who normally listen to the audio books are well aware that these Notes are not included in my narration. Now, you won\u0027t miss a thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. Careful narration of the Book of Mormon and other scriptures, including thoughtful commentary of the each chapter that I read from General Authorities and scholars.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6. Music and songs that I have produced, such as \"Savior, Redeemer\", which can be downloaded to iTunes or other formats. This is offered at every level, even for $1.00 per month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7. Other unnamed surprises that will continually add quality to subscribers at all levels, and allow my readers of the last quarter century to enjoy my novels and adventures in ways never imagined, as well as celebrate the Gospel of Jesus Christ. \u003cem\u003eHey, we\u0027re just getting started!\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a \"staple\" in the LDS creative community a long time--with novels from the \"Tennis Shoes Adventure Series\" and films like\u00a0\u003cem\u003ePassage to Zarahemla\u003c/em\u003e. Every day I get emails asking, \"When is your next book coming out?\" or \"Why can\u0027t you write novels faster?\" My full explanation may surprise some. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first started publishing LDS novels, I saw it as a \"steppingstone\" to the national market, where fame and fortune seemed more alluring. I got a taste of that with\u00a0\u003cem\u003eA Return to Christmas\u003c/em\u003e, published by\u00a0Random House, but readers easily recognize that this setting and characters are still very LDS. It\u0027s just who I am. Sometime in the 90s I looked in the mirror and said, \"If the only novels or screenplays I ever write are meant to entertain \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e Latter-day Saints, I\u0027ll die a happy artist.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe LDS market has experienced many changes. eBooks and streaming downloads have slashed traditional royalties. Pirating, especially of audio books, is widespread. Most privately-owned LDS publishers and mom-and-pop LDS bookstores have dried up and disappeared. Too many of my author friends have stopped writing LDS novels entirely. This market simply cannot support most families. \u003cstrong\u003eI remain one of the only LDS artists left \u00a0who remains stubbornly committed to create stories, movies, and other creative works intended principally for LDS audiences.\u003c/strong\u003e Our culture is so unique; our heritage so rich. This is my only source of income. Obviously a story that celebrates the Book of Mormon and other LDS beliefs does\u003cem\u003e\u00a0not\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0crossover to a national readership. Yet Latter-day Saints deserve their own stories, right? Our theology and culture inspires brilliance that I believe is beyond compare. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn past years I\u0027ve often devoted large blocks of time to \u003cem\u003enon\u003c/em\u003e-creative endeavors to make ends meet.\u00a0This naturally postpones the release of Tennis Shoes novels. That\u0027s why books sometimes take longer than I (or my readers) would like before they are finished and published. But instead of whining, let\u0027s \u00a0embrace changes in the marketplace. Becoming a subscriber/patron seems to be where the market is headed. Every writer/artist--LDS and non-LDS--must take substantially more control of their career, especially with promotion. This used to be the job of publishers and distributors. No longer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon.com offers an attractive opportunity to let those who love my stories embrace a new kind of support model--for as little as a $1.00 dollar per month--with rewards that far outweigh the costs. My podcast at \u003ca href=\"http://www.foreverLDS.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.foreverLDS.com\u003c/a\u003e is becoming a big\u00a0part of this, soon emerging as THE major hub of all things \"Heimerdinger.\" All fans who have joined my blog at FrostCave or reading groups on Facebook are encouraged to join ForeverLDS so they can remain up-to-date with new developments. The weekly podcast on\u00a0Foreverlds.com is always free, but subscribers at various levels of Patreon.com will have exclusive access to specialized features. \u003cstrong\u003eAs mentioned, for as little as $2.50 per month patrons can access \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUNPUBLISHED portions of my latest novels--\"hot off the press\" so to speak, more or less in serial form. \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0My commitment is still to\u00a0produce media that celebrates our theology, our \"LDS-ness\", and our \"peculiar\" and enigmatic values and beliefs. Subscribers will not regret a nickel of monthly support."

Most of my efforts have been been devoted to LDS novels, but I will expand this to include additional motion pictures and media--but \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0after\u00a0completing the current story underway in \"The Tennis Shoes Adventure Series.\" I own rights to many of my stories and audio books. This content will become available exclusively to patrons here. For the future, I envision a company that produces novels, motion pictures, and other media in multiple platforms and genres, but intended primarily for consumption by Latter-day Saints and those who appreciate similar values. To achieve this objective I must maintain the trust of LDS families and consumers, NEVER compromising our values and ALWAYS committed to excellence by providing clean, faith-promoting, and uplifting themes and visions. Even with such lofty ideals, the very nature of this business can never be denied: ENTERTAINMENT!!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "Imagine a media company dedicated to celebrating LDS excellence in every field of entertainment. Other are also pursuing this vision, and the pie is BIG. Never think it\u0027s small, or I believe you will reap the whirlwind. LDS artists must work TOGETHER if they wish to play a major role in building the kingdom of God.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs our resources expand, our team of professionals will be nurtured in every facet of production, promotion, and distribution. An ARMY of talented\u00a0LDS storytellers, directors, and artists will be unleashed, all with the same vision of achieving greatness while remaining committed to the standards that define our faith. Many of the greatest directors and films Hollywood ever produced came forth in an era when studios adhered to a common-sense code of ethics and morals. Some artists fought this code, but most devised brilliant compromises that preserved their powerful themes without compromising the public trust. Artists, by their very nature, HATE rules, yet these restrictions can inspire them to reach for loftier heights than they would have attained otherwise. So let\u0027s begin this process, assemble our team, and prove that we can preserve our values while \u003cem\u003eeasily\u003c/em\u003e competing with the highest quality of entertainment found anywhere in the world.",
