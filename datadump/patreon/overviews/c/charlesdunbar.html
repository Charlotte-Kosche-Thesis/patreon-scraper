I expected a handful of people to attend. I got more than a handful. I never expected to start on this wild ride, blending education and entertainment, and getting to meet so many people who shared my love and my interests. And I surely never expected it to last this long.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBu giving to this campaign, you are allowing me to continue in this works, preparing lectures, writing articles and stories, and creating video content that can be shared with the world. The support of the fans has kept me running these past six years, and I can only look forward to a bright future down the road.\u00a0"
