Making content about Shadowrun helps to spread the word about our awesome hobby, and the more people we can infect... the closer we get to WORLD DOMINATION!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNo, but really... Making fun, entertaining, and informative content about Shadowrun is our passion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/lkyWOJs.png\" style=\"width: 662px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll of you out there have a deep, deep hunger for all the stuff that we create here. You have so many suggestions for great things that you want us to make, and we have so many ideas that we want to bring to life! However, pumping out more content at higher quality isn\u0027t cheap. Especially if we want to do it right.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nComplex Action is 100% funded by the fans and their generosity. The stuff that we create quite literally could not be possible without your support. In order to keep it coming, and in order to keep bringing new and interesting stuff to you, we rely on your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Ucg7QnA.png\" style=\"width: 703px;\"\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\nRight now we have one big goal.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShadowrun 101 Series ($600+ Milestones)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe get a LOT of topic requests for GM Screen, and many of them just don\u0027t fit what GM Screen is all about. Many of the requests people send are for basic explanations of simple mechanics, or entire tutorials on how large parts of the game work (e.g. Magic or Matrix). Unfortunately, these don\u0027t fit into the mission and scope of GM Screen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHOWEVER, we would LOVE to be able to produce a bunch of GM Screen style videos that are more intended to be tutorials or 101 courses in particular aspects of the game. For example... A \"Matrix 101\" series that is written, designed, and produced intended to be watched from start to finish with the goal of getting a player prepared to run a character in the matrix by the end of the series.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese series would assume no prior knowledge, and they would work as standalone products. The only prior knowledge it would assume is very BASIC understanding of how Shadowrun rolls work. And... well... maybe we\u0027ll even do a series about THAT. ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we hit the $600 milestone we can start to produce our very first of these series and we can add a new one every $100 milestone we hit after that. Very exciting!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n***********\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are many more things that we have that we want to accomplish. We\u0027ll get there with your help!\u00a0I love all the support and can\u0027t wait to keep making awesome stuff for you guys."
