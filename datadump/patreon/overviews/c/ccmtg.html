We want you to get better through looking at your own game, week in and week out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe, the hosts, are PTQ grinders with a love for the constructed formats. We have a very Spike and \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/query?s=cname\u0026amp;q=Johnny,%20Combo%20Player\u0026amp;partner=AUTOANY\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJohnny\u003c/a\u003e view of Magic and have learned a lot in our time playing. We launched this podcast hoping that we can share that knowledge with you as we learn it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e- We believe what we bring the the Magic: The Gathering community is worth something, and Patreon is a great way for us to give our listeners a chance to support us with as little effort on their part as possible. Patreon allows the patrons of the show to set an amount that is easy for them per month and they can stop at any time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat about Oasis Games?\u003cbr\u003e- Oasis is a great partnership for Constructed Criticism and through it we have been able to play more magic than we would have otherwise. However Oasis is not here to pay for the cost of running the website and the cost of producing new and awesome content and products. That falls to the people who feel like they are getting something out of the show and would like to donate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen do we get our tokens and playmats?\u003cbr\u003e- The way patreon works is you have goals you meet. Once those goals are unlocked those products will be released. We are working to try and get all of those things released early but currently the plan is to release them when the goals are hit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo I have to pay to listen to the show?\u003cbr\u003e- Of course not! Our goal at Constructed Criticism is always to provide great content to everyone and while we believe that what we are doing is worth something we are not going to charge to listen to the show because we understand that life is expensive and not everyone can afford it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
