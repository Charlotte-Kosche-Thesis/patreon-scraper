    "summary": "This is a X-rated project named \"The Princess Wars\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will be a series of images, full color pages and B/W comic pages that tell the tale of the Princess Wars during the Age of Slaughter.\u003cbr\u003eThose who do not appreciate extreme violence, sexual violence, and pretty females battling for their lives (often in vain) should turn back now.  The character are influenced from video games and other sources, and thrown together in a new world with new backstories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"At the dawn of the age of slaughter The World was much like any world. Dragons soared in the sky\u0027s, princesses lived in beautiful castles, and knights went to war. Darkness had always threatened the land, but the alliance of men, elves, dwarves and other minor races kept them at bay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat changed one fateful night when the elder demon god Gurothynl finally bound the last of the Nightmares and released a curse upon The World. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe curse effected each race differently, male humans were filled with a slow burning hatred that was magically directed at females. The men would come to blame women for all their problems, real and imagined, and began to act against them en mass. The results were brutal, gruesome, and shocking. All across the world the human empires began to destabilize and collapse from within.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe elves fared no better, but for them it was the females who were filled with bloodlust. The race most equipped to counter this heinous magic fully embraced the darkness and in one night the elven lands ran red with gore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe stalwart dwarves couldn\u0027t resist Gurothynl\u0027s call at all, their celebrated magic resistance failed them, and they degenerated into beasts, and so were born orcs, goblins and all things twisted and murderous.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe world was almost lost at this time, and demons from the pit rose to take The World, now that it\u0027s defenders were shattered. They would have been successful had not the Gods themself interfered. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe divine were forbidden from directly influencing The World, but they knew if they didn\u0027t, no world would remain to watch over. Many gods gave up their divinity to battle the demons, and many of them gave their lives as well. In the end, after nearly 20 years of war the demons were forced back, and the remaining gods sealed the entrance to Hell by creating the Black Gate,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow it has been 3 generations since the Age of Slaughter began. The World is in constant war with the remnants of the demonic armies, horrific beasts and cunning monsters roam the lands. The Dark Elves have retreated to the depths and consort with demons and the dwarves haven\u0027t been heard from in 60 years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe remaining humans, with a smattering of other races, have created a society where only women rule, practice magic, and participate in the military. The black gate still stands, and will stand as long as royal blood is present upon it\u0027s walls. The realm is fractioned into 100 petty Queendoms, each ruled by princesses who take turns guarding the Black Gate. The bloodlust curse still arises occasionally in populous areas were the few remaining men live. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the age of Slaughter is not over. Demons consort with the dark elves, hatching plans to take the Black Gate and open the door to Hell again. The twisted remnants of dwarves and men gather in the north, having grown populous over the years, and prepare to strike against the queendoms. Worse yet an ancient primordial evil is being awakened in the east. Dark sorcerers are attempting to call forth the elder demon god himself to walk the world. If they are successful all in it\u0027s path will be twisted and corrupted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo set\u0027s the stage for the final chapter in the Age of Slaughter. Will the fragmented remnants of humanity drive back the evil once again? Or will the princesses and their soldiers all meet a fate worse than death? Destiny is not yet written, but one thing is certain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHERE WILL BE BLOOD\"\u003cbr\u003e"
