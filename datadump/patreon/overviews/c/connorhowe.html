    "summary": "What up gamers! It\u0027s your boy Connor Howe and thank you for visiting my \u003cstrong\u003eOfficial Patreon Page. \u003c/strong\u003eEven if you aren\u0027t supporting the channel through this avenue, it means a lot that you even thought to consider it. Thank you so much. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I graduated college with a marketing degree and what I thought was a fairly impressive resum\u00e9, I thought finding a job in San Diego which not only pays me fairly but also provides job satisfaction would be somewhat easy. Turns out, it wasn\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast-forward to October 2017, and I decide to make a YouTube channel. I\u0027ve made videos in the past, from travel videos to school projects to just screwing around with my friends on camera. I\u0027ve never really thought of YouTube as a possible career avenue, but having seen so many talented, hilarious creators on platforms like YouTube, Twitch and even Instagram, I made it my goal to one day make a living as an independent content creator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create video content, traditionally intertwining commentary with comedy and focusing on internet culture. As someone who is only just getting started on YouTube, I\u0027m sure you can imagine my content isn\u0027t exactly making me a rich man at this point. And look, I gotta be honest, I\u0027m tryna buy a few Gucci bags, Rolexes and Lamborghinis so I can show up to the Clout House and flex all over RiceGum and FaZe Banks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn all seriousness, I mean what I say in that I\u0027m passionate about making content for those of you who enjoy watching, and I\u0027m incredibly hopeful that I can one day make a livable wage through the content I create. If you like what I\u0027m doing and want to be a part of it, please consider contributing if you\u0027re able to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still setting up rewards for the Patreon, but I promise there will be more than just roles on the Discord server in the near future. This and merchandise (which I\u0027m not yet producing) are the best ways to support creators like me, so like I said -- if you\u0027re able to contribute, please consider it. You\u0027ll make my day, I promise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for visiting and considering. I love you guys."

It\u0027s your boy Connor Howe, and thank you so much for visiting my \u003cstrong\u003eOfficial Patreon Page!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eEven if you aren\u0027t supporting the channel through this avenue, it means a ton that you even took the time to consider doing so. Thank you so much, just for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI graduated college with a marketing degree and a resume filled with job experience I thought many employers would find impressive. But as it turns out, finding a full-time job in San Diego that not only pays me fairly but also gives me work satisfaction is a lot harder than I thought it would be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn October 2017, I decided to start pursuing a career on YouTube (though I\u0027m still working to support myself financially at this point). I firmly believe in the power of content, and I think avenues like YouTube, Twitch and even Instagram are the future -- they empower creators and provide a space for just about anyone to find an audience and captivate people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal on YouTube is to make people smile, forget about the stresses and difficulties of everyday life and to just have a good time, whether it\u0027s by means of teaching you something new, making you laugh or even just making you smile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create video content, typically intertwining commentary with comedy. And though I\u0027m somewhat just getting started on YouTube, I\u0027m already looking forward to the day where making my passion for making videos can turn into a sustainable income. That\u0027s where you come in -- obviously, I\u0027m not going to charge people to watch my videos. But for those of you interested in supporting me more than by just enjoying my content and interacting with me online, we now have the Patreon. Please only consider supporting if and only if you are able to do so. Any form of generosity will always be appreciated, but I don\u0027t need you guys to bankrupt yourselves just because you want me to start buying chains and flexing on RiceGum.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is new, but I\u0027ll be sure to set up some rewards for you guys in the coming days or weeks. If you\u0027ve made it this far, thanks again so much for the support. It means a ton.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove you guys\u003cbr\u003e",
