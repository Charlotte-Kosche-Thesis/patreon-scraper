My art is ever changing. I\u0027m both a highly trained and self taught versatile artist, with degrees in visual and performing art. I\u0027ve been a painter, dancer, performer, and healer for the last 20 years. My journey as an artist has taken me all over the world and I\u0027m using my experiences to create art that I\u0027m so excited to share with you. Join me while I create new bodies of work that are evocative, and both empower and inspire. Whether it\u0027s a life-size geometric oil painting of the chakras, or a street performance pushing the boundaries of the human form - you can be a part of the artistic process every step of the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO AM I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eI\u0027m a woman of the world. I\u0027ve put roots down in places all over the globe, often traveling with little in my pockets and taking only what I can carry on my back. Sometimes living off the grid, and other times living communally. My insatiable drive to be a creator inspired by the deepest questions of life, inner connectedness, and connecting with people and the earth, has taken me to the the wild rainforest of Costa Rica, to an ashram to study with a Shaman in India, performing provocative thought pieces on the streets of Berlin, and painting abstract works on the hidden beaches of Kauai. Throughout all of this my intentions have been to live in harmony with people, the planet, and myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY AM I ON PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eMy whole career I\u0027ve challenged the status quo, and Patreon is the best way to continue my drive to create while maintaining freedom and independence within the art world. Many artists view art galleries as their ticket to success - but like many of today\u0027s industries, the art gallery system is outdated, and should be disrupted and challenged. Art galleries are notoriously difficult to get into, often times take over 50% of the purchase, and don\u0027t allow the artist to communicate with the consumer. Patreon creates a system where I can be independent from that way of doing business, while breaking down the barrier between artist and consumer. I love sharing the process of creating, the journey of getting to the final product, and of course sharing the end result. I\u0027m thrilled to get started on my first patron-supported body of work focusing on freedom of creativity and the ideals I\u0027ve mentioned above. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW YOU CAN SUPPORT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eI\u0027ll always create and share my art with the world, and now with a monthly contribution you can be the first to get a look at what I\u0027m up to, and get your hands on original paintings, exclusive prints, and even collaborate with me on special commissions, ideas, and bodies of work. \u003cbr\u003eIf a monthly contribution isn\u0027t your thing, or you\u0027d like to do more in addition to your pledge, head to \u003ca href=\"http://caylinrosejanet.com/\"\u003ecaylinrosejanet.com\u003c/a\u003e to find out more about commissions and prints of a wide range of my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
