    "summary": "Hi, my name is Kian Wilcox, but you may know me better as Cerebra Linguist. I\u0027m a software engineer and entrepreneur who, for the last few years, has been exploring the intersection of science and the arts in poetry, music, and ink with my artistic co-conspirator Dmitri Ivanov. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSharing these explorations with you is our principal source of joy in life. CP Snow once wrote of the two cultures of Science and Humanities, and how the divide between them prevents us from being able to solve the pressing issues of modern-day society. However, he expressed hope that a third culture would arise to mediate the two. If you feel, as we do, that science is the poetry of the universe, then please join us in fortifying the foundations of this third culture.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEntirely self-funded so far, we\u0027re about 80% finished with my first illustrated book of science poetry, recently finished recording my first album, and production has begun on a full album music video. With Patreon, we\u0027re now able to share work-in-progress, sneak peaks, and exclusive content with those who love it most, as it is completed. We invite you to join us; this time, the revolution will be televised.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAroused by the veridical,\u003cbr\u003eattuned to the analytical\u003cbr\u003ethe lexical, intellectual\u003cbr\u003ewelcome home, fellow sapiosexuals!"
