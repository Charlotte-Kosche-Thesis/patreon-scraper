    "summary": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hey, this is Halley Feaster, from CelloVein.  I\u2019ve been playing the cello since I was 9 years old (that\u2019s 21 years now, yikes), but was never interested in being part of an orchestra.  Much to some of my cello teachers\u2019 dismay and confusion, \u003cstrong\u003eI was always more interested in rocking out!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Between the ages of 18 and 24, I honed my craft as a cellist in all genres - rock, jazz, progressive, classical, metal, fiddle music, and world music.  I played with industry giants such as \u003cstrong\u003eThe Dropkick Murphys, Gloria Estefan, and Steve Winwood\u003c/strong\u003e.  I even auditioned for \u003cstrong\u003eIan Anderson\u003c/strong\u003e from Jethro Tull, but was too young at the time to be chosen for the tour.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   I earned a dual Bachelor\u2019s Degree in \u003cstrong\u003ePerformance and Professional Music from Berklee College of Music\u003c/strong\u003e, and when I graduated in 2009, I began to develop CelloVein.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   CelloVein is my own independent rock cello project - something I\u2019d been dreaming of since I started playing the cello at 9 years old, but couldn\u2019t really make a reality until I\u2019d been through Berklee.  Basically, in CelloVein, I write music and cover songs on Acoustic and Electric Cello, instead of guitars.  \u003cstrong\u003eConsider me a guitar player trapped in a cellist\u2019s body.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   My husband, Michael Engesser, and I practiced recording my album in various spaces since we met in the Fall of 2009.  Nothing sounded exactly the way we imagined, so \u003cstrong\u003ewe sank our life savings into building our own recording studio.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Then we practiced recording more and more.  \u003cstrong\u003eFinally, the album started sounding the way we had imagined it\u003c/strong\u003e.  I was able to record the majority of the instruments and vocals on the album, but I still had to hire a few old friends to round it out, because I still needed help with mastering, graphic design, and playing other instruments.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   In April 2016, we finally released the album, and called it \u003cstrong\u003e\u201cBad Cellist\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   With 7 years of work behind us, we found out that \u003cstrong\u003egetting the word out would be the hardest part of this whole process\u003c/strong\u003e.  So THANK YOU for finding me!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   I registered with a company called TuneCore to release \u201cBad Cellist\u201d digitally to all major streaming services.  Of course, being a \u201cCD\u201d person, I also pressed discs via DiscMakers, and have \u003cstrong\u003emostly been giving them out as sort of a \u201ccalling card\u201d.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   By now, you can see the investments made - investments of time, energy, and also money.  So it may dishearten you to find out that \u003cstrong\u003emy total streaming revenue so far (as of October 2016) is (drumroll please!) $34.07\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   \u003cem\u003eThis\u003c/em\u003e is where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Patreon is a crowd funding platform made especially for creators, like me.  Fans, or Patrons, pledge per month or per creation (in my case, per creation).  For example, \u003cstrong\u003eevery time I released new song, music video, podcast or vid-cast episode, my Patrons fund me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   There are many different levels of patronage, and I came up with some great rewards for those who do pledge, like \u003cstrong\u003efree downloads, free CDs, your name in the credits, free merch, Skype lessons, even recording cellos on your own song.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Patreon is similar to Kickstarter and GoFundMe, except for the fact that Patrons pledges are recurring.  But remember that \u003cstrong\u003eyou can set a monthly maximum\u003c/strong\u003e so you\u2019ll never go over your budget, even if I get trigger-happy and start creating content by the boat load!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   There\u2019s lots of opportunity to interact with me and other Patrons, so \u003cstrong\u003eas a Patron, you would be joining the CelloVein family.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   I have a day job, and I can support myself with it, and I even like it.  BUT, it\u2019s not my best strength.  \u003cstrong\u003eCelloVein IS my best strength\u003c/strong\u003e, and your support will help me be able to not only support myself, but also to move CelloVein forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   For example, my first goal, as I mentioned, is to be able to support myself with my talent and skills. \u003cstrong\u003e I\u2019ll be able to devote more time and energy into creating more content for you - my Patrons!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   With your support, I\u2019ll also be able to start putting more money into CelloVein.  Recording, mixing, mastering, album artwork, pressing discs, licensing cover songs, releasing online, pressing vinyl (hopefully someday!), and making music videos all cost money.  \u003cstrong\u003eAnd with more money to make more things happen, I won\u2019t have to spend 7 years on one album ever again!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   My third goal is to start taking CelloVein live to the stage.  I\u2019ve spent years trying to make CelloVein work in a live situation, and I\u2019ve never had the right equipment or enough people on board to make it work.  \u003cstrong\u003eWith a live performance sound system, I can start out performing with my recorded tracks, and start adding musicians as the budget and interest grows.\u003c/strong\u003e  And I\u2019d love to make a trip to play in your town!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Thank you for finding me and checking out what I do.  Something I didn\u2019t mention before, is that as sort of a \u201cbig picture\u201d goal for my music, is that I want my music to of course be successful and go places, like any other artist, but more than that, \u003cstrong\u003eI want it to \u003cem\u003ehelp\u003c/em\u003e people\u003c/strong\u003e.  Although I\u2019m not sure yet how I can go about really making a difference in this world, I think this is a great place to start, and \u003cstrong\u003eI hope to someday be able to fund or give some of myself somehow to organizations which promote mental health\u003c/strong\u003e, which I believe is one of many neglected aspects of health, not only in America, but worldwide.  So thanks again, and enjoy the music!\u003cbr\u003e"
