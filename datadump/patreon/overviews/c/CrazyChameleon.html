And this is my Patreon page for a game that has been a long running labor of love to me. About five years ago .. for no particular reason I started writing. I set out a universe .. created characters and races. Whenever i had some free time writing more and more information about a world and setting I created myself. Which I eventually called the Fractured Worlds. Allow me to introduce you to the things you can expect to see! But first the latest Public Build!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.mediafire.com/file/b82j35x74ehdn7v/Fractured_Worlds0.10B.zip\"\u003eFractured World 0.10B\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNSFW Content :\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe primary things I want to cater to are Monster girls and large groups of people getting intimate with other and slowly becoming more and more debauched. Both the main character and his brother start the game as virgins however that quickly changes and the sexual activity will continue to ramp up through the course of the game as the player takes a natural journey with them delving into deeper kinks and more hedonistic sexual displays. Rather than start with a debauched character or have some sort of magical corruption involved I wanted to explore the Idea of someone who just isn\u0027t very jealous and falls quite naturally into a wild and lustful lifestyle. I am also bisexual \u00a0.. with a fairly strong preference for women. So what you see will mostly be hetero/futa stuff but expect some futa-males and fem-boy encounters as well as the occasional hot stud!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imageshack.com/a/img922/5855/egi1mg.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imageshack.com/a/img923/1553/XaYGXn.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnvironmental art :\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoing into this I decided fairly on that I wanted to deliver something superior to most erotic RPGMaker games. With a good mapper you can do a lot with the basic tile-sets. But I decided that the kind of world I wanted to create would be more enthralling If I upped the ante! My game features a custom UI and environmental overlays that transform the often bland RPGMaker maps into something that truly adds to the experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imageshack.com/a/img924/8673/vzyCrt.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imageshack.com/a/img922/6752/EpYpmU.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePolished battle system :\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile my battle system may be nothing new (Based on a CTB system) I have taken the extra time to make the battle animations more dynamic and include colorful character sliders that add to the excitement of combat. Though this will no doubt take some testing and feedback from you guys to get spot on. I aim to make the combat interesting. By working on the idea of buffing for an alpha strike and mitigating enemy damage. Many enemies will require overdrive to use their strongest abilities. And they only build this as you attack them. So if you hit them with weak attacks that don\u0027t really hurt them they will punish you \u00a0in return! Rather than using items to heal over long dungeons I have given several characters unique recovery skills that need to be used opportunistically\u00a0in combat in order to clear enemies with the greatest efficiency! While my battle system might not be revolutionary! I am aiming for the experience to be engaging, challenging and competant!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imageshack.com/a/img923/307/fOVzZW.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imageshack.com/a/img922/4554/6TM6dX.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEngaging story! :\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRather than focusing on common taboo\u0027s as many game\u0027s do I instead want to design with a simple philosophy .. If you care about the characters you will care about the sex! And I want to explore other wild sexual idea\u0027s rather than the common fantasies of mind control, incest or rape that while hot .. are already well served by many exceptional games! I will now lay out the synopsis of my story. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIhria .. A world unlike any other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now that world has changed forever ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA power both ancient and new stirs within you.

The arrival of an unknown army possessing unbelievable technology and the awakening of age old gods from slumber plunges the world into chaos! As all but unnoticed some unseen hand directs the soulless armies of the Chosen against the divided strongholds of humanity. Weak from constant corruption and war.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou must wield your power, Journey through the lost places and dangerous streets of Ihria, Rally your allies .. And stand firm in the face of an enemy that has manipulated history itself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether with your comrades you must discover the truth and unite the last world.
