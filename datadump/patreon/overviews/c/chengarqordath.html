    "summary": "So, let\u0027s start by talking who I am and why you should give me your money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Chengar Qordath. I wrote my first novel back when I was in high school. Well, my first novel-length story, at least. No, you can\u0027t read it. Mostly because it was awful. Like, seriously awful. As far as I know, there are no copies of it in existence, and I\u0027m glad of that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThankfully, I\u0027ve gotten a lot better since then. I\u0027ve been writing off-and-on ever since then, but it wasn\u0027t until I got into the MLP fandom that my writing really took off. Mostly because the fans are just such awesome people. I got started with a random one-off crossover between the Dresden Files and MLP, and from there I just kept writing more and more pony words. Now I don\u0027t think I know how to stop!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral of my works, such as \u003cem\u003eMy Little Denarians\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Life and Times of a Winning Pony\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eThe Lunar Rebellion\u003c/em\u003e have become rather popular and are quite widely read. I was especially pumped when Jim Butcher, author of the Dresden Files, tweeted about \u003cem\u003eMy Little Denarians\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing covers a fairly broad spectrum, from the largely lighthearted action/adventure of Harry Dresden\u0027s misadventures in Equestria to the comedy/drama of \u003cem\u003eLife and Times\u003c/em\u003e, or the epic trilogy that is \u003cem\u003eThe Lunar Rebellion\u003c/em\u003e. In addition to all of that is my latest venture, an ongoing series about Sunset Shimmer, a magus-for-hire in the lovely hive of scum and villainy that is Freeport.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing for a long time, and all of my works date have been available to anyone who wants to read them. I know I\u2019ve had a lot of fun writing them, and from all the positive feedback I\u0027ve gotten a lot of my readers enjoyed the stories too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, writing more than one million words of fiction is a massive investment of time and energy, and the way life works, I have to invest in things other than just writing. This includes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFood\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRent\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eElectricity\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFood\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLaunchpad funds to help me put these projects to print\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTuition\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFood\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInternet Service\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA whip, to help me properly motivate my editors\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDid I get food on the list already?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI did? You see, people\u2014this is why I need that whip\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I hope everyone understands that you can keep reading everything I\u0027ve published for free, and with my thanks for continuing to enjoy my works. However, if you like what you read and you feel like supporting the guy writing it, I\u2019d appreciate your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporters will be rewarded by getting sneak peeks at my upcoming projects. Those of you who can\u2019t spare a couple bucks for me don\u2019t need to worry, though; everything will still be released to the public on more-or-less the same schedule as it has been. We\u0027ll also be looking into expanding the rewards on offer once we build up some startup cash.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve come this far only because of readers like you. So thank you. Really\u2014thank you."
