    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey there!  I\u2019m Chris\nStefanick, host of the \u003cem\u003eChoice\nConversations\u003c/em\u003e podcast.  I\u2019m\npassionate about living life to the fullest. \nWe only get one shot at our time on this planet, folks.  This is not a dress rehearsal!  With that in mind, I\u2019m dedicated to helping people\nlike you find success in all areas of your life.  I interview experts across the field of\npersonal development.  This includes topics\nlike:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHolistic health, including physical, emotional,\nand spiritual health.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eImproving relationships, be they between parents\nand children, romantic partners, or friends and family.  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBeing successful with money and in business.  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHaving a purposeful, fulfilling life.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFinding peace and happiness.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThrough the first thirty plus years of my life I was your average guy.  I lived for sports and\nbeer, and was going through life on cruise control.  There was no introspection.  I was so into fantasy football that not only\nwas I the commissioner of the league, but over a 7 year span I went to the\nsuper bowl 6 times!  I was \u003cem\u003ethat \u003c/em\u003eguy.  It\u2019s embarrassing when I think of how much\ntime I poured into something as meaningless as fantasy football.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThen the \u201cGreat Recession\u201d hit.  I watched my retirement accounts get cut in\nhalf, and for the first time in my life I started to question what was going\non.  It was like waking up out of a\nhaze.  Researching the crash in the economy\nled me to researching politics.  Next\nthing I knew I was questioning everything, things that in the past I wouldn\u2019t\nhave given a second thought.  The scales\nfell from my eyes, as I learned the mainstream narrative was a lie.  Yet the biggest discovery of all came when I realized\nI wasn\u2019t happy.  I had all of the things\nthat I was \u201csupposed\u201d to have: a job, a car, a house, wife and kid, but I\nwasn\u2019t happy.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI began consuming self-help books, podcasts and videos.  I changed my diet and lost 30 pounds\npractically overnight.  I started using\nproductivity life hacks and was able to get much more done at my day job in just\na fraction of the time.  I healed my\nmarriage and became the father I always wanted to be.  Last but not least, I was happy.  And I had found peace.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n The path I\u2019m on is\ndocumented in my podcast \u003cem\u003eChoice Conversations\u003c/em\u003e.  The show hasn\u2019t always been strictly about\npersonal development.  It\u2019s grown along\nwith me.  And we\u2019re both still growing\ntogether.  It\u2019s a journey, not a\ndestination.  I invite you to give it a\nlisten:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://choiceconversations.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://choiceconversations.com/\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you like the podcast and want to contribute, please become\na patron.  Anything you can give would be\nappreciated.  If you\u2019re temporarily short\non cash, there are other ways to help out. \nOne way is to go on itunes and subscribe, rate and review.  (\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/choice-conversations/id315666764?mt=2\u0026amp;ls=1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/choice-conversations/id315666764?mt=2\u0026amp;ls=1\u003c/a\u003e) Sharing on social media is another. \nThis will help the show to grow, which helps me do what I want to do\n-\u0026gt; help as many people as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for your time and good will.  Make the \u003cem\u003echoice\u003c/em\u003e\nto be great!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
