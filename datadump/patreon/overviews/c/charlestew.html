    "summary": "After going through the nihilistic and government-controlled university system, I decided that the only effective and satisfying way to teach philosophy was to do so outside of that system. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enroll in an academic philosophy program today, you\u0027ll learn that reality doesn\u0027t exist, knowledge is impossible, moral standards are arbitrary, and philosophy has nothing to do with the real world anyway, all for the low price of $20,000-$70,000. You can avoid the financial cost by using non-university internet resources, but they have the same perspective as the philosophy departments, so you won\u0027t learn anything better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may be skeptical that there \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e anything better to learn, that philosophy is anything more than a senseless game of subjective abstractions, and I don\u0027t blame you. It\u0027s reasonable for people who see the products of philosophy programs to dismiss the subject as not just useless, but dangerous. Who wants to become one of these unhappy, cynical, hate-fueled drones whose only motivation is the shadow of pleasure he feels when he extinguishes the fire of an idealistic soul?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI approach the field from a perspective totally unlike that of academia. I\u0027m an Objectivist philosopher, a follower of Ayn Rand, and I teach philosophy and its history in order to help you gain and strengthen the foundations required to achieve certainty, success, and happiness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do your pledges go toward?
