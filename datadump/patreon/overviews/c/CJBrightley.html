    "summary": "C. S. Lewis wrote about fairy tales for children:\u00a0\u003cem\u003eSince it is so likely that they will meet cruel enemies, let them at least have heard of brave knights and heroic courage.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose are the stories I write. I write about heroic heroes and heroines. I write about people making the hard choice to do the right thing, even when it costs them. I write about people who are confused and scared, but act with courage and generosity anyway. My characters are not perfect people, but they\u0027re people you can believe in and root for. Some of my books and stories are Christian. Others are \"clean fantasy\" if you know what I mean. Everything I write is \"young-adult appropriate\" (and perfect for gift-giving!) but it\u0027s not necessarily YA... the protagonists are often a little older than the typical teenage YA protagonist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eG. K. Chesterton wrote: \u003cem\u003eFairy tales, then, are not responsible for producing in children fear, or any of the shapes of fear; fairy tales do not give the child the idea of the evil or the ugly; that is in the child already, because it is in the world already. Fairy tales do not give the child his first idea of bogey. What fairy tales give the child is his first clear idea of the possible defeat of bogey. The baby has known the dragon intimately ever since he had an imagination. What the fairy tale provides for him is a St. George to kill the dragon.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write fantasy. I\u0027ve written an epic fantasy series with no magic called Erdemen Honor, and a series of short stories in the same world. I\u0027m working on a darkish urban Christian fantasy series called A Long-Forgotten Song. Book 3, The Beginning of Wisdom, was recently released. I\u0027m planning book 4 now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have more ideas! I\u0027m starting to brainstorm a novella with merpeople. I have another novel drafted and in the works in the Erdemen Honor series with new characters you\u0027ll recognize from my short story Street Fox. I have another novel (possible duology) with a different fairy king in the planning stages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out how fantastic these rewards are. Entire NOVELS for $3? Seriously? Yes, seriously! Support my short fiction writing and get the novels for $3. Want to pledge more? PLEASE DO! Unlike some Patreon campaigns, my rewards are all set up for complete stories... complete short stories, novellas, and novels. I\u0027m not getting paid by the chapter. Pledge more and be generous! Go for it! You know you want to. I do plan to release most of these works for sale later, but as a Patron, you\u0027ll get everything (and get it early, if we make that Milestone). I\u0027ll release the ecopies as .mobi (Kindle) and .epub (Nook, Kobo, etc.). If you need a different format, just ask!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot sure?
