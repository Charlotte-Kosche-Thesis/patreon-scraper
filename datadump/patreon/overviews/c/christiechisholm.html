    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello!\u003c/strong\u003e Thanks for stopping by. And a great, big, tremendous THANK YOU to those of you who are here because you already\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.todayletter.com/subscribe/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esubscribe\u003c/a\u003e to Today Letter. You are champions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.todayletter.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eToday Letter\u003c/a\u003e, for those who don\u0027t know, it\u00a0is a newsletter/essay/word-delivery-system written by me,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://christiechisholm.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eChristie\u003c/a\u003e, a journalist and magazine editor who sometimes likes writing about things that don\u0027t require several sources and a nut graf. Usually, this means personal essays that are, by definition, about me, but hopefully in some way about you, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started Today Letter about a year ago, with no greater goal than getting myself to write again. I made it a newsletter to hold myself accountable. What I didn\u0027t expect was that so many people who were not immediate friends and family members would read it and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.todayletter.com/subscribe/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esubscribe\u003c/a\u003e. Most of them found me through this\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.todayletter.com/letters/grab-her\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epiece\u003c/a\u003e, which went viral last October, a phenomenon I had not experienced in my 12 years working as a journalist. Funny how that happens. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have mixed feelings about asking people for support in the form of money. Which is to say, I have mixed feelings about asking people for money. But I\u0027m doing it anyway, because writers and women and especially women writers too often give away their work for free or accept too little in exchange. We should stop that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStill, Today Letter, or whatever other name I may end up giving it, will always be free. If you can afford to become a patron, even for $1 a month, it will not only make me feel damn good, but it will also help me to survive financially in a culture that doesn\u0027t pay journalists, writers, or women particularly well. It will help me write more, because I won\u0027t spend as many nights and weekends looking at my budget and wondering what\u0027s gonna give.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to add rewards for higher levels of patronage, and I would love suggestions. A sketch or watercolor portrait of your face? (I do that\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BO3wZVTh_eY/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esometimes\u003c/a\u003e.) An advice and/or questions-and-answers column? A more direct newsletter with what I\u0027m reading and watching and thinking about? Let me know what you want to read. Because that\u0027s kind of everything.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime, thank you again for reading. You can subscribe to Today Letter (for free!) right\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.todayletter.com/subscribe/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
