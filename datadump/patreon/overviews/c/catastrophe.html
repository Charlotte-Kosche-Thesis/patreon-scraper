Supporting this project is up to you, the\nmore support we receive the more time we can put into the project and the more\nwe can make. Currently we are able to produce around 2+ pages a week! Releases\nto new Patrons are based on how much support is pledged each month!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNote that the total completed pages and our quote per week can be slightly\ndifferent, typically our quote is for two characters on a page, larger scenes\ntake up the quota more and smaller scenes mean more pages! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAttention! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNew pages will now be\ndistributed through our private update server. \u003c/strong\u003eTo get the\ninvitation link sent to your email, you need to become a sponsor whose donation\nhas been processed successfully at least once. This payment request usually\nhappens within the first few days of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\nEach person who signs up gets the first 105 pages of the comic in\nsupporter-level resolution and around 8-14 pages a month from that point on\nward, released in bulk each month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBRIEFLY:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. As a sponsor, you get access to the first 105 pages after your first payment at your subscriber-level resolution.\u003cbr\u003e2. Each payment of $3, $5 or $10 a month (depending on the resolution level of access) gets you the next 10-14 page portion of the comic, up to a month behind current releases.\u003cbr\u003e3. If you stop paying for updates, your subscription pauses. But as soon as you renew your payments, you can continue from where you left off.\u003cbr\u003e4. The later you become a sponsor, the more months behind the current releases you\u0027ll be (you always start at pages 105).\u003cbr\u003e5. After some time (a year) trusted members will also be able to move to the up-to-date early subscriber time level for releases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore Detail (The same in more detail):\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nN\u003cstrong\u003eew members\u003c/strong\u003e\nstarting from August 2017 (that is those new to donating to us) will start at\npages 105 for their first release at $3 USD for 1000 px access and $5 USD\nfor 1920 px acess and $10 USD for 4k-res access. Releases are covered in\nmonthly blocks, with every new month starting a new 106 to 112 release - think\nof this like train cars, each one moves through the release schedule at a different\npoint in time!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor more pages a month, we\u0027ll be selling each following month at the same cost\nletting customers move up the release schedule! So paying $6 a month will get\nyou that month\u0027s content and the month after. This is an almost identical cost\nto our prior \u0027support threshold\u0027 fee, with $30 getting you low-resolution\naccess up until July 2017\u0027s content if you pledge your support in September,\nalmost 105 pages (up to page 197) and $33 getting you all the way to this last\nmonth\u0027s free content! (page 206!). \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe later you come, the more it will cost\nto catch up from page 105 as more months are between your \"car\" and\nthe front of the release schedule!

The up-to-date \"Car #1\" for our service will\nbe off-limits to new supporters until an amount of time has passed (to be determined\nat a later date) to ward against credit card scams and thefts. This delay will\nalso increase over time, possibly every 100 pages (about every 6-7 months) for\nnew members meaning another \"front car\" being off-limits.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nKeep in mind that in the case of leakage fault of your own - our \u003cstrong\u003eagreement is canceled\u003c/strong\u003e.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo clarify:\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJoining now for as little as \u003cstrong\u003e$3 will get\nyou all 105 pages so far\u003c/strong\u003e, and around \u003cstrong\u003e12 additional pages\u003c/strong\u003e as per our\npreview content, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eyou will have the option to buy more monthly releases of\nthe comic all the way up to receiving content a MONTH BEHIND our 09/2017\nsupporters.\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e At later dates you might be limited to two or three month\u0027s\nbehind for joining later, or upgraded to our trusted/V.I.P update schedule for\ncontinued support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs soon as you make your first payment you\nsecure your potential closest-most \"train car\", so there\u0027s no rush to\nget to the front, you can pay for the content at a pace you are comfortable\nwith, with $3 a month being around 12 pages and a delay in payment simply\nmeaning you don\u0027t buy yourself any closer to the head of the back-dated\nuploads. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe more you pledge\nthe more you get!\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecoming a sponsor for $3 you get access to\nthe first 105 pages (at 1000px) and ~12 pages onward.\u003cbr\u003e\nFor $5 you get access to all that at 1920pixels!

The reduced amount will be charged\n(in place of your prior pledge) at the beginning of the next month and your\naccess level will be recalculated. \u003cbr\u003e\nIf you are one of our generous supporters who wish to\u003cstrong\u003e INCREASE your support level \u003c/strong\u003eto\ngain our higher tier rewards please bare in mind two changes in our ToS:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e1. \u003c/strong\u003eOur\nhigher tier options include higher resolution rewards on our server on top of\nother rewards like the $30 illustration reward: please note, we hold ALL of our\nsupporters to the same model for server rewards such as a zip download of our\nhigher resolution comic archives and new pages in higher resolution. For\nexample, you may have paid the fee of $30 for access a later month\u0027s content at\nthe standard-resolution tier reward pack on our server, you may then have\nreduced your support to $3 the second month to keep with that car\u0027s update\nschedule. If you wished to then increase your support, for high-resolution tier\nmonthly rewards, you would need to pay the difference between your current car\nand that car\u0027s cost for the higher resolution tier. For example, if you paid to\nmove 9 cars ($27+$3 for the month) you would need to pay that difference to get\nall those pages in higher resolution ($20 extra, as each move and the month\u0027s\npayment would be $5 for high resolution for a total of $50, not $3 for a total\nof $30). \u003cbr\u003e\nThe same applies for going from a $5 high-res tier to a $10 threshold for\n4k-resolution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e2. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eS\u003c/strong\u003eupporters\nwho wish to \u003cstrong\u003eMOVE TIERS\nMULTIPLE TIMES\u003c/strong\u003e or wish to repeatedly drop and raise pledges to\npurchase higher-resolution archives without their monthly page value, must meet\nan additional charge to prevent this unfair reward purchase (this does NOT\ninclude lowering support from the, typically higher, \u0027Catching up\u0027 pledge, just\nall additional raises in tier rewards AFTER the first time you choose switch up\nfrom your starting tier).\u003cbr\u003e\nFor multiple tier changes we are applying an additional cost for rewards set\nat: the desired tier\u0027s cost for your car number, minus the current tier\u0027s cost.\nThis is REGARDLESS of overall support in MOST cases, with some circumstances\ntaken into account such as high overall support.\u003cbr\u003e\nAs much as we LOVE to have supporters increasing their pledges with us and\ngetting more out of the comics, and we understand sometimes there\u0027s a need to\nreduce support again; these measures are in place to prevent scamming the\nsystem with $3-a-month support followed by a single $10 pledge every 6 months\nto get those 4k rewards and archives without paying the equivalent monthly\ncosts ($84 difference) by requesting, then losing access repeatedly to our 4k\ndigital comic reward.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eIf you violate our\npolicy and distribute early-access content to people outside of Patreon, your\nsubscription will be blocked, your Patreon account reported and you will have\nto pay to move up the reward schedules from pages 101-112 when you make a new\naccount to try and re-join. \u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe reserve the right to change the terms of joining the distribution server as\ncontent grows.

If there are circumstances\nthat would keep you from paying for such a period, notifying us beforehand with\na legitimate claim will allow us to pause your account, rather than flagging\nyou as forfeited.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf Patreon not be able to process your donation, you will be notified that the\ndelivery of content is suspended. This happens quite often \u2013 such as if your\nbank details change, you lose a bank card or your account is overdrawn. If you\nsolve the problem quickly, there is a high chance Patreon will be able to\nprocess your donation without missing updates.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you miss 1 month, then on the 2nd month Patreon is able to process a payment\n(the usual amount per month) \u2013 you will get the pages of the FIRST month you\nmissed, effectively moving down cars to keep pace with the rewards you have\nalready earned! You\u0027re buying the whole book, remember, not part of it and due\nto security issues we are no longer distributing only the newest pages of\nearly-access material to those who offer to support but only make a payment\nevery handful of months in order to claim all the content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eEach missed month donation will cause a lag in your updates by a month\u003c/strong\u003e.\nYou will likely receive these in a lump update once a month - immediately after\nhandling the donation all of the pages created in that month will be accessible\nto you. As opposed to an up-to-date \"Car #1\" account where each new\npage is uploaded when created.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf your account is lagging behind, you can \"catch up\" all missed\nmonths by making a proportional contribution (your usual amount due over the number\nof missed months + the coming month). In this case, after Patreon has processed\nyour donation, you will get all the updates for the missed months and will\nreceive the new pages as they are uploaded to the server. As previously\nmentioned, you may only catch up to Car #2 (a month\u0027s delay) if you are new to\nPatreon as of August 2017\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAnother thing to note:\u003c/strong\u003e\nsome people quit supporting the project and do not explain to us the reasons.\nIn this case, after sending the third month\u0027s notification that Patreon could\nnot process a donation - we remove this \"ghost\" account from the list\nof sponsors \u0026amp; the distribution server user list, membership is canceled.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis decision was dictated by the significant server resources, and human\nresources, spent attempting to hold up unresponsive accounts or contact un-paid\ndonors who have forfeited their attention to the comic for so long. \u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, we recognize that there may be a problem, personal or otherwise, that\nprevents a sponsor from making payments for a period. In this case, we can\n\"freeze\" a sponsors distribution account if they can no longer pay,\nbut retain an interest in the project and firmly believe that they want to get\nall of its pages later when they have the financial opportunity. In this case,\nif you plan to take a break from payment for an indefinite period of time\n(longer than 3 months) - just email us and we will mark your account as\n\"reserved\" rather than risking termination of your distribution\nserver account. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen you are able to, simply begin making pledges for the monthly content\nyou\u0027ve missed and we can get you up to date. :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnyone read this far? ;) Ok! Now we\u0027ll tell you about the future of the\nproject!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith increased funding we hope to release more and more pages per week, with a\ntotal of between 1500 and 2500 pages in the project (the total number of pages\ndepending in part on sponsorship). Also if the whole project goes well we also\nhope to publish this comic in paper format!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
