    "summary": "Hello! I am an aspiring artist currently pursuing my degree as an Art Studio Major at Mills College in Oakland, CA. I have been involved with art since I was very young, and very quickly discovered that it is what I want to pursue in life. Art is my passion, and while I will still continue to create no matter my financial circumstances, my dream is to sell my work and take commissions in order to combine my passion with a source of income. As patrons, you would be helping to fund me in getting the needed supplies to create more work, as well as helping to support me so that I can spend more and more of my time doing what I love! I am very involved in fandom, and would love to create custom fanart and/or cosplay materials for all my fellow nerds out there, including potential tutorials as rewards! My biggest fandoms at the moment are Marvel, Supernatural, and Hannibal, but I also will love Star Wars, Harry Potter, Homestuck, Fallout, Sherlock, and many others forever and ever. I cosplay with my girlfriend as well as on my own, and LOVE making props and doing makeups for each of our characters. Once I get a few patrons, I will start setting up tutorials for makeup, props, my artwork, and/or anything else you would like to see as rewards! Getting funded would help me continue to pursue what I love, and create more for all of you, so thank you!"
