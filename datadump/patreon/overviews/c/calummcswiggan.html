    "summary": "I\u0027m an LGBT+ Lifestyle YouTuber living in the UK and I make videos about LGBT+ issues, mental health, and sex education. I try to make myself heard for the hundreds of thousands of LGBT+ people around the world who don\u0027t yet have a voice. Whether I\u2019m taking on the latest fun challenge video or sitting down to talk about something controversial, I always strive to be 100% honest and open with you guys and am proud of the 50,000+ strong family we have built together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking weekly YouTube videos and giving you guys the attention you deserve is as time consuming as it is fun and can often feel like a full time job. I work full time for a sexual health charity so finding the time to commit to YouTube can be difficult and means I have very little free time to myself. By supporting me on Patreon you will be helping me get closer towards building a career and a future out of doing what I love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating videos isn\u2019t something that comes cheap \u2013 whether it\u2019s buying camera and lighting equipment, licensing music, or travelling around to meet you guys and fellow creators at events \u2013 it can all get quite expensive. This year I\u2019ve made the decision to find a way to fund the cost of running my channel and everything I do, and Patreon is one of the ways I\u2019m doing that. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eEverything I do and create will always remain completely free - I think it\u2019s important to make these videos widely accessible to anyone who wants to watch them \u2013 but if you want to give a little something extra to help support what I do then I would be forever grateful and will even treat you to some exclusive rewards. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for watching, thank you for reading, and thank you as always for your on going support!\u003cbr\u003e"
