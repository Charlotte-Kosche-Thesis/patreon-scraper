    "summary": "Hello. We are Graham Elwood and Chris Mancini and we started the Comedy Film Nerds website in 2008 and the podcast in 2009. In that time we have grown a great fan base and community. We have done over 400 podcast episodes, published a book (The Comedy Film Nerds Guide to Movies) and produced a feature film (Ear Buds: The Podcasting Documentary). All of it was only possible from great supporters like you! We want to expand everything we are doing to give you the fans more great content. That\u0027s why we are here on Patreon. More ways for our CFN community to participate and grow this cool thing we started in a garage. We are an indie company with NO outside corporations or investors telling us what to do. Help us keep it that way. Thank you so much for your support: past present and future. You\u0027re aces."
