I\u0027d like to think I write about a lot of different things, but in the end, I write about hypnosis. I write about boys submitting to girls, their minds slowing to a crawl, their eyes going glassy, their jaws dropping as they hand over control to whichever enthralling enchantress has them spellbound. It could be a smoldering succubus tempting an adventurer into unholy matrimony, an off-the-clock hypnotherapist taking her date deeper and deeper before giving him the ride of his life, or an alien queen unleashing her hypno-ray on the rugged astronaut sent to make contact. Still, no matter how, who, or why, you can be sure that the boy\u0027s going to end up hypnotized I wouldn\u0027t have it any other way, and I\u0027m sure that you wouldn\u0027t either!\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003eWhat To Expect\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003eIf you decide to pledge your support\u00a0\u2014 and I can\u0027t express just how thankful I am if you do\u00a0\u2014 then \n\t\u003cstrong\u003eyou can expect around three to four stories per month\u003c/strong\u003e. I try to make each story \u003cstrong\u003eat least 3,000 words long\u003c/strong\u003e, but more often than not, you can expect a story around \u003cstrong\u003e4,000 to 5,000 words long\u003c/strong\u003e. They may not all have sex, but they\u0027ll all have mind control of some stripe, and they\u0027ll always have a girl topping a boy...one way or another.

Seriously, if you don\u0027t know who Jukebox is, click the link, read his stuff, and get back to me once you\u0027ve read everything he\u0027s done. Even if his writing wasn\u0027t fantastic \u2014 which it is, of course\u00a0\u2014 Jukebox would still be an inspiration if only for his ability to write so much so consistently so well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://gigglinggoblin.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGigglingGoblin\u003c/a\u003e: GigglingGoblin is actually almost single-handedly responsible for me picking up the proverbial pen again, if at all! Her story Monstrous Ranch is so good that it jolted my imagination back to life once more. I owe her a lot both as a writer and a collaborator.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.mcstories.com/Authors/Homer-Vargas.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHomer Vargas\u003c/a\u003e: While Homer\u0027s work isn\u0027t as heavily femdom-centric as I would perhaps like, his stuff got to me early. If there\u0027s any question where my love of overwhelming femininity came from, Homer Vargas is the answer.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://hellskitchensink.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMGExaminer\u003c/a\u003e: Another source of inspiration is MGExaminer and his unerringly happy endings. His work ethic and output is staggering, and he has the creativity and talent to match. If you like my Monster Girl Mixer stories and the setting they\u0027re in, you have MGExaminer to thank.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fenoxo.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFenoxo\u003c/a\u003e (specifically Corruption of Champions): If there was one source for my love of bad ends and sexy combat, it would be Fenoxo. Honestly, if I could write nothing but bad ends, I would, and it\u0027s all because the bad ends in Corruption of Champions are \u003cem\u003eexquisite\u003c/em\u003e. Some of them take a bit of digging to get to, but there are a few that I find myself circling back to time and time again.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eToro Toro Resistance: While I can\u0027t link to anything this Japanese eroge (erotic game) group has made directly due to some objectionable content in their games, Toro Toro Resistance and Monmusu Girl Quest (its most famous work) are a major inspiration for my fantasy writing. I could talk about all the delicious bad ends to be found in MGQ, but I think the tagline sums it up. \"Lose and Be Raped.\"\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eKenkou Cross: Another Japanese influence \u003cdel\u003ethat I unfortunately can\u0027t link to\u003c/del\u003e, Kenkou Cross is probably one of the most well-known producers of \"monster girl\" lore and fiction in the world. His stuff doesn\u0027t have \u003cem\u003equite \u003c/em\u003eas much hypnosis as mine does, but it\u0027s safe to say that his work provides a great deal of inspiration for me.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.johnwilliamwaterhouse.net/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJohn W. Waterhouse\u003c/a\u003e: I almost hesitate to mention the late Mister Waterhouse \u2014 owing to my deep respect for him as a true artist\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but I would be lying if I said his paintings don\u0027t influence my writing. Though the subject matter varies, there\u0027s a common theme in most of his works. His women are enchanting, otherworldly, almost foreign in their smooth, unblemished perfection. They captivate. They are more than beautiful; they are \u003cem\u003edivine\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e"
