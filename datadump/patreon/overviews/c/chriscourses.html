There is a reason behind this: People need a way to support themselves, so they sell their goods and services at a set price. However, even if the price is as cheap as $10 a month, many aspiring developers are deterred due to the monetary wall blocking their educational path.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEveryday, people in our world want to make a difference, they want to grow their skillset, and create something that exhibits their true ability to succeed, but things become exponentially harder for them if they are unable to obtain the required resources to complete the job.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eThis is exactly what I hope to fix.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNo longer will aspiring or current developers be held back my monetary paywalls\u2014I\u0027m here to provide a free education that\u0027ll give anyone the toolsets they\u0027ll need to develop\u00a0robust, yet aesthetic creations on the web.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith years of professional experience, fantastic student reviews from the classes I\u0027ve taught, and numerous features across creative web development platforms such as CodePen... I\u0027m here to help make things happen. Whether it\u0027s your goal to develop a life changing web app, a stunning award winning website, or an artistic masterpiece that helps express your creativity, come join me in Chris Courses, and let\u0027s get to work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://christopherlis.com/img/me-resized.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not my goal to get rich, it\u0027s not my goal to get famous\u2014it\u0027s to inspire, help others find purpose in life, and to develop emotion evoking / life changing creations that truly make our world a better place.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m currently in the process of creating a free educational platform (chriscourses.com) that provides a central hub for current and aspiring developers to achieve their development related goals (think of it as a Khan Academy for real world web development). Whether it be landing a full-time development gig or building a life altering web app, I\u0027m here to help make it happen. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn brief, the majority of my income comes through freelance work\u2014I can\u0027t focus on Chris Courses 100% of the time simply because releasing tutorials for free doesn\u0027t do a great job at paying the bills (self induced, but effective for those who can\u0027t afford subscription services). Every donation headed my way will permit for the creation of more tutorials, rather than requiring I put my development efforts elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAll in all, I\u0027d just like to say, thanks so much for watching and for contributing towards all of the support I\u0027ve been given so far. I\u0027m here to ensure it all pays off in the end.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-Chris"
