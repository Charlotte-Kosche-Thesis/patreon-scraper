I moved to San Diego in 2000 and have enjoyed every minute of it. \u00a0I\u0027ve performed a number of times and places around town that have given me the joy and passion that LA was missing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the mid 2000\u0027s I learned about podcasts and podcasting and fell in love with it almost immediately. \u00a0After years of figuring out the right kind of podcast and niche I want to fit into AND coming out to myself and family as TransGenderQueer I finally figured out the type of podcast I want to produce and that is a journal or log of my self discovery into the LGBTQIA communities and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me weekly as I share my story and life on my show \"Changes In Latititudes: A Transgender Experience\"",

However\u00a0in making this choice it meant we needed to cohabitate with family which is not entirely horrible or even a bad thing but if you\u0027ve ever needed to do this you know \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEXACTLY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e what I\u0027m talking about and the loss of self and personal space that comes with this type of cohabitation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy reaching this goal my family and I (wife, son and me) would be able to afford a \u003cem\u003esmall\u003c/em\u003e place of our own. If you\u0027re not familiar with housing in California, this would cover rent, gas, electric, internet and renter\u0027s insurance \u003cem\u003e(not cable TV)\u003c/em\u003e for a 2 bedroom 1 bath apartment in an upper-lower to lower-middle class part of town plus fuel for vehicles to be able to transport our child to \u0026amp; from pre-school, starting in fall of 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePLEASE NOTE\u003c/strong\u003e: The monthly goal is $2000, with the additional $50 I plan to set aside in a college fund for our son.\u003cbr\u003eReaching this goal would mean the world to me because not only would we be able to stand up on our own, but also I would be able to produce/create episodes more frequently AND be able to give something back to my son in the future. One of our self inflicted goals when we moved was to be able to put aside at least $50 a month for his future.",

     "description": "I\u0027ve been using my current Mac Book Pro since 2011. It was brand spanking new when I purchased it and has treated me incredibly well for the years, but as with all things technological it\u0027s time to start planning ahead and looking to the future. \u00a0The way I see it, my current Mac Book has about 24-36 months left before things start going wonky. If I were to replace it with the latest comparable version (IE the newest 15\" Mac Book Pro) the price is roughly $2499.99 plus warranty \u0026amp; tax and any unforeseen expenses, therefore I figure around $3000 should be a good round number goal.",
