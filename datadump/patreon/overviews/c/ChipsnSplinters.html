    "summary": "Hi - I\u2019m Leon, welcome to my channel, I\u2019m on a mission to become a total woodworking legend and I\u2019m documenting my journey so that you can either rejoice at my progress, or laugh at my ineptitude\u2026 or maybe even both, it\u2019s up to you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to go from total woodworking no-hoper to someone that can actually make a living from making stuff out of wood. There\u0027s no time limit, it might take a year or it might take 10 - hopefully it won\u0027t be the latter though!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve spent the past 20 years working in publishing with 10 of those years as a publisher in the City and the following 10 running my own company. Now at the age of 42 I\u2019m ready for a change. Chasing the money no longer makes me happy and my happiness has become more of a priority recently. So I\u2019m doing something about it by learning a new skill in something that I really enjoy, with a view to giving up my business in the near future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eZero to hero\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I say zero, I literally mean zero. Currently, other than the few rudimentary skills that I learnt at school, I know next to nothing about the art of woodworking, so I have a great deal to learn\u003cbr\u003eIn terms of investment, I have spent a little money on equipment but other than raw materials the only cash I\u0027m putting into this is the money that I make from selling the stuff I\u2019ve made. So if I want to go on a course or buy a new saw, I will have to make a few sales. You can chart my progress \u003ca\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course if you want to chip in and help me out then please be my guest - or even better, ask me to make something for you and I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u003cbr\u003eI warn you though - the furniture that I make to begin with is likely to be\u2026 umm... let\u2019s say amateurish - but stick with it - it\u2019s bound to get better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can you help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best way to help is to simply follow my progress on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.chipsandsplinters.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esite\u003c/a\u003e. If you can also follow me on \u003ca\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp; \u003ca\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e, that would also be a massive help. Finally if you want to give a small donation to aide my progress then be my guest. Thank you :o)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u2019s it - I hope you can join me on my mission...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
