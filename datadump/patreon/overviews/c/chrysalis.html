English isn\u0027t my first language, but I wouldn\u0027t be able to reach nearly as many readers in my native language. I look forward to honing my English writing skills with the support of friends and readers, who will hopefully comment on my work published with Wordpress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first web serial, Anathema,\u00a0launched on the 22nd of june, 2014, and I\u0027ll upload at the very least one chapter of 3000 or more words per week - if life allows, two chapters. Donations would help me dedicate more time to writing. Anathema is a dark, gritty superhero story with a stronger focus on realism than what\u0027s typical for the genre.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is my life, always has been, and my stories and characters\u00a0are vivid\u00a0in my head even when I\u0027m trying to do... less interesting stuff. It\u0027s the one talent I have, and nothing would make me happier than finally turning my passion into a profession."

But all the comments and support I\u0027ve received so far really encourages me to keep going, so expect to see more weekly chapters of Anathema and other fiction in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I\u0027ve finally come out of the closet by publishing, this isn\u0027t just a hobby or an experiment for me. I write after coming home from 12 hour days, and no matter how tired I am, there\u0027s this passion that drives me to finish the next chapter instead of going out or playing games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI studied Information Science, but due to several unfortunate factors (few job openings and no work experience apart from internships being two of them) I haven\u0027t been able to get a librarian or documentation job in the 3 years since I got my bachelor degree. Right now I\u0027m dabbling with call center jobs to keep myself afloat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt present, I\u0027m writing the dark superhero web serial Anathema on Wordpress.",
