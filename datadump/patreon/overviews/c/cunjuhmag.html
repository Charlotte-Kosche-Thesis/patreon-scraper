    "summary": "Hey! You\u2019re a beautiful soul, did you know that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCunjuh (kuhn-juh) is a Chicago based, biannual art and literary publication exclusively for People of Color (POC) and other racialized identities established in 2016. Our focus is giving a platform to artists of color typically gated from well-established white art and literary worlds without sacrificing the nuance we all contain as individuals. We pride ourselves on curating a selection of art across mediums; we exist in an age where the possibilities of what and how things can be produced are growing every day, and it would be a disservice to limit what art contributors can send. \u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re forever grateful for your donations \u0026amp; honestly, simply believing in us enough to even decide to support us at all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donation will be put towards printing physical copies of our magazine for contributors \u0026amp; for anyone else that digs \u201canalog\u201d publishing these days. Towards actually *paying* those contributors instead of giving them a copy of the mag \u0026amp; calling it a day. Of course, we can\u2019t promise the Big Bucks, but establishing that artists deserve to be \u0026amp; will be rightfully compensated for their work is important to us as editors (and artists \u0026amp; writers \u0026amp; people). Yeah, art is gorgeous, but we should be divesting our funds from corporations that don\u2019t have an interest in our liberation, and putting it towards professions where their labor is seen as \u201clesser\u201d (and the people performing it seen in the same light). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, we want to use the money we receive to be able to build a physical community within Chicago. There\u2019s plenty of art here being made by incredible artists of color \u0026amp; the intersection of art \u0026amp; politics is not lost on us. We want to be at home making our immediate community better through workshops, murals, gatherings \u0026amp; celebrations despite everything that has happened, and continues to happen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout this city, Cunjuh wouldn\u2019t exist or be able to persist, and we give our thanks for that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank you so so so much for your generosity, we hope to make y\u2019all proud :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProtect ya magic, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Editors of Cunjuh Mag"

As people of color, we exist in intersections that skew and dislocate us from our humanity. \u003cem\u003eCunjuh\u003c/em\u003e seeks to offer people of color a space to reclaim truths entirely separate from dominant narratives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe especially encourage queer and trans people of color to submit. Even our voices can be silenced in publications dedicated to people of color and we hope to resist that temptation as best as possible. Those who exist within that intersection are the best example of how mediums are being queered in form, practice, and message.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough the origins of \u003cem\u003ecunjuh\u003c/em\u003e are rooted in the spiritual legacy of people from the african diaspora, our space is open to all people of color. Everyone from a racialized heritage has experienced faith and spirituality in the front of oppression in some form, with or without a guiding text, with belief.\u003cbr\u003e",
