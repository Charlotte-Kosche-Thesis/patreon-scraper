    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHello! We\u2019re ClawMountain Studios. 8 years ago we started\nas just a group of friends making silly YouTube videos, and while we\u2019re still\ndoing those silly YouTube videos, a lot has changed.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019ve made tons of films, released biweekly shorts since 2013, won awards from\nthe LA Horror Competition, BIFF, The California Film Awards and more local film\nfestivals, and made several long-running web shows. That said, we want to do\nmore.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs filmmakers, we believe it\u2019s important to challenge ourselves and expand our\nfilms. We want to take our audience to new worlds, showcase more breathtaking\nscenes and provide more depth to our stories. We want to think bigger and take\na shot at the potential to bring our audience more epic adventures.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo do this, we need the one thing every filmmaker fears:\na budget. Films like \u003cem\u003ePlaneswalkers \u003c/em\u003eand our new release \u003cem\u003eHonor Among\nThieves\u003c/em\u003e are examples of films that have had a larger budget. You can tell\nbecause there are more people involved, better costumes, props and special\neffects, and cooler locations, among many other aspects.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe YouTube landscape has changed, and we\u2019ve changed with it. Beyond going\nviral, we are striving to focus more on storytelling, higher production values\nand most importantly, entertaining you as an audience. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith this Patreon, you\u2019re becoming part of the crew. Your donations will go\ntowards food, props, costumes, rentals, location fees, transportation costs and\nmany of the other expenses film has. No one is taking a cut. 100% of the funds\nraised on Patreon will go towards the short films we are making which get\nreleased on the Internet, free of charge. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you want to know what we\u2019re up to, check the goals bar on the left! If you\nsee a film you want to have happen but it\u2019s far up there, share this Patreon\nwith your friends and family so that we can make that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you enjoy watching out shorts, seeing our crazy behind the scenes, and\nwatching us grow and get better at filmmaking, consider contributing $1 to our\nPatreon. No matter how clich\u00e9 it is, that dollar goes a long way towards making\na better film.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
