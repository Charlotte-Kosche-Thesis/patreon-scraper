    "summary": "Back in 2015, three friends gathered in a basement and dreamed of creating shows about the videogames, movies, and TV shows we all love to consume. After a few years of battling and analyzing these entities on Youtube and Twitch, the group decided to surge forward and attempt to make this glorious campaign into a profession. Thanks to the wonderful support of our family, friends, and especially our fans, Critical Reviews is aiming to educate and entertain the world! Our particular blend of humor, honesty, and passion for these interests drove us to seek out full time work here on Patreon. It all boils down to this, if you have enjoyed our streams, podcasts, or reviews and want to see more of them, or even different types of shows covering everything in the nerd kingdom, then supporting us here is the strongest way to do so.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledging to Critical Reviews will only bolster our production value and allow us to tackle even more projects. Equipment like cameras, microphones, lighting, and all those integral components will be the most crucial elements to increasing the quality of everything we make. Joining at any tier will make you part of the Legion: a group of individuals dedicated to discussing and dissecting media in a respectful manner! The force that has already been established is comprised of the nicest and most generous soldiers a General could ask for and we\u0027re hopeful that it will only continue to thrive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur leaders consist of three individuals: Jimmy Good, Joe Leaver, and Thomas Yang. Their goal is to cover more events, partner with other like-minded groups, and provide informed opinions on movies, games, or anything else our community demands coverage of. Critical Reviews doesn\u0027t support all of us as full time members, but we are hopeful that one day it shall! Our influence and scale is left in your capable hands.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEternal Goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e$250 per month: \u003cstrong\u003eSet streaming schedule\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n  \u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e$500\nper month: \u003cstrong\u003eDungeon Dwellers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n  \u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e$1,000\nper month: \u003cstrong\u003eAn Eternal Sell-Pen\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n  \u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e$2,000\nper month: \u003cstrong\u003eThe Commander\u0027s Kitchen\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n  \u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e$5,000\nper month: \u003cstrong\u003eNational Campaign\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n  \u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e$7,500\nper month: \u003cstrong\u003eInternational Campaign\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n  \u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e$10,000\nper month: \u003cstrong\u003eStudio Space\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo us, the most engrossing and intriguing hobbies in our lives demand a critical eye not only to perceive shortcomings, but to appreciate their finest attributes as well!
