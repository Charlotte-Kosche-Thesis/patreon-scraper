    "summary": "\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eI am a full time artist living in Seattle Washington. I have quite a bit going on, like everyone else of course. I have my personal art career and I also own a small gallery in the Georgetown neighborhood of Seattle called Eight and Sand. For my personal artwork I work with some local galleries doing lots of group shows and I have art in The Hive Gallery in Downtown Los Angeles. I have had the great fortune to be included in the 78 Tarot project and have enjoyed working with them on two decks so far. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eWith my art gallery my focus is on local and national artists that I represent with solo, duo and group shows. I sometimes participate in the group shows. The gallery is still in its infancy, into our second year now. You can see more about that at eightandsand.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eYour patronage will help me in so many ways!\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eArt supplies\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNew Technology (camera, lights, monitor, scanner)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTravel (mostly to and from LA)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTime\u00a0to paint a new body of work (this would be larger paintings that take much more time to paint and cut down on work that I can create more quickly to sell for pet food and people food, mortgage, gas etc..)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cem\u003eRenting a brick and mortar space is not cheap. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRent\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInsurance\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdvertising\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWine and snacks for opening shows\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLarger space (someday I would like to move to a larger space, my gallery is quite small)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAs you can see this all adds up FAST! My husband and I are sacrificing a lot to make this all work because it is what I am most passionate about. I love painting and I love helping other artists get their art out into the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI am personally the most happy when I am working! Well, until its time for a break and then I am most happy laying around with a drink in my hand and a book or something. So...I want to paint for you! I will be offering the majority of my mini (5x7\" and smaller) artwork here, to you first! There will be prints, exclusives, discounts, puppies, booze , and candy!!! YAY! or something like that...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo how I will do this is I will create 4 mini paintings per month, one for each week. Below you can see the reward tiers for monthly pledges.\u00a0Following is some info on each reward offered: \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOnce a year I will make a special holiday postcard that I will send out to backers before Christmas. These will be exclusive to my Patrons, they will be a hand signed letter of thanks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI have an Etsy shop where I sell my art that is not currently on display in a gallery show. I also put up prints sometimes and lots of other stuff like jewelry and hand painted boxes and different things. The monthly 30% off coupon will be exclusive to my patrons here and will be good towards anything in the shop (unless specified) does not apply to shipping though.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Art Trading Card prints will be made from the monthly mini paintings. If you don\u0027t know already art trading cards are 2.5x3.5\" inches, the same size as a normal trading card. These are easily framed or kept in a binder for a collection. These will be signed on the back.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe sketch card will be the same size as the art trading card prints but will be an original sketch, not a print!\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7a6de7_6e189d6f6863446f8f1429d29f7389de.jpg/v1/fit/w_375,h_375/7a6de7_6e189d6f6863446f8f1429d29f7389de.jpg\" style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe 4x6\" inch ink and watercolor painting will be on watercolor paper. This will be an ink drawing with light washes of watercolor paint as accents. For now there will only be 10 of these available per month.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7a6de7_9e0af8e5a37144a88f4a8309b8f70cc6.jpg/v1/fit/w_375,h_375/7a6de7_9e0af8e5a37144a88f4a8309b8f70cc6.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor the final $200 pledge level you will have a choice of one of the original mini artworks that I have painted for that pledge month. For the most part the mini paintings will be done in acrylic paint on canvas, paper or small panels. Sometimes they will be framed, sometimes they wont it really just depends on my supplies and what I am inspired by at the time. I get a lot of frames from the thrift store and I paint a lot of my mini art specifically for a frame that I have found. This will be a first pledged first served for choice, there will only be 4 of this pledge level available per month.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7a6de7_e9ebb50b584f42b3b867c61faada9f60.jpg/v1/fit/w_375,h_375/7a6de7_e9ebb50b584f42b3b867c61faada9f60.jpg\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7a6de7_3df248b4456043cea71a17f339b58230.jpg/v1/fit/w_375,h_375/7a6de7_3df248b4456043cea71a17f339b58230.jpg\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7a6de7_728135851db748038fa268a31ba60901.jpg/v1/fit/w_375,h_375/7a6de7_728135851db748038fa268a31ba60901.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"

     "about": "\u003cem\u003eI am a full time artist and gallerist living in Seattle Wa. I live in a tiny house on a hill with my husband, two cats, and one fat little yellow chihuahua. I was born in the summer time in Oregon. At the time my dad was a logger and my mom was a factory worker. My sister was happy to meet me, she was already old enough to ride bikes and have pets and listen to cassette tapes. I have been in Washington since I was about 5 or so. We traveled around a lot because of my dads work and we even lived on two islands, and a little boat for a time and I loved playing with all the strange sea creatures that live in our icy Northwest waters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am fully self taught. I prefer to work with acrylic paint. I like to paint girls, blood, and strange things. Dreams, nightmares, fairy tales, they all make their way into my paintings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also own and curate a little gallery, Eight And Sand, in the Georgetown neighborhood of Seattle. I put on monthly shows, solo ,and group. I enjoy promoting other hard working, local, and non local artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work has been published in a few books over the years, most notably in Big Eye Art Resurrected And Transformed by Blonde Blythe aka Toni Boozer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been in many art shows over the years showing mainly around Seattle and a little nationally. I currently have artwork on display around Seattle and In Los Angeles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e",
