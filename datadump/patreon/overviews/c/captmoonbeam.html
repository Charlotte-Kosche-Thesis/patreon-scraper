    "summary": "On June 3rd, 1988 I passed my private pilot check ride and at\nthirty years of age, I was a captain on a Cessna 152. I flew my first passenger\nthat day and I\u2019ve been flying and sharing aviation ever since. But, I almost\nlost my dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u2019re only a hand\nfull of jobs that kids aspire to and being a pilot is at the top of the list. I\nwanted to be a pilot from the age of six when I flew in my first airplane.\nIt was a twin-engine Delta Airlines Convair 440. I was hooked and that was what\nI was going to do when I grew up. As I got older I managed to convince myself\nthat there was no way I could afford to be a pilot. I got married, had kids,\nworked for a company and still wanted to be a pilot. Then one Christmas a\nrelative gave me an introductory flying lesson as a gift. After the first of\nthe year I went to the airport and redeemed my certificate. I climbed into a\nlittle two seat trainer with a crusty old instructor named Gordon. We flew from\nMemphis to West Memphis and I was hooked before we turned back. That was it,\nall there was to it, but I was hooked like a fish on a line. I scheduled my 2\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;nd\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt;\nlesson before I walked out of the office. I went home that afternoon and told\nmy wife I was going to be a pilot. The next month I quit my job and ran off to\nbe a pilot. I\u2019ve been flying ever since. Oh yeah, the wife and kids, I took them\nwith me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love flying, I\u2019m a professional pilot and I love what I\ndo. I also love sharing the adventure of flight. I call it that because that\u2019s\nwhat it really is. When I go to work, I\u2019m leaving on an adventure and I share the\nstory of that adventure through my YouTube videos. My mission is not so much to\nteach, which I do, but to inspire others to pursue their dreams before it\u2019s to\nlate. By sharing your gifts through Patreon you\u0027re helping create the videos and write the stories that inspire others to achieve their dreams. Thanks, Jim.\u003cbr\u003e"
