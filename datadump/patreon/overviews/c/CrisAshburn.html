Her father taught her how to heal with acts of kindness and how to tell a good story with wild gestures and strange voices. Her mother taught her of the importance of ceremony, remembrance, and the wisdom found in laughter. She grew up singing songs and dreaming of her ancestors; until one day her mother said it was time.

They will assist me with building up the needed energetic layers to create a personlized healing atmosphere for you. I may use anywhere from 3 to 7 tarot and oracle decks, automatic writing, hand-picked and custom-designed stone grids, multiple incense blends, charms, and more. I may see visions or hear words/songs. I may take on physical and emotional pains (yours as well as spiriit). If the pains are yours, I will help to work through them and cleanse your energetic field. During these sessions you are always encouraged to be interactive and ask questions, make comments, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e",
