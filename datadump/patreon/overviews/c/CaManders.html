Currently, I am working on a longform fanfiction for South Park called Indigo Children, centered around Kenny McCormick and Craig Tucker. It is full of hazy metaphors, Dudes Being Dudes, and maybe an alien or two.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have also been working on an original piece called Nearsight! It is a story about a werewolf named Keith who is unwittingly trapped in the center of a vampiric civil war. Watch him run from his problems, incur more problems, and then be too stubborn to leave things alone!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eManders just is. \u00a0I draw and illustrate and am currently working on a long format webcomic/graphic novel called Godkillers. \u00a0Much of the work you will see here is centered around that project but you\u0027ll also find fanart, DnD work, and other drawings and projects posted here. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGodkillers is the story of a young man, Hayden Prince, who manages to find himself entangled with a group of homeless, superpowered, teens. \u00a0The story follows him, and a few others, as they chisel out a world of their own and punch aliens in the face while doing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth of us would like to take a moment to thank you, the patrons, for supporting our work. \u00a0Your support means that we can more comfortably put longer hours into our work and provide more content for you to chew on. \u00a0We appreciate that you like our work enough to throw real cash money at us and \u00a0can\u0027t wait to share more with you!"
