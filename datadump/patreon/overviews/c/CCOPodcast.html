Thanks for checking us out! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome join \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=CCONation\u0026amp;src=typd\"\u003e#CCONation\u003c/a\u003e! We do all kinds interesting and unique takes on decks, analytics and we have many ways to be fun and entertaining. In the CCONation, all are welcome and equal. For this reason, none of our content is hidden behind paywalls. Also, all of our contests and giveaways are open to all for no monetary investment or pledging. Tune into the show for more details on how to be entered!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn CCOPodcast, you\u0027ll hear us talk about building spicy Commander brews, how to spice up boring lists, BBQ\u0027ing and drinking beer. If that\u0027s the kind of Magic the Gathering podcast that sounds appealing to you, look no further that CCOPodcast!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA little about us and the cast\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are Ryan and Brando from the beautiful city of\u00a0Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. We know, it\u0027s\u00a0a mouthful. You don\u0027t actually have to remember that part. Or be able to pronounce it! Collectively, we have somewhere around 40 years of Magic the Gathering playing experience! Now, we play commander almost exclusively.\u00a0That is, if\u00a0you don\u0027t count the MtG drinking games we make up along the way. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll hear about those on the cast!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started CCOPodcast for a few reasons. First and foremost, because we both love Magic the Gathering. It\u0027s entrenched itself in our lives. It\u0027s become part of who we are and created some of the strongest bonds\u00a0that people can have in their lives. It would be hard to imagine life without Magic, really, wouldn\u0027t it? Second, Brando works in radio and while he isn\u0027t currently a radio personality, that\u0027s one of his career goals. The podcast acts as an avenue towards that goal. Also, it certainly didn\u0027t hurt to have a radio stations recording equipment at our disposal!\u00a0Third, we were all sitting around a table drinking one night (imagine that! Us, hangin\u0027 out, drinking!) and a buddy suggested that we start a podcast. Not being in a sound state of mind and forgetting how busy he was already, Ryan agreed and that\u0027s how\u00a0he got roped in! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe asked around online to see if anyone was interested in picking us up. Luckily we found a host. We produced a pilot episode,\u00a0they liked it, and the rest is history!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Community\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAstoundingly to us, we now have what we call a world wide Audience! as mentioned before, that audience has come to be known and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=CCONation\u0026amp;src=typd\"\u003e#CCONation\u003c/a\u003e. The majority of our listenership resides in the USA and Canada but\u00a0 the top 10 countries in \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=CCONation\u0026amp;src=typd\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e#CCONation\u003c/a\u003e after that are Brazil, The United Kingdon, Australia, Philippines, Germany, Belgium, Italy, The Netherlands, Mexico and\u00a0France!\u00a0Holy crap, that\u0027s awesome! Shout out to all you guys and every other nation that tunes in every week!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat makes CCOPodcast Unique?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA couple things actually, for one, we\u0027re normal dudes. Dudes that you might want to actually hang out with. We talk about beer, food, our wives, hipsters and taking down the Scrap Booking Ladies on \u003ca href=\"https://www.podomatic.com/podcasts/commandercookout\"\u003ePodomatic.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t really hold back. If we don\u0027t like something, we\u0027ll tell you. If we don\u0027t like someone, we\u0027ll give them a big F-U. Mostly it\u0027s in good fun.... But sometimes we\u0027re serious!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe do arcs of episodes. A few episodes in a row on a common topic to get as much coverage as we can on the subject matter. Along with each new arc comes a contest/giveaway. Little fun stuff. You can enter for free too! Usually that involves a re-tweet or a share somewhere. Patrons are entered based on their reward tier as well. Just sayin\u0027.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, with the help of \u003ca href=\"https://edhrec.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEDHREC.com\u003c/a\u003e, we\u0027ve come up with both the Milk List and the Spice Calculator. The former is a list of every color combination in Magic. For each combination, we look at the most popular cards at each mana cost as per EDHREC. The less cards we play on the list, the more unique the deck. It\u0027s good simple fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Spice Calculator is as follows:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQGRTC1UQAAm39s.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s how we use science to figure out JUST how spicy our lists are. Check out our goals section for more info on that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
