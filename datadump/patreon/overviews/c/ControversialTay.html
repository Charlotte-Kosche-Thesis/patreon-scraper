In addition to that, I have an aptitude and strong passion to change our societies by protecting marginalized folks. Having funds will help me thrive rather than simply survive. I am very huge on marginalized folks not solely surviving, that\u0027s something we struggle doing all the time, we need more than that. For me personally, I am so willing to educate and speak, as well as do all of these taxing but necessary actions in order to spread awareness and create social change. However, regardless of me being willing, there is not much I can often do without funds.
