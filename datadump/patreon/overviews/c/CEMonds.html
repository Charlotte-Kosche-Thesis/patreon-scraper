Monds, a southern born creative merging the intrinsic cultural powers of visual arts and healing arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work to blend my education in both fine arts and traditional healing arts to produce work that is culturally aware and uplifting to the many intersecting identities I identify with. As a Black queer woman with Creole roots, I work to consistently make people like me more visible in the art world and in fine art exhibit spaces. Because our everyday experiences are often unseen by those not like us, I want to create the work that speaks to us specifically, that features us, and that comes from a familiar place of experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach person who has supported my work over the last decade, and those who are new to my work are helping to carve more space in the industry for stories like ours. With each new supporter and each new resource, the process of creating these works becomes more accessible and streamlined, so that we may create with abundance. I am grateful for each step forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt is cultural education. Art is healing. Art is activism. Art is storytelling.\u003cbr\u003eThese are how we have continued to survive and thrive.\u003cbr\u003e"
