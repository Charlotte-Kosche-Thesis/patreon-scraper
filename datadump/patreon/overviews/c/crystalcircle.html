    "summary": "Hey there! :D I\u0027m Janeil (Alex) and I\u0027m the writer and illustrator of the draconic webcomic series, Sister Sister: a Dragon\u0027s Tale! The comic was originally posted on Deviant Art way back in early 2012, but was put into a hiatus soon after ward. After years of re-working the story, art and pacing, the comic was re-born in 2014! Since then, it has become fairly popular and the support and feedback I\u0027ve gotten from it is OVERWHELMING! Seriously I can\u0027t thank my readers enough!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe webcomic updates every Saturday and occasinally Wednesdays!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support the comic on Patreon?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI trying my best to keep this comic pumping while going to school for mechanical engineering. Supporting the comic would serve as motivation (as I work better under pressure, heh). What, you think I\u0027m just going to ask for money to keep me motivated and that\u0027s it? NAH! As a huge thanks to all the supporters, you guys get access to all sorts of cool bonus comics, concept art, species info and MORE! Big supporters will even get cool merchandise like stickers, charms, buttons and posters!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo the comic is no longer free to read?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNO WAY! My comics are ALWAYS and will forever be free to read online! If you pay you get the bonus stuff. The comic itself will always be one click away!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow long is the comic? How long do I have to support it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have no clue :3 No seriously. I don\u0027t know the exact page count! All I know is that this is basically my child....I\u0027m going to be raising it for years! I\u0027m talking hundreds of pages for you to read and (hopefully) enjoy! As far as supporting it...as long as you like! I understand if you can\u0027t support it for it\u0027s life time. It\u0027s an adventure comic! You guys are coming along with it. No good adventure lasts a few days or weeks...or 100 pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this comic\u0027s rating? Is it family-friendly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rating is 17+ and it\u0027s not family-friendly! Well...unless you have kids that like giant flame-throwing reptiles that occasionally bite each other\u0027s heads off...I\u0027m serious. This is a comic with DRAGONS! It\u0027s violent, bloody (occasionally gory) and some pretty scary stuff happens as well. Some of you may have seen what comes out of the dark parts of my brain...not pretty or friendly! Read if you like, but if you are under 17 years old, be prepared...you have been warned.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurious?\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sistersister.thecomicseries.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHave a read yourself!\u003c/a\u003e Or look at some previews!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/6fb326a76efe0157d14d008e796f4a7b/tumblr_np5f0z2DFd1tkdgowo1_1280.png\" style=\"width: 332px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://sistersister.thecomicseries.com/images/comics/81/1a30d6395ee236089de5187ad5513b411947933713.png\" style=\"width: 333px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://41.media.tumblr.com/60038159b3892fb532e79f1fba2824d4/tumblr_ny6g2uHYEA1tkdgowo1_400.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://41.media.tumblr.com/8a7e17596b577b4bdf2214ce2fdf076c/tumblr_nj8fu4GFQx1tkdgowo1_400.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/fa2b1a47972d107e5dec19b93d4415d0/tumblr_nm7kx7NgPo1tkdgowo1_400.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
