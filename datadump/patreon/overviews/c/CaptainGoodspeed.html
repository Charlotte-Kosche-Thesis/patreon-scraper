It goes without saying that there are much more important things in life than my channel so if you are in any way short of money, then use the money you have to look after yourself and your family first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor those of you that don\u0027t know, I am a full-time Mathematics student at Newcastle University, so as you can imagine, money is quite tight with having to pay bills at home and traveling to uni every day, so, therefore, I can\u0027t spend as much as I would like to on improving the channel. I\u0027m not going to lie, I\u0027m certainly not struggling financially, but I don\u0027t have enough spare cash to invest in some of the things I would like to!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been absolutely blown away by the support you guys have given me over the last two years and I want to reward you by making the best content that I can! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny money donated will go towards improving the content on the channel and becoming a patron will give you special \"privileges\" in helping decide the direction the YouTube channel goes in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney Donated so far has contributed to me buying:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA Green Screen so that you don\u0027t have to see my room in the background to the videos and improve the professionalism of the videos.
