    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Chimene. I\u0027m a writer from London who currently lives in Brooklyn. I write about race, politics, gender, Islamophobia, and identity. There\u0027s certainly more than enough to say about all of that these days. I\u0027ve written for the Guardian, The Independent, The Quietus, International Business Times, Media Diversified, The Pool, The Debrief, to name a few. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExcitingly, I\u0027ll be editing The Good Immigrant USA (Little, Brown/Dialogue 2019), which will take on the same format as the award-winning best-seller The Good Immigrant (Unbound 2016), of which I was a contributing essayist! It\u0027s a project I\u0027m deeply proud of. Aside from people of colour being in charge of our own narratives finally, we aim to platform as many writers of colour that we possibly can. It\u0027s really important for me to support the community that\u0027s been supporting me for so long.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, I also started out on the London spoken word and poetry scene, and have a poetry collection called Outside Looking On (Influx, 2014) that was mentioned in a Guardian\u0027s Best Books of 2014 list.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little bit of other stuff about me includes knowing that I\u0027m a North London girl, hooped earrings and all. My family are Turkish Cypriot, which is something that also crops up in a lot of my work. I\u0027m mostly obsessed with UK Garage, totally obsessed with dogs, and plan to be Stevie Nicks when I grow up. I\u0027ve been collecting photos of Canary Wharf for a few years, which is hard to fully explain, other than seeing it makes me feel less lonely.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spend a lot of time educating or trying to change things for free. It\u0027s definitely worth it, but it can really take its toll when you remember how much free emotional labour women of colour are expected to do. Not to mention all the pretty gross harassment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you can help - talking for free and being freelance doesn\u0027t always give me the secure space I need to write about other things that matter globally, and personally. There are a lot of projects that I\u0027d love to share with you that I haven\u0027t sadly had the financial freedom to create in full.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI won\u0027t stop working on the social issues that matter, or trying to find balance to write on so much more, so if you enjoy my work and thoughts, you supporting this with whatever you can give would really go a long way for me. Thanks for stopping by.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
