I\u0027m a little odd and silly, cometimes...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve worked as a costume designer for more than ten years and, since 2011, I have a shop on etsy moderately successful.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI work on commission and therefore i often don\u0027t have time to \naccomplish everything I want, so I decided to open a Patreon so i could produce other items than those that my clients requests.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have drawers full of projects for weapons, armors, clothing, headgears and masks and I would be really happy to create them!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy\n satisfaction is in the realization of a project, not so much in being \nable to wear or show it off, and so I decided to try to make a project a \nmonth, based on how much you will want to help me, which is then given \nto one of the people who have supported me: a sort of giveaway.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ll be really glad if you want to help me accomplish my dream, any help would be really appreciated ... I \nstrongly believe that a lasting commitment in time in the end is all \nthat matters\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBelow you can see some of my old projects, realized for my customers!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is a complete armor for a \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: green;\"\u003eDiablo 3 Witch Doctor! \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy client wore it during \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: blue;\"\u003e 2015 Blizzcon\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, and I\u0027m so proud of it!
