To all our listeners (which includes\nsome who like us and a few who don\u0027t) current patrons and future patrons thank\nyou so much. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nShane rang me in December 2017 and asked me if\nI wanted to talk football with him.  I said sure mate, what did you want\nto talk about. When he explained that he wanted to talk football on a pod cast\nthat other people would listen too I was immediately sold.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe main reason being that I, like Shane love\nAFL football and just wanted to talk about it without being told what I could\nor could not say. Shane sold me the dream. No boss, no big brother to tell\nus what to say just two blokes who played a bit of footy have had some highs\nand some lows in the game, enjoy each other\u2019s company and want a space to talk\nfootball. When we started we had no idea what the show would look like or even\nif anyone would listen. Now we have a dedicated and loyal audience we really want to take you on a journey with us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAt Crawf \u0026amp; Hirdy we talk AFL football and\nwhatever else Crawf decides takes his fancy. Both of us love the game of AFL. A\ncombined 40 years in the game as players, coaches and commentators has given us\na unique perspective on what happens on the field and sometimes off it. Every\nMonday and Friday or Thursday Shane and James  will be joined by Ralphy\n(Ralph Horowitz)  to dissect, preview and chew over what is happening in\nthe game. Mondays will be a review of the weekend whilst Friday and Thursday will\nbe a preview show where Shane and James take you into the world of AFL match\ncommittee. We will assess the teams and attempt to give you all 9 winners for\nthe round. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEach week for our members we will be sending\nout a least one Blog per week, more in-depth tips and a video of Crawf \u0026amp;\nHirdy\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003eBIG\u003c/strong\u003e issue. Sometimes this will be big and others it\nwill just be something that Shane needs help with. And trust me he needs a lot\nof help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for becoming a part of our show we\nreally hope you enjoy it as much as we do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nShane Crawford, James Hird and Ralph - Ralphy-\n Horowitz\u003cbr\u003e"
