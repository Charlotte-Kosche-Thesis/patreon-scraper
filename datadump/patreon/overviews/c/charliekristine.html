    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eA bit about me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really just have a divine appreciation of life, a value of people, places and the world that surrounds us. Modeling has become a vehicle for me to get out there and just be with what I feel such a deep love and value for and to connect. I have bigger goals and want to make a difference in the world, Ive come to realize that there is just not enough hours in the day (could we clone me so I can work on more things at once)--- anyway, after falling ill a few years back and having such a wonderful community of people help nurture me back to health, set me up and get me back on track and on my way I\u00a0really feel like I want to be able to give them something back too, but that takes down time mixed in with my passion and hard work --- and in order to have down time to produce the kind of content and to reinvest what has been given to me I need a little more stability in my life--- I heard about this site and it seems like it might be just the fit AND also be the perfect place to come up with an outline and understanding of what it is that the world would like more of from me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love modeling and photography. This Crazy passion started with photography and a film camera with me and my dad walking around the ranch when I was little and snapping shots off of things like dew drops on spider webs, wagon wheels and shadows--- my imagination went\u00a0crazy and ever since has not slowed down--- Ive taken classes in photography, and have had the\u00a0privilege of working with many talented professionals and\u00a0beginners on both sides of the camera and screen--- I love this stuff--- it never grows old to me, I just want more of it and to share the same joy it has brought to me with others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am here to offer supportive insight and to help develop your direction, or just be a\u00a0positive source of joy and\u00a0inspiration to you and other\u00a0entrepreneurs and\u00a0artists, and show em, Hey, you can do this too! \u00a0--- \u00a0 I am open to hear new ideas and believe that possibility and  direction are quite limitless in anything that we wish to set our minds out to do- I want to make a difference.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreativity, fantasy, visions, exploration, accomplishments, growth, expression; I want to be, am proud to be, and value being part of all of this! :-)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your curiosity, interest, and for including me. I look forward to learning more about what I can do to help others be and deliver what they want to do. I think we are all here to make a positive\u00a0difference. Life and the people in it are such a gift.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarmest Regards,\u003cbr\u003eCharlie Kristine \u003c/strong\u003e"
