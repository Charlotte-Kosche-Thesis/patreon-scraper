    "summary": "I love trying to get down to the core of how to do something, or how something works. What exactly is going on inside that Rubik\u0027s cube that lets all of those blocks slide around without getting tangled? What really happens when I spend a Bitcoin? What makes solder stick to some surfaces and not others? Why does anything move if every force is met with an equal and opposite force?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re an engineer, technology fan, or just a curious human being, I hope you\u0027ll find my video explanations about technology helpful. I strive to make videos as thorough and as concise as possible. My formula typically involves hundreds of hours of research, interviews with experts, and many rounds of editing to distill complex topics down to intuitive and concise explanations. Time is everyone\u0027s most precious resource, so I always endeavor to follow the advice,\u00a0\"\u003ca href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Don%27t%20bore%20us%2C%20get%20to%20the%20chorus!\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDon\u0027t bore us, get to the chorus\u003c/a\u003e.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSadly, since I haven\u0027t won the lottery yet and earn far less than minimum wage from YouTube ads, I have to divide my time between video production and things that actually generate money. The more Patron support I get, the more videos I will be able to make. I will also strive to target topics that you--the Patron supporters--care about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Patreon:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a site where you can pledge to give me a dollar amount for every new video I produce. You can also become a Patron for free to give input on future videos. Regarding the goals on the side, they reflect total pledges, not individual ones. For example, if the combined total of all pledges reaches $100, I\u0027ll remove the ads from videos while they\u0027re new. One more note: you can always cancel your pledge if my videos don\u0027t live up to your expectations. Patreon also offers 100% refunds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLooking forward to hearing your suggestions for future videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHere are some comments from among the 5 million views received so far:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx9zgZCMqXE\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHow Bitcoin Works Under the Hood\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\"Thank you for the video, great simplified explanation of several very complex complex subjects involved in Bitcoin.
