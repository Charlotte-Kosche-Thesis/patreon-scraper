Of course, it\u0027s for the most trending news, articles and other miscellaneous tidbits for the horror game genre this side of the web! So about me and why I\u0027m here: playing games for a living, everyone and their mother wants a piece of it nowadays it seems. Yes, I love video games and I love playing them, but there\u0027s something I like doing even more than that: writing. Whether it\u0027s making an article, compiling a top 10 list or maybe even covering news about something up and coming I like* (*spoiler - games), I love, love,\u00a0\u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e writing. I\u0027ve been doing it recreationally ever since I knew how to hold a pencil. Not only is it an amazing creative outlet, it\u0027s something that has, and will continue to, help me connect with those around me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of Patreon and its members, I\u0027m hoping to be able to support myself financially enough to begin working in the writing world full-time, instead of just on the side. Not only will I be able to provide you all with more, better content, I might even manage to branch out and begin making a wider variety of things! From videos, to honing in on particularly popular titles to write about habitually, maybe even the odd let\u0027s play so you can see the process I go through (like screaming or crapping myself. Mostly screaming.) whenever I decide to make a list or write a review.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been told before that I have just the right mix of sarcastic humor and English know-how to make something of myself in the literary world should I try, so here I am! Whether or not I can manage to stick around is in the hands of you, the beloved Patreons. And... \u003cem\u003eme too I guess.\u003c/em\u003e Nah, what am I talking about, my content is \u003cstrong\u003egreat!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cdel\u003eBecome a patron now!\u003c/del\u003e :D \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
