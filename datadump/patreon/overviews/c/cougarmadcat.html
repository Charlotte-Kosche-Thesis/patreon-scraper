It seemed like something interesting to try out even though I knew I would not be making any big distribution to it at the start due to the roller-coaster of emotions that my life had been on at the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I am going on and trying to do my best with what I feel I can accomplish. What about what I can do? Well, my life has been comprised of art and animals as well as trying to help others to the best of my abilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current endeavors include drawing, 3D work using Daz Studio and other programs, mucking about toying with writing a book or two, and trying to tackle YouTube videos as it lies in a domain past my comfort zone and gives me the chance to help others as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am making videos to help others, to get their names out there so as to give people an idea of what they can do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo hang about if you like what you see. We can enjoy some chats and see what I come up with.\u003cbr\u003e"
