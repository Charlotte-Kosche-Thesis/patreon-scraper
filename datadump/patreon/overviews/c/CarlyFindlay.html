    "summary": "I\u0027ve been blogging for quite some time.\u00a0Almost seven years! And I am really proud of what I\u0027ve produced. There are some great resources on my blog for you - hundreds of posts about Ichthyosis (my skin condition), disability and appearance diversity that are really helpful. I know this because you tell me. You search for and share the posts, and you ask for advice about doctors and resilience, relationships and diet \u2013 and all things in between. I\u0027m so grateful. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eApart from the very occasional sponsored post, I don\u0027t get paid to write this blog. I spend a little money on the blog - online storage, apps, graphics and getting people to edit my posts when I\u0027m really busy. I come home from my day job to write because I love it. There\u0027s a lot of time involved in blogging - most posts take me up to five hours. I also manage social media and answer countless questions asking for advice about Ichthyosis and general disability issues. People ask me to help them with blogging and social media. My blogs are used as classroom, university and business resources. Sometimes I am asked to edit work or give interviews. These are GREAT OPPORTUNITIES but take time and expertise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I am asking you - my readers - to support me. If you\u00a0value my content or have used it to educate others,you can support me monthly on this Patreon account.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money you will donate will support my blogging - so I can continue bringing you quality, meaningful, useful and moving content. I will also spruce my online home up a bit. I can keep writing but outsource the stuff I\u0027m not good at. And it will allow me to attend blogging conferences and networking events \u2013 so I can continue to learn about new practices and expand my networks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you value my work, if it\u0027s been useful to you in any way, if it\u0027s made you laugh or cry, if you\u0027ve used it in the workplace or classroom and can spare a few dollars, you might consider supporting me to keep doing it. Think of it as buying me a drink. (It can be a cocktail, a wine, a hot chocolate or even a bottle of water!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can pledge whatever you can afford per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u2019t afford to pledge, please share this Patreon, tell people about my blog. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI so appreciate it.

I challenge people\u2019s thinking about what it\u2019s like to have a visibly different appearance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have written for many publications including The Guardian, SBS, Daily Life, The ABC, Mamamia, Frankie magazine and BlogHer. I have used my blog to write about my skin condition, Ichthyosis, as well as promoted causes such as Love Your Sister and Donate Life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost recently, I was named as one of Australia\u2019s most influential women in the Australian Financial Review and Westpac 100 Women of Influence Awards for 2014. I received the 2010 and 2013 Yooralla Media Awards for Best Online Commentary for my body of disability focused writing. I also won the best personal blog category for Kidspot Voices of 2013, and the 2013 BUPA Health Activist award for Positive Life Change. I have also been a finalist in the Best Australian Blogs competition in 2011, 2012 and 2014.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an accomplished speaker - I have spoken at the University of Western England\u0027s Appearance Matters conference, the Melbourne Writer\u0027s Festival, Layne Beachley\u0027s Women in Leadership Forum, Problogger, University of Melbourne, Royal Melbourne hospital and Cancer Council of Victoria (to name a few).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI organised Australia\u0027s first Ichthyosis meet in 2015 - bringing together 75 people affected by the rare, severe skin condition Ichthyosis. 25 attendees had Ichthyosis. Friendships and support networks were formed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013 I was discriminated against by a taxi driver because of my skin. I wrote about this on my blog, took the case to the Human Rights Commission and made a complaint to the taxi company and the Victorian Taxi commission. One of the outcomes I wanted following my complaints was for improved disability training for taxi drivers.

I am proud to have influenced the taxi industry and assisted passengers in this way. The video has since been disseminated to all Victorian taxi companies via the Victorian Taxi Commission too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
