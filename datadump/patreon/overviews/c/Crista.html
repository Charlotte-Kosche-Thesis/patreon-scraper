    "summary": "Twenty years ago I created my first website - an angelfire diary that I diligently updated and waited for moderated approval - that started my life as both a digital citizen and a Professional Oversharer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFive years after that I began to explore and work in sexuality online, learning who I was and how to love myself at the dawn of queer porn online. The following fifteen years have been a rollercoaster ride through different spheres of sexuality, different websites, different social media platforms.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, I\u0027m Crista Anne. Sex blogger, former outlaw dildo peddler, writer, educator, activist, feminist and Professional Oversharer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople search - sometimes their whole lives - for what makes them different or unique. What their gifts are. I was lucky enough to discover early on that I have the ability to speak honestly, bluntly and without shame about a wide range of topics that many find taboo. These common or near universal life experiences that have been deemed too private, aren\u0027t for me. The more that I shared online with my friends and readers, the more connections I made with people on a basic human level. That has made me passionate about the power of connecting \u0026amp; educating via shared experience. Talking about the messy, imperfect, taboo parts of being a person has incredible power.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn early 2015, I discovered just how much power when my #OrgasmQuest project went viral. For two months I had world wide media attention on my masturbation habits, reaching millions.\u00a0After a lifetime of being a highly orgasmic and sexually empowered woman battling mental illness, I found a medication that finally allowed me to enjoy being alive. While I loved this medication, the amazing effects it\u0027s had combating my lifelong depression and PTSD, I started experiencing anorgasmia as a side effect. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy universe creating orgasms were gone, and I refuse to accept that I have to give up pleasure in exchange for not wanting to kill myself the moment I wake up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSexual side effects are incredibly common, and I\u0027m proud to shine a light on a condition that affects so many people. There is extreme stigma regarding depression, sexuality and the side effects of various medications. Though my writing and tweeting, beautiful conversations have sprung up. I\u0027ve spoken to thousands of people who resonate with my mission. I did eventually regain some orgasmic ability, but I battle anorgasmia to this day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter Quest, my life changed dramatically, for better and worse. My Partner and I were soon engulfed in a vicious custody battle that ate up the next two years of our lives, every penny we had, plus a great deal of debt. I was advised to stop writing, which was a devastating change. However my community came around me and I kept myself busy working with The Woodhull Freedom Foundation, working in sex positive social media behind the scenes, and branching into writing about feminism - especially the endless harassment that so many face for daring to share their opinions online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, custody has been settled and I am free to return to writing as me, for me. Those two years changed me greatly. Who I am now is a stronger, mightier, even more passionate than before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I want to do now is continue sharing my life, but keeping the most personal bits here on this platform. After what I\u0027ve just been through, I feel more comfortable speaking here, to people I know support me, while I regain my footing. My website - CristaAnne.com - will continue to have fresh content relating to my many passions, but this space is where I want to explore who I am now and where I want to go next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, wonderful Patreons - Your support means the world to me, and to my family. We\u0027re a work in progress and a masterpiece all at once. With your help I can get back to the things I love to do, the missions I was born to do, and be the change I want to see in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
