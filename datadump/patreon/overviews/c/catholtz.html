I also do art in other mediums, including drawing, sculpture, interactive installations, fire eating, and performance art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere on Patreon I\u0027m opening a window into my daily art practice. I post images of my finished paintings, photos and videos of works in progress, and invitations to livestreaming events where you can watch me paint live. Much of this content is exclusive to Patreon. I\u0027ll also share documentation of my works in other mediums, as well as invitations to my future shows and performances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo pursue art has been my dream for many years, and although my practice has been somewhat limited recently due to poor health, slowly, with hard work, I\u0027m seeing my dream become a reality. My art has begun to pay my bills, and I\u0027ve been able to take on private commissions to help make ends meet, and as of this year I\u0027ve begun showing my work in local spaces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNothing would make me happier than to be able to continue to work towards my lifelong dream of being able to support myself through my work. And in spite of many setbacks, trials and travails, I somehow find myself on track to be able to do just that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m grateful for all the kindness, generosity, and good luck that\u0027s gotten me this far. I\u0027m especially grateful for each person who pledges here to become my Patreon patron. Having a small monthly income through my Patreon keeps me going in a very practical way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, all of you, for helping me take another step closer to my goal. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2665 Cat\u003cbr\u003e"
