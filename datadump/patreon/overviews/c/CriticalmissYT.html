    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eGreetings, Adventurers!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re using this space as a Q\u0026amp;A to explain why we\u0027re on Patreon and help you decide whether you\u0027d like to support us. We\u0027ll start with basic questions and work our way up, and you can stop reading when you\u0027re convinced one way or another. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore we get into all that however; whether you\u0027re here to become a Patreon or just wondering why we have a page at all, thankyou! We\u0027re beyond happy that you might find us worthy of your time, money and Freddos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Why are we on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eFor the same reason as many content creators, really. We love what we do and we hope that you love it too! Any funds we earn through this platform will go directly into growing the community we have built around our content with Discord and Twitter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What about YouTube\u2019s AdSense?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eWe don\u2019t make anything through monetising our videos. Even before the \u201cAdPocolypse\u201d our channel wasn\u2019t suitable for family-friendly advertisements and now that there\u2019s a barrier for entry into their service we\u2019re no longer eligible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven when we do become eligible for the service, we won\u2019t be using it if we\u2019re being funded more than we\u2019d be making without services like Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What justifies support from viewers?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eBefore we had our advertising rights stripped away from us we had the chance to get a sneaky peek at what we would be making on the average video and it honestly just isn\u2019t worth it at all for such a small channel. We try our best to giveaway games once a week during streams to active members of our Discord server, and that requires buying the games. We work with props during skits, and that requires buying the props. We sometimes break something that we use to create content, and that requires buying new parts or repairs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re funding this channel out of our pockets currently, but as we plan to expand what kind of content we create, we\u2019ll be expanding the kind of money we can expect to spend on it - and it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019ll be able to do everything we have planned without dipping into rent and bill money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s where you come in. A single person donating $1 a month is enough to completely eliminate any financial concerns that we have currently. Completely. Eliminate it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Completely?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eCompletely. Let us hit you with some info; Before we became unable to monetise our videos we checked the stats and it showed - under \u201clifetime\u201d - that we had made $0.81 through AdSense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA single person donating helps us more than YouTube has in the entire time we\u2019ve been using the platform.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What do I receive for my contribution?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eGoodies, depending on what you call good. A special Role on our Discord server, behind the scenes videos, Guildmaster discussion podcasts about where to go with the channel, and a say in what happens before anyone else even knows we\u2019re planning it. Automatic entry into competitions and the satisfaction of knowing that without your support, the giveaways probably couldn\u2019t happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: So; how much do you NEED?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eWe understand you might be thinking $1 doesn\u2019t sound like much, or that you can\u2019t spring for any more than that. Stop that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can\u2019t stress enough that we don\u2019t want you to give us money so that we can have money. If you aren\u2019t pledging because you genuinely enjoy our content and want to see us tackle bigger and better projects, don\u2019t worry. We aren\u2019t going to push you to part with your cash and we won\u2019t hold it against you if you decide not to pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll notice that the \"Rewards\" section is all bundled together in one package. Whether you\u0027re willing to donate $1 or $1,000,000 - everyone gets the same bonuses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How will Patreon funds be allocated?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eAll funds received through this service will go towards:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eJack\u2019s monthly Humble Bundle for giveaway prizes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eProps, footage, assets or anything we need to complete a project or series.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSoftware and Hardware upgrades if and when they\u2019re required.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Why are you so obsessed with Cillit Bang, Barry Scott and Freddos?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s far too personal and we refuse to answer it."
