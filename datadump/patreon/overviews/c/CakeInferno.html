    "summary": "Well it turns out you\u0027re at that part of Patreon again! But no worries mate, it\u0027s okay! ;-;\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nElaborate 3D animations of the nommy kind aren\u0027t exactly a regular thing, especially when they\u0027re so specific that they can only be enjoyed by a small internet subculture. It would likely take someone who\u0027s completely out of their mind to devote so much valuable time and experience into a hobby like this, right? As someone who\u0027s perfectly self aware even I have to agree there! The amount of work going into these films is hardly describable, there\u0027s so much to it that it\u0027s simply not maintainable as a hobby. Well, unless there\u0027s actually a way of getting some kind of compensation for it. And that\u0027s where Patreon hopefully comes in!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://cake.macrophile.com/HDimages/jungle_house_small.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you support this nomsense?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe most direct answer I can give is: to ensure there will be future animations of this kind. Furthermore I\u0027d like to keep these animations as free as America! If I keep on going like this however, I\u0027ll probably disease somewhere along the way. It\u0027s likely that I forgot that I also have bills to pay, and so far creating these animations has only raised them significantly. Needless to say that if you aim for ultra graphics settings in your animations, your energy bill will turn out just as ultra!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your support I\u0027d be able to give you animations in a more frequent manner than once or twice a year. Not only would you get more animations, as the support would furthermore allow for purchasing better software/hardware to produce them at an even higher, even more unnecessary quality! Patreons who are supportive will receive WIPs of recent projects, furthermore I\u0027ve planned to offer insights to my work with future VFX breakdowns. Supporters will also get access to future videos a little earlier, additionally they\u0027ll come at higher quality formats, including 4K resolution. Here\u0027s hoping the later doesn\u0027t just sound appealing to me alone, because I\u0027m a nerd. D:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith more significant support (as surprising as it would be!) I\u0027ll be able to put more focus into this and release content more frequently. The fastest without sacrificing quality would likely be a 2 - 4 months cycle of new animations being posted here. This is however a goal that would require some decent support and is likely something for a distant future.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://d.facdn.net/art/cakeinferno/1491431530/1491431419.cakeinferno_zoe_wallpaper_1080p.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQuality content\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHaving more than 10 years of experience with various 3D programs I\u0027m able to produce CGI content of sophisticated quality. Apart from character animation I also put a lot of care into environment modelling, texturing, shading, lighting, and rendering. By supporting this page you\u0027ll help me to keep and improve the visual fidelity of the content I\u0027m producing. More support will translate to better hard and software, which will directly translate to better visuals. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027d certainly love doing non-fetishy animations at some point later on, but let\u0027s be realistic, patrons will throw money at my face to see characters eating each other, not to have me creating a low cost version of Zootopia. Keep in mind that regardless of this page being marked NSFW, there won\u0027t be any naughty bits to see here. A general rule would be that if something wouldn\u0027t happen in a Don Bluth cartoon, it wouldn\u0027t happen here either. Vore itself still remains weird and will likely make people who aren\u0027t into this uncomforable, that\u0027s why this page remains NSFW.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRegardless of that, a lot of people told me this page doesn\u0027t have to be marked NSFW. This theory can always be tested, which is why I encourage them to go to their workplace and put one of my videos on the most exposed screen there. I\u0027m sure it would make for some interesting reactions! \u0026lt;:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://cake.macrophile.com/HDimages/stomach.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrequently Asked Questions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Will my pledge only give me download access to the next animation, or your whole library?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Once a pledge is processed you\u0027ll be given download access to all animations I produced. Quality of the downloads range from 1080p bluray quality equivalent ($10 tier), to 4k quality ($15 tier) in the newer animations. Every few months I\u0027ll bump up an updated quick video access list that has the download links for all the animations in their various quality versions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Aren\u0027t your animations freely accessible anyways?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: There\u0027s usually a free version of the animations I post, yes! This Patreon was first intended as a small tip jar to at least dampen the high production costs of these animations, by now the support has grown so significant that it actually compensates both running costs and labor, allowing me to release animations in a timeframe from 2 - 4 months, rather than finalizing an animation every 2 years like it used to be. \u003cbr\u003ePatrons do of course get a couple of bonuses, such as many work in progress previews during production. The higher tiers additionally get early access to the films I do, including nearly lossless 1080p and 4k versions, all up to 60FPS.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: I\u0027ve pledged $10/$15 for one month, but had to pull back my pledge. Will I still get early access to the next animation?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Yes! If your pledge was processed during production then you\u0027re put on a list. Once the animation is released on Patreon I\u0027ll PM the links to every person whose pledge processed throughout the previous 2 - 4 months it took to complete the new animation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What if an animation actually takes longer to produce than 4 months?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: So far I\u0027ve only been close to this. However, should this actually happen, or should an animation that was previously advertised for release in a certain month getting delayed to another, then I\u0027ll freeze payments and make the additional time free for all patrons. \u003cbr\u003eNote that I\u0027m working solo, which is highly difficult if you do CG film production at any elaborate level, this means that I often need to heave tasks that are commonly managed by a small team of people. Delays are sometimes hard to foresee, but I\u0027m always doing my best to minimize them. Should any patron be completely dissatisfied though, they can always message me and ask for a refund.\u003cbr\u003e"
