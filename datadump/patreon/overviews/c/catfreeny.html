My name is Cat Freeny, and I\u0027m a comic artist currently working on \u003cem\u003eHeirs to the Mountain\u003c/em\u003e, an epic romantic adventure story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat brought me here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I was in the eighth grade, I had this story in my head about a pair of twin sisters rescuing their country from a dark time. I would always play the story like a movie in my head if I was bored in class, and as the years went on, my story and the characters evolved. I only did this for fun.. I never thought I could actually make money and possibly a career doing this! So I\u0027m stepping (WAY) outside of my comfort zone, and I\u0027m just hoping to bring them to life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Heirs to the Mountain?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story follows Robin and Raven Telviv, twin sisters who are born into their country\u0027s noble family. They have lived in secret and on the run, in a time where their country is fractured and corrupt. Robin and Raven must realize who they are, and uproot the current regime. While they journey their homeland, they will grow as people and leaders, and discover who they want to be to the men in their lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eHow can you help?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I love drawing and making storylines, it doesn\u0027t pay the bills by itself. By becoming a patron, you help me not only with monthly living/work expenses, but you also get an epic adventure I\u0027ve held in my heart for a long time. As I invest my time and tears (haha) into this, I hope you will come to love and be invested in this story as well! My first issue release will be sometime in 2018, so keep your eyes open until then! Thank you so very much!\u003cbr\u003e"
