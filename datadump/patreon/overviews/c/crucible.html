    "summary": "My mission is to find an escape route for everyone to exodus Facebook. The elysian summerlands will be decentralized, fully distributed in computer memory storage and political-conceptual space, and it will be like Google Drive without Google Drive plus free computers. My art is to create an easy-to-use packet of the most advanced liberating computer technologies. This is harder than it sounds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy art is designing \"introspective interfaces\", which are a new genre of ambient game which help you to contemplate and reflect. For the last ten years, I have been researching the psychology of self-actualization and the ways that screens affect us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s time to put this research into action by creating\u00a0a movement which can trigger epiphanies, encourage poetic language use, and help us to relax.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I need your help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, no accessible, decentralized, well-funded public art platform exists. Emerging technologies are making it possible for anyone to create art that is loved by many. These new markets allow an effervescing of political systems into new concoctions, making political systems into colognes, fragrances which can be branded and sold on the market. This will allow new regimes of artistic governance to coalesce, out of a global monoculture (or NWO).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese new software platforms do not yet fully exist, or, if they could be pieced together with existing technology, this technology is not widely known or accessible. By making these futures more easy to access, all of the best updates can be had by all. Click.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe software of the future will implement a floodgate referral network, but I\u0027ve emulated it here in Patreon\u0027s payment structure:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$30/month - weekly phone calls, planning meetings, ultimate secret initiations immediately (USII package).\u003cbr\u003e$20/month - monthly phone calls and planning meetings\u003cbr\u003e$15/month - official student of the Internet School of Magic\u003cbr\u003e$10/month - as-needed consultations\u003cbr\u003e$5/month - free access to future apps and other published goods\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you sign up with someone else, you get the level above (it stacks for trios or groups!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eApp features\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/k0VZSt5.jpg\" style=\"width: 224px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eAt right, you can see a screenshot of a prototype that I made in Processing. This prototype showed that the core \"gameplay\" mechanic was fun, intriguing, and contemplative. Here are the basic features of the final interface:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEnter words and phrases to contemplate\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eConnections grow between words as you play with them on the screen\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFlick words off the screen to send them to memory\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSearch to recall words from memory, or scroll through history\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eClick the \"Insight\" button (not pictured) to generate a never-before-seen combination of your own words, based on their connections (will trigger epiphanies)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTune the color of words by drawing circles around them\u2014categorize your words any way you like\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEasy export features so your words aren\u0027t locked-in (later versions will sync with a decentralized cloud)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNative Android application with elegant interface and OS integration (much prettier than the prototype screenshot at right)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIt may seem simple, but there is nothing out there like this! The algorithms under the hood which combine your own words in novel ways are partially based upon the connectionism of your own brain.
