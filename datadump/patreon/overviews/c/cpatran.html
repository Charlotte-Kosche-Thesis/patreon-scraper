    "summary": "Coleman Patrick Ranahan is an idiot. (Hi, that\u0027s me). He struggles between the first and third person on ... oh who gives a shit. Actually, I\u0027m a filmmaker and writer. I went to film school at Columbia College Chicago (graduated - 2012). I\u0027ve made one feature film called Lost Signals that you can rent or download\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://t.co/SbsUmCoy1X\"\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e And at one time I was the layout editor, opinion columnist, and writer for the Kishwaukee College Kaleidoscope between 2008-2009. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook, I\u0027m doing something I\u0027ve been thinking about doing for awhile, that\u0027s writing humor columns, or more specifically (pretentiously) - opinion columns with a humorous twist. If you\u0027ve ever followed the likes of Rex Huppke from the Chicago Tribune, or Alexandra Petri from the Washington Post, that\u0027s what you\u0027re getting into.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s the deal? (He asked in the most offensive Seinfeld voice he could muster) I was originally trying to write for my hometown newspaper, but they don\u0027t seem to acknowledge that I exist (other than the profile they did on me for launching my first feature film), so I want to do what I pitched to them, except now to the entire world. Each month, I will create at least two columns, 500-700 words, on any one subject. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat subjects you ask?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e1) Me.\u003cbr\u003e2) Politics from the hometown perspective of a bleeding heart liberal (get the pitchforks ready - I\u0027m from a conservative town) who constantly wants tacos.\u003cbr\u003e3) That episode of Parks and Rec where Andy cries.\u003cbr\u003e4) How many times I\u0027ve repeatedly stubbed my toe walking into the bathroom before turning the light on.\u003cbr\u003e5) What it\u0027s like to discover I\u0027m a heartless robot\u003cbr\u003e6) How quickly I get angry when the guy behind me at the post office won\u0027t stop saying \"Because, Josh...\"\u003cbr\u003e7) Accidentally murdering said guy named Josh. (Legal defense ya know? - Legal note: Purely kidding)\u003cbr\u003e8) Why my hometown of Rochelle, IL should just consider installing palm trees where the real trees go.\u003cbr\u003e9) Something something Brie Larson.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe list goes on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, to do this, incurs costs. I would rather start from a clean website, instead of my personal tumblr account. This means buying the website, and I\u0027ve been looking at Squarespace, which means a monthly cost to maintain said website.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, again - two columns - twice a month - 500-700 words - any subject. If I start to exceed a certain goal, I will gladly start to up the columns to three or more, maybe weekly. Patrons can expect the column a day early, access to the column before everyone else. There may be other rewards as I think of them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpread the word, retweet, spread the link on Facebook, and hopefully I\u0027ll be able to bring you something mindful, funny, stupid, or thought provoking. Mostly stupid though. I mean, have you seen me? I\u0027ve been described as a walking cartoon character. My soul is dead."
