And I can do something about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eColoring Fantasy\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is part self-publishing business and part media representation campaign. All of my stories feature characters who are minorities. People of color, of different sexualities, disabilities, illnesses, anywhere on the gender spectrum (though women are definitely in the spotlight).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a Filipino-American woman with a writing degree, halfway through an acting program. I am very, very close to media of all formats and sorts, but prose fiction is my first love. I have never been satisfied with the lack of people who looked like me or the people I knew. And while there is a slow upturn in the number of minority characters in fiction and media, people still have to hunt to find good representation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA free sample of my work can be viewed here:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/3443352\"\u003eBeat Grid\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0It is not available for purchase, as it is the first part of a novel chapter, and also not strictly speaking a fantasy. (The situation is explained on the page.) \u00a0However, it is the largest example of my work which I am comfortable putting on the Internet for no charge, and also an accurate representation of my writing style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why am I doing this now?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI moved to a new city in January for two reasons. One was to study. The other was to escape abuse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be completely honest,\u00a0I\u0027m broke. I mean, \u003cstrong\u003ereally broke.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Not that I expected to be rolling in money--I mean, my childhood dream was writing and I\u0027ve now added acting onto that! I would have to be an idiot to expect financial stability. But I have even less financial stability than expected, after going through five jobs of varying terribleness, and my savings are nearly depleted.\u00a0So, I\u0027ve turned to self-publishing to dig myself out from the pile of bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI charge by completed short story.

Even in San Francisco, there are people who believe all punks look like Sid Vicious. Craigslist won\u0027t cut it, and Gilman is a gripe, so Doug\u0027s only option is an epic quest all around California to find other punks of color.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeath, Our Close Friend: \u003c/strong\u003eFantasy.
