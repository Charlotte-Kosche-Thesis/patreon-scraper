While I am still \u003ca href=\"http://eepurl.com/bgqPW1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003econtinuing to sell my work\u003c/a\u003e; I\u2019ve decided to stop taking commissions in order to launch this Patreon page. I\u0027m passionate about sharing my knowledge and teaching skills of this traditional craft. I want to focus on breathing life into old forgotten stories, along with some new ones that have never been told! Through Patreon I hope to delve deeper into the history, myths, and epic narratives surrounding the symbol of the sword, in order to find inspiration for new projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4611/39619939884_c8139c992e_h.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page gives me the opportunity to connect with the amazing people who have enjoyed my work for years!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you receive as a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to tons of behind-the-scenes glimpses of my work as it comes to life\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTraining and real-time interaction with me through live-video while I work and teach\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGive collaborative insight on how you think I should design and craft my swords, knives, and original art\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as many other cool things to come as this community grows!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a creative person who thrives on interaction and feedback of ideas, so this is a chance for me to invite folks to truly be a part of Cedarlore Forge.
