    "summary": "It\u0027s been called the 3 legged dog of comics, and the scrappy, street-fighting cousin of Marvel and DC and even hailed as the comic book equivalent of Roger Corman and American International Pictures. Maybe you\u0027ve heard of it? ...probably not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, you do know the industry legends that called it home. This is Charlton Comics.\u003cbr\u003eCharlton employed guys like Steve Ditko and Dick Giordano. Ditko went on to co-create Spider-Man. Giordano, a Charlton editor, became a legend as an executive at DC comics. But that\u0027s just a taste of the list. A few other names you know are: Denny O\u2019Neil, Bob Layton, Paul Kupperberg, Joe Sinnott, Roy Thomas, Frank McLaughlin, John Byrne and even Neal Adams. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s just scratching the surface.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow their characters are a different entity of their own. \u201cThe Watchmen,\u201d a critically acclaimed and hugely influential comic that was adopted into a movie in 2009, was based on Charlton Comics characters. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_620/v1444068342/u783jl0hha1tohst7vdz.jpg\" style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42); text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Charlton?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA year ago, we might have asked the same thing!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe knew of Charlton, but honestly, not much. Then we attended a panel about Charlton Comics, and we couldn\u0027t believe that someone hadn\u0027t told their story. You see, their tale doesn\u0027t begin and end with the legends that worked there, or even the characters that went on superstar... err...superhero status.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe captivating story of Charlton starts with a prologue, and that\u0027s the story of one of its co-founders, John Santangelo. We can\u0027t give you spoilers, but in the age of TMZ and tabloids, Charlton fits right in. It\u0027s positively scandalous! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_620/v1443998842/v7ta88mgqfbgb0out44z.jpg\" style=\"color: rgb(42, 42, 42); text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the truth about your role in helping to make this movie:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour contribution to this project is vital.
