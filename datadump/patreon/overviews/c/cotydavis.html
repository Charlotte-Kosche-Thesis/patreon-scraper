The songs showcased are original songs written and performed by either myself or the guest song writer/poster. Accompanying the songs is a blog post that gives insight into the observations or beliefs that influenced or inspired the song. I have begun making videos for the songs in order to establish a presence on youtube while giving the listeners added value. Currently these videos are primarily still shots or stock footage videos, however, I am currently working on getting some actual video work done for upcoming projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy music is free to download from the website. The support gained from Patreon will be used to hire musicians, video crew, editors, etc. The more patrons interested, the more songs I can record and projects I can pursue.

For example, if you want to give $5 a project but no more than $10 a month, if I release three patron charged projects that month you will be charged for the first two and not the third.
