     "about": "Koyoteelaughter was born on a small little farm in the Ozark Mountains of Southern Missouri to a family of 13. From a real young age, all he ever wanted to be was an artist. His brother was an artist. His sister was an artist. He just knew down deep in his bones that some day, he\u0027d be a world famous artist. Koyoteelaughter, as it turned out, was delusional.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSure, he tried to become that artist he always wanted to be. He drew and sketched and inked and painted pictures every day. For a time there shortly after high school, he reached a point where people actually paid for his art work. He made a few hundred dollars off of that, but in the end, working at the local Oyster Bar ended up paying more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDistraught and destitute, Koyoteelaughter finally admitted to himself what everyone else already knew. Working in an Oyster Bar is nasty work, so like Jed Clampett of the Beverly Hillbillies, he packed up his Nissan and moved back to Missouri where once again he was the poor son of a poor farmer, only now, he lived in a place where fine art was a logo on a speeding ticket. He couldn\u0027t cope. No. He could not live like this. So, he decided to switch mediums and try has hand at different form of art. The art of writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike a squid trying to figure out how to open a corked bottle, Koyoteelaughter three himself into this new field of expression. With no formal training, he had no choice but to make it up as he went. He didn\u0027t know what a verb was or an adjective. Back then, a dangling participle just sounded like a perversity, and an oxymoron was some you called a thick-headed idiot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut over time, he learned the way of the word. He learned to what a verb was and an adjective. He learned how to write mediocre dialogue, but the thing he learned most, was how to craft a character. At least, that\u0027s what he believes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe\u0027d always wanted to write a novel. Even back when he was trying his hand at drawing, he wanted to tell a story, but not just any story. He wanted to tell the story of his people, of the tragic tale that was his life. Isn\u0027t that the dream of every writer? Sadly, he couldn\u0027t find his voice, and he couldn\u0027t figure out how to finish a novel once he started it. It took him hundreds of tries, and in the end, success only came to him after he struck a deal with another artist to trade a fairy tale he wrote for a painting a woman he liked agreed to do in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwenty-eight days later, a full length novel was completed complete with fairies, children, magic, and sword fights. It was funny, it was dark, but most astounding, it was done. He was so\u00a0happy, he tried getting everyone he knew to read it, but only a few would. He didn\u0027t let that deter him though. Caught up in the excitement of his success, he wrote a second installment to the first. It was just as dark and bitter sweet like cheap American chocolate. Those who read the first read the sequel and loved it, but he couldn\u0027t stop at just two. He needed to finish the tale. He needed to finish the trilogy, and so he wrote a conclusion in which everyone dies. It was awesome, but nobody read that one. He wouldn\u0027t let them. He kept that book all to himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHigh on his success, Koyoteelaughter decided to try writing in a different genre, one he was unfamiliar with. That genre was Sci-Fi. He\u0027d never read science fiction before. He had nothing to base his stories on, so he did the one thing people just didn\u0027t do anymore. He made it all up based on word prompt taken from Reddit.com. He called that story Croatoan, Earth, and surprisingly discovered a fan base who enjoyed his take on the genre. Two years later, he created this page so that the people who loved his tale and characters could donate to help keep the story alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s how I figured out that Clark Kent was Superman!\u003cbr\u003e",
