Sometimes life draws us away from the things we love and means we don\u0027t always have the time to plan for our games as much as we\u0027d like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Solution\u003c/h2\u003eThis project is aimed at giving you everything you need for a game session in one package, including tips and information aimed specifically at cutting down the overall pre-game planning time. Each adventure will be in three Tiers, a quick 20-30 minute Scenario, an Adventure that builds off the Scenario (for up to 2 hours of gaming), and an Expansion of the Adventure (for 4+ hours of gaming). The higher tiers get access to the lower tier content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMy Background\u003c/h2\u003eI\u0027ve been playing Dungeons and Dragons and various other tabletop RPGs since 1981. Living in Wisconsin at that time meant we had an abundance of options with TSR being only an hour away and GenCon being first in Kenosha, and then in Milwaukee where I live. This means that I\u0027ve got decades of experience behind me, half of which is as a DM. I\u0027ve run games at conventions, run home games for years with homebrew campaigns, and even been paid to run regular games at local stores. Now, I\u0027m packing up all that experience and producing adventures to share with everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThank You!\u003c/h2\u003eI\u00a0hope you\u0027ll join me on the path to adventure and journey through all the newfound worlds and stories that we\u0027ll discover together. I also hope the adventures help your games go smoother and that you and your players all have great experiences, TPK or not!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eProject Ideals\u003c/h2\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eTiers \u003c/strong\u003elead into each other for a continuous storyline.\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eTiers \u003c/strong\u003ewill offer content for at least as long as stated (30min, 2hrs, 4hrs)\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eSections \u003c/strong\u003ewill have at least one map.\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ePivot Points\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0- Main party decisions have DM tips, what I call Pivot Points, where the story might fork or run in several directions. These outlines help in planning.\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eRandos \u003c/strong\u003e- Pre-generated random encounters as needed.\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eNPCs\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003estats and quick descriptions will be supplied\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eInclusion \u003c/strong\u003e- Everyone, regardless of experience or skill level is welcome. Be kind to each other in the comments. No racism, hate, or vulgarity please. All questions of play, rules, etc are welcome.\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eAccessibility \u003c/strong\u003e- I am also looking into ways to be more inclusive in the content. That means perhaps braille or audio versions of the texts, etc. I am also looking into ways to give tips and tricks on making the game more accessible for all gamers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther Outlets\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also pursue ways to publish the modules on DM\u0027s Guild or Drive-thru RPG. They will be more expensive and be released no less than 3 months after being released to my Patrons here. I expect the PDF versions to sell for around $7-10 there which is higher than any of the digital tiers. They will not receive any of the bonuses, etc. Just the modules will be packaged up and sold there as a secondary income stream.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
