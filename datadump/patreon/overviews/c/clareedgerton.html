I\u0027ve been training the last decade or more to tell stories with my voice and body, and now I\u0027m re-focusing my attention to tell stories on the page (or rather, screen, to be much more honest about our 21st century media consumption habits).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also date. A lot. I have been on more first dates in the last year than anyone else I\u0027ve ever met - with one notable exception, Steve Dean, check out and support his patreon page at \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/stevenmdean).\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/stevenmdean\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese dating adventures and my proclivity for storytelling are combining in my latest venture: writing a book. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe working title of this book about dating, sex, travel, love, and a journey toward self-acceptance is tentatively titled:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCrossing the (Date) Line: Swiping Right for Adventure\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eor\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Curious Girl\u0027s Guide to Sexual Adventure\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am asking for your help in supporting the translation of experience into content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal for this book is to combine creative non-fiction essays, poetry, and screenshots (think tinder nightmares), to create what I have affectionately been calling\u003cstrong\u003e \"Eat Pray Love for Sluts\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything you can pledge will help me secure space to write outside of my apartment (allowing me to work in an engaging and focused environment, i.e. \u003ca href=\"https://www.impacthub.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eImpact Hub\u003c/a\u003e), spend more time writing and editing, and research some of the claims I intend to make about dating, sex, promiscuity, and body positivity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, this is my memoir, but it is also a story for all of you, and particularly for the women in my life. We have a plethora of wonderful memoirs available to us, telling stories of women who travelled, ate, fucked, and then found \"the one.\" While I do not dismiss their experiences in any way, I want to write the story of the woman whose promiscuity led not to finding a partner, but to finding herself; to finding myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can help by donating any amount, big or small, to help me tell this story. Meanwhile, I will send you little treats along the way. I decided to use Patreon rather than Kickstarter, because I am generating material constantly, and this book is going to be a process to create, I want to share that process with you along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease give whatever you feel you might be able to give, and whatever you think my stories might be worth. Even $1 a month would be greatly appreciated."
