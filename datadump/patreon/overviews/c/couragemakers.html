While you\u0027re here, I\u0027d love to tell you a story, and why I\u0027m launching a Patreon page.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e***\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eOnce upon a time there was a woman who liked lots of colours, laughing until her belly hurt and the feeling when you\u2019re on fire and feel like you can do anything. She struggled to fit into the world. She had big dreams, wanted to make a difference and leave the world a brighter place than she found it.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eShe felt like she was always swimming against the tide, but deep down she felt there must be people out there like her. Kindred spirits, fellow dreamers. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCouragemakers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\nAlong the route of trying to find her place in the world, this woman ended up completely miserable in a job that should have been her dream job. Although things looked great on the outside, on the inside she was \u003cstrong\u003emiserable, exhausted and disillusioned\u003c/strong\u003e. She felt like the shell of the person she once was. There had to be more to life, she was sure. She realised something needed to change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eOne day, sick of hearing the same stories and an aching to hear stories of courage and possibility, she had an idea: What if she sought to create the very thing she craved? What if she could speak to women all of the world, about their stories, their struggles and their dreams? \u003cstrong\u003eWhat if she could create a movement of unconventional women, owning, living and sharing their stories?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eAnd what if she shared these conversations, to encourage and rebel rouse fellow couragemakers? What if it could help couragemakers know they\u2019re not alone, remind them that no one has their shit together and be a place of hope in a world of dreamshitters?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eAfter a year of being scared of the microphone, and a shitload of small moments, choosing courage over fear, on 28th February 2016\u00a0The Couragemakers Podcast was born.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eAnd courage spread like wildfire. \u003cstrong\u003eOver 80 episodes and 150,000 downloads later,\u003c/strong\u003e Couragemakers had grown bigger than she ever dreamed. There was a world full of interesting people, a lifetime of intimate conversations to be had and thousands of women whose courage was growing by the day through listening to the stories. \u003cstrong\u003eAnd the community behind the podcast? Wow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eBut she knew the day might come when she would need to make the whole set up a bit more sustainable. And she had another dream. \u003cstrong\u003eA dream that feels scary to say out loud.\u003c/strong\u003e A dream of creating a movement; a supportive community where likeminded people could find each other. A dream of growing bigger and more impactful.

When I first launched Couragemakers in February 2016, it was a bit of an experimental passion project alongside\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thathummingbirdlife.com\"\u003eThat Hummingbird Life\u003c/a\u003e. But since recording that very first episode, I thought \u003cem\u003eHoly Shit! \u003c/em\u003eI think I\u2019m onto something here. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy plan at the beginning was to see if it resonated with people, and it\u2019s clear that it has. From the \n\u003cstrong\u003elovely heartfelt emails \u003c/strong\u003eI receive every week, to the \u003cstrong\u003ewonderful guests\u003c/strong\u003e on the show, and Couragemaker\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003eregular place on the iTunes charts,\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0it\u2019s clear that Couragemakers is \u003cem\u003every\u003c/em\u003e much needed in the world. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow 2 years down the line, it\u2019s time to start thinking about things a bit more strategically. I have no plans of stopping Couragemakers - I plan to continue to produce the podcast for many, many years to come, and make it even bigger and even better - but something needs to change.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause when I say producing the podcast, I mean, \n\u003cem\u003eproducing\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eNot many people know how much work it takes to create and sustain a podcast, so I want to give you a bit of an insight.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile Couragemakers is a joy to produce, a LOT goes into it.\n\u003cstrong\u003e It\u2019s very much a one-woman band. \u003c/strong\u003eFrom the many hours per week of reaching out to future guests, scheduling interviews and replying to enquiries to the interview preparation, the recording, the (tedious) process of editing, publishing, writing show notes and the promotion. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is a LOT of work\n\u003c/strong\u003e. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\nAnd it no longer feels sustainable as it is right now, time -wise, financially and life-wise. \n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003ePeople always assume that successful podcasts by definition comes with a sizeable income.

I don\u0027t want to sacrifice the content. While I know many other podcasts go down this route, my gut says a firm no. I don\u2019t want to split the episodes in half and try and sell you razors in between. I don\u2019t want to start every episode talking about coffee beans or mattresses. It is \n\u003cem\u003emy\u003c/em\u003e opinion, that it does a great disservice to the stories and the guest, and a great disservice to you, the listener. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInstead, I\u2019m curious to see how we can create a \n\u003cstrong\u003ewin-win situation for everyone.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m curious to see if Couragemakers can become a \n\u003cstrong\u003ecommunity supported, sustainable and independent platform in its own right.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m excited to see how we can build a Couragemakers community made up of like-minded women who \n\u003cem\u003eget it,\u003c/em\u003e and really get together and support each other and lift each other up. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Plan!\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have \n\u003cstrong\u003eso\u003c/strong\u003e many ideas and plans to develop, build and grow Couragemakers. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nShort term plans: \n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ePractical weekly solo shows specifically designed for multi-passionates and creatives.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eA really strong and vibrant community where we can all get to know each other and create a wonderful space online for us to share ideas, support each other and share our lives together.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eWeekly Twitter chat/other platform based around that week\u0027s Couragemakers episode and theme.
