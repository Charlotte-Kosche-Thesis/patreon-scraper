    "summary": "If you\u0027re reading this, you are most likely already aware that\u003cem\u003e Challenge Mania \u003c/em\u003eis a Podcast hosted by Derrick Kosinski \u0026amp; Scott Yager that covers everything Challenge. If you did not know that, we thank you for your blind intrigue and/or apologize for someone sending you the wrong link, either by accident or as sick, twisted joke. It\u0027s possible that you may need better friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat makes \u003cem\u003eChallenge Mania \u003c/em\u003eawesome is that although Derrick \u0026amp; Scott are the hosts, it is \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cem\u003eour\u003c/em\u003e friends, that keep the show going! Without the Challenge Maniacs letting us know who \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e want to hear on the show, we wouldn\u0027t have a guest list. Without \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e guys blowing those cast members up on social media and letting them know their presence is wanted, needed and demanded, our calls wouldn\u0027t be answered as quickly. Without \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e sending in amazing questions based on years and years of viewing experience, we wouldn\u0027t sound like we remembered each and every anecdote and noteworthy event in a guest\u0027s Challenge career.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimply put, without \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cem\u003eChallenge Mania\u003c/em\u003e would not be the podcast that it is today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd \u003cem\u003ebecause\u003c/em\u003e of you, \u003cem\u003eChallenge Mania\u003c/em\u003e will be an even better podcast \u003cstrong\u003etomorrow.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is very important to us that \u003cem\u003eChallenge Mania \u003c/em\u003eremain mostly free and accessible to each and every person all over the world. We understand that not everyone has money to spend on entertainment and we are flattered enough that you all dedicate several hours a week to throwing us in your headphones and participating in our silly social media games and antics. That being said, in order to keep the two episodes a week coming to you all free of charge, we are hoping that the Challenge Maniacs who \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e have the ability to make a pledge towards our future will consider doing so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"But the show is already free. Why would we do that?\" \u003c/em\u003eGood question. See, it\u0027s that sort of intellect that makes us love you all in the first place. There are two reasons. One is to show your appreciation for the countless hours that Derrick \u0026amp; Scott put into the show each week, from booking guests to research to the time and money that goes into recording, producing, editing and hosting each and every episode. Throw in the time and money necessary for promoting and sharing the show on social media, interacting with the Maniacs, gathering questions and conducting a continuous conversation with each and every one of you. Now, top it all off with the development of promotional materials, stickers, merchandise and \u003cem\u003eChallenge Mania Live \u003c/em\u003eEvents and \u003cem\u003eChallenge Mania\u003c/em\u003e has become a full time, seven-day-a-week venture. If you appreciate all the hard work, time and money that we have and will continue to put back into this show and all its related entities in order to put forth the most enjoyable, interactive experience for die-hard and casual Challenge fans alike, a pledge of \u003cem\u003eany \u003c/em\u003eamount you are comfortable with or capable of contributing is much appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd secondly and more importantly, we are going to make it worth your while. (\u003cem\u003eCue the air horn)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eWe have crafted several tiers of participation as a patron and we invite you all to take a look and see what you might be able to swing financially and what prizes or features may entice you to do so. Some of our prizes are physical things like stickers, shirts, tickets and other stuff like that. Some of those will be exclusive to patrons and unable for purchase anywhere else. Also included will be exclusive content that only patrons have access to. This will include \u003cstrong\u003ebonus\u003c/strong\u003e podcasts, video content, \u003cstrong\u003ebonus \u003c/strong\u003eQ\u0026amp;As and more! Lastly, we will be offering one-of-a-kind experiences you won\u0027t be able to get any other way like receiving a Thank You Call from Derrick \u0026amp; Scott, in-person Meet \u0026amp; Greets at \u003cem\u003eChallenge Mania Live\u003c/em\u003e shows, and the chance to \u003cstrong\u003eAPPEAR ON A FUTURE PODCAST!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe same way we look to you all to give us ideas and inspiration for podcasts, we will do the same for patron incentives. If you guys have cool or fun ideas for what might motivate you or others to make sizable contributions to our cause, please let us know on social media. #ChallengeAccepted\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, we just want to make it clear that simply by being a listener of our show, by tuning in every week and by hopefully telling your friends and family about it along the way, you are already in our hearts. If in addition to that, you find yourself able and willing to become one of our patrons, we promise, we will make it worth your while and will make it our mission to demonstrate our gratitude in fun and innovative ways that only we can come up with!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Bonus content/podcasts are offered to \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManiac\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e-level patrons and above.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Each month we select one patron, Enthusiast-level or above, to interview Challenge Mania style for our MEET THE PATRONS podcast series!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***THIS MAY WE WILL BE RANDOMLY SELECTING ONE PATRON TO RECEIVE A SIGNED, USED AND WORN CHALLENGE JERSEY FROM NONE OTHER THAN ABRAM BOISE!!\u003cbr\u003e"
