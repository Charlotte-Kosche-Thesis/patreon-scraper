Ever since I was young, I was always creating something, and I have been lucky enough to be recognized for that work in local communities and on the Internet through animated videos I make. Many of my YouTube videos consist of animated shorts and parodies of some sorts (usually to video games).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnimation, regardless of what form it takes, whether it is 2D, 3D, or stopmotion is very time consuming and uses a lot of resources. For my animated videos, I create a vast majority of what you see. The character models, weapons, creatures, rigging, animating, lighting, and rendering are all done by me. (I do area models often as well as well, but I occasionally outsource those). Needless to say, it takes a lot of time and work for me to create an animated video from start to finish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI absolutely love what I do and I have been fortunate enough to gain a small following with the videos that I make. However, as much as I would love to continue uploading better content and uploading more consistently, bills need to get paid and my time is constantly pushed away from this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is where Patreon comes in. Through your support, I can afford to spend more time on what I am most passionate about. Videos will be able to come out more frequently and in better quality. With enough funding, I can afford better equipment to enhance the quality of my work and effectiveness of my workflow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI greatly appreciate anyone who is willing to donate to my Patreon, even if all you can afford is a dollar a month. Everyone who donates to this Patreon will be credited in each of my videos (in order from highest contributor onward) and will have access to Patreon-exclusive content. Those who contribute more will have access to more content, and details on that will be listed in \"Rewards.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and a big thank you to my supporters! You\u0027re the best!\u003cbr\u003e-Skyler Foxx (C4DNerd)"
