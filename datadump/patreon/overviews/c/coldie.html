    "summary": "The mission of this journey is to free myself from the proverbial chains that hold me back from fulfilling my dreams and properly exploring my passions. What I love most about Patreon is how there is support, but emotional and monetary, that is the catalyst for progress. I have a very supportive network who I enjoy sharing progress and getting feedback from. This is how we grow as a community and as an artist I take it very seriously that my best potential for the greater good is to create visual art that stimulates and inspires.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI do this by creating experimental and stereoscopic 3D fine art.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn every piece I create, I invite the viewer to step inside the piece and feel its energy. I am looking for a response. Positive or negative.
