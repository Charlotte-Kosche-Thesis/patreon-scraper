    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Jodeen\u003cbr\u003eI love making art and encouraging others to make art. I really love other artists, and am a big believer in artists having community, and I think the internet is a wonderful venue for both learning, encouragement, and fellowship. My goal is to help people who love art and would like to develop their skill and enrich their lives. My thing is pets, wildlife and fantasy art, as well as art inspired by the beautiful place I live. I want to provide tricks and tips, not just for actually making art, but for making time for art, and getting your art seen, or even actually making money with your work! I have methods to balance life and making art. I have helpful ideas for both the joy of art and the business of art. There is nothing that makes me happier than when people tell\n me that I\u2019ve helped and inspired them. I want to genuinely thank you \nfor considering to become my patron. Any contribution is greatly \nappreciated. Pledges are extremely easy to adjust or discontinue at any \ntime if you need to. Thank you so much for checking out my page. \u003cimg src=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/e/2764\" style=\"margin: 0px 0.2ex;\"\u003e"
