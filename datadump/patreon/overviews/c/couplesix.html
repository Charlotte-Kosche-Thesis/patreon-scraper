We\u2019re five Caribbean folk so we\u2019re really interested in weaving our island\u2019s folklore, history and culture into the things we make. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re also really focused on making rich characters that are very diverse. Our games will champion people of colour, and people who are queer. We are building things very differently in our studio - and we\u2019re excited for you guys to be a part of that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Game We\u0027re Building: Le Loupgarou\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re two-years into working on our first major title, \u2018Le Loupgarou\u2019.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s a game about a plantation fire, a pact with a creature called a Baccou, and a civil rights activist masquerading as a maid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s a narrative-driven stealth adventure game set in a mythical version of 1930\u0027s Barbados. You play as Le Brun, an old man whose frail body harbors the unhinged beast, the Immortelle, Le Loupgarou.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou hunt souls through darkened streets in a world where there are monsters far more terrifying than you. You have to survive long enough to pick apart your own history and identity, and the history of those you\u2019re hunting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s also a game that\u2019s built around historical events. In 1937 Barbados erupted in riots. Workers had banded together to push for union rights. It was one of the watershed moments for adult suffrage and it gave birth to some of the most incredible people this island\u2019s ever seen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeet Bertha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rpgQtX7.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBorn in St. Lucia. Raised in Barbados. Activist. Educator. Mystical obeah woman. Mother to precocious little six-year old Rachel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHer role in this narrative gives us goosebumps, and we\u2019re so excited to share that with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eOur Design Philosophy: \u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis isn\u2019t a game about power. This is a game where the player will have to be observant, careful and coordinated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/2MuZg6Z.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut you\u2019re still a hunter.

They met because of Runescape, which is how all great relationships started in \u201805. Krystal (first) moved to Barbados and became besties with them. Then Ari met Josh (fourth) at art school and we kidnapped Blaize (last) from Trinidad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a team we\u2019ve worked unflaggingly for almost three years, learning the rigors of game design from the ground up. We\u2019re friends who became partners who became game makers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eHow you can directly support the making of Le Loupgarou\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout support it could end where it began, a nice idea in a notebook. A nice niche.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe got into this because we wanted our stories to be visible for the first time. To be the ones to dictate the narrative of what the Caribbean looks and sounds and feels like. And to make a game that exhibits that with as much magic and fidelity we know only we can bring.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short: to make games about us, and by extension, about you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve drawn on all of our internal resources and we\u2019ve been scraping and building for two years now - but we have hit our reserve limits. It\u2019s begun to hurt the project. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s why we\u2019re approaching Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support what we\u2019re up to, and you mirror our belief that the world needs more games like this, then pledge. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar goes directly into the making of the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd in exchange you get access to a whole host of behind the scenes materials. You get to see and be a part of the mess, before the success. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re Couple Six, and we make games about you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
