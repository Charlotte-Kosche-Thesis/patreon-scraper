Sexy sex. Of the sex variety.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIncase the last paragraph didn\u0027t make it clear, \u003cstrong\u003eCaves and Critters\u003c/strong\u003e is strictly 18+ - featuring adult themes both obscene and violent from time to time. Unlike some furry comics, however, the sex remains strictly \u0027appropriate\u0027 in timing. This isn\u0027t a world where characters will just randomly shag a stranger in the middle of a busy tavern; but hey, when you\u0027re wandering the wilderness with a couple of well-built and attractive fellers, stuff\u0027s gonna happen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it does. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn obscenely lewd detail.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eAlright, cool, but why Patreon?\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBecause living is expensive! Srsly, that\u0027s pretty much it. I love drawing, and writing Caves and Critters and all the other nonsense I create; but rent doesn\u0027t pay itself. I\u0027ve set the goals at the most bare-minimum extents I can; I\u0027m not trying to get rich off of your generosity. All I want is to be able to work on the content you enjoy and not have to panic about having a roof over my head or food on my plate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThis isn\u0027t some Paywall thing is it?

It\u0027s picked out by a raffle system - with higher pledgers getting more entries - and to make sure those who can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to pledge more than the bare minimum have a chance, nobody can ever win two months in a row.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlternatively, those who win a spot in the monthly art raffle can forego a personal piece, and instead crack the ol\u0027 horsehair and make me draw a full extra page for CnC this month! Meaning up to 4 extra pages for the comic in any given month, depending on what people want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell.. that\u0027s pretty much it! As time goes on and support grows I hope to release a second comic project (basically once I no longer have to rely on commissions nearly as much as I currently do to support my income) and have even begun planning out the foundations for Caves and Critters\u0027 eventual sequel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "It\u0027s a high hope, but hey - if it happens, I\u0027ll be a happy man! With this goal achieved I could quite literally work on comics full-time. That means regular updates for both CnC and whichever other project I settle on and probably more! Hell I got enough ideas knocking around this brain of mine. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNB: The effects of this goal won\u0027t come into effect until it\u0027s been achieved for at least two consecutive months. I\u0027d LOVE to make comics my full-time job but it\u0027s a risky move without reasonably stable support.",
