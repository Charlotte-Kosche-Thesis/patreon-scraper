We really enjoy making  videos as we travel and want these videos to help you the best way we can. We are in no way asking for a handout. Instead this is us wanting to connect with those who want to see our channel quality grow. \u00a0Patreon is so awesome because we get to give back to those who choose to become a Patron. \u00a0The support will help us to be able to dedicate more time to bringing you the content that you love to watch and we love to create! It also gives us a way to have more interaction with you all on a daily basis, keep in touch more, and get your feedback and suggestions to help fuel and ignite our content creation!  We look forward to interacting with you more through our private Instagram.

We lost our \"good\" jobs, and our first home in 2008 due to the economy crashing. Once back up on our feet we decided we were not interested in purchasing another home or slaving away at a 9-5 job. We dreamed of a better way of life than that! We wanted freedom, travel, and to have a blast along the way. \u003cbr\u003eBritnee came up with the idea of full time rv living and traveling. At first Beto wasn\u0027t to sure about it and thought she may have fallen off her rocker. Once the idea had some time to marinate Beto was totally on board. December 16, 2015 they started there journey as full time rvers and their is no looking back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-erhKS6aqxCg/V5QnJoygigI/AAAAAAAAAKg/3ULBZ2QK5IQz_fMXlB7clPj5oo6cD5CwACLcB/s1600/13775554_1322471147767500_3628961286644466238_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA\u00a0year later we have no plans to stop traveling and want to do everything we can to share this lifestyle with others. We truly believe it is the best way to live. We needed a reset on life and wanted to follow our dreams of travel and with Ctrl Alt Dreamers we are doing just that! \u00a0Our motto is that life is truly to short and you should follow your dreams and do what makes you happy! \u00a0We believe the the travel life doesn\u0027t have to be super expensive or glamorous. For those who love to travel they will do whatever it takes to see the world. For us RVing was a realistic and obtainable way for us to jump right into a life of travel. If we can do it so can you, and we would love to show you how!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XO9EE21_gxo\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
