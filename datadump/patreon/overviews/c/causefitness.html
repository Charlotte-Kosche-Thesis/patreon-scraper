But, my mission has evolved. I\u2019m still all about fitness, but I\u2019ve also become extremely frustrated with the fact that \u003cem\u003efitness\u003c/em\u003e all by itself doesn\u2019t solve any \u003cem\u003ereal \u003c/em\u003eproblems.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMy story...\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y7qJBIc0jew\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe all need a whole lot more than fitness. We need life support!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut everyone just pretends (we\u2019re so good at pretending) that everything is Pinterest-perfect and life is always Instagram-able. That lie will suffocate us in envy, greed, and lust. I had to start talking, so I started a new series on my YouTube channel called \u201cReal Talk with Rach\u201d.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n My MO for the series is to speak openly and vulnerably about topics that we can all relate to but are afraid to talk about, and breathe new life, hope, and encouragement into them. Vulnerability IS scary, but it\u2019s the only way we will really connect, and connection is key to healthy growth, \n\u003cem\u003eand holistic fitness!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is also a ministry.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTalking about hard things is just the beginning. It\u2019s the shovel that will help us dig down deep enough to find the truth. But not even \n\u003cem\u003ereal talk \u003c/em\u003ecan save us from ourselves. Only Love can do that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am compelled to share the love of Jesus that has completely saved my life and changed the trajectory of my future. It isn\u2019t about \u201creligion\u201d, it\u2019s about a real relationship with the Creator of the Universe! It\u2019s about loving God, and loving people! There is nothing about fitness or nutrition, or anything else that I\u2019ve learned through study or experience, that has had a greater, more positive impact on my heart, mind, body, and soul; and it had nothing to do with anything I did. God did it all!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGod is SO good, but He\u2019s been so misrepresented! Whether I\u2019m saying it out loud or simply showing it in action, I hope to be able to share His true heart for people through my videos and my everyday life.

You\u2019re investing in me and my call to love people through videos and social media! I know this\u00a0is what I\u2019m supposed to be doing \u2014 and you\u2019re making that possible.
