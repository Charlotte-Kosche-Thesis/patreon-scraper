It stretches far back to medieval times when artists and bards were employed by nobles to create luxurious paintings or pen stories or compose music without having to worry about silly things like paying bills or preparing meals. Today, these people who support artistic endeavors aren\u0027t nobles but philanthropists, and they\u0027re usually involved in groups that use fancy words like \u003cem\u003esociety\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003efriends\u003c/em\u003e. Typically, these societies will focus on an organization as a whole, like a library or art gallery, instead on an individual artist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e What Patreon does is help scale down the concept of patronage to a level that\u0027s affordable and individually targeted.

In a typical week, I spend between 3-5 hours creating content for short stories, novels, and blogs, which allows me to finish a short story or chapter a week. I write across the board in everything from cozy mysteries, thrillers, speculative fiction, literary fiction, and YA. Mostly, I write about people and their relationships with themselves, with others, and with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spend between 25-30 hours a week working with other authors, both published and unpublished, to help get their stories up to industry standards. This includes copy and line editing, beta reading, critiques, and Q\u0026amp;A feedback. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rest of my week, approximately 50 hours, is spent at my out-of-home, W-2 job, which I am trying to leave to pursue writing and editing full-time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Of course, I spend time with my kids, and we go on epic adventures to the park to feed pelicans and ducks.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eWhy Patreon:\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eBeing a full-time (or part-time) creator brings a lot of uncertainty and variables to the table, and I\u0027ve pursued some less-than-desirable routes to assuage those anxieties.

By becoming a patron, you\u0027ll help sustain my creativity while receiving special goodies and incentives along the way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month, I\u0027ll release patron-only content that includes story content, writing updates, writing and editing tips, and contests for reduced editing rates. As a patron, you\u0027ll see stories (or parts of novels) at least a month before anyone else. I also have other goals I\u0027m working toward, like creating a podcast for mystery writers and co-creating a trans-Atlantic literary magazine with my best friend, but my first priority is delivering great content and editorial feedback.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eMy goals:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Check out my goals in the left-hand column (or below if you\u0027re on a mobile device) to see what awesome things I have in store for my patrons.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a lot of stories to tell, and with your help they can come to life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your continual support.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
