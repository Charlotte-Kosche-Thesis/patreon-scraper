    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHello there, potential patrons! My name is Cameron Ward. Online,\nI go by the title of Cam\u2019s Eye View. Over many years of my life, I have grown\nto love multiple subjects, like films, cooking, animation, and, of course,\ngaming. I have been interested in video games ever since I received my Nintendo\n64 in the late 90s. My first ever video game experiences include some of the\nclassics like \u003cem\u003eSuper Mario 64\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eMario Kart 64\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eAladdin\u003c/em\u003e on\nmy cousin\u2019s Super Nintendo. Back in 2008, I beat \u003cem\u003eSuper Mario Galaxy\u003c/em\u003e for\nthe Wii, and that inspired me to start writing reviews. I expanded into\neditorials about gaming, video game Kickstarter projects, top 10 lists, and\ndeveloper interviews. After a while, I became interested in writing\nreviews/editorials for animated and certain live-action films. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMy\ngoal is to be 100% honest with my work. The opinions you see in these articles\nare my actual thoughts. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy\nShould I Support Your Work? \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo, that\nleads to the biggest question of why you should become a patron of mine. Well,\nas far the gaming side of my site/Patreon goes, I post reviews, editorials,\ninterviews, lists, and Kickstarter Shout-outs. I will be upfront with everyone,\nand you won\u2019t get anything shady out of me. I won\u2019t take review copies of games\nthat have post-release embargos. I won\u2019t take deals in really crummy paid\npromotions, and I won\u2019t review games that I haven\u2019t played. If I haven\u2019t played\nit, or have had limited experience with it, like some kind of beta gameplay,\nthen I won\u2019t review it. Even then, any beta experience will be a \u201cThoughts On\u201d\nfirst impression type of article. If I am a part of any paid promotion, which\nwould be one that has no restrictions on me and my opinions, or have received a\nreview copy of a game, I will be sure to be upfront about it from the very\nbeginning. I might review a game down the line that I missed when it was\noriginally released, or create something else, like an editorial or list about\nthe game. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAs\nfor the film review side, I write with the same standards as the game reviews. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI\nhave been running my website for several years now, and have been reviewing\ngames since 2008, with over 400 reviews. If this Patreon becomes successful, I\nhope to be able to make a living off of what I love to do, and have it result\nin consistent revenue. Another goal of this Patreon is to be interactive with\nyou the public/patrons. Do you have a question to ask me about anything\ngaming/movie related? Do you want to suggest or recommend an old or new game to\nme? Well, you can go right ahead and ask me about anything related to gaming\nand other forms of entertainment. If you are a patron, and want to play certain\nmultiplayer games with me, I\u2019ll make sure to add you to any console or PC I\nhave. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo,\nif you decide to support me and my work, here is what you are going to get. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eGame\nReviews\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThese\nare the articles that started it all. You will get reviews of games, old and\nnew. You will get nothing, but honesty and to-the-point details about these\ngames. I will talk about the story, the gameplay, the history behind the game,\nthe people behind the scenes, the overall presentation, and the good, bad, and\nugly stuff about them. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eThoughts\nOn\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThese\nare my editorial pieces that you will see alongside Kickstarter Shout-outs.\nThoughts On will tackle my, well, thoughts on upcoming games or certain topics\nthat are about the game industry as a whole. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eCream\nof the Crop\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThese\nare lists.

I won\u2019t just cover\nany regular/bad Kickstarter. These have to stick out in terms of being\npromising. I have guidelines as to which ones I will talk about. If your\nKickstarter doesn\u2019t impress me, then you need to trash it, work on it, give a\nhoot, and then try again. Anyway, since Kickstarter has become flooded with\nprojects that are quite poorly put together, like the quality assurance behind\nSteam, you will only get the best of the best Kickstarters with these\narticles. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eDev\nTalk\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThis\nis where I will be interviewing developers of upcoming indie games\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe\nOther Side of Animation\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThese\nare the reviews/editorials/lists focused on animated films, big and\nsmall. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003ePlay It Again! \u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThese\nare my positive reviews of live-action films that are fun to watch more than\nonce! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWill\nI be doing Reward Tiers? \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAt\nthis point in time, I will not be doing reward tiers, but you never know about\nthe future!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf\ncourse, no one is forcing you to support my Patreon, and if you don\u2019t see\nsomething you want to invest in, don\u2019t worry about it.
