Games (or perhaps more accurately just the playing of games) are an amazing thing for bringing people together, so much so that the concept of play is wired right into our basic instincts. I think that\u0027s why Let\u0027s Play is such a popular concept; it revisits our childhoods at friend\u0027s houses, sitting together on the couch while someone or another played the latest video game. You play, you joke, you laugh and have a good time. With the advent of the internet, that concept spread and grew into what we have today. These days, the couch has hundreds, or thousands, or even millions of people sitting on it, and even though only a few might be playing, everyone is having a good time. To me, that\u0027s nothing short of magical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31,73,125);\"\u003eWhy A Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eBecause this is expensive! I run a business with Chay Plays, and the collaborative efforts of eight people can be costly to produce! There\u0027s hosting costs for backups, this way, if YouTube were to pull a video of mine for whatever reason, there can be \u00a0a handy download link where people can still get it. \u00a0There\u0027s equipment to buy and maintain, the games themselves cost money, etc As it stands, the channel costs an average of about a hundred dollars a month to maintain, and as we grown and branch into larger projects and features the cost grows with us. Money is always tight for me, because I can\u0027t work a conventional job due to disability, so dealing with all those costs sometimes becomes a very big problem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon, I can offset or eliminate those costs and keep doing what I do without concern. This way, I am free to do what I do, and the people that enjoy what I do can have the knowledge that they help make it possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31,73,125);\"\u003eWhat Does The Money Go To?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eLots of things, really. It can pay my hosting costs, even if I need to upgrade to larger and more expensive hosting plans in the future as the channel and community grows. I\u0027ll use it to pay for off-site backup and storage, so that the worst thing that can happen to the channel is a temporary outage, not catastrophic failure. I\u0027ll also use it to improve my equipment (and therefore quality of content), as well as purchase new games to play on the site, meaning I can pick up and showcase the latest games without worrying that I can\u0027t afford them for the time being.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future, if this makes a great deal of money, who knows? I might hire someone to take care of my audio/video editing, freeing up way more time for me to make even more videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have other entertainment projects I\u0027d like to do in addition to Let\u0027s Play if I can free up some of my workload by paying others to do some of the editing and other work for me, which would diversify the content I produce. I would also like to be able to afford to give my friends who are working on the site with me a suitable cut of profits, as it does not sit right with me that they so generously work for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost importantly, if it makes enough money, I could do this full-time, producing tons of videos for everyone to enjoy while financially contributing to my household\u0027s happiness and well-being, which is much more than I can expect to do under any other circumstance. I have a lot of dreams to do good in my community both on and offline, but dreams usually cost money. I want to fulfill them if I can, and I think it imparts a greater meaning to them if they are fulfilled with the help of others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31,73,125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
