    "summary": "First of all... THANK YOU for landing on this page. It means you probably started out on one of our blogs or at ChasingCreative.com, which means we already like you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe (Ashley Brooks and Abbigail Kriebs) started Chasing Creative because we know hard it is to make time for anything above and beyond what you HAVE to do in a day. And we wanted (and still do!) a way to make time for those creative projects that we had been putting on the back burner for far too long. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you dream is to write, paint, sing, read, or one - or more! - of a million other creative things you could do, we want you to be able to find the time and motivation to do it. Chasing Creative is where we and other creative people share our stories, encourage one another in our creative pursuits (and life in general), and swap tips for making time for things other than laundry and dishes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe launched Chasing Creative in 2016 after hours of research and planning, and we spend hours each week making the podcast to share with you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we asking for money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we began, Ashley had one young daughter and ran her own small business, and Abbie had a day job and blogged for fun on the side. A little over two years later, Ashley has three (!) small children and still runs her growing business. Abbie has a son and is trying to build a business to replace that day job. As our respective businesses (and families!) have grown, it\u0027s getting harder to keep creating quality content without a little help. We\u0027ve always treated our podcast as a really fun hobby, but would love to make it financially self-sufficient.\u00a0Your support means we can do that, and that we might even be able to start outsourcing some of the work in the future. Planning, recording, editing, and sharing all take a lot of time out of our very short days and we\u0027d love to start creating content more consistently. But we need a little help to do that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will your donation cover?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll be using donations to cover the cost of hosting, the software we use to create the podcast, our domain name, and other tools we use to make the podcast a reality. To replace microphones when our children \"borrow\" them. To upgrade Google Drive accounts when all of our enormous audio files start maxing out our space. And eventually, we\u0027d love to start outsourcing some of the editing if we can afford it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill you help us make our creative dreams happen, so we can continue to encourage yours?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for helping us chase\u00a0a creative life,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAshley Brooks\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ewww.brookseditorial.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbbigail Kriebs\u003cbr\u003ewww.inkwellsandimages.com\u003cbr\u003e"
