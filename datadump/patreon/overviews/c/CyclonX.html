I\u0027m best known for my love of the Persona series, but I love making music of all genres. DnB, synthwave, pop, trap, dance, rock... you name it, and I\u0027ve probably tried it at some point! Music making started as messing around in FL Studio as a pre-teen, but its evolved into so much more over the years!\u00a0 Making music has given me the opportunity to meet some great people, explore new genres, and above all, its allowed me to bring a surprising amount of people joy! After building up some great relationships and a loyal audience, I\u0027ve decided to give back to all of you!

Well, in the music making process, there are ways to get by like I have for awhile. Using freeware VSTs and cheap software allows for beginners to learn the process of music making and figure out what it is that they make. Everything involved with my art creation I\u0027ve done has been on my own (aside aid from a few friends along the way), including channel art design; videos; music composition, rendering, and mixing; and social media management. Having done this for awhile, I\u0027m now satisfied enough with my content to require quality equipment to truly make my music as best as it can be. By supporting me on Patreon, you\u0027ll be aiding in the cost of MANY areas of my music making, including...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVirtual Instruments \u0026amp; VSTs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEffect Plug-Ins\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSample Packs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVocal Commisions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAudio Controllers\u003c/strong\u003e (keyboards, turntables, etc.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAudio Equipment\u003c/strong\u003e (headphones, microphones, etc.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDAW Software\u003c/strong\u003e (Digital Audio Workstations, like FL Studio)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlbum Art Commissions\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideo Rendering Software\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e...\u003cstrong\u003eand various other aspect of music making that may require a bit of payment!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAnd as a thank you for helping me pay to improve my music, you\u0027ll get special rewards \u003cem\u003eexclusive \u003c/em\u003eto Patrons of my page, which are available to view here and upon purchase of pledging.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/CyclonX_\"\u003esend me a Tweet\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for visiting my page, and I hope to talk soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--\u003cstrong\u003eCyclonX\u003c/strong\u003e"
