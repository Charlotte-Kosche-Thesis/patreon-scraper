Like so many others. I\u0027m in a sea of competition but it\u0027s the only thing I want to do. I would make due with whatever means of work I can find as long as it gives me time to make music. \u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s my passion, it\u0027s the only thing I know how to do. Since I was 13, almost 14 years old, I started making music where I quickly realized how fun it was. I would never have guessed that in a few years later, I would have released multiple albums, make works for other artists who enjoyed MY music, and create a base of loyal, amazing fans that would have my back whenever I felt like I was out of reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m 19 years old, and after a few years of only self-taught experience, I finally feel like I\u0027m worth the support and kind words you guys are giving me. I take this as a sign that I can go another step, by creating this page, which may or may not be a success, and accept kind donations and any amount of money you guys are willing to give me. I\u0027m doing this so I can fund future releases. \u003cbr\u003eThe money will only go into my music, and I will work hard, harder than the past 5 years I\u0027ve been practicing to make this my job. Sadly I don\u0027t have much of an income, so it makes things difficult.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t have any money to spare, don\u0027t worry about it. If you do want to donate for this cause, go ahead. I would appreciate it from the bottom of my heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will continue to make music like I always have, and I won\u0027t give up.\u003cbr\u003e Donating will mean I can release music more often. Economics will become less troublesome, I will afford new software and hardware (at the moment, I use nothing other than my computer to make music) and I will be able to give my whole setup an upgrade. Not having any form for equipment is a big handicap, and I want to change that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel very blessed to have come this far. Thank you very, very much for your amazing support, listeners. I will take any form of support with a warm heart. If you want to connect with me or chat, I am generally a very nice guy, so if you have questions, shoot away anywhere you can find me! (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Youtube)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou will only be charged everytime I release \u003cem\u003ean album\u003c/em\u003e. NOT single songs.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ship worldwide. Supporters signing up for the $20+ reward will have the shipping covered by me.\u003cbr\u003eSince these physical CDs are shipped and printed from Japan to me first, there will be a delay from the album\u0027s release till you get the CD in your mail - but I ship as soon as I can!\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
