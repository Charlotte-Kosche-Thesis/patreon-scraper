I love creating new music and sharing it with you. Your encouragement and support makes my journey as an artist an even greater experience. I started a Patreon so that I can create more content and finish my album. I have been working very hard on it and will need some help to complete it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT IS PATREON?\u003c/h4\u003eFor those of you wondering what on earth this is, let me tell you! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in the olden days, there were patrons of the arts--people that for some incredible reason wanted to support artists in their creative endeavors. Patreon is bringing this back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY I JOINED PATREON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nMy ultimate goal is to make the best music I can and to reach as many people as I can with it. I think music is a magical thing. It has comforted and healed and inspired me throughout my life, and that is what I hope to do for others with the music I create. I want to connect with people. I want to help people feel not alone. I want to help people \u003cem\u003efeel\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately, making videos, making albums, taking the time to find new songs to share...costs money.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy primary means of sharing my music with the world has always been YouTube. My videos are something I\u0027ve given away for free since 2009 and I\u0027ll continue to do so for as long as I am making them. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBut, if for some reason you are one of those magical people who feel like being a part of making that possible, of supporting independent music just because it makes you feel good, then this is the place for you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows you to become my Patron. You can pledge any amount on a per video basis, and that money goes straight towards making more music possible. And as an added bonus, there are some fun perks you get for being a Patron as well.
