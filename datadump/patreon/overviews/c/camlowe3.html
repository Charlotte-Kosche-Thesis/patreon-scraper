    "summary": "My trek into writing began when I was 6 years old and hasn\u0027t lost steam since. I wrote my first full-length fanfiction novel in high school (thanks to J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter) and ventured into the open waters of original novels shortly after. I have found my niche in mystery novels (thanks again, in large part, to J.K. Rowling and also to Stephen King). My life has been a constant lesson that there is beauty in the tragic. What I want to do more than anything with my writing is show those who lack hope that \"happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light\" (Albus Dumbledore).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for enabling me to share that hope with the world, Patreons. May you do the same everywhere you go."
