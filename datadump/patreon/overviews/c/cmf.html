    "summary": "Hello and welcome to my Patreon page! \u00a0My name is Christina and I am an artist / illustrator. \u00a0I have a BFA in Illustration from the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD), and I make 100% of my living as a visual artist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere you will find my \"visual musings\" -- a fancy term for my personal drawings, sketches and other random artistic pursuits. \u00a0I usually try to post two drawings / sketches every week in my public content. \u00a0If you choose to become one of my awesome patrons (Tier 2+), you will have access to more content and \"behind the scenes\" stuff in my Patron-only posts (not to mention other cool rewards).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor me, there aren\u0027t many things that compare to sitting down with just pencil, paper and an idea and making something beautiful that didn\u0027t exist before. \u00a0My artwork is largely inspired by an appreciation of the natural world (plants, animals \u0026amp; nature in general), as well as a fondness for stories, legends and the wisdom found in exploring different cultures (both historical and contemporary). \u00a0I also have what some may call a not-so-small obsession with pattern, texture and detail.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI firmly believe that each new piece I create comes\u00a0with the opportunity to make someone\u0027s world a little brighter and a little broader. \u00a0That is why I am so excited to be a Patreon creator. \u00a0The Patreon platform allows me to share my artwork and connect with a community open to the creative process, while enabling me to make a living doing what I love. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo where does your money go when you become a patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt helps me pay the bills.  While money doesn\u0027t buy happiness, it does pay for things like food and the roof over my head.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt goes towards the tools and resources I use to create my artwork and grow my business. \u00a0Patreon funds help pay for things like art supplies and the computer hardware and software that let me do what I do.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eThank you so much for stopping by!! \u00a0I hope what you see here adds a little light to your day. \u00a0Enjoy and come back soon for more \"musings\"!"
