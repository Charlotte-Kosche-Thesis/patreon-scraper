My older brother Christian and I took off when I was 17 so we could start actively pursuing our music and spreading it as we knew it to be the best way we could serve the world. We left our lovely home in Northern California to Maui, our destination and the first place we ever got on a plane and traveled to without a clue of what we were doing, just trusting everything would unfold as it should. And it did. We grew as brothers and so did our music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we felt the island was ready to send us off to new places we listened and went back to California to prepare for our next journey we called \u2018Maui To Maine 2017\u2019 where we drove an RV styled van from California to Maine over the course of 2 months, taking our time seeing the country.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://claybournemusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/17353289_10211912603037871_1930265026260690661_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"960\" src=\"http://claybournemusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/17353289_10211912603037871_1930265026260690661_n.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0.5em 0px;\" width=\"960\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewe settled in Maine for the summer focused on our growth as HUMANS.
