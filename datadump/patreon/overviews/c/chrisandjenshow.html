We host weekly episodes that are around an hour long, and talk about different topics that range from odd news stories to the latest video on FilmCow Extra.  A lot of times we\u0027ll go off topic into a web of discussion that leads to who knows where...but we always end up having a good time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur show is free to listen to, and will always be that way\u2026 but there are expenses in having a show like ours.  Things like the website, episode hosting, equipment, Jennifer\u2019s daily foot massage, and other stuff that comes up last minute (like a broken hard drive...ugh!).  It has gotten to the point where we have different ideas to expand the show, but now need your help in order to do so.  And this is where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we like about Patreon is that it provides a way for you to help us out while also getting rewarded with sweet stuff!  So not only do you get an awesome show to listen to, but you\u2019ll also get some rewards as well!  Take a look below at the different levels, decide what you feel comfortable giving, and just know that we are very grateful for your help!  And guess what?!  Even if you can\u2019t help us out...maybe money is too tight\u2026.we still thank you!  Just keep on listening to our show, and sticking with us every week!"
