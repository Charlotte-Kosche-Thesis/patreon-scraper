That definition is ever-evolving, shaped not only by my own musical training, but by my studies of yoga, meditation, creativity. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s also been shaped by many, many questions (and existential angst?) along the way. Questions such as: What \n\u003cem\u003eis \u003c/em\u003eit, actually, to be a classically trained musician in the world today?\u00a0Who am \u003cem\u003eI\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eas that musician? \u00a0What\u0027s our place in society?\u00a0How do we tell our \u003cem\u003eown\u003c/em\u003e stories, discover and use our \u003cem\u003eown\u003c/em\u003e voices? \u00a0And almost above all - how do we create lives that we love, lives that fulfill and sustain us as these creative musical artists?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd so, the\u00a0\n\u003cstrong\u003eClassically Trained\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0podcast was born! It\u0027s my quest to share and to discover the answers to those questions. To explore and expand what it means to be a classically trained musician in the world today. To reveal cracks and open windows in the boxes of tradition, expectation, and limiting beliefs that we find ourselves in so we can crawl out, fly away, or otherwise smash the boxes to pieces, and in so doing become the creative musical artists that\u00a0\u003cem\u003ewe\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0decide to be in pursuit of what makes our hearts sing.\u00a0From the practical advice to the philosophical perspectives, from the entrepreneurial stories to the beliefs that shape us - that\u0027s what this is all about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eSo how does this Patreon thing work?\u003c/h4\u003ePatreon is this amazing platform that gives you a way to join your favorite creator\u0027s community and pay them for making the stuff you love. Unlike Kickstarter where you pledge a larger, one-time amount for\u00a0one specific project, on Patreon\u00a0you pay a few bucks per month\n\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003efor your creator\u0027s\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eongoing\u003c/strong\u003e creation of things (podcasts, artwork, video essays, music, poetry, a mix of everything - whatever it is they do). This means the creator gets paid regularly and you become a bonafide, real-life patron of the arts. Kind of like in Mozart\u0027s day, but without the wigs. Imagine...your favorite creators\u00a0\u003cem\u003emaking a living\u003c/em\u003e doing what they do best\u2026 because of you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThis sounds amazing! How do I become a patron?\u003c/h4\u003eAll it takes is a $1 a month!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJust click the \"Become a Patron\" button above the Rewards section of this page, enter the amount you\u0027d like to contribute per month, and that\u0027s it! Choose whatever amount feels good to you that fits your life and your budget, and don\u0027t worry - you can change it or cancel at any time.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eRewards (?!)\u003c/h4\u003eAs a huge thank you for becoming a patron, I\u0027ve put together some rewards that I hope you\u0027ll enjoy!

You can choose to participate as much or as little as you\u2019d like.

And if it\u0027s not the right time or circumstance to for you to become a patron, I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003eso\u003c/strong\u003e thankful to you as a listener, sharer, and fellow musician (or musician-friendly person) who is coming along with me on this ride in your own way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eLots of love, and happy listening!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
