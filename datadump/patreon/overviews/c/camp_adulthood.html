(#1 goal - buy Producer Jennie a potato to say thank you for all her hard, uncompensated work!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what is Camp Adulthood?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCamp Adulthood is the Millennial art of living like a trash bag while still managing to pay for your own s**t and being interesting AF. Camp Adulthood is doing very big and scary things, like having a baby or buying a house or taking care of an ailing parent or starting a business, while still not being sure where your checkbook is (or even how to write a check). Camp Adulthood is Tinder and Facebook and Instagram, but also Encyclopedia Britannica and Oregon Trail and John Hughes movies. But most importantly, Camp Adulthood looks critically at a divided generation in time of endless opportunity and terrifying unrest."
