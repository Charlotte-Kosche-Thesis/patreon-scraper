    "summary": "On January 11, 2017 my divorce was finalized and I was diagnosed with cancer. It was a little much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the preceding year I struck out on my own, lost most of my friends, opened my first savings account, fell in love abroad, made some crazy new connections with folks, started a long distance relationship while still technically married and made many terrible decisions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving cancer is expensive. Co-payments, co-insurance, deductibles, moving expenses to find a better place to live during recovery, loss of income from being out of work after surgery, student loans that apparently don\u0027t care a damn bit if you can\u0027t pay during illness, and debt incurred due to a million little things that come up unexpectedly.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI thought instead of doing a traditional fundraising page. I would commit to giving back what I can for your support. I will be looking back to how I got to that terrible Wednesday of divorce and diagnosis and chronicling the road ahead. I will be doing this publicly at \u003ca href=\"http://www.chordomadiaries.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.chordomadiaries.com\u003c/a\u003e but patrons will get more personal and raw stories here, with some receiving rough drafts of long-form pieces that will make up a creative non-fiction book of this experience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m giving myself to the end of the year to put together a full draft of this book so this page will run for those ten months after which *knock wood* it won\u0027t be necessary anymore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWords can\u0027t express how thankful I am for your support, but trust me, I\u0027ll try. It\u0027s really easy to feel like my entire life has been derailed because of this, but your contributions and this outlet will help me stay on track during a difficult time. Thank you. I love you.\u003cbr\u003e"
