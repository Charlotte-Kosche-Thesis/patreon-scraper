This \nis not a place for children, no, but it is not a place for lewdness or \nlasciviousness, either.  It is my hope that by providing art of my \ncharacters, Dara and Kirra, they may encourage and comfort those who \nneed it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons of any tier will have access to:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eArt of my fictional characters Dara or Kirra, based on prompts provided by the community when they are available.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ePoetry, again based on prompts provided by the community when they are available.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso, the $5 tier may optionally submit simple prompts, one for a sketch and one for a poem, once a month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is not a \"commission\" Patreon, I do not accept direct requests.\u00a0 All prompts are subject to approval, and I reserve the right to decline any prompt from anyone for any reason.\u00a0 Don\u0027t worry!\u00a0 As long as prompts are kept simple and fun, it\u0027ll be fine.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nExamples of what I mean by \"prompts\" are as follows:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eDancing\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eTomb

conscience pretend that much of what may admittedly be pin-up art is \"safe for work.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHOWEVER.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n Please let me make one thing VERY clear:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThis Patreon does NOT contain pornography, graphic nudity, or other similarly suggestive content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you are looking for that, please move on.\u00a0 This is a place of respect and thoughtfulness first, fun second.\u00a0 Suggestive or

are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJust an artist who is apparently a poet as well, trying to do right by themselves and others.\u00a0 You might know me from elsewhere, but I go by the name Dara here.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are Dara and Kirra?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDara and Kirra are shape-shifting artist\u0027s muses (which I know is a contradiction, but that\u0027s how it is) whose natural forms are of significantly-endowed anthropomorphic wolves.\u00a0 They enjoy cosplay and dressing up, hanging out with friends, and video games.\u00a0 To keep in shape they lift weights and exercise, though they don\u0027t actually have to.\u00a0\u00a0 They usually avoid activities with too much bouncing, but sometimes it is necessary...or completely intentional.\u00a0 Probably no trampolines, though.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDara is outgoing, yet modest.\u00a0 She\u0027d prefer a hike in nature, or attending a party or social gathering, but would always dress sensibly.\u00a0 Kirra is reserved socially yet a bit more of a show-off, who prefers to stay indoors and/or play video games, but would be more likely to wear a relatively more revealing outfit if she\u0027s going to go out.\u00a0 You are also more likely to find Kirra reading.\u00a0 There are exceptions to all of this, of course!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThey don\u0027t mind answering most questions, too.\u00a0 Hopefully you\u0027ll get to know them better over time!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the deal with all this, anyway?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLike I said near the beginning, I feel there\u0027s a need for artwork of this nature.\u00a0 Fun, different, not necessarily safe, but not lewd or profane either.\u00a0 This art walks a fine line sometimes, and I know that, but I find it seems to genuinely help people too.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI feel like I would be wrong if I didn\u0027t share this art, but I can\u0027t really hold a normal job for health reasons, and I sure could use the support.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are they so...BIG?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFair question!\u00a0 Dara arrived as sort of a vision or dream(I don\u0027t remember which) and characters didn\u0027t just \"pop in\" to my imagination like that at the time, so they are quite special to me for that reason alone.\u00a0 Originally she was much larger, if you believe that!\u00a0 I went back and forth for years and eventually settled on the size that she is now.\u00a0 \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve felt a lot of guilt and shame over whether or not I should have such a character, and have often considered retiring her.\u00a0 Over time, I have concluded that she helps people more often than not, sometimes in spite of her size, if not because of it.\u00a0 So she stays, as she is, as big as she is, and both I and the viewer have to deal with that.\u00a0 Hopefully it will be a positive, if not thought-provoking, experience for everyone involved.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt would be easy to just say \"because that\u0027s what I like,\" but really, the story is far more complicated than that.\u00a0 @.@\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBack problems?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eNope!\u00a0 Some women suffer physically from being a larger size, while others don\u0027t.\u00a0 Dara and Kirra are meant to be built in such a way that they don\u0027t have too much trouble, and I also try to make it obvious that they work out often.\u00a0 I certainly don\u0027t mean to make light of the trouble some people have, and the wuffesses do sympathize.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGravity is a problem, yes.\u00a0 I do admit I present them as more, ah, buoyant than what might be \"real\" or \"natural,\" but I try not to overdo it.\u00a0 And, well...they are imaginary, ultimately.\u00a0 While I try to keep things in a thoughtful perspective, I also suggest not taking them so seriously you can\u0027t also have fun with the idea.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u0027t pretend they have it easy, at least\u00a0 Their overcoming such difficulties is part of the point!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePAYWALL???!!!?!!112\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYes, but a limited one.\u00a0 Eventually I\u0027ll post some things to the official curvywuffess tumblr(link below).\u00a0 If you want to see everything, early, as well as get early notice of my art streams, consider a subscription!\u00a0 If you super-hate paying to see art, then just wait a bit.\u00a0 It\u0027s as fair as I can be.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align:

this far, thanks a ton!\u00a0 I know this is a very unusual Patreon, with some unusual ideas, but that\u0027s the point.\u00a0 If you\u0027re not interested or can\u0027t support my Patreon, I hope
