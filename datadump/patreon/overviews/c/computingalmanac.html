    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003ePsst! Hey. Want wizard powers?\u003c/h1\u003e\nHave you heard of this weird new thing called a \"computer\"?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou\u0027ve gotta see this. It\u0027s one of the most powerful tools ever created. I tell you, pick this thing up, and you\u0027re Gandalf. It\u0027s a general-purpose problem-solving machine, capable of reading any type of information and producing any type of output.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, except for PDFs. You have to install a special program for those. Oh, and your printer, and word documents, and spreadsheets, and your company\u0027s database, and all of your company\u0027s clients\u0027 databases. But, if you get everything installed and set up just right, you\u0027re all set!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUntil you download too many updates. Or if you have a Windows phone and your friend\u0027s TV only works with Apple AirPlay. Or you want to train your computer to do something new, or click on the wrong words and get a virus, or...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLook, this stuff isn\u0027t easy, all right? In fact, it\u0027s gotten so complicated that even the professionals don\u0027t really understand what we\u0027re doing anymore. It\u0027s a good thing we aren\u0027t putting computers in cars. What do you think would happen if you tried to park a Google car in an Apple garage?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eThe real magic is under the hood.\u003c/h1\u003eWhen the public Internet first appeared in the early 90\u0027s, there was only a smattering of computing knowledge to be had. Over the last few decades, however, the sheer quantity of information has exploded exponentially. Even with search engines and smart editors, \"getting into computing\" is a daunting task. How are you supposed to know which ten-year-old blog post has the right rubbish to copy paste on to your screen?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe world may be smaller now, but we\u0027re more isolated than ever. Programmers barely even talk to each other, much less to normal humans\u2013who generally have too much of a self-preservation instinct to pay the Programmer\u0027s Toll, a hefty sum that must be paid upfront in time, energy, stress, and coffee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut there\u0027s still hope. Modern web technology has become so advanced that you no longer need to pay the Programmer\u0027s Toll just to start exploring the full potential of your machine.\u00a0Over the last fifteen years, I\u0027ve taught hundreds of students in every part of the USA. I\u0027ve mentored freelance clients, shipped almost a million of lines of code (and deleted two million more), and I want to share the good stuff with you. The computer you\u0027re looking at right now really is\u00a0the same universal datatool I described in the first paragraph...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf \u003c/em\u003eyou know\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://computingalmanac.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewhere to start\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
