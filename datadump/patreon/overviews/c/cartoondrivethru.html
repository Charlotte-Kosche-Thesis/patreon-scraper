    "summary": "Since 2010, I\u0027ve been producing fully-independent animated series for my Youtube channel, Cartoon Drive-Thru. Some people may know me from animation dating even further back. The channel features the original series Deadly Space Action, Sweet \u0026amp; Sour and the Puzzle Hunters, and I\u0027m currently working on two new cartoons: Princess Ness \u0026amp; the Perilous Quest, an anachronistic fantasy about an inept adventuring party trying to pull off dungeon dives and heist capers, and Go Ahead Make Us, about a startup work-for-hire company of former school bullies failing to turn a new leaf.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve made 22 3-5 minute Deadly Space Action cartoons, 24 1-2 minute minisodes, 11 Puzzle Hunters episodes, 5 Sweet \u0026amp; Sour episodes, multiple 5-15 minute pilots, one-off shorts, and podcasts. And until 2016, I\u0027ve done it just about entirely on my own, from writing to thumbnails to animation to backgrounds and even the voice acting. It\u0027s fun work, but it is a financial sinkhole. Youtube, Vimeo and Newgrounds generate no revenue for me, and making my own cartoons takes time away from paying jobs. I\u0027ve made lots of sacrifices to afford myself the time to create these cartoons, which is a time-consuming, exhausting task.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport from donors has allowed me the opportunity to pay voice actors, but I would ultimately like for the channel to be self-sustaining through the Patreon, which would then open up the ability to bring on more talent, from background artists to potentially other creators who could earn a revenue share.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cartoons will continue to be free on Youtube, and you can watch them until you start involuntarily mouthing all the words. This is a purely optional donation option and I\u0027m happy with any support you give.\u00a0I hope that with Patreon I can provide early sneak peeks at cartoons in development, a look at how the sausage gets made, exclusively for backers. But new cartoons will always eventually make their way to the public and won\u0027t be held for ransom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
