    "summary": "My name is Yujiro Seki, and over the course of the past several years I single-handedly planned, shot and edited a feature-length documentary, called Carving the Divine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCarving the Divine offers a rare and intimate look into the life and artistic process of modern-day B\u016bshi \u2013 practitioners of a 1400 year lineage of woodcarving that\u2019s at the beating heart of Japanese, Mahayana Buddhism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from committing the last five years of my life to this project, I\u2019ve devoted a great deal of my own financial resources to getting the project to this point, including buying a professional video camera (Canon C300), lenses, audio equipment, lighting, tripod, 16 terabytes external hard drive, and so on \u2013 not to mention all the travel expenses and other miscellaneous items I paid for. In other words, in order to realize this documentary I\u2019ve made a great deal of sacrifice. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I am still continuously working with a music composer to fine-tune the scenes, the film is nearly complete.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I have realized completing the film is only the first step in this industry.  In order for people to even know my film exists, I have to venture into the world of marketing, especially social media. By using YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, I will promote the film so that it will receive the respect it deserves.  In the end, the film will be taken seriously and be distributed around the world.  I believe this documentary, which shows the modern day life of the people who carry on a 1400-year-old legacy, will be able to accomplish this goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince marketing is not an area of my expertise, I have decided to hire a specialist to work with me.  He believes in my vision and came up with a cost-effective strategy which requires a lot of work by myself.  Yet, in order to keep this operation going, I need at least $500.  I have already spent a fortune on this project.  I do struggle to come up with the expense while trying to merely make a living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting from the price of a cup of coffee, you could be a patron and support the future of Carving the Divine.  This has a noble purpose which is to preserve and protect a 1400-year-old Japanese tradition of Buddhist wood carving.  I invite you to join me on this journey and inspire the world!\u003cbr\u003e"
