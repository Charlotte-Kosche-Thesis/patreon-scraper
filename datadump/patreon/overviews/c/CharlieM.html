    "summary": "I set up a 16 channel immersive sound environment in March 2011, many people helped me with experimentation and composition and I gradually refined the system until I registered a design for a 6 speaker system in 2015. That system is named Encircled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy using a recently developed plugin (using headphones + spatial audio developed by Oculus) everyone can compose for this system - in a standardised format - without the expense of buying the equipment needed for a real life immersive speaker system, retaining the possibility of replay on a real life system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, Encircled will be a place where musicians, producers and audio engineers explore the future of electrifying immersive sound experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA place where experimentation and research bring new music, sound and multi-channel speaker configurations to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis includes exploring and explaining the tools needed to create this music and how you can get started.
