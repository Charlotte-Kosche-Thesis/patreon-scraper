    "summary": "The experiences.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFor me, life is about all the experiences. This also applies to the subculture that has come to be a big part of my life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA dark December day I said to myself \"You spend way to much time watching YouTube videos. Why don\u0027t you start a channel yourself?\". At that time I was following a lot of alternative channels - but I felt that something was missing. These channels were focusing on fashion, makeup, DIY projects and such actions - but rarely on the experiences that I value within the scene. And when they were focusing on experiences, the production quality was often quite low.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI saw countless comments from people around the world that seemed to live their entire subcultural life through internet. And I thought that it was a shame that these people were probably watching haul videos, subscription box openings and make-up tutorials day after day. While there is nothing wrong with such videos, I thought that they were missing out on what\u0027s most important. The experiences.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, I decided to start my own channel, focusing on adventures and experiences. Trying to inspire people to get out there and enjoy life. And to show those who really can\u0027t what I think my subculture is about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027ve been doing this for a while, and I\u0027ve come far enough that the production\u00a0has started to become a financial burden. I do this because it\u0027s fun, to contribute to the subculture and to develop my skills as a videographer. Therefore it is totally fine with me to throw some money at this project. However, it has reached the limit to what is reasonable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo keep a high production quality I need to have decent equipment. This is what I primarily would like to ask for your support to fund. When making videos on a regular basis things break down occasionally. Just recently the microphone input on my camera has started to break down, which will mean quite a cost to repair. Also, once in a while I need to update my equipment as well as get hold of new equipment that allows me to produce videos that I have\u0027nt been able to do before.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo those of you who enjoy joining my adventures through YouTube I ask - would you be able to contribute to the channel - and become a part of the Candy Army?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport the channel with a couple of dollars a month. Your support would mean that I would be able to do more and cooler things - and there are also a couple of nice rewards for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support would primarily support my equipment costs - but if the number of contributions get many enough that would mean that I\u0027d be able to do more and cooler things for the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me on my adventures. Join the Candy Army!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading!\u003cbr\u003e"
