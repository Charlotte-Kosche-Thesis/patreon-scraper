But I think being understanding someone else\u0027s mind can only help you clearly understand yours. And this is only my belief and I am only one person, obviously. As much as I want to share my opinion I want to hear yours as well. I am inspired most by the people that surround me and even people that I meet simply on a daily basis. Through this Patreon you will see life through my eyes \u0026amp; what it means for me to be a human being in this world, through a vast majority of different mediums.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI can\u2019t wait to share my world with you!\u003cbr\u003e\nThank You,\u003cbr\u003e\nCaitlin Isabelle :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMediums I enjoy exploring:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Photography\u003cbr\u003e-Film\u003cbr\u003e-Traditional Drawing (pen \u0026amp; paper)\u003cbr\u003e-Painting\u003cbr\u003e-Digital Drawing\u003cbr\u003e-Fashion\u003cbr\u003e-Writing\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand so much more that I have yet to explore.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
