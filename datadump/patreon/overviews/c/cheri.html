My name is Cheri and I have been creating art since the first time someone put a marker in my hand.  Though sometimes my masterpieces were not well-received (ball point pen wall murals are not appreciated by landlords for some reason), I never doubted that part of my life should always be dedicated to art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on Patreon? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs soon as I heard about another way to share my art with people, I knew I had to jump on it. \u00a0I love the structure and accountability of Patreon, and the contributions of my patrons enable me to spend time working on things that matter to them! \u00a0It\u0027s a win-win situation, really!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had initially started my Patreon account as a way for friends and family to help support my art dreams.  Now, a year later, I have grown as an artist and as an entrepreneur.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you get by supporting me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I have not been able to create specific works for my Patrons the way some others have done, I have decided to simplify some of my ideas.\u00a0 One of those ideas has been to start a subscription box full of handmade items and options for lifelong learning and discovery.\u00a0 I have now combined this with Patreon, and the pieces have fallen into place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you will receive throughout the month are some sneak peeks, some polls about content and themes, and a monthly mailing based on your Tier of support.\u00a0 If you can only give $1, great!\u00a0 I\u0027ll send you a thank you postcard with my art on it every month.\u00a0 You will eventually have enough mini prints of fun illustrations to decorate your entire home with them!\u00a0 If you can support at $100, the very highest Tier, you get to hand-pick which items from that month\u0027s theme will arrive in your box.\u00a0 I\u0027ve set up several Tiers in which the cost is the same as another option, giving you the chance to decide how you would like your box curated.\u00a0 Feel free to sign up for multiple Tiers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReturns/Damages\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment I am not set up to take returns, but every package at the $5 Tiers or above are insured so that if one arrives damaged, all you have to do is send me a photo of the damage to the box/envelope and the items inside.\u00a0 I will replace the damaged items and submit a claim to the Post Office.\u00a0 If you don\u0027t like the theme for the next month, please remember you can\u00a0cancel your patronage at any time and re-pledge when the next theme goes on sale.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd what will I do with your support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour monthly pledge, beginning in November 2017, will cover the cost of items and shipping for your box, and will provide a little extra to pay for my time stocking and mailing out the boxes. As soon as your payment clears at the beginning of the month, I will mail out all of the subscriptions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much, from the bottom of my heart for being here for me (even just reading all the way through this is amazing), and if you\u0027d like to see what I share with the public, please check out:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.phoenixflightcreative.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWebsite\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/quasiebear/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://society6.com/artsbycheri\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSociety6\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.redbubble.com/people/artsbycheri?asc=u\"\u003eRedbubble\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/ArtsbyCheri\"\u003eEtsy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEmail me at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:phoenixflightcreativestudios@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ephoenixflightcreativestudios@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e to collaborate, share thoughts, or to get information about my other services.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
