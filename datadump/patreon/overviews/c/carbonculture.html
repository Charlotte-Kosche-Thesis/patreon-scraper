We\u0027re here because we want to bring you on this journey with us. We want to make a space for creators to share their interpretations of the digital world. We want to hear from voices putting technology into context.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCarbon Culture is two parts: \u003cstrong\u003eCarbon Culture Review \u003c/strong\u003eand our new book imprint \u003cstrong\u003eCARBON Books. \u003c/strong\u003eThe Review\u00a0is our annual journal of art, fiction, poetry, and interviews from creators across many backgrounds and disciplines. Eventually we want to center each issue on a specific topic--something our Patrons will help us decide--but will stay true to our mission of advocating for thoughtful and creative dialogue between Art + Tech + Lit. CARBON Books will be our full-length book publishing operation that will give us the opportunity to share with you, our community, in-depth, engaging explorations of our digital world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCarbon Culture is the ultimate labor of love that we are dedicated to continuing. We\u0027re a small, dedicated staff of two, working for nothing, but pledging your support will allow us to do some of the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) Stay ad free online and in the magazine\u003c/strong\u003e and avoid relying on relationships with corporations. Creating content about different digital industries without having to rely on those industries for funding means we can bring you the most honest and revealing insights. We source the best original material. Period. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) Expand the print run of Carbon Culture Review \u003c/strong\u003eso we can reach an even farther audience and get on the newsstands. We want to get our content into as many hands as possible, to make the conversation as big as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) Fund our full-length book imprint, CARBON Books \u003c/strong\u003ewhere we can bring you more in-depth content. In our first year we want to publish two to three manuscripts that speak to the Carbon Culture community. At a certain funding level we will be able to give our authors advances, ensuring the highest quality work and wide distribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4) Travel to tech and literary events \u003c/strong\u003ewhere we can expand our network of creators and readers. The cooler the people we find, the cooler the exclusive content we can bring you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want you with us, so we want to get you exclusive stuff. You will get access to supporter-only discussions and early access to general content, be able to submit your own work to our editors, help guide the direction of the magazine, get digital and hard copies of Carbon materials (including some sweet swag), and the sense of community that only being a patron can give.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a dedicated band of believers who want to bring you the best the worlds of Art + Tech + Lit have to offer. This journey started a while ago, but it\u0027s been so great that now we want to make you a part of it as well. The world is changing too fast to not take notice of those documenting it, contextualizing it, and above all, creating it. So come on, join us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to check us out."
