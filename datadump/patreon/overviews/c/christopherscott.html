    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Chris. I make movies and teach students the entire movie making process including writing story and character development, acting, costume and prop design, art, fabrication, cinematography, editing and visual fx, etc...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWatch the video playlist above to see the short film production work we\u0027re doing from scratch on very micro budgets. Most of the work is done myself with one or two students at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I work professionally on feature films like Jurassic World, Transformers and Terminator, we have big budgets, large crews and all the best tools we could need. But most indie filmmakers including myself do not have access to these high end tools and big budgets at home. We have to make use of whatever we have and make it count. I teach my students to use what they have and make movies. You don\u0027t need a full on studio and massive production budget to get things done! Low budget filmmaking is creative, fun and great practice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy goal is to raise $20,000\u003c/strong\u003e to buy filmmaking equipment for my school \u0026amp; studio. I\u0027m here on Patreon to share our developments and find like minded people who will support us in reaching our filmmaking goals.\u00a0Check out what we are creating on my links. If you find it interesting and would like to access more, please support our work here for special supporter only content and perks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!!\u003cbr\u003eChris"
