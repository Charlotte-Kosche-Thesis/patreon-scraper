Even more so who doesn\u0027t stream on twitch? Anyone with a PC, XB1, or PS4 can, and most do.

With the web people are more separate than before and those awesome talks on the couch you would have, don\u0027t seem to happen anymore. We loved sharing our gaming experiences and stories with our guests. It doesn\u0027t take much to get us chatting.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow ours is a unique story; in where one of us is new to gaming, and the other has played since gaming started. Between us we play every game under the sun, and we think of ourselves as the Peter and Lois Griffin of gaming (at the least in terms of our humor).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs conversationalists, we also span a wide range of topics all related to games and that leads to amazing discussions at times, and may provide some revelations. Be it some random fact or interesting news about gaming, once we end up going down that rabbit hole it can be an enlightening journey, while making a few jokes along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eBut Wait There Is More...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nThat wasn\u0027t enough for us though and so we\u0027ve branched out to produce podcasts, skits and the occasional live DJ sets as well. Our Podcast (2 seasons on YouTube) used to come out weekly and we would love to get that going again. It was a large investment that has come at a big price, but is worth it when we saw the fruits of our labor (not to mention the pure fun in doing it).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eDon\u0027t Mean To Beg\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWe took the leap of faith in getting some of the things we needed to bring you an experience through the power of the internet, but we\u0027ve learned that it is a full time job and doing this in our spare time just isn\u0027t time enough. It\u0027s something we would love to take on full time without interruptions.\u00a0We are always working on creating content and improving it, and as such need funding to keep it running.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have also been lucky enough to have a small group of friends with diverse talents. One of which is a gifted writer. Dare I say, we consider him to be the \"Dan Harmon\" of our group. His creativity and skill at crafting comedic scripts are fantastic and we can\u0027t wait to show you. We have a full seasons worth of screenplays written and ready for filming (some might already be out on YouTube) with a great crew of friends rehearsing and prepping to shoot.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eHonesty Is The Best Policy\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eSeeing that we do more than just stream on twitch, we want to make it clear from the start that we are going to be transparent in what your funds are used for. None of the content created will be behind a pay wall. You don\u0027t have to support us. Everything we do is available online and at no cost and it will remain that way.\u00a0The primary use of the funds is just in keeping our internet up and running to continue streaming and uploading our content at the best quality for your viewing experience. Others involve getting the last bit of equipment need to resume (and continue) the filming of our podcast \u0026amp; skits. Supporting us here will not give you some special video, (or will it)? All kidding aside, we believe it\u0027s important to be upfront and let you know what it\u0027s all used for, as that is what I myself would want and expect from the shows I support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eThe Project List\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nHere\u0027s what we are working on and where you can find them:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHitome De Game podcast, skits \u0026amp; related videos\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CyberMousey\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/CyberMousey\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003eTwitch live game \u0026amp; DJ sets\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/cybermousey\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttps://www.twitch.tv/cybermousey\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDJ mixes online\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/cybermousey\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttps://www.mixcloud.com/cybermousey\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut We Love It\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nEven without your pledges we still would do it because we love to; but with it, we can do those things and do them regularly.
