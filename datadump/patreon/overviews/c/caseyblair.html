    "summary": "Welcome! My name is Casey Blair, and I write speculative fiction novels\nfor adults and teens. You can find out more about me on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://caseylblair.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eauthor website\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m launching this Patreon alongside TEA PRINCESS CHRONICLES, a\nweekly serial fantasy novel full of tea and magic. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTea Princess Chronicles is FREE, and you can read it\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://teaprincesschronicles.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s something I work on for fun alongside\nother novel projects, meant to replenish my creative and motivational well, and\naccordingly it\u0027s pretty light-hearted. There\u0027s witchcraft and female\nfriendships, cats and magical realms, princesses and enormous quantities of\ntea. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cu\u003eWhat do you get for backing this Patreon? \u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt least for now, I\u0027m not worrying about reward tiers. I\u0027m grateful for\nyour consideration, and please feel free to back in any amount. I \u003cem\u003eam \u003c/em\u003eusing the goals feature on the left,\nand I\u0027ll add more as time passes and I get a better sense of what people are\ninterested in. (Bonus segments, merchandise featuring Leigh Wallace\u0027s wonderful\nartwork, e-books, etc.). Backing will get you access to the Patreon, where I\u0027ll\nperiodically take surveys on what to write or what else you\u0027d like to see from\nme. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e1. For every additional $25/month\nthis Patreon earns, I\u0027ll write another Tea Shop Interlude.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve put a few\nof these goals up already and will adjust or add more as needed. You can read\nsome samples of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://teaprincesschronicles.wordpress.com/tea-shop-interludes/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTea Shop Interludes\u003c/a\u003e on the serial website: these are side\nscenes of about 500 words each that can be read at any point in the narrative\nwithout egregious spoilers (though I recommend reading at least the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://teaprincesschronicles.wordpress.com/chapter-list/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efirst four chapters\u003c/a\u003e for context). Tea Shop Interludes are set in the tea shop where Miyara\nworks and will mainly be humorous, involving some aspect of Miyara\u0027s challenges\nrunning the tea shop. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nInterludes will also each feature a tea with a different fantastical\ningredient with vastly varying degrees of palatability, which Miyara will be\ntasting, selling, attempting to set fire to, that sort of thing. Fantasy\ningredients I\u0027ve put in tea for the story so far include dreadstalk bark, fairy\ndew extract, and jacksnake ichor. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027ll name each scene according to the featured fantasy ingredient, so\nyou\u0027ll be able to see easily if something has been taken and can\u0027t be used\nagain. \u003cstrong\u003eAccess to the Patreon means you\ncan suggest or vote on which questionable fantasy ingredient you\u0027d like to see\u003c/strong\u003e\nme inflict on this poor tea shop. (Or do Miyara a favor and suggest an\ningredient that doesn\u0027t sound extremely questionable!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n2. At higher price points, I\u0027ll write a few \u003cstrong\u003ebonus segments featuring a location or characters\u003c/strong\u003e (subject to\nplausibility with the main storyline) that have appeared in the story, and you\nwill have the opportunity to help choose what those chapters feature. So as you\nread the story, if there are particular characters you\u0027d love to see interact,\nor a place you want to spend more time in, let me know! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n3. For this Patreon, each month I\u0027ll be posting blogs on topics related\nto writing (business or craft), which will be marked as such with an otherwise\nirrelevant picture of my cats. Backing the Patreon means \u003cstrong\u003eyou\ncan also request or vote on particular blog topics\u003c/strong\u003e you\u0027d be interested in\nseeing me write about. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn summary, the Patreon is a chance for you to shape the bonus content\nI want to produce alongside the main storyline. (Since its purpose is also to\nrejuvenate me, not to create a whole lot of extra work or expense, unless\nsupport for this Patreon is shockingly high fulfillment will be focused on these\nkinds of supplemental writing pieces.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cu\u003eAll that aside, why am I starting a Patreon? What will funds go\ntoward? \u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe short answer: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIncreased financial stability; in particular, a safety net. All\ncontributions here enable me to keep my functioning writing life balance by\nhelping my ability to financially cope with unexpected/emergency/irregular\nexpenses outside the normal day-to-day ones I have covered. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe long answer: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI work part-time so that I have the space I need to write. This setup\nworks wonderfully for me for a lot of reasons, I\u0027m incredibly fortunate to be\nable to make this work, and I want to continue as long as I can. Part of the\nreason I was able to quit the full-time job that was crushing me three years\nago was because I\u0027d saved a substantial buffer. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHowever, I don\u0027t currently make any money from writing, and over time\nthat buffer has dwindled--my last year in particular included a car accident,\nmoving expenses, health care costs to recover from an injury, and the company I\nworked at closing without notice, which left me unemployed at a time I\u0027d\nexpected to be making extra money. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe good news is I \u003cem\u003ehad\u003c/em\u003e a\nbuffer, so I didn\u0027t go bankrupt and am not being forced to acquire full-time\nemployment again. Yay emergency savings! The bad news is my buffer is nearly\nexhausted, and if a similar combination hits this year I\u0027ll be in trouble. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn addition, I already know that I have at least one big expense\nlooming: my car has been in the process of dying slowly for a long time.\nFingers crossed it makes it out the year, but it\u0027s sixteen years old, and it\nwon\u0027t keep chugging along much longer. I can\u0027t currently afford to replace it. I\nam saving money, of course, but most of that has to be slotted to cover health\ninsurance next year in case I\u0027m no longer eligible for Medicaid. That means I\u0027m\nnot in a good position to replenish the emergency buffer quickly. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd, while I hope to have a book deal in the future, if you\u0027re not\nfamiliar with the publishing industry, suffice it to say that writing income is\ninconsistent. Advances have to cover long stretches of time, royalties are paid\ninfrequently if the book earns out at all, self-employment taxes are huge--if\nyou\u0027re interested I can do a longer post, but basically novel writing income is\nnot at all steady. So even if I do get a book deal, I hope the Patreon will\nhelp tide me over payment gaps. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe long and short of it is I\u0027ve put a lot of time and effort into\ndeveloping my writing, and more than anything I want to be able to continue\nthat work. Your support helps enable me to do so, and that means the world to\nme. Contributions in any amount go a long way. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, please check out TEA PRINCESS CHRONICLES or my author website, and\nif you like my work or want to support me in it, I\u0027d appreciate if you\u0027d consider\ncontributing here! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll the best,\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCasey\u003cbr\u003e"
