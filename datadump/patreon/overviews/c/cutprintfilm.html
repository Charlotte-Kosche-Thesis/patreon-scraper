Ideas you can\u0027t even imagine. We want to bring you MORE original content via your eyeballs AND your earballs. If we could make content you can TASTE, we would! But we don\u0027t have the technology yet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur vision is to be able to bring our subscribers a steady stream of interesting, funny, or just plain entertaining videos and podcasts. We\u0027d love to be able to do this much more frequently than we already do, but we don\u0027t want to cut corners. We\u0027re not interested in slapping together some still images, throwing in an audio file and calling it a video show (we\u0027d\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/dL5iZhxWzJQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/i\u003edo that). We\u0027re also not interested in having an uninformed conversation about movies without doing some hardcore research and actually having an informed and interesting opinion on the matter. Cutting corners doesn\u0027t produce great videos and podcasts, it only produces hot stinking garbage and we\u0027re pretty sure the internet already has its fill of hot, stinking garbage.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhy not? That\u0027s what we say. What, do you think you\u0027re better than us? Hey, that\u0027s fine with us as long as you toss us a buck or two.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating original content is rewarding on its own, but to be able to get paid for creating that content is even more rewarding. We all know affiliate advertising programs and video advertisements don\u0027t amount to more than pennies a month and, trust me, you can\u0027t survive off of pennies. They taste terrible and will break your teeth if you try to eat them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cold, hard truth is that running a film website requires money. Server costs, hosting fees, equipment costs. I mean, have you seen how much a movie ticket is lately? Don\u0027t even get me started on the cost of snacks, either. $12 for a soda? What is this, some dystopian hellscape?! No, it\u0027s reality and we have to make a little \u003cem\u003emonayyy\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0if we\u0027re going to scrape by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re putting our livelihood and the fate of our families in your hands! You can choose to donate a dollar a month (or more - hopefully more, if you don\u0027t want to see us out on the street) to help us create the very best content we\u0027re capable of! And trust me when I say, we\u0027re capable of creating some pretty incredible stuff. Putting a little money in the coffers just helps us raise the bar on what\u0027s possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSeriously, thank you!
