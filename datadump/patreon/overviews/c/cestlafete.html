    "summary": "Growing up, I was dead-set on becoming a professional artist, specifically as a penciller for Archie\u0027s Sonic the Hedgehog comics. I drew obsessively and though my goals changed (indie comic artist), my desire to create did not.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately, I did not go to art school as planned, instead majoring in Video Game Development and setting off into a career of mobile development. As the economy suffered, so did my creative output, and at present, I find myself working a minimum of two jobs (plus temp work/odd jobs) to keep the bills paid and food on the table.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(Here\u0027s where you come in!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to be able to draw again without feeling that my time is being wasted on leisure. I often talk myself out of doing art because I feel that it isn\u0027t earning the time I spend on it, save for when I do commissions, and the art supplies aren\u0027t buying themselves. If you back me on Patreon, what you\u0027re saying is \u0027Yes, your art is worth the time spent on it!\u0027 and encouraging me to make time in my life to do the things I love. The money you pledge will literally allow me to justify creating things just for the love of creation and could even lead to a small side business of prints, patches, posters or more!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you enjoy what I do, help me enjoy what I do too, and without the guilt!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT CONSTITUTES REASONABLY FINISHED ART\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eWhen I started planning out my Patreon, I had to come up with a goal that both felt reasonable and worthwhile. I felt like I would be overburdened with the idea of a fully finished piece at first and would quickly give up, as backgrounds aren\u0027t always as easy to whip out as figures and colouring. What I decided was that a \u003cstrong\u003ereasonably finished\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0piece was the way to go, at least at first, with the option of switching to fully finished when the time comes that I am able to sustain my drive at that level with any amount of frequency.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nReasonably finished examples include:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA full page figure, inked and coloured with shading (when applicable) with or without background [\u003ca href=\"http://24.media.tumblr.com/3402f07532d8d4d3d88a62c70a9319f4/tumblr_n5fc01VXnB1twgsxro1_1280.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efigure example\u003c/a\u003e] [\u003ca href=\"http://37.media.tumblr.com/7ea1d26f96ebab7d0c876de16e5d16c9/tumblr_ml2lzoWJt41rsvqnno1_1280.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u0027finished\u0027 example\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA finished vector of a figure with some attention to presentation (i.e. with framing/background fill at minimum) [\u003ca href=\"http://37.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_me8lwktnED1rsvqnno1_1280.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eexample\u003c/a\u003e] [\u003ca href=\"http://37.media.tumblr.com/04bc63a13da55c6f0bba0a677febea4f/tumblr_n3qbuuGAQP1twgsxro1_1280.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eexample\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA comic page, fully inked, with or without shading, toning, colour, etc (varies on style)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA vectored and digitized patch with final stitched product [\u003ca href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/patreon/f79d89591ec26f5e4fc8b5c897512f64.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eexample\u003c/a\u003e] [\u003ca href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/patreon/0cfde14b2298aafedecf1ef9bc32c0be.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eexample\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePiece that appear without backgrounds will not be double-charged once they receive backgrounds unless there is support for that sort of system or that some considerable energy went into their creation (generally due to detail/realistic rendering)."
