    "summary": "Hi everyone! Thank you so much for being here supporting the podcast. The funds from your support go directly towards our ability to invite expert professionals to be guests on the show. With your support we will be inviting women across a variety of professions to share their story and advice. So far we have experts in Reproductive Endocrinology, Obstetrics, Women and Gender studies, and Disordered Eating lined up! While each and every one of our guests contribute so much to the show, we would like to be able to focus our expert episodes on providing listeners with as much information and resources as possible on the topic. This means travel expenses and other associated fees.\u003cbr\u003eYour contributions will also help to offset the cost of equipment and time required to make our sound quality better. We know this is an area that could use improvement, and we are doing the best right now with what we have.\u003cbr\u003eThank you advance for your support!!"
