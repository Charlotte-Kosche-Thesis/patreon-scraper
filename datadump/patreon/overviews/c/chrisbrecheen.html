My name is Chris Brecheen, and I\u0027m a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a number of ongoing writing projects\u2013from a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.chrisbrecheen.com/\"\u003eblog about writing\u003c/a\u003e that occasionally dips into\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.chrisbrecheen.com/2012/07/and-occasionally-some-writing.html \"\u003efiction\u003c/a\u003e, to regular Facebook posts\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chris.brecharge \"\u003eabout current affairs\u003c/a\u003e (along with a healthy dash of daily updates and geekery). I run a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ChrisBrecheensWritingAboutWriting/\"\u003eFacebook page about writing\u003c/a\u003e where I put up all kinds of content from puns and memes to articles about linguistics. I\u0027m also writing a book as fast as I can and periodically work on other projects as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really don\u0027t get paid for any of this work though. I don\u0027t have ads on my blog. Digging around for the links and memes I put on FB is a labor of love. Even the book I\u0027m writing will be published non-traditionally and made available to everyone for free (as well as as cheaply as I can on Kindle and print-on-demand). My writing is for the world. Every penny I really generate is from donations, and while I have a few breathtaking, top-dollar patrons, about half of my current output is based on donors of less than $10 a month. It is really up to all of you you how much I can keep writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I would continue to write with or without making a dime, but the more bills that I can pay without having to slog off to a day job or a side gig (or a day job \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e a side gig), the more time I can focus on doing even MORE writing. More posts. More content. Better quality. And faster turn over on my fiction. I set up this Patreon so that my readers, should they wish to, would have a chance to support these endeavors as well as have the warm and fuzzy feeling from providing patronage to an independent artist who provides all his art to the world for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you like me, like what I do, and want to see it continue and/or more of it, please consider becoming a patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNOTE:\u00a0If you\u0027d like to support me as a writer, I welcome that support as I have skyrocketing rent and insurance like everyone else and might like to live in my own tiny studio some day instead of sharing a two bedroom with three people, but PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE don\u0027t \"fund\" my social justice writing in a vacuum. (My political snark I don\u0027t mind getting paid for, though those thoughts often dovetail.) I don\u0027t do the social equality part of my writing for money. I have my reasons for not being able to be a full-fledged \"social justice advocate/activist/writer/warrior,\" and I refuse to be making a paycheck off of these struggles that are not mine. I\u0027ll do these Social Justice Bard posts and call out privilege on my Facebook no matter what. I promise. If the gestalt of my writing appeals, great, but if you only want to see more social justice posts, please donate to the causes themselves (BLM, SPLC, Planned Parenthood, Equality Now to name just a few) or writers\u2013particularly women of color\u2013who are writing about their own struggles and without whose hard work I would never be able to articulate such ideas.  Thank you.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
