At its core, what makes us all human is our ability to\nkeep fighting and innovating while ensuring a future for the next generation.\nThat is what our ancestors did hundreds of thousands of years ago, and if they\nhadn\u0027t done it then, and continued to do it throughout all of history, we\nwouldn\u0027t be where we currently are: sitting comfortably at the top of the food\nchain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe story of humanity is about living, thriving, surviving,\nescaping, fighting, existing, and \u003cstrong\u003ehoping\u003c/strong\u003e\nthrough seemingly insurmountable odds. This unwillingness to be broken is epic\nin proportion and scope- yet integral to understanding human nature. Moving\nfrom the dawn of mankind and the blossoming of culture, to the expansion\nthrough the land-bridge between continents, to the change from nomadic to\nagrarian societies, to the rise of civilizations, all of history was born in\nAfrica: the cradle of humanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis project embodies the spirit of the ancient Adinkra\nsymbol called the Sankofa. It means \"Go Back and Fetch It.\" It tells\nus the importance of working through our collective past so that we can move\ninto the future. I have decided to take the spirit to heart in all aspects of\nthis project while transcending the subject matter. While I am using the new\ntechnology of augmented reality to tell this story, I am interested in\nreturning to the beginnings of major storytelling breakthroughs. The aesthetic\ndraws from early charcoal cave drawings (the first storytelling medium). By\npresenting it as a shadow play, I can draw from the beginnings of acted out\nperformance. By presenting it as black and white, I return to the origins of\nfilm making. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe presentation will be through wall decals arranged in a\ntimeline of events from the moment that humans discovered how to make fire, leading\nup to present day. It will be broken up into 3 sections: the beginning, the\nmiddle, and the now. When scanned, it will look like charcoal cave drawings\ncome to life and act out the story on the wall in a kind of shadow play. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project will be released episodically beginning with when humans first discovered fire. The episodes will be released with accompanying decals that you scan to get the next part of the story.\u003cbr\u003e"
