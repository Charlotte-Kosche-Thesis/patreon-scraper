In this space the priority is \u003cstrong\u003ethe practice of midwifing our individual and collective wholeness. \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThe word midwife means \"to be with\". We can not be with or wholeness, individually and collectively, if we can not be with our shadow. \u00a0Midwifing the shadow is a commitment \u00a0to dive for the light, by all means necessary. \u00a0In this space we embody love in action through the practice of sharing and listening, witnessing and dreaming together. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s get creative together. Let\u0027s question. Let\u0027s practice listening. Let\u0027s hear each others stories. Let\u0027s see ourselves and each other beyond the illusions our culture of oppression have projected upon us.  Lets grow together.  Let\u0027s challenge and support one another.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.healinirie.com/\"\u003eConscious Kitchen\u003c/a\u003e prepares nourishing vegetarian meals, mostly locally sourced and made with love, reverence and honoring of ancestral wisdom.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout the meal, intentionally curated prompts will be offered for us to reflect on and talk about with one another.  After our meal we will hold a larger council over tea and close in meditation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease join me and our neighbors in nourishing an awakened community that cares about learning how to be with each other. \u00a0We know it will take practice, that we will stumble and fumble along the way and that we all have a lot to unlearn. \u00a0Let\u0027s all enter with both a learners mind and a commitment to doing our part to face our shadow and dare to be whole. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eM Y * P A T R O N * G O A L S for Nourishing Conscious Community are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) \u003cstrong\u003eGuest Speaker Fees.\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0I have a goal of bringing a speaker to the end of year Nourishing Conscious Community gathering. \u00a0However I desire to keep the gatherings accessible to participants. \u00a0With the support of patrons like YOU I will be able to host the speaker at our end of year gathering.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) \u003cstrong\u003eBase Funding Costs. \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently, I have to charge folks to cover some of the costs for meals as well as the platform I use to obtain tickets to the gathering. \u00a0With the support of patrons like YOU I will be able to host these gatherings at no cost to attendees.",
