I\u2019m a Florida girl, who can eat her weight in street tacos, loves wine,\nher fat cat, grumpy dog and worships the written word. Whether I\u2019m writing them\nor reading them, words are my jam. Okay, words and tacos. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWriter, dreamer, wanderer, gypsy soul, pirate, adventurer,\nmagician, wino, romantic, storyteller, joyful. Those words pretty much sum me\nup. I\u2019m a free spirit, who truly believes magic can be found between the pages\nof every good book. I decided to take a leap of faith in 2013 and stopped\nwishing I was a writer and became one. I\u2019ve published 18 books to date, both\ntraditionally and on my own indie label. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOn a normal day you\u2019ll find me locked away in my closet with\nmy dog, writing all the words. (Yes, I literally write in a closet. And people\nsay writers are quirky. Wonder where that idea came from?) I take breaks to eat\ntacos, hang out with my awesome husband/publishing partner and of course\nrehydrate with the nectar of the gods. (vino - wink, wink.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI write Fantasy and Young Adult fiction, publishing on average 10 books a year. This is mainly possible by the sear amounts of\nblack coffee I mainline and the fact that I write in my sleep. I\u2019ve dreamt the\nidea for just about every book I\u2019ve written! The dream starts over until I\nwrite it down! I guess my inner diva wants to be heard. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u2019ve heard of me, it\u2019s probably thanks to my epic\nfantasy series, The Geneva Project. Those four little books started it all. My\nYA Boyfriend series and Romance Retreat Series are also near and dear to my heart.\nYou could fill a whole bookshelf if you tried to collect all my books and anthologies.\nThank goodness for ebooks, right? And Patreon! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://thegenevaprojectbook.com/Pateron_HeaderGraphics_510x125_2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBooks are expensive. They\u2019re pricey for avid readers like\nyourselves, and the publishing process can get costly too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWriting is the easy part. And the fun part in my opinion. My\ngoal is to get my magic (words that is) into your hot little hands as quickly\nas possible. Partnering with Patreon can help make that happen. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll the money my supporters pledge will go to my publication\ncosts. And in case you\u2019re wondering, it\u2019s not all tacos and wine:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEditing\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eMarketing and Advertising\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eDesign and Formatting\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003ePrinting\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eTranslation to audio, braille and multiple languages.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eSchool visits\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://thegenevaprojectbook.com/Pateron_HeaderGraphics_510x125_3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy goal is to make my books a reading experience that is even\nmore enjoyable for my readers. (That\u2019s you guys.) That happens by getting\ninvolved. When you pledge your support, you\u2019re not just giving me money. You\u2019re\nbecoming a part of my work. You can help inspire characters, tell me what you\nlove and want more of, or heck let\u2019s just bond over our shared love of books,\ntacos and wine. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen you make a Patreon pledge you become part of my tribe.\nI\u2019ll keep you updated on what\u2019s new in my life. We can share pet pictures.\nYou\u2019ll see videos about books before they release and participate in exclusive\nQ\u0026amp;A sessions that you help direct. Whether you\u2019re an aspiring author,\nreader, blogger or friend, Patreon is a great place to connect with like-minded people.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://thegenevaprojectbook.com/Pateron_HeaderGraphics_510x125_4.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTime for the good stuff. What do you get besides to say\nyou\u2019re friends with quirky old me? Books! And lots of them!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a patron, you\u2019re essentially supporting my dreams. And\nthat is something huge and should be rewarded. I\u2019m going to send you\nstories as I write them. They\u2019ll mostly be fiction, in any of the various\ngenres I write in and they\u2019ll mostly be sent digitally so you get them quicker!\nFor those of you that long for the Eau de Real Book, there are tiers where\nyou can make that happen too. Want even more cool book stuff, like special\nedition art, and character inspired creations? Yep, you can have that too. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBottom line is you get full access to my newest fiction,\nspecial swag and bookish goodies before everyone else! And you get to know that\nyou made it happen. You are supporting a magical art. Words have the power to\nbuild worlds or tear them down. I promise you that I will weave my soul into\neach story I send your way, offering you an adventure you can escape into for a\nwhile. Maybe it\u2019ll be a brief journey, or maybe it will change your life. I know\nyour support will change mine. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
