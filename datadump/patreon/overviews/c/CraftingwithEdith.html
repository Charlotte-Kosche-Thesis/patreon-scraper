They are afraid of the liability.  After the \nlast job I was very depressed so my husband encouraged me to start this \nchannel as a way to cheer me up, I think he was worried I may do \nsomething foolish.  The channel is fun but it is the support of viewers \nlike you who inspire me to keep making new creations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe really enjoy giving the creation and seeing someone really happy to have received it.\u00a0 Life is the primary inspiration for the things we create.\u00a0 One of our goals is to circumnavigate the world creating unique items along the way.\u00a0 As we go we will create tutorial videos and videos about the our journey around the world.\u00a0 Once we have a boat we plan to start a drawing to select one of our patrons to join us as crew for a week each month so you can craft with myself and Edith in an exotic location.\u00a0 Our puppy Edith is one of our inspirations, she fills our life with interesting adventures.\u00a0 Edith loves to cuddle while we work on creating crafty things and edit the related videos and so we are always Crafting with Edith.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you become a patron every dollar contributed in a month gives you 1 entry into a drawing for the creative things we make in the videos.\u00a0 Once we have a boat each dollar will enter you in a drawing for a week long visit as a crew member so you too can craft with Edith.\u00a0 Good Luck!\u00a0 Your contributions help us keep creating and making videos!\u003cbr\u003e"
