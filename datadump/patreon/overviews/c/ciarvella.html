I work(ed) for a public library for seven years and I think that stories should be available to everyone. I like the idea of content that\u0027s made freely available to anyone who is interested in it; I also believe that content has value and I like the idea of supporting creators who provide the content that I enjoy everyday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am making my novel \u003cem\u003eUnrepentant\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0freely available through my blog,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ciarvella.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCynical Idealism\u003c/a\u003e. Anyone can read it. I\u0027ll be releasing three chapters of the novel every week, so the entire book will come out over the course of about three months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you read \u003cem\u003eUnrepentant\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and you enjoyed it, please consider supporting me. I like to think of it as a tip jar for a job well done. Pledges will be collected on a monthly basis for the duration of the project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis isn\u0027t Kickstarter, so I don\u0027t need to reach a set goal in order for the book to come out. It\u0027s already done and it\u0027s freely available to you regardless. Thanks for reading.\u003cbr\u003e"
