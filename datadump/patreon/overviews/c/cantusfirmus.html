I\u0027ve done this by focusing on topics explicitly theological as well as by looking at art, philosophy, history, and science through a Christian lens. I hope to extend this approach even further through Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor\n me, this Patreon is an opportunity to do more of what I love while \ngetting a little extra financial help finishing my theology MA and \ntaking care of my family.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor you, it means rewards for your patronage, such as (depending upon your level of support) early \naccess to podcasts and new book projects I\u0027m working on (as well as \nstatus updates and opportunities to participate in the process), all of \nmy books in digital format, a special bi-weekly podcast that will discuss \nbiblical/theological issues as well as analysis of a theologically relevant movie selected for \nthat episode, and the ability to see and discuss the work I\u0027m doing \ncompleting my MA. At the $50/month tier, you can also get autographed physical copies of my books, a shout out in the podcasts, and the opportunity to suggest a film for me to discuss in the exclusive Patreon podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering supporting what I\u0027m doing and a special thanks to those who already are! I\u0027ll work hard to produce quality content that makes you feel like you\u0027re getting your money\u0027s worth.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
