This is a way for the fans of Christian Saint Photography to support the work I do and become a small (or slightly larger) part of my creative team! It\u0027s pretty much like being an executive producer but you can do it from your couch and don\u0027t even have to wear clothes. You can actually be a \"Christian Saint Executive Producer\" while taking a shit! I won\u0027t judge you. As you might guess, photography is very expensive and time consuming, not to mention the overhead of living in NYC, so in order to keep producing the images that I love (and hopefully ones that you love), I need all of the help I can get. This work is for myself and for my fans. I\u0027m currently trying to finish my second book and your support on Patreon, is helping me afford the time to work on that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eSweet dude, so how the @#$% do I do this @#$%?\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI see that you like to curse... that\u0027s cool, I do too on occasion. There are several cool reward levels that allow you to tailor your monthly support. For as little as $5 a month, you will have access to my uncensored image and photo sets tier. My page is set to \"Pay Up Front\" so you will be charge when you sign up and then you will be charged again on the first of every month, until you decide to leave. Each higher pledge level gives you access to new rewards and all of the rewards in the levels below that amount. Plus, you\u0027ll have the knowledge that you are just a little bit smarter and a tad better looking than everyone else. Regardless, you will have my gratitude and friendship, at any level. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I try to deliver:\u003cbr\u003e$5 Tier (Photo Sets \u0026amp; Uncensored Image Posts): 2-3 Exclusive Photos Sets per month and multiple uncensored social posts.\u003cbr\u003e$15 Tier (Videos): 1-2 Posts Per Month\u003cbr\u003e$25 Tier (Tutorial / Before \u0026amp; Afters): 1 Tutorial Per Month \u0026amp; 1 \"Before \u0026amp; After\".\u003cbr\u003eAll Tiers give you instant access to the archive of posts for that Tier and below.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eNo, seriously, what are you offering me that I can\u0027t just get at Kmart?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, pretty much everything I offer, you can\u0027t get at Kmart. I will be posting content each week that you can\u0027t see anywhere else, including: uncensored images, exclusive photo sets, behind the scenes, mature content videos, photography\n tutorials, including retouching and lighting techniques and signed prints. I am here to share my work and knowledge with the people that mean the most, my fans. You also get to support my art directly and have the chance to connect with me and let me know what you like to see, so the content is more interactive. I\u0027m pretty freakin\u0027 excited about the whole damn thing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eThat sounds AMAZING!!! Wait, back up, who the hell is Christian Saint?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am a Brooklyn based, professional photographer with over 20 years of experience in Advertising, Fashion, Celebrity and Fine Art photography. Since 2007, I have focused on tattoo beauty and independent (alternative) models, which does not pay the bills but is the work I love to create. I\u0027m hoping that by sharing this work on Patreon, and offering my years of experience and knowledge, I can continue to create this personal work, outside of my commercial career. I was the official photographer of Tattoo Life Magazine, shooting ALL of their covers from 2007-2015 and many more since then (non exclusively), as well as their annual Tattoo Energy Calendar. The 2017 Calendar is on sale now, shot in Italy, featuring model Karla Lambert. I\u0027ve also shot some memorable covers for Inked Magazine, including their sex issue with Christy Mack! I just published my first book, \u003ca href=\"https://www.goliathbooks.com/detail/index/sArticle/134/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\"Tattoo Super Models\" GoliathBooks.com\u003c/a\u003e and am now focused on my second tattoo model book project. These books are incredibly time consuming and expensive to produce, time that I will never make back with book sales. Your contributions will help me complete this project as well! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll content on my Patreon is registered and protected \u00a9 Christian Saint - All Rights Reserved \u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u2020 DO NOT COPY FORWARD OR REPOST MY CONTENT ANYWHERE FOR ANY REASON \u2020\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u2020 DO NOT USE MY IMAGES AS REFERENCE FOR YOUR ARTWORK \u2020\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
