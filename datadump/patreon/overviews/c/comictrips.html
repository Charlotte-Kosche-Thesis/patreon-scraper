    "summary": "Well, hello there. Allow us to introduce ourselves-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are Kat \u0026amp; Paul, two obsessed collectors that also happen to be married. We are originally from New Jersey, but in the Summer of 2017 we relocated to the Charlotte, North Carolina area. A few years back(March of 2015 to be exact), we began our YouTube journey together as we drove around our local area hunting for comic books and toys, with a camera(back then an iPhone) in-tow...as of Summer of 2017 we have filmed, edited, and promoted \u003cem\u003eEIGHTY\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0webisodes over \u003cem\u003eEIGHT\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0seasons of 10 webisodes each. We have in the past year also added subscription box and product reviews to our channel, with an occasional\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/bJsUYoGDwfI?list=PL4uAAj5adeRs9qWlDVjgS_hcO7Xk7guf6\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edrunk toy review\u003c/a\u003e, but those are few and far between since we aren\u0027t huge drinkers. Maybe we\u0027ll change that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have driven \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ethousands \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eof miles\u003cem\u003e(Over 4,500mi in season 5 alone!)\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to comic book shops, vintage toy stores, flea markets, antique malls, and comic conventions of all sizes as obsessed collectors looking to find that special treasure trove for pop culture gold, as well as meeting new people along the way. What this does is helps put independent businesses in the spotlight and in-turn hopefully will end up in them getting more customers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been described as \u003cem\u003e\"American Pickers for 80\u0027s Babies\"\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and \"\u003cem\u003eDiners, Drive-ins and Dives for nerds\"\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0by our viewers, and we take pride in that. We are told all of the time by our loyal circles that \u003cem\u003e\"Geez, you guys should have your own show on TV!\"\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0which is awesome, but also weird because technically don\u0027t have cable. Either way, that sentiment is awesome and we \u003cem\u003eGreatly \u003c/em\u003eappreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe difficult part of attempting to make a viable YouTube show with the feel of a TV show at our level is that there is \u003cem\u003ezero\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0financial support from the platform. With a comparatively minute amount of subscribers and views per video, ad revenue is next to non-existent, we don\u0027t receive sponsorships, and we don\u0027t seem to be on the radar of anyone who wants to fund us.\u00a0We have made these trips while working multiple jobs just to fund the channel and it\u0027s become strenuous on our personal/financial lives to keep it going. We love it, but we are \u003cem\u003eextremely\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0limited on what we can do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re \u003cstrong\u003ehoping\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0that for those who have watched our channel both new and veterans, will understand just why we have made this decision of turning to crowdfunding to help us. BUT, it\u0027s not like you\u0027re getting nothing in return! For being a Patron here on Patreon, even at the \u003cem\u003elowest\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0level, you\u0027ll be accessing things that the rest of the world will not get and most importantly, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eyou get to help us shape the future of our show...like an executive producer.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out our perks to the side, consider becoming part of THE COMIC TRIPS SUPPORT LEGION, and if you have any more questions, please don\u0027t hesitate to email us! If you\u0027ve made it this far, \u003cem\u003ethank you\u003c/em\u003e. If you make it farther and pledge, \u003cem\u003ethank you a whole freaking lot.\u003c/em\u003e"
