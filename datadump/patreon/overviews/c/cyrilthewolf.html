Hi, I am Connor Pelkey who does random internet creations under the handle Cyril the Wolf. Incidentally, this has nothing to do with the fact that my entire body is much like Gaston from \u003cem\u003eBeauty and the Beast \u003c/em\u003e(or The Beast for that matter.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a musician, conveyor of off-color humor and currently going bald. All of these things are important as all of my videos are either: music I have created, how to create music (using off-colorful metaphors to explain certain aspects of the creating/documenting process) and I whine about my Male-Pattern baldness a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA good idea of my sense of humor and musical style can be found in the video above! I would like to note that the  videography is more primitive than my current skills... but that is something I hope to use the money from the patronage to improve on with better technology!!! You can also direct various questions about me to http://cyrilthewolf.tumblr.com/ask which is a good place for me to see your question and answer it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
