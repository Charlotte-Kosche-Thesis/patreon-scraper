    "summary": "GREETINGS AND SALUTATIONS, and thank you very much for checking out this page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, most of you probably have seen my name up there, but in any case, I commonly go by the name Shook (not the LoL player, mind you), and would maybe qualify as a budding artist if you squint hard enough. As you probably already know, this is an unforgiving business to get into, so that\u0027s why I dare asking for support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee, I love drawing, and I like making people happy and/or entertaining them. I wish I could just keep making silly drawings for myself and those around me for free, but alas, money is a necessity in this world. Whether my stuff is worth paying for is not for me to judge, but I do hope that some kind spirit(s) out there would deem it worthy, because I really don\u0027t want to resort to cash grabbing, or \"selling out\" as some people might say.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what DO patrons get out of this deal? Well, beyond my eternal gratitude (which isn\u0027t worth a lot), patrons would get what amounts to a free commission every month, corresponding to their generous donations. At least for now, while there are few enough of you for me to be able to handle it. :v\u003cbr\u003eThese commissions, unless you explicitly wish to keep them private for whatever reason (do note: I will not draw risque stuff), will also be available for the public to view, since I\u0027m not too comfortable with the idea of making entirely exclusive content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe amount of monthly \"gifts\" is currently very limited since i don\u0027t want to risk swamping myself, but the amount may rise when/if i get more confident in my ability to deliver. Of course, you don\u0027t HAVE to get one every month, but do note that they don\u0027t stack up.\u003cbr\u003e"
