    "summary": "In the summer of 2016 I launched the Queird website with the explicit goal of promoting the work of queer, trans, and QTPOC artists. It has since been mainly focused on t-shirt designs, but I\u0027ve always hoped to expand to any conceivable art, but running an online e-commerce business is a lot of work and it\u0027s been slow going. In the time since I launched I have decided to run Queird as a non-profit with the additional goal of creating a plethora of resources for said artists in the form of a makerspace and retail store in Oakland. \u003cem\u003eI want to have tools and supplies available for all queer artists to make what they want to make and, if they so choose, a place to sell it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eLet\u0027s back up a bit though, because this is more my Patreon than a Queird Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Chloe Madison - I\u0027m a 32 year old white, queer, polyamorous, non-binary transwoman and I prefer ze/zir/zirs pronouns. I have spent most of my life trying to find where I fit in the world of capitalism. I studied broadcasting at a tradeschool, worked for a news station as a Photojournalist and ended up freelancing video productions as I learned to be a web designer. I stumbled into product design for web and mobile apps and was really good at it especially with my motion graphics experience through some of my previous video gigs. In January of 2015 I moved to the Bay Area with hopes of getting a job with a startup or established tech company as a designer. I did, but two years later I was fired for what I can only assume was an intolerance to my neuro-divergent behavior... mainly autistic traits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was devastated even though it had been a toxic work environment for sometime before then. It took me a month to realize a thread throughout my entire life that had always brought me joy -- making things... and especially making things with my hands. I was so brainwashed by the capitalist machine that I couldn\u0027t see the one thing that made me happy was \u0027economically viable\u0027. Art isn\u0027t a real job, right? (sarcasm)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that\u0027s what I\u0027ve been doing for the past few months, and I\u0027m happier that I\u0027ve ever been in my life, but my financial resources are starting to dry up and I\u0027m still investing my own money into projects like Queird and helping my community create things with the physical resources I have. I want to continue providing my skills at a discounted or free rate to those in my community who are significantly less privileged.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy recent acts in such manner include but are not limited to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelping to make large format prints on the large format printer that was donated to Queird\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e3D printing custom parts that would otherwise not be able to be found\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFixing someone\u0027s bike by helping them make a custom part with tools that I am skilled at using\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEmergency removal of a stripped bolt from a bracket\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThings I want to offer to my community\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eprinting, 3d printing, modeling, woodworking, repairs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003econsulting on any physical project\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003efree or reduced cost items that I am making to sell including stickers, patches, prints, shirts and more\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003emore - what do you want from me?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI, for a time, had a YouTube channel where I did DIY video tutorials and build blogs. I had hoped to keep this going, but it was just too much for me and I\u0027ve decided to focus on doing more consumable video content on my Instagram at: \u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/clomads\"\u003ewww.instagram.com/clomads\u003c/a\u003e  - I have been planning on doing more livestreams though... it\u0027s just the editing that kills me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf y\u0027all can keep me fed, I can keep working to make Queird better and better along with providing technical support to queer artists along the way."
