But everyone needs a job, and doesn\u0027t everyone want one that they enjoy waking up to in the morning?  That\u0027s what making music and videos is for me. With your help, I might actually be able to make the same music you enjoy at a \u003cstrong\u003ehigher frequency\u003c/strong\u003e (more songs) and \u003cstrong\u003eimproved quality\u003c/strong\u003e (more instruments, better mixing, fancy-ass cinematography).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eGreat, you get your dream job, but what do I get out of this racket, huh? HUH CHAD?\u003c/h1\u003eGreat question. Obviously the videos I make will still be free to watch, but I am 100% committed to making your donation worth whatever price you choose to pay. None of these rewards involve \u0027virtual high fives\u0027 or \u0027twitter follows\u0027 because let\u0027s face it, that\u0027s just an inflated way of making you feel special. What does have value is owning the music I make, getting a behind-the-scenes look at each video, engaging one-on-one with me via live-streams and concerts, and just making the overall experience richer for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eOk, I\u0027m listening...but can I trust you?\u003c/h1\u003eNo.  I mean yes!  YES!  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND ALL THAT IS HOLY--ok you get the point.  Think of it this way - the more money I get per video, the more resources I can put back into the product you\u0027re already recieving anyways.  You can either donate money for each video or set a monthly cap. I make 2-3 music videos per month, and if I\u0027m lucky it\u0027s 4, so at the very bottom level of patronage you will pay $4 a month and get 4 songs + a virtual high five (just kidding)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eAlright! Sign me up for $4,000 per video!\u003c/h1\u003eI really wish you existed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell that\u0027s that, I wanna be as transparent as possible and will answer any question you have ASAP.  Check out the rewards and see if any of that sounds like an awesome good time (cause it will be).  I promise you are missing out if you don\u0027t : )\u003cbr\u003e"
