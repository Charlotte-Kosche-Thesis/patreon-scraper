    "summary": "I\u0027m Chastity, I run a large number of quests on fiction.live (formerly known as Anonkun), with several having been fully finished, including\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fiction.live/stories/Exalted-The-Sun-s-Chosen/4T2zch4iXXYihWZAM\"\u003eExalted: the Sun\u0027s Chosen\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fiction.live/stories/Doll-Machine/FrAGga8yD7sXK7aq3\"\u003eDoll Machine\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fiction.live/stories/Ghost-of-a-Dead-Wife/zZ6GrRCEsrvseK65c\"\u003eGhost of a Dead Wife\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0I am currently running on an at least once-a-week basis\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fiction.live/stories/Repeater/rBsmtKRh9L938fxZA/\"\u003eRepeater\u003c/a\u003e. Prior to fiction.live, I ran a quest called Text Adventure Quest: Swordsage, which you can find an archive of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://pastebin.com/u/spookyscaryskeleton\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find a complete archive of all my quests (besides Swordsage), including the dead ones, on fiction.live\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fiction.live/user/chastity/stories\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve also taken to running a bit on \u003ca href=\"https://forum.questionablequesting.com/members/chastity.22228/\"\u003eQuestionable Questing\u003c/a\u003e, so you can find a bit more of my work there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading and enjoying my work! I greatly appreciate donations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIdeas Donor:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe basic idea is that I will run a quest divided into brief \"scenes,\" without any kind of central overarching story or characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach scene derives from a short pitch by an Ideas Donor, and follows a brief story arc. An example of a pitch would be something like, \"A former nerd who\u0027s become very wealthy meets an old bully, who is working as an escort to make ends meet. He takes advantage of it and turns her into (effectively) his sex slave.\" I would then expand this into an opening post setting up the basic premise of the scene, which in turn would be leveraged into a proper scene as part of the quest - probably on the order of three to ten thousand words, though possibly more if a scene works particularly well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen a scene is completed, a new one is selected by random roll from a pool of ideas contributed by Ideas Donors. Each contributor is assigned a single number, and if they submit multiple ideas, I select the one I like the best when I roll their number. There won\u0027t be any repeat rolls of the same contributor until either the new month or the exhaustion of the pool.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe quest will run at minimum monthly to the completion of one scene, but very likely will typically run more frequently than that. The monthly minimum is just that, a minimum commitment I expect of myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommissions:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am now doing direct commissions. For $10, you can commission a \u0026gt;1,000 word scene from me (and I\u0027ll write more for more money); 1,000 words being about the length of a typical smut scene in my various quests. You can provide as much or as little detail on the commission as you like, and I\u0027m willing to do fanfic if that\u0027s what you want (though I may need time to consume the media in question, if it\u0027s not something I\u0027m familiar with). If you\u0027re commissioning, you can also submit quest ideas for the ideas level too, for no extra charge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGeneral Notes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are contributing, you can message me on Patreon by clicking the little \"Messages\" option in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. This is much more convenient for me to sort through than connecting your account here to your account elsewhere, so please do it here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in donating or commissioning, here\u0027s a general list of what I dislike, so you can make your decision well-informed, and tailor any submissions to it:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eFemale-perpetrated rape.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\"Hard\" male submission: bondage, pegging, violence beyond the level of the girl gripping the man\u0027s head between her thighs, and so forth. \"Soft\" male submission (female guiding, on top, diminutive pet names, etc) is fine.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGore.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSerious, injurious violence (versus spankings, slaps, grappling/pinning).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePure yuri/lesbian sex (versus yuri as a flavor in an mff threesome).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYaoi (yes, including traps).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEmotionally uninvested sex, where the characters don\u0027t really have a connection, whether positive or negative (hate, love, respect, working relationship, etc).
