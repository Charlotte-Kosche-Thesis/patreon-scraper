    "summary": "Hello fans of the \u003cstrong\u003eCruising Off Duty \u003c/strong\u003eYoutube Channel. \u00a0The Channel is about Sailing and Travelling and how getting out and exploring by sailboat can be an excellent way to get away from the stresses of the day to day grind of work, kids and just life in general. \u00a0I have been a Police Officer for 23 years and needless to say the job can be stressful, so getting away from all of that and feeling the the serenity of travelling by sailboat and hearing nothing but the lapping of water against your hull, while being pushed along by the wind, is a great way to leave all of the daily worries and stress behind. \u00a0We spent the first sailing season of the channel exploring the Ottawa River but starting next season we will be on the 1000 Island area of the the St Lawrence and the Great Lakes. \u00a0The area is stunningly beautiful and I can\u0027t wait to document it and bring it all to the viewers. \u00a0I document these travels along with my wife Janice by land and drone videography.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese video take a lot of expensive cameras, drones, computers, software etc, to create (not to mention many hours of time). \u00a0Most people who do not create Youtube videos have no idea what the creators gets paid in advertising from Google, but here is the sad fact. \u00a0Ballpark, you can expect that a creator is getting around 1/3 of a cent per view. \u00a0That is fine if you are Casey Neistat with millions of views per video, but in the niche market of sailing and travel channels, the limited views just don\u0027t cover a fraction of the cost to produce the video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor this exact reason it seems like every major sailing Vlog on youtube has to turn to their fans through Patreon to help support the channel. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSo what would becoming a Patreon of Cruising Off Duty do for you?\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0Well, \u00a0check out the various reward listed to the right to see exactly, but, in a nutshell, at a certain level of support we can cover the cost of the equipment which means the Channel can keep up with the cost of camera equipment and continue at a slightly higher level. It allows for better equipment down the road and therefore better production value. \u00a0If the support grows to a decent enough level, then we can move up our 6 year plan to sell everything and buy a Catamaran and sail around the world documenting everything we see along the way and bringing it to you the viewers. \u00a0Hopefully the viewer gets real entertainment value about seeing far away places that you could never get to by plane.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that is the plan, it is just a matter of if that plan of living on a sailboat and circumnavigating the globe happens soon or waits until we one day retire. \u00a0Hopefully you have enjoyed the videos so far and hopefully you can see the value in supporting the channel, so that we can start doing full time, now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for any support,\u003cbr\u003eCraig and Janice.\u003cbr\u003e"

This is incredible and we\u2019ll work hard to show you how grateful we are for the opportunity!  You will have our ear all the way along and we look forward to having your direction as we produce episodes going forward.  You have shown that you are passionate about making Cruising Off Duty be at the best possible production level and the money you are donating to the channel will go toward keeping the production level high by allowing us to keep our camera and production gear at a high level.  With supporters like you, we  would be able to bring on help such as a dedicated video editor to allow us to spend more time making videos and less time behind the computer.  This will not only free up time to produce better quality videos but also more frequent videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou get all of the rewards listed at previous levels and more:\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou are a making the channel succeed so you need swag!

We are truly grateful for anyone that would even consider this pledge, you\u2019ve literally (and figuratively) moved us.  With support like this we, no longer have to work at our regular jobs and can retire now and expedite our plans to start sailing around the world immediately. You see a tremendous value in what we create along with the knowledge we\u2019ve gained and shared over the past and you see the value in Cruising Off Duty in the future. \u003cbr\u003e\nWe can\u2019t even think of a proper title to give someone so generous, but since you are financially supporting the channel, you deserve to be the President of the Production Studio.  With this pledge amount, you\u0027re allowing us to focus solely on Cruising Off Duty and not worry about getting paid sponsors for videos where we have to say what the sponsor wants us to say. With this new freedom, we will not only be able to sail the world now but be able to afford to keep our camera gear up to top specifications and perhaps even get help with filming so we spend more time in front of the camera experiencing the world and bringing to the viewers than peering at it through a viewfinder.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe honestly don\u2019t know what reward we can offer for such a gracious pledge, but here\u2019s our current attempt:\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll of the previous rewards but more:\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe hug mentioned in the above level but, Oh who am I kidding?
