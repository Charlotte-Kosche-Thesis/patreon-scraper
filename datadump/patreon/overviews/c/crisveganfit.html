    "summary": "Hey there Everyone! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here a little bit about me (WHERE DID THE FITNESS COME FROM?)\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I was 80lb over weight. I wore jackets to cover \nmy stomach where I carried most of my weight. People asked me how far \nalong I was in my pregnancy and I had to explain that I was big... and \nnot pregnant. I had HORRIBLE self image. I hated looking at myself in \nthe mirror. I suffered from migraines and I didn\u0027t know why. I had \ndifficulty breathing, I had joint pains in my knees from carrying around\n extra weight. . . I felt sick and I hated myself. It just wasn\u0027t fun \nbeing in my mind a few years ago. I was around 24 years old and my \ndoctor told me my cholesterol was ridiculous and that I was already \nshowing signs of cardio vascular disease and that I should be very \nconcerned. One night I didn\u0027t go out with my friends because I had \nnothing to wear that would fit me anymore and I was embarrassed at how big I had \ngotten. Netflix was becoming a thing and I stumbled over a documentary \ncalled @ForksOverKnives and it changed my life. The first 5 minutes \ndescribed my health issues to a T on a typical American diet and how to \nreverse all of those issues. I went vegan that night and my first month I\n lost nearly 20lbs by just cutting out meat and dairy. My joints ached \nless and less... my migraines disappeared (it was from the dairy \nconsumption) I had more energy I didn\u0027t even know what to do with. I \ndiscovered weight lifting and kept going on my journey to loving myself.\n I made a connection to what was happening to animals after watching Earthlings on Youtube. The only way I got through the horrible footage is because I\n owed it to animals to watch what I had done to them for over 2 decades.\n I went vegan for my health, I stay vegan for animals \u003cimg src=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f42e\" style=\"margin: 0px 0.2ex;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f437\" style=\"margin: 0px 0.2ex;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f414\" style=\"margin: 0px 0.2ex;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f425\" style=\"margin: 0px 0.2ex;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f424\" style=\"margin: 0px 0.2ex;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f423\" style=\"margin: 0px 0.2ex;\"\u003eand the environment. \u003cimg src=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f30f\" style=\"margin: 0px 0.2ex;\"\u003eI just want my fellow brothers and sisters to feel happy with their \nbodies and to be healthy... I want people to stop contributing to animal\n suffering... I want complete animal liberation. Later, I worked as a personal trainer for nearly 2 years at an Anytime Fitness in Browns Mills, NJ. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eANYWAY! life happened and I got into real estate and moved to South Florida. \u003cbr\u003eSo where did the activism part come in?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere I was making some comfortable bank at an office listening to newly wed couples rant about what they wanted in a dream home. I remember thinking \"Jesus Christ... I could be at the University of Miami right now talking to kids about how their food choices contribute to environmental racism.\"\u003cbr\u003eI shit you not. Just ask Zoe Sigle *The Humane League South Florida Director* now currently the Denver, Colorado Director.\u003cbr\u003e Any event she would throw on Facebook I made sure to be there. I was either leafleting schools or participating in The Humane League or Vegan Outreach\u00a0 campaigns that involved protesting in front of restaurants or calling food chain supplies that were in cahoots with factory farms that were infamous for severe animal cruelty. I never had weekends off but when I would request them I would be in front of the Miami Seaquarium with a group of dedicated and consistent activists DEMANDING the release of Lolita the orca and informing the customers of her suffering and what exactly they were paying for. PART OF HER CAPTURE STORY HERE\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfwnpjghVk0\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfwnpjghVk0\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would participate in protests in front of labs where they are horrifically experimenting on primates or joining a crowd in front of the Chinese embassy in Miami where we were voices for the thousands of dogs tortured and slaughtered during the Yulin Festival. Mary\u0027s Ranch is a slaughterhouse in Hialeah, FL where more dedicated activist have gone on vigils. When you bear witness to horrors you can expect some PTSD\u00a0 due to the screams of animals begging for mercy during slaughter. I would record their screams and the type of people that would do this to animals. All of these forms of activism I have posted it on my social media.\u00a0 (INSTAGRAM; @CrisVeganFit) that currently has over 35k followers and I use it as a platform. I don\u0027t use my big audience to twerk and make duck faces to. I use it to make a difference. I was great at real estate sales....but I\u0027m fucking awesome at creating awareness about animal suffering. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is where you come in. All of us have bills to pay and mouths to feed and lets face it...an animal rights activist doesn\u0027t get a pay check. We just want people to wake up and I\u0027m pretty IN YO FACE about it. I\u0027m going to paint activist art, I\u0027m going to write positive affirmations and send them to you or even post videos here on Patreon. (Painting and daily positive affirmations have helped me cope with my PTSD) I\u0027m going to customize workout routines and nutrition plans (according to your needs and goals) for those who support me and who seek fitness guidance. I know what I\u0027m doing but your donations also help me with my PLANT BASED NUTRITION CERT so that I can tell your \"how do you get your protein\"ERS that I know what the fuck I am talking about because I went to school for it.\u00a0 I have posted videos on Instagram of me singing and people want me to make my own music...and studio time means money. I\u0027ll be creating tracks on a straightedge living (drug free life) animal rights, women\u0027s rights, human rights,...basically shit that matters instead of (party this...take pills that...and hoes all day) the crap that\u0027s usually played on the radio to distract you from all the shit out there that\u0027s going on.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSumming everything up...your donations help me;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSTUDY vegan nutrition to help others\u003cbr\u003ecreate awareness of plant based fitness\u003cbr\u003ecreate awareness of animal rights\u003cbr\u003egas money to get to protests\u003cbr\u003eorganize local protesting and leafleting events\u003cbr\u003ebuy supplies needed for events or online activism\u003cbr\u003estudio time for singing\u003cbr\u003efuture animal and sex trafficking survivor sanctuary \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eyours in animal welfare, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCristina Di Paolo \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
