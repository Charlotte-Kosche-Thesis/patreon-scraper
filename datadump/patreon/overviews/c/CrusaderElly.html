I\u0027m very active when it comes to tabletop RPG\u0027s (D\u0026amp;D 5e) but the goal here is something different entirely: publishing a book!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.pathsofdestiny.co.uk\"\u003ePaths of Destiny\u003c/a\u003e is a fantasy novel based on WoW, one of Blizzard Entertainment\u0027s popular universes. The story is split into 4 volumes, with the first 3 describing a physical and mental journey between characters. Each volume focuses on a different character and plot, until they all converge. The story is filled with love, mystery, adventure, action, and heart-wrenching moments, as well as plenty of references and symbolism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write in my free time, outside of work, and couldn\u0027t have come as far as I did without the help of friends, family, artists, editors, web designers and others. I\u0027m thankful to each one of them for lending me their expertise so I can actually show the story to the world and bring it alive. That said, I want to do even more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVolumes 1 \u0026amp; 2 are ready to go, and I will post 1 chapter each week. Volumes 3 \u0026amp; 4 are in process. In addition, I want to write alternate \"what if\" scenarios. I want to write a 5th \"volume 0\" to detail the events that happened before. I want to visualize more characters into actual portraits. I want a comic series. And I\u0027ve got a storyboard ready for an animated short. All of these, and more, are currently distant dreams - but perhaps, with your input, they could become possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love my work and want to get involved and see it ascend to something greater, please do have a look at the rewards on the right. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEither way, thanks and enjoy!"
