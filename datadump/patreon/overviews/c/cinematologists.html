    "summary": "Thank you for dropping by our page and if it was our podcast that brought you here, thank you for already listening to us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started the Cinematologists\u00a0podcast in March 2015 as a labour of love, combining the singular pleasure of watching films with a passion for debate about cinema as an art-form. Our aim was to try and combine the live, almost tactile\u00a0electricity of the film experience with the intimacy of heated post-film social debate, contextualised with an accessible yet scholarly incisiveness. Up to this point, our podcasts have been produced bi-monthly, usually focused around a cinema screening where we record an introduction to the film as well as the post-screening audience discussion. These \u0027live\u0027 sections are complimented with guest interviews featuring filmmakers, academics, actors and critics all of whom bring unique and fascinating insights to the specific films and questions of cinema culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, we want to bring you more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to bring the podcast to different venues across the country and interview even more fascinating guests who we hope will inspire and challenge you. We also want to create different types of episodes and extra content that expands both the scholarly potential of the programme but also offers the potential for us to expand debates into new areas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has certainly been a difficult decision for us to set up this Patreon account. We are still not sure whether it is the right one (or whether it will work at all). It was never really in our mindset to \u0027monetise\u0027 The Cinematologists and the core podcast will always be available for free, ad free. We know that we have a growing and loyal audience for the show and we want to be able to give our audience the opportunity to support us in a meaningful way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is not about the money for us. We want to expand what we do at The Cinematologists\u00a0and if you could support us in even the smallest way we will be eternally grateful.\u003cbr\u003e"
