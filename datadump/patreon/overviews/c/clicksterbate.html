It sucks. Even more so when it\u0027s accurate. Add to that the rise of the fake news sites, that attempt to toy with your emotions in hopes of getting some click-coin. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWouldn\u0027t it be great to have a news source that never raises your blood pressure, simply because you already know it\u0027s not true?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eEver?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eNot even a smidgin?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my dream for ClicksterBate.com. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://clicksterbate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/smallerevilaliens.jpg\" style=\"width: 397px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA regular presentation of news so entertaining, so spectacular, at times\n so ... (dare I say it? - yes, I dare!) uplifting, that I had to make it \nall up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve toyed around with the idea of a venture like this for some time, but recent developments have spurred my motivation. After a relatively long term position followed by a couple years of free-lancing, I recently re-entered the job market. It became clear fairly quickly that I\u0027ve \"aged out\" of the profession I was in for decades. All of the hiring managers I interviewed with were much younger than I. At my last interview, I nearly slipped off the stripper pole. An awkward situation at best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m banking on Patreon to amuse an audience, and make a living:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n I\u0027ve been involved in many different web based media projects over the \nyears, using many different financing/funding models. When I decided to \nstart \u003cstrong\u003eClicksterbate\u003c/strong\u003e, I considered an advertising-driven model, but \nrejected it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t get me wrong, I don\u0027t think there is anything \ninherently wrong with advertiser support. If you\u0027re dealing with tens or\n hundreds of thousands of readers, it can be the most accurate metric of what your audience wants.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n But I don\u0027t expect to ever have that sort of readership. My goal is \neventually a couple thousand (ish) fairly regular readers who share and \nappreciate my warped sense of humor. If I was being supported by ad money, I \nknow in time I would end up writing for the advertisers, not the \naudience. Advertisers, intentionally or not, inevitably impose \nthemselves in the editorial process. Again, this does not make them \n\"bad\", it\u0027s just human nature. And in the case of much higher volume \nreadership, almost a necessity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Given that I like to poke \n(mostly) gentle fun at everyone, I\u0027d end up stepping on the toes of the \npurse holders at some point. I don\u0027t want to live under that constraint.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n So far, \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e seems the best avenue for me to reach an appreciative \naudience, make a living, and as a bonus I\u0027m able to engage my audience \non a regular basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://clicksterbate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/smallernorealm.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s to a long, strange trip!
