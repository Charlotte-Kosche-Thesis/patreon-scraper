    "summary": "Starship Valkyrie is a live-action, sci fi, role-play event that serves as a tactical simulator and leadership course. Participants take on the role of the crew of a starship and attempt to resolve the scenario presented by the game master. It\u0027s stimulating, and hectic and really satisfying when done right. This sci fi world of Valkyrie, or the storyverse, is created in real-time in response to the actions of the players. Did the players save that hostage? That imaginary person may go on to affect the future story. Did the crew insult the aliens while executing their mission? That could impact future relations between Earth and that alien species.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been wanting to use Patreon for a long time, but I haven\u0027t been able to think of a way to do it. Pay me per game of \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Starship-Valkyrie-134298213272664/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eStarship Valkyrie\u003c/a\u003e that I run? That\u0027s not right; what if you didn\u0027t play in that game? Besides, if you did, you *already* paid me; why would you pay me twice? I could post the reward of a description / video of the event, but that\u0027s a lot of work, and frankly, not much of a reward for my supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarship Valkyrie events generate a lot of information, and the players talk about it for a long time afterwards. The best games have ramifications on future events for years to come. When that information gets collected into a permanent form, it turns out to be very popular - even with people who weren\u0027t at the event. Players want to know what happened and they like to discuss what\u0027s likely to happen next. They want inside information on this alien species or that new technology. They want to take the pulse of the Storyverse.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what I will do. I will write 3 to 5 page articles on various Starship Valkyrie storyverse elements. Then, what you\u0027re paying for (in small increments), is some fun, interesting, or exciting content that builds out the Valkyrie-verse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis accomplishes a few things: \u003cbr\u003e1. It motivates me. I\u0027m lazy so this is good. \u003cbr\u003e2. It builds Starship Valkyrie. People are always looking at the blank spots in Valkyrie and shaking their heads. How much trade occurs between the Earth Republic and the Skelow? How much beer can one Versa buy? How many Tardek are left alive after their planetary cataclysm? I want to explore Valkyrie and answer these and many other questions. \u003cbr\u003e3. It generates a product with some measurable micro-value all on its own. If I write an article on \u0027The One Republic Shipyard,\u0027 or \u0027hyperspace travel,\u0027 or the \u0027Rise and Fall of the Committee,\u0027 someone could potentially read that article as a stand-alone piece, enjoy it, and use it for their own purposes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please support me to generate this content for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
