Due to this, I needed to find a platform that can help me keep my Artflow circulating as it is much more than a physical art. \u00a0I really work on energy and try to give love and healing with my Art. \u00a0It moves and inspires many. \u00a0I would appreciate your time in watching my video explaining further of my Art and your support is so appreciated. \u00a0Much love to all xoxo\u003cbr\u003eCarmen Amara\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/qHnkjDF_gSs\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/qHnkjDF_gSs\u003c/a\u003e"

     "about": "Carmen Amara\u2019s fans recognized her as a professional artist, health and fitness model, dancer, singer, and advocate for planet preservation; but where did it all begin?\u003cbr\u003eAt just two years of age, Carmen started to dance.  She already exhibited traits unique for a child so young.  She had extremely advanced body awareness and a great appreciation for fluidity and movement.  As she grew and matured, so did her senses, spirituality, and ability to manipulate her body; Carmen had exceptional flexibility.\u003cbr\u003eThroughout her young adulthood, Carmen experienced many things that assisted her learning how to be in a sound state of enlightenment \u2013 mind, body and spirit.  She indulged in a variety of mentally and physically-challenging social activities, including: cheerleading, dance (ballet, tap and jazz), gymnastics, capoeira, break dancing, rhythmic gymnastics, and singing.  Conditioning of the mind and body was always at the forefront of whatever she did and, as she continues to experience life, she continues to evolve.\u003cbr\u003eFor Carmen, practicing \u201cArt Flow,\u201d which incorporates many facets of fitness, dance, flexibility and spirituality \u2013 activities constantly present in her life \u2013 is an everyday regime that must be followed just like any other disciplined activity.  She works intuitively to have the best understanding of her body and movement patterns \u2013 from the way she breathes to acclimating to various surfaces on which she exercises or performs.  To many without understanding, it may sound primal; however, it is imperative to stay present and aware of everything \u2026 all the time.  Even while asleep, Carmen maintains a constant meditative state that is much deeper than when she is awake.\u003cbr\u003eCarmen is also a Reiki Master by Santiago Dobles and Jed Shlackman.  Her art heals by relaxing the mind putting her fans into a trance state, which is how she applies her energy.\u003cbr\u003eMany people greatly appreciate Carmen\u2019s fitness regime, and she is highly sought-after for instruction.  She doesn\u2019t see herself as some type of \u201cfitness guru\u201d because \u2013 for her \u2013 it\u2019s not only about the physical.  Carmen is a firm believer that one\u2019s spirit must be kept nourished daily so that our bodies will be well.\u003cbr\u003eCarmen is Nationally-recognized as a leader in the health and fitness industry for her ability to inspire people by teaching strength through art.\u003cbr\u003eCarmen is one of the foremost sensual contortionists.  The moment she awakens, she begins to prepare (sometimes taking up to six hours) physically for her sensual art performances, which incorporate both Art Flow and meditation.\u003cbr\u003eCarmen attributes her growth as a contortionist to Emil Valentino \u2013 an amazing and talented contortion coach.  Emil saw Carmen\u2019s stretching video on Facebook and immediately recognized her special talents and passion to learn, so he took her under his wings to learn more about this very fascinating form of art.  Other inspirations include Zlata, Ernesto Sarabia and Soul Motion.\u003cbr\u003eCarmen is a genuine person who has been faced with \u2013 and overcome \u2013 obstacles and adversities.  She is a very selfless and kind individual who thrives on helping and enlightening others on how to achieve their greatest potential in a positive and healthy manner.\u003cbr\u003eWhen asked how she would describe her accomplishments so far in life, Carmen replied \u201cUnconditional love of one\u2019s self must exist for everything else to fall into place.  Ultimately, I have used all my hardships in life to rise like a Phoenix.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eACCOLADES\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCarmen is a very talented artist who has performed at a variety of venues.  In addition to being an aficionado in the health and fitness realm, she is also a vocalist.  She has been on national television where she sang for Univision.\u003cbr\u003e(2015, December 21). \u201cTeaching Strength Through Art.\u201d \u003cem\u003eUSAToday.com\u003c/em\u003e.  Winner \u2013 photo essay.  Professional artist, Carmen Amara of Amara360 in Miami, FL was selected out of thousands of artists and performers to appear in a national photo essay in USA Today on Teaching Strength Through Art.\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, her Art Flow has been presented at Art Undressed for the past two years.\u003cbr\u003eWhile no stranger to national stages and exposure, Carmen prefers to do her performances in her own home.\u003cbr\u003e",
