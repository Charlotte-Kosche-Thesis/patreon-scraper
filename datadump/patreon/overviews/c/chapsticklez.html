Hopefully you love it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing fanfiction since purple-mimeographed Spock/Kick fic was sold under the table at conventions. Anyone else remember the smell of those pages? I write the stories and worlds that are interesting to me, currently that being the canceled \u003cem\u003eRookie Blue\u003c/em\u003e, like my marathon 100 chapter \u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/works/2216241/chapters/4859400\"\u003eOut With the Old\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve done \u003cem\u003eRizzoli \u0026amp; Isles\u003c/em\u003e and even \u003cem\u003eXena\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my stories have something in common; they\u0027re not simple. I strive to write real people, and real\u00a0 decisions, and sometimes the characters do stupid things or make wrong choices. And sometimes I misstep trying to tell a story. But I don\u0027t write easy and I don\u0027t write angst. I write what someone once called \"grown up fanfiction.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal with this Patreon is not to make gobs of money and tell people to pay me or I\u0027ll never publish anything again. This is to help push me, to thank me, and to encourage me. No more. No less.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow This Works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen a new chapter of a work is up, Patrons get it first. The different tiers get different levels of access. A week after the new chapter is up, the stories are published on FFN and AO3 for everyone to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA new chapter is produced at least once a month, usually between 5000 and 10,000 words. Generally chapters are posted every three weeks, which means twice a month at some points in the year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Get\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides just the stories, Patrons will also get \u0027friend only\u0027 rewards. The stories I \u003cem\u003edon\u0027t\u003c/em\u003e post on FFN/AO3 for whatever reason. They may even be original stories. You also get the occasional behind the scene telling of what really happened, or why a choice was made. And of course, you get a hotline to ask me questions you\u0027d rather not in public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/chapsticklez/posts?tag=patron-only\"\u003eYou can read all those Friends Only stories using the \u0027patron-only\u0027 tag.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
