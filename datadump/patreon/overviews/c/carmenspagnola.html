    "summary": "Basically, I could (and sometimes do) talk about the nature of soul all day long. I\u0027m lucky to have some deep-souled folks around me to do that with. I thought I\u0027d invite you to listen in, in case you\u0027re not so lucky as me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, when you pledge to be my patron, it\u0027s kind of like I\u0027m your favourite barista and you\u0027re leaving something in the tip jar. \u00a0Or I\u0027ve invited you over for dinner and you\u0027re bringing the wine. Or I helped you move and you\u0027re buying the pizza and beer. There\u0027s obviously no obligation, but the acknowledgement really means a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a more cerebral level,\u00a0I created my show so I could capture the thought-provoking ideas of my smarty pants friends and normalize topics like spiritual longing, the collective unconscious, and the decline and re-building of culture. The world needs some medicine, my friends. So I\u0027m seeding soulful thoughts and amending the soil of our culture with words like \"spirit\", \"sorrow\", \"initiation\" and \"reclamation\". We create our world with our words. Lets speak of great things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Numinous Podcast is published every week or so by me, Carmen Spagnola, using an old version of Garage Band with a microphone macguyvered onto a swing-arm lamp and pantyhose stretched over an embroidery hoop to reduce the pops on my s\u0027s, t\u0027s and p\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I could upgrade my sound quality. I could do fewer Skype interviews and more on-the-spot recording or capture conversations when I\u0027m travelling! I could have a sound engineer do a pass over my shows to equalize the volume and smooth it all out before publishing! (Mercy, I\u0027d faint if I could do that. That would be amazing to me.)\u00a0I could upgrade my computer so it doesn\u0027t have to \"think\" for 30 seconds every time I click and reduce my editing time by HOURS. I could get a real intro with better music professionally recorded! (Still using my husband\u0027s mellifluous voice, of course).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may not feel as irked by my sound quality as I am, in which case you may just want to support as a way to indicate that you like what I\u0027m doing and would like more of it. In either case, thank you thank you thank you for your support!"
