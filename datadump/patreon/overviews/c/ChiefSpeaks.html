     "about": "\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MassBayCanna/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eChief\u003c/a\u003e is a seasoned entrepreneur with years of expertise in myriad fields of business. A native of California and the Founder and Manager of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://massbaycannabis.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMass Bay Cannabis (New England\u2019s Original Cannabis Club)\u003c/a\u003e , the U.S. military veteran has a wealth of experiences he brings to any table. Civically engaged and community involved, Chief utilizes his passion for justice to inform and educate others on the positive benefits of medicinal cannabis use. With focus, determination, and tenacious vision, he also works to debunk the myths surrounding its criminalization, all while seeking to change the cannabis narrative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s been no easy feat and change has often been gradual, but Chief has persevered. A selfless business owner, he constantly spends time considering and implementing methods to ensure that the masses receive correct information about medicinal cannabis, and its healing and relief properties. As a result, Mass Bay Cannabis was birthed out of a desire and need to provide this education, information, access, and quality resources to adults, all while building a better industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://massbaycannabis.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMass Bay Cannabis\u003c/a\u003e is just one of many enterprises Chief owns and operates, but it is by far the most meaningful to him. Proof of this can be found in the zest and fervor with which he speaks on and navigates the cannabis arena with politicians, community leaders, legislators, and the like. An advocate for change, he recognizes that in order to influence change, he must be at the table. This is why Chief has been so intentional and strategic in his approach to changing the medicinal cannabis narrative. It\u2019s more than just trying to get people to consume cannabis\u2014he\u2019s working to improve the overall quality of health and life within communities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith research to substantiate his findings, Chief is creating an alternative, moral cannabis system instead of the profit versus people model currently being offered. He is not alone in his sentiments. The evidence is clear when looking at the recent growth and expansion of Mass Bay Cannabis. Its newfound popularity is a testament to the hard work Chief has been putting in to change the landscape of how cannabis is socialized. The services, access, and guaranteed privacy Mass Bay Cannabis offers has left many satisfied consumers returning for more education, information, and resources. It\u2019s also a result of the overwhelmingly positive repertoire Chief has in the Greater Boston community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChief\u2019s life work far surpasses the novelty buzz surrounding cannabis though\u2014he has worked tirelessly as a medicinal cannabis consumer rights activist for decades. After finding personal relief in treating his post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms from his time in active duty, Chief felt indebted to sharing its innumerable benefits. Today, he endeavors to bring social equity in cannabis to the Greater Boston area and beyond as never before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile incredibly humble and modest, Chief is a pioneer to say the least. His vast knowledge base and commitment to the ins and outs of all things cannabis have granted him a large network and solid connections in a variety of industries, as he walks a path of unchartered territory. His heart for helping, saving, and protecting others extends far beyond the war zone to any and every community he is a part of. Mass Bay Cannabis is another outlet for Chief to operate in his innate gifts, which has and will continue to yield much rewards and success for not only himself, but all involved.",
