That thing, he wields no power over you. For you\u0027re the angel of death and I\u0027m the proof of it.\" Eliath thrust her upper body forward, drenched in the sweat brought about by a horrific nightmare. Ever since she fought against the King of the Ghouls more than seven years ago she has had an inexplicable resurfacing of the same shaking anxiety and fear that enveloped her on the day she faced him. Gallagher, the boy she loved has increasingly been a voice in her nightmares and dreams of late.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd an army made of monsters flesh marches abreast the northern nations of mankind and in numbers seemingly beyond the capability of humans to resist. The monsters, they\u2019ve come beyond the Vale, a land completely unknown to humans. Their migration has spurred a conflict, called the Great War. Eliath is one of the great heroes of the earlier years of the Great War, a war that once was thought to be over when the creature of bones died and Eliath triumphed over it. Now the war begins anew and the powers that be and the old heroes of mankind rally to fight the monsters that are born of the earth. However, Eliath begins to find that the ghoul are not the only thing that lies beyond the Vale and that true nightmares lie ahead. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuick Summary\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/span\u003e: The Efflorecent Shadow and its sequel is about Eliath leading an army in a seemingly hopeless war against a growing army of monsters and slowly learning about the world behind the wall mankind has built to keep them out.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003ePreview\u003c/span\u003e :\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1klMDJt0L32_5XOqe-AdgZ4w6T3Hl0QuqxIMvy_VEENY/edit\"\u003ehttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1klMDJt0L32_5XO...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003eExcerpt\u003c/span\u003e :\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\"The young teenage girl chose the hill adjacent to her to ascend and better assess where she was in the world. When upon that purplish hill she finally did stand, she was struck with awe and paused completely as in her waking eyes she witnessed a creature far off near the horizon following the wandering river. The beast was of such a magnitude, it was rare to see something so large even in dreams. She could not discern its entire figure but it moaned and thundered through the maze of this titanic forest. Its skin was as black as the void of night and it apparently had only three legs extending from its lower body. Two steep charcoal pillars of smoke rose into the heavens behind it, exuding in torrents from its spine.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt was actually quite beautiful, its moans were like a song. A song longingly sung to any who could hear. It almost sounded like the beast was lost and lonely.  Maybe it is looking for something it could not find. Perhaps it was just as lost as Eliath. Though she wouldn\u2019t dare get that close to it, it may have a beautiful song but that was not reason enough for her to trust it. Its cries soon turned to from song into sorrow, when one of the moons in the sky began to clot the light from the sun. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnimals from all over the forest began to run to the south. It wasn\u2019t long before a deep darkness conquered all that was bright here and in turn the forest began to glow with bio-luminescence. The many different kinds of colors danced in tandem with the wind. Eliath ran into a nearby slippery cave carved from the slow erosion of the river. At the mouth of the cave, she could hardly see through the sudden darkness. Eliath could hear the sound of the oncoming stampede swelling in the echos facilitated by the narrow walls of the cave.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSuddenly animals of all different sorts began to burst over the hill she had earlier descended and in their retreat, they sent debris cascading to and fro behind them. Eliath soon was to see what was chasing them, but it would first have to get close. Amongst the many figures wading through the dust, a shape began to manifest itself to her. Out of the dust came a horribly mangled looking human body, overgrown with bulbous tumors and flesh broken open by tentacles and a secondary maw on its chest. With eyes glowing red and the sound of loose bones rummaging beneath a skin barely held together. In her sight, is a creature that would cause anyone to heave at its grotesque form, should they have the time to truly fathom what this was.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEliath had no such time, she was struck with fright that shook her composure to a greater degree than she was able to handle. Just by mere reaction to the sight of it, Eliath slipped on the mossy rocks beneath her and fell uncontrollably down the watery throat of the cave. Where upon reaching its bottom Eliath was hardly alive. Downed in a pool of shallow water, spitting and gurgling. Suddenly, In her head, a voice came to her, this time very different from Gallagher. This voice, very cold and rusted, it began to germinate in her mind.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u201cHumans have tainted the Vale. What lies beyond was never meant for your kind. The creatures from this beyond, will hunt you to your final breath. No where shall there be respite from us and the age of men will wither away.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA mangled human form began to slothfully tread toward her. She couldn\u2019t see it, the darkness simply too thick. The horrid noise of it, its fumbling and loose innards and dripping flesh, the sound tormented her. \u201cLeave me be!\u201d she screamed. She trembled to stand, where fear almost crippled her to stillness. She had no weapon and the darkness of the cave was nothing but strobing shadows before her ill-adjusted eyes.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003eThe Sci-fi Novel\u003c/span\u003e : \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eRampage\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt is planned to be 90,000 to 100,000 words long.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eSix chapters are currently finished.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFeatures an apocalyptic future, a maddening A.I construct, a quirky, yet lovable, adopted 14-year-old girl who named herself Robert.

Saturn aglow, a magnificent fleet of  ships could be seen launching and docking all around the planet. And in the clouds there were floating cities harvesting hydrogen. Billions of people were in her view. After all Saturn was one of the capitals of the solar system. But there was no one to talk to, out here was a lonely life. They\u2019re scavengers, she thought, low-lives, the bottom the food chain, no one of those billions would want to be friends with her even if she were to try. And every day she\u2019d watch these shining megaliths fly freely in the open ocean of space. Their hulls gleaming and powerful engines humming in her mind. She had asked once what life was like aboard one of those ships. The destroyers, the frigates, the trading ships. Ben had told her, life was no better there, the Consortium is an empire that spans several dozen moons and worlds. They\u2019ve conquered almost every planet outside of the core worlds and have done so with destruction and fear.

Robert climbed to the \u0027top\u2019 of the space station, opposite of the window of her room where she could see a different set of stars and the many other moons dancing in the glimmering wake of Saturn. Here she gazed out into the infinite darkness of space, thinking of other intelligent beings. Imagining if somehow their eyesight could extend like powerful searchlights out into space. Would she finally see that the universe is teeming with life? Would the sky then be pulsing with the light of millions of inhabited worlds?  How many of them could looking toward her right now and she couldn\u2019t even know it? If only she knew that they were out there--would she suddenly feel a great connection to the universe? Never again to feel lonely?\"\u003cbr\u003e"
