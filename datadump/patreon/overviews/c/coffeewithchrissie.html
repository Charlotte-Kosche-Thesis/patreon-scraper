Talking mental health is what I live for and this podcast is one more incredible platform I get to connect with you on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live and breathe awareness and advocacy for breaking down stigma. For 12 years I was tortured by an illness I had no idea I even had called Pure OCD. I was too ashamed, embarrassed, and afraid to ask for help or even tell anyone about the everyday hell I was in. Luckily I survived a suicide attempt at age 20 when I could no longer manage. After successful treatment, I fell into what I call the grief of the mental illness experience. I stayed in that place of shame and fear feeling isolated and alone again for another decade.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I pushed back in 2011 and started speaking out, connecting to people worldwide to help foster hope through advocacy, sharing my story and peer support!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy sole purpose has been to spread awareness not only about OCD, but about the toll mental health takes on our lives and how together, by sharing stories and supporting one another, we can eliminate stigma and help individuals feel less alone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so glad you are here and I hope that my podcast will bring you some connection and hope that you are NOT alone in your journey in mental health!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--Chrissie Hodges\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
