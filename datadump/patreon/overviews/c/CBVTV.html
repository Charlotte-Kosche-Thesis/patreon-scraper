    "summary": "The biggest response and I guess the most rewarding to me have been the videos that I made of some of the old time hunters. I guess there is a need to document the history of our sport. With all the modern day gizmos and gadgetry its nice to hear how the old timers did it. There are still some of those old timers out there, they aren\u0027t all gone yet and I have had many people contact me about getting out and documenting their story. Unfortunately, like a friend of mine once said, I was born good looking and not rich lol. So this is where you guys could really help. If I could get enough support I would make it a point of searching out as many of these guys that I could and if they are willing I will do an interview style video. Like the other videos I have made I will use any interesting pictures that they have. Maybe at sometime we could create a book of pictures and make it available to our supporters. I\u0027m still working on how all this will shake out and what is the best way to do it. The hound hunting community isn\u0027t that big so its not like I can make this on monetization alone. \u00a0But any help will be greatly appreciated.... THANKS!"
