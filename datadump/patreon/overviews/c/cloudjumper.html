    "summary": "Hi. My name is Merlin . . . yeah that\u0027s my real name ^^\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBy\n day I am a professional composer and musician, working mostly in \nvideo games and film. But at night I turn into an music-superhero \n(Cloudjumper), who fights for what he believes in: the freedom of music. \u003cbr\u003eI\n create music because of what one can feel listening to it. To me that \nis the priceless magic of song, and I want that to be available to \neveryone. \nI also play concerts whenever I can manage and busk in the streets where I can.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow I do it\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love the concept of artwork being used by other\n artists to create new amazing artwork.

At this point I do everything myself.

And also just spend more time creating awesome free things for everyone, instead of working all the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://cloudjumper.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/guitar.jpg\" style=\"width: 314px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eYou\n can think of Patreon as my virtual guitar-case, in which you toss a few\n dollars once a month, when you pass me in the park, and enjoy the music I \nplay. It is even better actually, because you can get cool stuff for it, and\n stay in touch with me. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s one of the biggest reasons for me\n to choose Patreon. I want to be able to talk with all of you, and listen\n to your wishes. I want to be able to thank you directly and share my \nexcitement and projects with you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a little like Kickstarter. The difference is that I don\u0027t ask you to give me $500 for one big project. I ask you to give 1$ or 5$ or whatever is right for you every time I create something, or every month. This way I can keep making things and make a living as an artist. You can stop any time and set limits, and even get some perks for it. It\u0027s secure and direct, and much more valuable to me than you buying my CD.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I LOVE Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI think Patreon,\u00a0 is a especially great way to support not-so-famous-yet-creators (of all kinds). It is secure, it lets you stay in contact, and it makes it easier for us creators to give back to our patrons. I like to know the people that support me will have a good experience doing so--and that they can easily reach me. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://orig09.deviantart.net/83cf/f/2012/343/d/c/my_fingers_by_zita952-d5ni3an.jpg\" style=\"float: left; width: 220px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003ePatreon is helping a lot of artist be who they are and share their work by giving you a way to support them directly. It makes me want to be a patron.\u003cbr\u003eAnd it makes me want to be one of these artists. Because one of the most beautiful things I know, is to feel that people believe in me and my creations. And that\u0027s what a patron is, right? Someone who wants to support you because they believe in you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\"Tell me more about yourself\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am a huge nerd. A gamer and a sound alchemist. I love mixing styles and\n sounds, playing with conventions. Using sound and music, I create and \nstimulate feelings. I want to make you laugh, cry, jump, bang your head,\n get lost in dreams, clear your mind, change your life, inspire you to create.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe that, in working for movies, games, the arts and the \n\u201cindies\u201d, I am giving back to the world of media, which is such an integral part of my life--on top of that, I do it because\n I enjoy it so much.
