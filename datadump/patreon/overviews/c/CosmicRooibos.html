I\u0027m the author of the Roadrat fanfiction/fannovel, \u003cem\u003eKisses from Inferno\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is the purpose of this Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThis Patreon is an opportunity for fans of the story to express their interest. Funds will be spent on commissioning artwork for \u003cem\u003eKisses from Inferno\u003c/em\u003e, which means that your pledges will be turned into even more content for the story and world. Thank you for taking the time to consider pledging, and thank you even more should you decide to do so!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWho am I?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing for several countless years ago when MSN Chats was still around, doing RP in chatrooms. When MSN Chats closed, I moved onto messenger RP, and then eventually LiveJournal/Dreamwidth. In October of 2017, I had to leave my position as a customer service representative due to stress levels greatly increasing my fibromyalgia symptoms, severely impacting my quality of life. As I\u0027ve grown as a writer, I found that RP wasn\u0027t quite scratching the itch like it used to, and with the extra free time I had on my hands, I decided it was about time to start fanfiction proper.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is Kisses from Inferno?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eKisses from Inferno \u003c/em\u003eis a romantic modern urban fantasy/action story about a demon exiled from his home in Inferno to a life on the mortal realm, and a witch who had lived most of his life estranged from his heritage and destiny before meeting aforementioned demon. Together, both of them discover newfound strength and a new perspective on life and the world through their time together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow did Kisses from Inferno start?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA friend of mine from Dreamwidth RP, of whom I would write out Roadrat with, and I frequently talk about alternate universes in which to inject Junkrat and Roadhog. Demon AUs had been very common amongst the fandom but they really exploded when Junkrat\u0027s Fallen skin came with his release in \u003cem\u003eHeroes of the Storm\u003c/em\u003e. The two of us had talked about the tropes that had been born out of the concept, particularly the demon Junkrat/priest Roadhog concept, but we started talking about approaching Roadhog from another, magic-aptitude angle. That\u0027s what inspired me to posit the witch concept, inspired by another fandom I had drawn much creative inspiration from: \u003cem\u003eBayonetta.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eHowever, \u003cem\u003eKisses from Inferno\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is not just an \u003cem\u003eOverwatch/Bayonetta\u003c/em\u003e crossover. Many concepts are borrowed and inspired from \u003cem\u003eBayonetta\u003c/em\u003e, but there is a wildly different emphasis on themes, and the pieces are put together much differently. In the end, \u003cem\u003eKisses from Inferno\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0should be a story that can be enjoyed by those who aren\u0027t familiar with either \u003cem\u003eOverwatch\u003c/em\u003e or B\u003cem\u003eayonetta\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
