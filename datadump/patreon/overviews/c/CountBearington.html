Thank you so much for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003eI am a 22 year old student from Scotland, about to start studying Digital Media at the City of Glasgow College. I\u0027m super excited about this because I have a burning passion for all things computer related.\u003cbr\u003eI live with my Dad, he\u0027s a pretty cool guy, much cooler than me if I\u0027m honest. He\u0027s a Stormtrooper!\u003cbr\u003eI love Bears, Reptiles, Cats and Coffee. Not all in the same way of course, that would be weird.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout The Bear\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my free time, I make YouTube videos and try to make people laugh. I love the work, and the challenge of always trying to think of fresh content, new things to say, interesting video titles, and most importantly playing games all of the time! Unfortunately, due to time constraints from both my day job and college I can\u0027t create videos to the standard that I would like to. There simply isn\u0027t enough time in the day to juggle that many things. That\u0027s where Patreon comes in, if you\u0027ll allow me to explain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout Patreon (and why it\u0027s so great!)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a system that allows amazing people (That\u0027s you) to help content creators (That\u0027s me) find the time to do what it is that they love. \u003cbr\u003eHow the system works, is that you can pledge an amount of money of your choosing, every month.\u003cbr\u003eThis then helps to enable me to have the right equipment and software, the time, and most importantly the peace of mind to be able to do what it is that I love.\u003cbr\u003eI can then continue to produce quality content for you lovely people!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I will be able to reduce the number of hours that I work in my day job without having to worry about not being able to pay my way in the world, while also putting that extra free time into recording and editing more videos. It\u0027s really a great system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBUT WAIT, WHAT\u0027S IN IT FOR ME?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m glad you asked. Now I am not the kind of person to ask for this kind of support for nothing, and that is why I am offering ALL of my patrons a number of special benefits. Some of which I\u0027ve thought of already, some will come soon.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first of these benefits is that I will post a link on patreon, every day, that will allow you to watch my latest video the day before it is publicly released. \u003cbr\u003eI will give shoutouts to my patrons every month in a special video to show my thanks to all of you\u003cbr\u003eAt the start of every month I will have a poll on patreon, allowing you to vote on which games I play next, and suggest things that you would like to see me do on my channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor patrons who pledge that little bit more to the cause, I will have a gaming session, at least once a month, in which I invite the patrons who have shown that extra bit of support to join me on Teamspeak and in game. These nights will be recorded and you will get to appear in one of my videos every month as a special guest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel like I\u0027ve rambled on enough, and still probably forgotten something. Thank you so much for reading this far and I hope that I can Count on your support in the future! (Get it, Count? Because I\u0027m...never mind)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
