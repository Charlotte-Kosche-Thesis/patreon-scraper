    "summary": "Since you\u0027ve made it here to Patreon, I better make this good. \u00a0I\u0027ve been thinking about participating in Patreon for quite some time. \u00a0I love art. \u00a0I paint every day. I love teaching people what I have learned. \u00a0I became interested in painting about five years ago, and have spent hundreds of hours watching videos and taking online classes. \u00a0I\u0027ve built a following on YouTube thru my Monday morning video series (Creative Heart Monday). \u00a0I also do various videos throughout the week. \u00a0I am a member of the Gel Press Creative Design Team and the Canvas Corp Brands Creative Crew. \u00a0I use just about every supply under the sun....but, don\u0027t worry...we will work with supplies that most people have and I\u0027ll let you know, in advance, what you will need and what you can use for substitutions. \u00a0Like everything we do, we improve as we grow, so I anticipate that this page may change (for the better) throughout our journey due to your thoughts and suggestions. \u00a0We will do many different projects together....from abstract paintings, faces, florals.....to 3D art, like beautiful boxes. \u00a0I\u0027m sure that we will change it up as we grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy videos on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/c/cyndicesare\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e are high speed. \u00a0The projects that we do here will be in real time and I will explain EVERYTHING! \u00a0As I mentioned, I\u0027ve taken lots and lots of classes from fantastic artists....but you know how it is when someone says \"do this\" and they do it really fast...then you do it and it\u0027s just not the same. \u00a0I won\u0027t leave you hanging, I will \"show and tell\" everything (hopefully, without boring you to death).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy Personal Life\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m 56. \u00a0I\u0027ve been married for 27 years. \u00a0I have one, little, yorkie/maltese and 2 chickens. \u00a0We live in the country, but close to town (if that makes sense). \u00a0I managed and sold residential and commercial real estate for 25 years. \u00a0When the economy took a dive, I retired. \u00a0That\u0027s when I started painting. \u00a0I have a quirky sense of humor and if you decide to become a patron, you\u0027ll experience that. \u00a0Politically, I\u0027m progressive. \u00a0I consider myself a spiritual person. Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m not going to get into politics or religion here.....live and let live. \u00a0I have one sister. We are very close. My parents live about 45 minutes away...which is the perfect distance (close enough for me to get there fast in an emergency, but far enough for them not to be in my business). LOL I love them very much. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy Should You Become a Patron?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will learn lots of, mixed media, techniques and create beautiful pieces with them. \u00a0I will be very attentive and when you ask a question, I respond quickly. \u00a0We can have a wonderful time here because I am very open to suggestions. \u00a0If someone has a special request, I will do everything in my power to accommodate. \u00a0I\u0027m not the best artist in the world (or even on Patreon), but I really want to teach what I have learned, build a community, and make other people excited about art. \u00a0When we finish our projects each month, I want you to be astounded by your talent!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s hard to ask people for money and, trust me, if I didn\u0027t need it, I\u0027d spend every, waking, hour putting projects on YouTube for free because I love it. \u00a0But, as we all know, life is expensive. \u00a0Even though my husband and I live a very simple life, as you get older, careers end and income dwindles. \u00a0I love my art and I love sharing it. \u00a0I will always put free videos on YouTube, but I would love it, if I could really teach people how to express themselves thru art. So, this is how I\u0027m going to try to do that. \u00a0I would appreciate your patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s an example of my art in a, super speedy, video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YqzoJSBzFuM\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePEACE!\u003cbr\u003eCyndi Cesare\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

When I dropped it, along with the screen cracking, the camera on the back was damaged. \u00a0I use the camera on the front to film videos, but I have a difficult time taking, nice, crisp, photos of my finished art. \u00a0I think that my videos would also be better for you to watch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. \u00a0Better lighting - I would like to invest in professional lighting to make my videos a better experience for the viewers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. \u00a0New printer - I would like to, eventually, have a nice Epson printer, so that I can make my own, high quality, prints. \u00a0Presently, I go to the printer\u0027s for my prints, which is not very cost effective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. \u00a0Canvases - As you might have seen in my videos, I use many \"used\" canvases that I purchase at Goodwill, etc. \u00a0I love making something new out of something old, but.......my goal is to sell at art shows and I wouldn\u0027t feel comfortable selling art on used canvases. \u00a0I would love to be able to purchase some large canvases and create some huge pieces of art. \u00a0Without a doubt, I would video the process!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBottom Line - My dream is to travel around my state and do art shows a couple times a month. \u00a0I want to teach mixed media art online and in stores. \u00a0I never want to give up creating videos for my YouTube subscribers. \u00a0I have been working towards these goals and have made headway over the past year. However, sometimes a person has to admit, no matter how hard, that they need a little help. \u00a0To continue to do what I\u0027m doing and add to my sharing with others, a little help could make all the difference in the world and I would be so grateful to everyone who helps to make my dream come true. (and I want to add that if you are reading this and are not able to become a patron, just knowing that you watch and enjoy my videos means so much to me)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePEACE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCyndi",
