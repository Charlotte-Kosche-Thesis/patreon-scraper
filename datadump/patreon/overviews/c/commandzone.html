Your Patronage will help pay for our weekly editor who will spend anywhere between 10-20 hours per episode (and more if you include render times for hour long videos). The money will also help us invest in more equipment to film higher production content such as our Game Knights series and Kitchen Table Fables. We also have monthly server fees, app developer fees, and web hosting. \u003cem\u003eNote: the Patreon money does not, and will never, go towards \u0027luxury\u0027 purchases for the hosts, specifically in the form of Magic cards and product.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e How does a per-episode Patreon work? Why per-episode and not monthly?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e Our Patreon is set to be per-episode, which means that we collect our Patron\u0027s contributions once per episode released. We chose this format for several reasons - there are sometimes months when we can\u0027t release our full slate of content, so we wouldn\u0027t want our Patrons to pay extra during off months or the holidays. The per-episode option is also the regular choice for almost every other podcast out there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: \u003c/strong\u003eWhat if you release more than 4 episodes a month?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon is great with its flexibility for its Patrons. You can set a monthly limit to how much you donate, so even if we release 20 episodes in one particular crazy month, you won\u0027t get charged more than your maximum donation limit (note: we will never release 20 episodes in a single month).

Aside from listening to the show every week, it makes a huge difference for us if you are able to share our Patreon with other listeners or your friends and family who might be interested.
