    "summary": "Hello. My name\u0027s Neil, and I\u0027m the creator, editor and writer of the \u003cem\u003eCommodore Format Archive \u003c/em\u003eat\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.commodoreformatarchive.com\"\u003ewww.commodoreformatarchive.com\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://commodoreformat.wordpress.com/\"\u003ecommodoreformat.wordpress.com\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s\u00a0a website dedicated to celebrating the Commodore 64 magazine of the same name, as well as the many great and often little known games that were released between 1990 and 1995.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE STORY OF THE WEBSITE SO FAR\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started the website in 2014 and it\u0027s always been free. Like you, I love \u003cem\u003eCommodore Format\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and I love the C64. The website has literally hundreds of articles: exclusive interviews with people I was told would NEVER talk,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://commodoreformat.wordpress.com/cf-interviews/\"\u003elike Sean Masterson and other staff\u003c/a\u003e. There\u0027s an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://commodoreformat.wordpress.com/everycf/\"\u003eissue by issue guide to the magazine\u003c/a\u003e which tells the story of the mag and the games - and we\u0027ve created dozens of features covering everything from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://commodoreformat.wordpress.com/1-dick-tracy-11-issue-6/\"\u003ethe real story behind the awful Dick Tracy\u003c/a\u003e to a chat with one of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://commodoreformat.wordpress.com/the-mevlut-dinc-interview/\"\u003eguys who worked on the doomed C64GS project\u003c/a\u003e. All of this is new. New stories, new information, and completely free. I\u0027ve done it for free for a very long time. And I want to do more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT WE WANT TO DO NEXT\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs the story behind \u003cem\u003eCF\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is almost told, I\u0027d now like to shift the focus on to the many wonderful, ,little known games that were produced for the C64 between 1990 and 1995 in the UK. Basically, the ones \u003cem\u003eCF\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0featured! We\u0027ve already done a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://commodoreformat.wordpress.com/top-ten-games/\"\u003etop\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://commodoreformat.wordpress.com/2470-2/\"\u003ebottom\u003c/a\u003e games rundown, but that\u0027s merely scratching the surface. I want to tell the stories behind the glorious, little triumphed budget games and the C64 carts that were produced for the ill-fated GS; I\u0027d like to chat with and talk more to the guys who produced the first wave of indie games that appeared from 1994 onwards, and..well, basically a lot more like that. If you\u0027ve seen our top and bottom rated features, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://commodoreformat.wordpress.com/cfs-best-of-budget/\"\u003eour best of budget\u003c/a\u003e - we\u0027d be doing more of that, in depth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHERE\u0027S WHY\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027M HUMBLY ASKING FOR A SMALL, MONTHLY OR ONE-OFF DONATION\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAll of this takes time. I\u0027m a freelance writer, and when I started the site I had a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0more time. Now I don\u0027t. My evenings (and all through the night!) are taken up with looking after our two very small children (a toddler and a baby). \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe time I used to have to dedicate to the site has simply vanished, and I can\u0027t use my time in the day because I need to be filling that with paid work\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAND IF YOU MAKE A SMALL DONATION, THIS SITE WOULD BECOME PAID WORK\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou probably follow me here. If I get enough patrons here, I\u0027ll be able to put aside time in the working day to write more. And I\u0027d really, really love to.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDON\u0027T WORRY - THE SITE IS FREE AND ALWAYS WILL BE.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it\u0027ll get a LOT bigger with your support. Truly, we can make it a celebration of the C64 in the 1990s, which is an era so many people don\u0027t know anything about. \u003cstrong\u003eIf you do decide to become a supporter, I\u0027ll give you access to a weekly blog in which I talk about all manner of things \u003cem\u003eCF\u003c/em\u003e and C64. You will also get access to every article we publish 24 hours early!\u003c/strong\u003e But I want to keep the site paywall free, so donations really are voluntary, if you can spare it, to help the site grow. Thanks for reading!\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
