We have been active in one form or another since 2000. The core members of the team are close friends and have been for all the years. (ALL THE YEARS!) We are tight knit and love and hate eachother like brothers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCBMPC:TV! is the creative output of the CBMPC! airsoft team. The channel, run primarily by UK ICS Captain Magaz, features airsoft action and gameplay videos from the perspectives of several of our team members, vlogs, reviews, a podcast and footage from the archives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a very active team who love the game and want to share our experiences on and off the field with you guys! We have been recording video content since 2006, but only started taking the Youtube game seriously in 2015. The past two years has seen the team more active than we have been throughout our entire life span. As a result our community has\u00a0grown incredibly and we hope to continue to grow in numbers over the next 12 months and eventually take over the internets! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What do you do with all the monies??\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nBy pledging to CBMPC:TV! you will help us do that. We would love to create higher quality content and shoot more regularly. Your pledges will help us with this. Everything you guys pledge from one wingwang all the way up to a million wingwangs (the currency of the future!) will go towards better camera gear, equipment and keeping us up to our nuts in airsoft guts... \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe last twelve months has seen us slowly replacing our older gear with better quality POV and weapon mounted cameras to improve the quality of the content we produce, so you guys can see what we saw in the moment as clearly (in some cases far more clearly!) than we did.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe will be continuing with season 2 of the \"Balls Deep!\" podcast soon, now with a new and improved set! We are planning on creating a whole new lighting setup and buying dedicated cameras for the show so every episode looks consistent and of the highest quality. We\u0027ve also got internets at the studio now so live streams will be more frequent! Of course, we will be putting together patreon supporter only streams to thank you guys!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Why should we support you??\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you enjoy our content (and I\u0027m guessing, as you are here reading this... You probably do...) and you want to see the channel grow and help us put out more content, more frequently and in better quality, supporting us will help that happen!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll also be putting together Patreon supporter only swag... You know you want to get your hands on that right ;)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOf course, don\u0027t feel you have to pledge to us. Regardless of how Patreon works out we will continue to expand CBMPC:TV! and create awesome content!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Magaz\n\u003cbr\u003e"
