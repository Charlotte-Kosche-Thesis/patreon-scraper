    "summary": "Creative potential flows through all human veins, as much a\npart of us as the air in our lungs and the skin on our bones.  It favors nothing and no one, coursing\nthrough us all equally and without reserve \u2013 but we each must choose for\nourselves \u003cem\u003eif\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e we will tap into this internal stream. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMost people are content to poke tiny holes in their creative\nveins, feeding one drop at a time to various aspects of their lives, using it\nwith caution and always wary of its volatile nature.  But mixed in among this crowd are others, others\nwho feel helplessly compelled to cut that vein wide open and let their hearts\nbleed freely until those creative waters wash over everything that they do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThese \u003cem\u003eothers\u003c/em\u003e are the\npeople that we like to call \u003cem\u003eartists\u003c/em\u003e.  They are the people who draw no lines between\nthe internal and the external, and who thus have no fear of bleeding out.  They consider passion and purpose one and the\nsame; and they breathe in life so deeply and so fully that their every exhale\nstirs the dead leaves of thirsty hearts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy these terms, I am an artist - each morning I rip my heart\nopen anew and I allow it to bleed all over these pages; and only by doing this\ndo I make enough room to drink more of the rich and succulent inspiration that I\nfind dripping from every inch of this world. \nI write not only because I love to, but because I have to -  it\u2019s either write or vacillate wildly between\ndissolving into nothing and exploding into galaxies. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI invest my most precious resources into my writing - I give\nit my time, energy, passion, determination, and I give it my hope.  I willingly lay my life at its alter in the\nhopes that my investment will be returned to me in similar form; and what I\nexpect in return is as layered as my investment.  Besides hoping that it will keep me grounded\nsomewhere in between disintegration and combustion, I depend on my writing to provide\nme with the freedom to continue spending my days immersed in my inspiration, to\ngive my readers the pure blood of my creative veins, unfiltered by agents and\nfree from the quantifying, monetizing, and categorizing of publishers. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nEach time that I write, I stand naked before you and hope\nthat you see the similarities between my uncovered soul and your own.  I hope that when my words shine you recognize\nit as the same light that burns within your soul; and I hope that when you read\nmy shadows that you have that much more courage to face your own.  But I also hope that you recognize that we\nshare the same dream \u2013 the dream that by working hard and staying focused, by\ntrying always to learn and grow, and by giving whatever gifts we have to give,\nthat we will be sustained enough to continue working, learning, and\ngiving. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have chosen, among many other such artists, to trust you\nwith the power to keep that a dream or to make it a reality.  I believe that there are many who feel as if\nthey are living in a world of plastic, despite the fact that just below the\nsurface it\u2019s made of pure gold.  And I\nbelieve that art often acts as a chisel that chips away at that plastic\ncoating, revealing the true luminescence of what\u2019s been hiding just beneath\nthat outer shell. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy investing in artists, you are helping to strip this world\nback down to its true nature.  You are\nempowering those whose products can\u2019t be manufactured and aren\u2019t covered in\nplastic; those whose products don\u2019t \u003cem\u003etake\u003c/em\u003e\nlike most others but instead they \u003cem\u003egive\u003c/em\u003e\nsomething back \u2013 they give back the soul, the raw energy, the authentic\nfeeling, and the relevant information that so much taking and molding and\nprocessing has smoothed over. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI ask that, if you have found inspiration, support, love,\nlight, hope, or just enjoyment from my work, that you consider investing in its\nfuture by supporting my creative freedom. \nBy subscribing today, you can help ensure that I can continue to learn\nand grow in my spiritual understandings and that I have the resources and\nfreedom I need to continue surrendering to my passion for sharing those\nunderstandings with language that\u2019s meant not only to communicate but to\ninspire, to intrigue, and to breathe a little bit of life into a suffocating world. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI thank you from the center of my soul and the bottom of my\nheart for your continued support and I look forward to hearing from you on\nsocial media and blogs.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWith Love,\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCristen\u003cbr\u003e"
