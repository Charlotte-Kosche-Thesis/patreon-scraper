A true polytheistic pantheon with a developed religious system\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe gods and goddesses (and devils) of Gaia each have their own focuses - whether war, fertility, life, death, secrets, or knowledge, etc - and are sacrificed to according to the needs and desires of the people. Even clerics and priests who are devoted to a particular god or group of gods still sacrifice to other gods when they desire good weather or a pregnancy or success in battle. Meanwhile, temples are not simply places of worship but actively provide services related to their deities - training soldiers, caring for orphans, healing the sick, storing and loaning coin, etc. Meanwhile a myriad of Saints and Anti-Saints allow players and DMs to port in their favorite gods and devils from other campaign worlds; Kord becomes St. Kord, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Player Characters are the Reborn; Most NPCs are New Souls\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRoughly 1% of the world\u0027s population are born with the souls of The First Men. These rare individuals have incredible raw talent (ability scores), supernatural survivability (hit dice/points), quickly master formidable skills and magical or martial abilities (player classes), are capable of rapid natural healing (hp recovery), and can have their souls strengthened by the gods or devils in reward for their actions, allowing them to grow even more powerful rapidly (experience points and leveling).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe other 99% of the world are born with new souls - they have basic NPC classes, cannot receive magical healing of any type, and require years of training and practice to master any skill or craft.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese two elements alone make a massive difference in creating a sensible and immersive world, with explanations for fundamental gameplay mechanics and the uniqueness and power of player characters. But that\u0027s just scratching the surface of Gaia, which has cohesive explanations for everything from magical abilities to creature types to powerful items and more, as well as a rich world (and cosmological) history.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEach Era of Gaia\u0027s history corresponds to a different Game System.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhile this starts with D\u0026amp;D - the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th eras corresponding to the relative editions - future eras can and will relate to tabletop systems set in steampunk, modern, and future/space eras.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe world of Gaia is developed and expanded by playtesting. \u003c/strong\u003eOur current playtest campaign is Oathbound: Divided We Fall, starting in the 127th year of the 5th era. As players adventure and develop their characters, world lore is shaped by both experiment and roleplaying.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Patrons get exclusive and advanced access \u003c/strong\u003eto formalized features of Gaia as they are developed, polished, and finalized as well as behind the scenes looks - and even involvement - at Oathbound gameplay.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs development of Gaia continues, we will have more playtesting opportunities and develop campaign world guidebooks, modules, supplements, game system adaptation guidelines, and even proprietary game systems. \u003cstrong\u003ePatrons will always have first access and PDF copies of all final materials.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards will change as we move on to new goals, so keep an eye out for updates!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"\"\u003eJanuary 2018 Update\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003eOur primary focus right now is playtesting 5th era lore with D\u0026amp;D 5e, including an adaptation of Pathfinder\u0027s Ultimate Campaign Kingdom Building rules and Kings of War battle rules to cover kingdom management and mass combat respectively.
