Tastefully.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOpen door policy:\u003cbr\u003eDisclaimer: I receive no salary for working on thedollop.net. None. No money, no swag, no kickbacks. What I have received is Dave and Gareth\u0027s official permission to be their site\u0027s official librarian. I have their blessing, which is exceedingly valuable. But that\u0027s it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHosting: I pay 89.95 every three months to the amazing people at SiteGround, for both sites, and I plan on never leaving again. I am digitally home. I pay 14.00 every month to Podbean for the podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIncome: As I stated in my bio, I am chronically ill, and suffer from intractable pain. I cannot return to work, and my attorney and I are in the process of proving that to the Social Security Board. I am at the final stage of that process, appearing before a judge; I have proved I can no longer pursue my chosen field. So my income is extremely limited. (I also have to wear spiffy braces on my fingers to type; pics upon request.) There Might Be Cupcakes and thedollop.net are a positive outlet for homebound me, and is a healthy tether with y\u0027all in the outside world. Plus, it keeps my funny bone polished.\u003cbr\u003e"

They have entrusted its digital home, \u003ca href=\"http://thedollop.net/\"\u003ethedollop.net\u003c/a\u003e, to me. Foolish mortals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI envision my role as such: Dave and Gareth built and own the house; I have stocked and maintain the rambling mansion\u0027s library, and host the parties thrown in said library.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI balance a kind and hypersensitive heart with a wicked sense of humor, meaning I can write, as I did for \u003ca href=\"http://thedollop.net/wp/blog/episode-119-dollop/\"\u003ethe episode 119 website entry,\u003c/a\u003e \"Mutiny on the High Vaginal Seas! aka You and Your Barber-Surgeon\", and yet be careful to never mock a person for the essence of who they are as a human on this planet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have fibromyalgia and Ehlers Danlos Syndrome: Hypermobility Type, but they don\u0027t have me. My chronic illnesses are not an open secret. Questions are welcome. The basic breakdown is pain, vertigo, fatigue, weakness, and the danger of dislocation. Yes, I am in constant pain, about a 3 or 4 on the universal pain scale. I think that might make me an honorary superhero, at least a mutant. Yes, those wicked multi-joint silver rings I wear are actually braces, to keep my fingers from hyperextending.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eYes, I will show you what my fingers hyperextending looks like; it\u0027s kinda cool looking. Yes, I have good days and bad, and I have learned to fake normal through the pain, so that I am not an insufferable maudlin ass, so my presentation can be confusing. \"But you don\u0027t look sick\" just means I am doing my best to not get my pain, vertigo, fatigue, and various other symptoms all over your good time. A good day for me is most likely a day you might consider taking as a sick day from work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore information than you may ever want: \u003ca href=\"http://butyoudontlooksick.com/\"\u003ebutyoudontlooksick.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eI\u00a0am a voracious reader. That\u0027s a huge part of why thedollop.net is such a perfect fit for me. My best friend says that the website is what the inside of my brain must look like--silliness, facts, randomness, and unexpected connections, peppered with perky profanities and  bouncy exclamations along the lines of \"Oh, my God! Did you know that--\" It should be a surprise to no one that I apparently spontaneously began to read before the age of two, in my pediatrician\u0027s office. Witnesses!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0was a kid in the \u002770\u0027s and a preteen and teenager in the \u002780\u0027s. That should tell you all you need to know about my musical, movie and tv tastes, and my hangups.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0have one of those really loud laughs. I do not enjoy life halfway. I devour books and information. If I love you, I am enthusiastic about my love, and why not? Life on this rock is cold and short. Come here and get another hug, damn it! And I laugh from the bottom of my soul, one of those room-stoppers guaranteed to either irritate or induce others to laugh. My laugh is as dorky as I am, wouldn\u0027t want it any other way. But it is an odd accessory for a shy introvert. Further proof that God has a sense of humor.\u003c/blockquote\u003e",
