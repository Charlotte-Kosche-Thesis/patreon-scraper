Though I\u0027ve worked as an editor and as a writer, I am probably best known for my comic critiques and thoughts regarding the diversity (or lack of) found within various entertainment industries. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShould any of the rewards I offer spark your interest please consider becoming a patron. However, if you are a fan of my content I certainly appreciate you regardless of compensation!

I also want to make a commitment to myself and to my readers to focus on fiction. Finally, I want a regular outlet for my obsession with marketing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my first Patreon. I admit that I am learning as I go, but I would love to have you along for the ride! Whether you decide to become a patron or not, I am so glad that you are here."
