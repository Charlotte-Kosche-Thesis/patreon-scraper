    "summary": "Dear beautiful\nhumans,\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my\nPatreon page! Thank you so much for\nstopping by.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMany of you\nare people who have been really generous supporters of my work in the past. Maybe you bought a few extra copies of \u003cem\u003eThe Rewind Files\u003c/em\u003e for Christmas presents,\nor you\u2019ve trucked out to warehouses and coffee shops and tiny performing spaces\nall over Portland to see my staged readings at the Fertile Ground Festival, or you\nmade a donation to support \u003cem\u003eDear Galileo\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr maybe you are a total stranger who stumbled here by accident, in which case, hello new friend!\u00a0 You can learn more about who I am on my website here - \u003ca href=\"http://clairewillettwrites.com/\"\u003ehttp://clairewillettwrites.com/\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAs artists, we\u2019re\nconditioned by the world we live in \u2013 and to an extent, I think, by our own insecurities\nand fears of failure \u2013 to devalue our work, to do things for free for \u201cexposure\u201d\nor to feel guilty when we ask for what we believe we\u2019re worth. Asking people to\nsupport and invest in the artists whose work matters to them has been my job for\nthe past thirteen years. I\u2019ve raised\nmillions of dollars for arts organizations as a grantwriter, but it\u2019s always\nbeen a hundred times harder when I\u2019m asking for myself. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo please be\ngentle. This is scary.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMany of you\nmay have backed Kickstarter or IndieGoGo crowdfunding projects before (like\nmine a few years ago for the first reading of \u003cem\u003eDear Galileo\u003c/em\u003e). Patreon works\na little differently. On Kickstarter,\nyou back a project; on Patreon, you back an artist. On Kickstarter, you know exactly what work of\nart will be brought to life with the donation you made; Patreon is a leap of\nfaith. Patreon is an investment in a\nperson who has ideas they want to share with the world. Instead of making a flat donation one time to\nhelp a creator reach their goal, in exchange for a set of concrete donor\nbenefits, you make a recurring monthly pledge, which can be as little as $1.\u00a0 There are a few different levels of benefits, but the main one is that an artist whose work you care about gets just a little bit more financial stability\nto help them continue to do the thing they do that you like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo I am here\nto humbly say, I have things I\u2019d like to write, and things I\u2019m writing right\nnow, that I think are worth supporting, things that later you might be proud to\nlook back and say that you helped bring into being. I\u2019m working to complete a stage-ready draft\nof \u003cem\u003eDear Galileo\u003c/em\u003e for The Sheen Center\nin New York City, who are considering it for production. I\u2019m outlining a second and third book in the \u003cem\u003eRewind Files\u003c/em\u003e series. I have a musical and an opera in progress with\ntwo terrific composers that I\u2019d like to carve out time to be able to finish\nsomeday soon. I have a concept for a brand-new play (a \u003cem\u003eTwin Peaks\u003c/em\u003e-ish murder mystery with an all-women cast set in a 19th-century Canadian whaling settlement) that\u0027s on hold until I have the time and resources for travel and research.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a writer is amazing and exciting and it is also terrifying and unstable. Even a gift of a few dollars a month makes a huge difference.\u00a0 And then we both win, because I get to keep writing plays about space and books about time travel for you to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support, it\u0027s more appreciated than you know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLots of love,\u003cbr\u003eClaire\u003cbr\u003e"
