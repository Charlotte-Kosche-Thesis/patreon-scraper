    "summary": "Fleshing out lore, forming human connections, this is something media has a tendency to skip over to tell a very specific, insulated story. But what about all those other people? What about the blacksmith that almost died, or the little girl that lost her family because of the actions of the hero.\u003cbr\u003eThis is what I do. I give stories to the people the screen forgets. I breathe life into the scenes that served a specific purpose and flesh out the vague details of a half-remembered story about a blade or a set of armor.\u003cbr\u003eMost of my work would include writing about already established worlds and characters in a way I perceive them. Most of my work involves an OC that interacts with the world.\u003cbr\u003eThere is a work that I would love to work on outside of these fanfictions, however. Pledges would provide me inspiration and breathing room to work on the original work and perhaps even convince my artist to draw some illustrations or even comic pages out of what I write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides that, I enjoy spending time replaying video games from the SNES era and up and talking about how much I loved them and the design choices I think work and don\u0027t work and that sort of thing. My artist and I played through a lot of a Hard Mode ROM Hack of Final Fantasy Tactics for the PSP. I also did a full playthrough of Secret of Mana and I intend to play a lot of other games, like Xenogears and Secret of Evermore and I have to finish FF6.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost pledge funds would probably go toward video editing software for the Let\u0027s Plays and hardware upgrades for the artist and myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would be more than happy to take commissions.\u003cbr\u003e"
