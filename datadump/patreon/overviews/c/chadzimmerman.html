I always have made these videos for free, and I will continue to do so, but if I impacted your life enough for you to want to help support me in this, or you just want some shweet exclusive shwag: I wanted to give people the opportunity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonating to this campaign will allow me to not worry about high and low traffic times, making my ends meet or worrying if a piece of equipment breaks. I cover all of these on my own dime, but if you\u0027d like to ease my mind a bit I\u0027d greatly appreciate it. However, I won\u0027t take this sitting down! Below I have many options from exclusive stickers, sponsors, bootie-touches, even song translation opportunities to say the least! If you\u0027re going to support me in this way, I want to make sure I can thank you all properly. \u003cem\u003e*I\u0027ll be updating and adding new tiers each month as this crazy thing I\u0027ve built grows, so stay tuned in, and thank you so much for reading this mess :) Carry on!*\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Huge hugs*, sincerely and from the heart; Thank You All. I can\u0027t do any of this without you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll shipments will be made by me by the 31st of any given month. Each month you\u0027ll get different versions of each tier! If you have a specific thing you\u0027d like in a video description or sponsorship, just send it over to my business email: bookingpedestals@gmail.com and put \"Sponsorship for (Donor Name)\" or \"Description for (Donor Name)\" in the title. \u003cstrong\u003e*International shipping maaaaay cost extra*\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
