I also maintain a personal blog and YouTube channel on the side. (Check it all out at ChrisWitmer.com.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m sold out to the idea that following God is a wild adventure and young people can change the world if we live wholeheartedly for God.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write articles and make YouTube videos challenging my own generation to do just that: live wholeheartedly for God. I believe there is wide-open potential for young people to change the world and to see us waste that potential would break my heart. I am so ready to see a generation enthusiastic about serving God with everything they\u0027ve got.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, all of this takes a lot of time, yet I still have to find ways to support myself while doing it all. That\u0027s where you come in. Through your support via Patreon, I would be able to focus all my working and creative energy on TheRebelution and my other writing projects (such as the book for young men I\u0027m currently writing). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see, to the right there are different tiers and rewards. You can give $1, $5, $15, all the way up to $100 if you want. In return, I give you special access to me or my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve benefited from my work or want to see it expand and grow, would you consider becoming a patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt would be an incredible honor to have you join the ride!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank-you!"
