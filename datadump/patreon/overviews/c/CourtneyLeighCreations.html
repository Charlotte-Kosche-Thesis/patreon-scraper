I milked goats every day growing up, tackled emus, rode horses, and later went on to study fashion design/costume design in the big city, but after all that I\u0027m here. I\u0027m a small business owner who loves to create. I\u0027ve been cosplaying for about 9 years, but I\u0027ve been a creative soul since I was born. I feel I have a lot to give and would love for you all to join me on my new ventures!\u003cbr\u003eTake a look at my tiers because I\u0027m going to be doing monthly photos here on Patreon and I\u0027ll also be providing some tips on cosplay crafting!

I am more than thankful for what my business has given me already, but I would LOVE to give back by doing tutorials and creative photoshoots for you all and connecting more. Patreon will help me by taking some of the stresses of my day job away so I can dedicate more time to making videos and doing creative projects to share with you lovely creatures \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve been following me for a while, you might be able to tell that my costuming projects have taken a hiatus, but not by choice. I would LOVE to make more tutorials, do more photoshoots, and create bigger and more amazing costumes. I would love to set aside time to really engage with my audience and create new content.\u003cbr\u003eMy patreon is here for people that want to take that extra step to help me continue doing what I love.

No more than a month after highschool, I moved to Los Angeles to get my degree in fashion design. It was a rocky start after I graduated college, but here I am today, a small business owner! I\u0027m hard working, constantly creating things, and am what I like to call, \"hyper passionate.\" I can\u0027t stop and wont stop no matter what, but of course it gets expensive. Hence I was convinced by a few people to make this Patreon. We\u0027ll see how this goes!",
