In fact, it barely covers its own costs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, without significant improvement in CONTACT\u0027s finances, the pressure to \"get a real job\" again is ever-present. In fact I have been trying \u2013 15 applications in the past 12 months, with no luck. Which is lucky for CONTACT, because, at this stage of my life, if I did get a \u0027real job\u0027, it would surely mean a serious slow-down or even closure for CONTACT.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I hope you appreciate that your patronage, no matter how small, could have a significant impact on CONTACT\u0027s future \u2013 and I will be eternally grateful for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrian Hartigan\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eManaging Editor\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"mailto:editor@militarycontact.com\"\u003eeditor@militarycontact.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eor mobile 0408 496 664\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S.\u00a0I am on the high side of 50 years old, married to Rosie, with two adult daughters and one granddaughter.
