    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eColemanCollective\u003c/strong\u003e is a multidisciplinary performing arts company, founded by Cain A. Coleman, Charisma Glasper and Matthew  Perez, which aims to bring together artists as equal collaborators to produce art in various forms. This group features choreographers, directors, dancers, actors, writers, visual artists, musicians, and other performers who seek to share and create with artists of diverse cultures and disciplines through PERFORMANCE, EDUCATION and COLLABORATION. The artistic direction is suggested by Coleman and Perez, and the collaborators they bring on bend that vision to create something completely original and unexpected.  The effort to work towards a mutual understanding and create as a community is what fuels the collective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs ColemanCollective continues to grow and build new opportunities for performance, education and artistic collaboration, our budget and expenses grow as well. While we are a very young organization, our goals are larger then life. We hope to, not only expand our collaborative network, but to also build a brand known for educating young and mature artists alike, in various disciplines. As performers, aim to encourage, enlighten, and provoke our audiences. As educators, our goal is to encourage students to step outside of their comfort zone and grow as critical, versatile artists. To be multifaceted as a company or individual, is the future of the arts. We are currently running full speed ahead into creating productions built for proscenium theaters, while developing ways to present ourselves as space transformers and creating works for unconventional venues. We are attracted to invention and ingenuity, though we are significantly informed by tradition and history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs our goals and efforts towards a more developed future for the arts manifest, we kindly ask for your patronage. Arts companies in the United States are almost entirely dependent on private backing. Please help us reach our full potential by making a personally meaningful donation and encouraging your network to do the same. We have a very ambitious group of well rounded artists, with minds ready to create and voices ready to make change. Your support will allow us to step into the future of ColemanCollective with funding for rehearsal studio rentals, transportation/airfare, application fees, compensation for our artists, research/development of new and existing work, musical equipment, performance costumes/set/props, marketing fees and all other operations of business."
