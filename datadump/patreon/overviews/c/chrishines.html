    "summary": "My names Chris Hines and I\u0027m a vegan animal rights activist from the UK. This is only going to be a temporary intro for now until I get time to make something more substantial but I wanted to just explain why I have set this up. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a job, I am self employed running an online music magazine. Over the last few years I have got more and more involved in animal rights activism and this has now taken up a big chunk of my time. I\u0027m one of the main organisers of the Devon Animal Save group so do a lot of work and outreach with them, I have my youtube channel, I\u0027m making two documentaries (one on pets and one on vegans in music), I do college / uni talks on the subject, online debates and I\u0027m constantly doing whatever I can to try and spread the word and defend animals. It\u0027s basically become my second job. Due to all this I end up losing a lot of actual work hours and this is starting to affect my monthly wage each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to this, I\u0027ve had to recently put a lot of activism on the backseat while I work and obviously this doesn\u0027t help the animals much. I thought setting this up would be a good way to try and start to make up the cash I\u0027m losing when I\u0027m not working and allow me to balance the day job and activism without ending up broke and homeless lol The less I have to worry about money the more I can do for the animals. I feel what I\u0027m doing is effective and hence why I really want to push things forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you see value in what I\u0027m doing and want to help me do more, then please join and it will really help me out. If this gets going I\u0027ll try and set-up some perks and stuff like that for people as well.
