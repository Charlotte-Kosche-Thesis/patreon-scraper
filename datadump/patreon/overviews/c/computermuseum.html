    "summary": "First of all, thank you very much for considering becoming member of exclusive HomeComputerMuseum friends club. This already means a lot to us. You\u0027ll be able to help secure the future of this unique museum and be able to see and do exclusive things for Patreons only!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you found this page without actually knowing what this is about, here\u0027s an introduction:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eHomeComputerMuseum\u003c/strong\u003e is a museum about (home)computers based in the centre of the Benelux (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg), in the technical region of the Netherlands, close to airports like Eindhoven and Dusseldorf and easy to reach by train and car. The museum is 500m2 and has around 400 computers in stock. From the early Commodore PET2001, Altair 8800, Tandy TRS80 and Apple II all the way up to early 2000 pc\u0027s with Windows XP and Mac OS X 10.5. Since computers will break when they\u0027re not used, all computers are prepared to stay on during opening hours and ready to be touched by anyone who wants to. Even printers, modems, scanners and other additional hardware is connected and ready to use. We also have our own repair lab when something breaks. All computers are set up in a environment that\u0027s styled in the correct era. \u003cem\u003eIt\u0027s not a museum, it\u0027s an experience!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt least once per 3 months we do a big LAN-party where the newest computer is a Pentium 4. Meaning we do only old school gaming with games like Duke Nukem 3D, Red Alert, Wacky Wheels, Unreal Tournament and anything we fancy to do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a non-profit organization that gives chances to people with autism and teaches young children how the old computers work. We strongly believe that in order to understand the future, one must know the past. That\u0027s what we\u0027re doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eSee, feel, try, play \u0026amp; learn!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe also love to show these old, sometimes forgotten, computers on Youtube and on social media. We need funds to keep this museum up and running and that\u0027s where you can help!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get in return?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou\u0027ll be giving a free entrance for as long as you be a member. You will know first what will be in the museum soon and you get a previews or insights in the videos posted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also organize events which you\u0027ll be able to get it before it\u0027s public announced, some of them are even free for Patreons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere\u0027s the money used for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVery simple, the income goes out for rent and electrical bills (most computers do use power which is not for free alas). None of the money is used to pay salaries or buy computers, but we do need money to buy parts to keep the machines alive.\u00a0"
