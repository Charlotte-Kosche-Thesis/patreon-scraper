     "about": "We will keep this short since our promotional video covers it all, but the long and short of it is that the three of us started getting together every Wednesday morning to drink coffee, take a break and figure out how we were going to make an impact (and how we could work together to do so).  We called it \u0027Solving the World\u0027s Problems Coffee Hour\u0027.  We chatted about all kinds of ideas: research, new workouts, combining things, and crazy ideas we heard on podcasts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen it dawned on us.  We should start a podcast. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYep, that is how we thought we might be able to make a dent into the worlds problems (it all starts with a dent, right?)  So here we are now.  Several months of planning, brainstorming and politely asking Kyle\u0027s friend Justin (the awesome AV guy) if he could help us out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what it\u0027s all about is that Clinically Pressed is going to be a traveling podcast and we will be recording on location.  We are going to interview experts around the country from all health/nutrition/performance professions as well as include round table discussions covering major topics and questions.  Our goal is to provide as much information as we can that is useful to viewers/listeners, and do it all at no cost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to make the complicated simple and make it something you can apply to your life.  We hope you enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-CP Crew\u003cbr\u003e",
