After 6 years of touring and traveling with my beloved Taylor guitar, I was tired of constantly worrying about grumpy flight attendants and passengers who might inadvertently cram their luggage on top of my instrument. The size of the uke attracted me; the cultural phenomenon that the Uke has become won me over.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile learning to dance hula in Chicago (of all places), I began singing with my kumu (teacher) and fell in love with Hawaiian music, those lush irresistible  harmonies and the heart-and-soul storytelling approach.  When I left Chicago, my kumu gifted me an ukulele.  It would be a few more years until I would play ukulele regularly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I play uke everyday. I teach ukulele classes 3 times a week, perform jazz ukulele gigs a couple times a month, and have written several songs on the uke. My ukulele video tutorials have become more and more popular (thank you!), and I love sharing the joy that comes from simply strumming, singing, and playing the uke.  \u003cstrong\u003eI believe anyone can learn to play and enjoy making music on this instrument, and there is nothing more magical than making music.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy growth on the uke has everything to do with my sharing the instrument.  I\u0027m taking on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLODvOB1QB53Vss99jpmotJET5v1b3FmxZ\u0026amp;v=lvp7wwiV9w8\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e#100DaysofUkuleleSongs project\u003c/a\u003e to push myself to share more, and I\u0027ve created this Patreon page to give the uke fans and fellow players out there a way to support my teaching and playing.  I love the craft of creating special uke arrangements for my favorite songs.  With your support, I\u0027ll be able to focus more energy on creating arrangements and producing videos and tutorials. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve posted\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/qqDiaZ-pqyA?list=PLODvOB1QB53X-8-nsakUkBKsrsREtPvq0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efree ukulele tutorials\u003c/a\u003e because I believe my teaching style can help people grasp the basics of ukulele faster (and thereby spread the joy of ukulele faster!).  You may have found me because your romance with the Uke has just begun - I encourage you to share that joy with others.  If you\u0027d like to support my teaching and playing, I welcome it, but I intend to continue posting and sharing regardless because it\u0027s the best way I can bring more music to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be posting a new video everyday for 100 days, and we\u0027ll see what happens beyond.  Please keep watching, strumming along, and spreading the word. Follow your passion, and go play uke! \u003cbr\u003e"
