I\u0027m hear to help you discover more! \u003cbr\u003eI work as a professional tango violinist. I am based in Paris, France and London, UK. Tango music is my passion. I find it full of emotion, groove, drive, expression...the list is endless! I have played this great music all over the world and now I want to bring it to you! Every time I teach someone new about tango, they fall in love with it and are hungry for more. Alas there is very little that is published and in English hardly anything at all. My mission is to create books, articles, arrangements, workshops, videos all about this music, focusing on violin and strings in general. I will also be posting things up about my three tango groups, the London Tango Orchestra, Firebyrds Quartet and Serpientes.\u003cbr\u003eHelp me spread the word about this incredible musical genre. Your pledges will help me free up the necessary time needed to do all the research, translation, writing etc that will develop this style in the anglo-speaking world. Come join me on a voyage of discovery and help me create a world-wide tango music community!\u003cbr\u003e"
