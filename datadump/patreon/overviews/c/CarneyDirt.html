Patreon is Us, Together, riding this ship to a new art land. Sails up. Tits out. (*Middleman exits through the gift shop* Boy, Bye.) This is a super straightforward, easy, open, and no pressure platform. It\u0027s going to change the way we art. You can always BaiL if you get cold feet -or- StaY if it feels good and see where this art rabbit hole goes with a bunch of other art nerds. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(146, 205, 220);\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003ew h o ?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n If you\u0027ve made it here you probably like art and you probably even \nlike some of my art. Perhaps you\u0027re one of those amaZing people in my \nlife who lift my spirits on cloudy days and hugs me at gatherings. Or \nsomeone who keeps me in their thoughts when vending opportunities arise \nor when someone needs a personal or super weird gift for a loved one \nthat explains a feeling. Or maybe you just like my paper scribbles \n(dawwww) or my words. You take me seriously \u0026amp; know I live for this \nshit.

And the way it works - So let\u0027s say I make a beautiful painting, I would post it as a thing and you would be charged a dollar, or three dollars or whatever patron level you had signed up for. Let\u0027s say a week later I post another thing I made, an 11 foot tall bat sculpture. Once again, you would get charged. but . . . \"What if I can\u0027t do more than $1 per month?\" Understood. This platform allows you to set caps on what you can giver per month. So in the event that I start injecting espresso and finish up art faster than ever before . . . you can still breathe easy AND enjoy the art and togetherness in the patron community. I call them-theres \u0027wins\u0027.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0w h y ?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHaving any type of regular guaranteed income is super helpful. It let\u0027s me help worlk out a budget for art supplies or upcoming projects. and . . . Art is free and freeing. Creating art - the knowledge, classes, traveling, supplies, and space aren\u0027t always free. I want to make more of my art more available to everyone. I want to have the time \u0026amp; the freedom to make even more art to share with more people. What I would really love is the freedom to be able to make things in public spaces for the communities that need it the most. *squad goals*\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am still learning. Always learning. Like a mad scientist, I am searching for the secret cocktail combination of mediums that will tickle my fancy. It\u0027s always right on the tip of my\u00a0 . . . . . . .\u00a0\u00a0 You might also have noticed my varying mediums. I love to write on still\n quiet mornings, coffee beside. I love to collage at 3am while the \ncolors swim. Woodworking fills my heart-cup. ALL THE THINGS. I like them\n all and I have no intention of settling down monogamously with one \nmedium, any time soon, or at all really. Patreon makes this so much more doable.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am totally new to having a Patreon page. I\u0027m taking as many tips as I can from Amanda Palmer (one of my heroes for sure) who says, \"i *really* believe in the future of crowd-power and what these people \nand companies are doing. it isn\u0027t making world news, because it is what \nit is: a quiet, underground network of artists connecting directly with \ntheir fans, bypassing the entire commercial system. this is AWESOME. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nit\n is, in these days of negativity and tumblr outrage, the bright side of \nthe net: it is how the web can really *save artists* in an art-economy \nthat is floundering.
