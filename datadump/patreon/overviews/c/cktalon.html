    "summary": "Hi guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrue Martial World will go Premium some time in March. Once that happens, the authorization given to me by Cloudary Holdings to host advanced chapters will cease. As we are ushering in a new month, please remove your pledges so that you do not get charged. I wish you would support Qidian\u0027s Premium program as it will share profits more equitably between translator, author, and publisher.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough we are entering the Premium Program, the actual earnings of the Premium Program\u0027s monetization won\u0027t happen immediately for the foreseeable future. During this period, I will continue sharing a portion of the earnings with Cocooned Cow (author of TMW).\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHopefully, if you are here reading this, it means that you would like to support me in my current project - \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.webnovel.com/book/7834185605001405\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e[True Martial World]\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTime taken to translate a chapter consisting of about 2,000 Chinese characters to 4,000 characters takes us around 1.5 to 3 hours. I believe most readers have witnessed my speed with TMW, AC and IRAS, SFSP releases, so you can trust in me to fulfill the promises!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQuality translations are in fact, extremely time consuming. Not only must the translator convey the proper tones and meaning of the words across, research on references is also a must, so non-mandarin speaking readers would be able to gain a better idea of what the author is trying to portray. As I am in contact with authors of both novels, I am able to consult them when I am ever in doubt.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere is currently only me on the  team but please understand that I have a full time job as an engineer and am unable to commit as much time as I would like into translating... Whatever free time I have, I commit it to translating, on top of real life, work schedules and family time commitment.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHence, any pledge amount would serve as an additional form of motivation and deeply appreciated. \n\u003cstrong\u003eA portion will be donated to the authors too.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy current translation pace is at 7 regular chapters per week for TMW. Having reached the second tier\u00a0(see below), the release rate for TMW has been increased to 8 and my objective for this year would be to up the number of regular chapters to as high as possible per week. Due to providing advanced chapters, there has been a revamp of the release rates.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/208404313-Why-was-I-charged-immediately-Will-You-Charge-Me-Again-\"\u003e***** Read this before pledging to us!

The chapters of [True Martial World] will always be free and open for all to read. The pledges are just a way to offer continued support if you are able to do so. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCan I change my pledge amount?\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYes, you can. Just go to the top right of the page and once you hover near your profile picture, you will see a list of options. Just click on \u201cYour Pledges\u201d and you should be able to see all your active pledges and make changes/edits to it. \n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHow does Patron charge me?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003ePatreon accepts two forms of payment: PayPal and credit card. You can add your paypal account to Patreon, or if you don\u2019t have one, then simply add your credit card. Please make sure that your given payment account has the funds, not expired, etc, otherwise the pledge will be automatically declined by Patreon. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI made a pledge, but why hasn\u2019t it charged my Paypal/Credit card yet?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eAll pledges on Patron are processed the start of every month, so regardless of when you pledged, you will be charged at the start of the next month. For example, you made a pledge in a middle of January, so you will not be charged until the 1st of February. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to send me a message or make a patron post here after you pledge.\n\u003c/em\u003e"
