    "summary": "Hello! Thanks for taking the time to check out my project! \"Chaplain Stories\" is a podcast series born out of a desire to give military Chaplains the opportunity to tell the stories of the work they do. If you read military history, between the lines of the accounts of training, deployments, battles, and warfare there are Chaplains taking care of military personnel, families, and civilian contractors. In most cases, the stories of Chaplains go unheard to all but a handful of colleagues, family, and friends.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause Chaplains play such an integral role in military organizations I wanted to give them the opportunity to share with the world some of their stories and experiences. As a military Chaplain myself, I reached out to some of the Chaplains I have access to locally and when they expressed interest I purchased some basic recording equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy longterm goals for the project are to continue to upgrade my recording equipment capabilities. I now have a high quality digital recorder and two high quality microphones but there are additional accessories that need to be purchased to continue to increase the quality of the podcast (longer microphone cables, microphone stands, etc.). Plus, I would eventually like to purchase a 4K video camera to record video of the podcasts (which backers will get first access to!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I\u0027ll not only be able to purchase higher quality recording equipment but also be able to pay the ongoing costs of hosting the podcast on the web. Your support will mean that more Chaplains get to tell their stories and that those stories are captured with high quality audio and video and preserved for the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to check this out, for your support. The number one thing you can do now is to share, share, share!\u00a0"
