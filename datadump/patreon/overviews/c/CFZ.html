    "summary": "\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Centre for Fortean Zoology, founded in 1992,\u00a0 is the world\u0027s only truly global resource centre for cryptozoology and allied disciplines. Our aim is to coordinate and promote research into cryptozoology, mystery animals, out-of-place animals, zooform and zoomorphic phenomena, folkloric animal archetypes and rare, unusual and aberrant animal behaviour.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027On The Track\u0027 is a monthly WebTV show, written and presented\nby Jon Downes and Charlotte Phillipson from the Centre for Fortean Zoology. Jon\nfirst started the show nearly 10 years ago after reading about Rachel Fuller\u2019s WebTV show, \u2018In The Attic\u2019, where she, her\nboyfriend Pete, and various of his friends broadcast music and chat - literally\nfrom their attic!\u00a0 As Pete is the guitarist for one of the greatest British\nrock bands of all time, his \u2018friends\u2019 have tended to be very impressive media\ncharacters. In a similar way to when Jon first heard Pete Townshend\u2019s music a\u003cimg src=\"http://www.cfz.org.uk/images/mugshot2.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003end\nthought \u201cI wanna do that\u201d, reading about their broadcasts made him decide to do\none of his own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, as Jon\u2019s household has always been a mixture of\nfamily and an ever-shifting population of friends, relatives and collaborators\nfrom across the world, he decided to try to involve as many of them as\npossible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd because he has a very surreal outlook upon the world, and is still a seventeen-year-old hooligan guitar slinger at heart, there is a\nfair dollop of crazy humour and even some good old rock \u0027n\u0027 roll on occasions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe hope you enjoy the show as much as the team enjoy making\nit. However, there are all sorts of things we want to do, that - at the moment - we simply cannot afford to, because we lack the equipment, manpower, or money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd this is where \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0come in! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur friend Louis was kind enough to set this page up for us (and we cannot thank him sufficiently, because we would never have done it without him). We would like to make \u0027On The Track\u0027 bigger and better, and with your help we can get bigger, better, more ambitious; to be able to take on larger projects and reach a wider audience, continue our groundbreaking work, and slip a few quid pocket money to the younger members of the operation, in return for their ongoing dedication to the CFZ and our activities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of what we do is free, and will remain so; however,\u00a0 if people feel kindly disposed towards us, and want to \"invest\" in \u0027On The Track\u0027, to help us achieve our goals, there are\u00a0some fun rewards to be had, and the sky to aim for. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please help us if you feel that you can!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
