It\u0027s not that she\u0027s lonely- she has a lot of siblings to play with- but she has dreams, a desire for adventure! What would happen, if she walked without stopping? How far could she go? What would she see? \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://yokokasquest.com\"\u003eYokoka\u0027s Quest is a webcomic that updates 3 days a week; Monday, Wednesday and Friday!\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://yokokasquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/promo1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis story had been on the back burner for a long time- in fact, I wrote the first draft all the way back in 2004! I already knew I wanted the story to be a comic but, not having the skills, I only wrote it down and left it at that, then moved on to other projects. Around 2013, I decided it was time to start getting serious about what I wanted to do with myself, and what better project to start with than the first story I ever wrote?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started drawing pages in October 2014 to have a buffer, and the comic itself has been going live since September 17th 2015, posting every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. So far, we\u0027ve made it to chapter 5 and still going strong and on schedule- and I\u0027m determined to keep it that way!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://yokokasquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/promo4.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, here\u0027s the catch. I want the comic to be \u003cstrong\u003eavailable online for free\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0No matter what happens, I don\u0027t plan on changing that! But as you can guess, this takes up a lot of time and energy. This is where you come in! With your help, I could concentrate on making this an actual living, doing what I love every day and sharing all the stories I can think of with the world!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://gumroad.com/clefdesoll\"\u003eYou can grab old Patreon rewards for free here\u003c/a\u003e!!\u003cbr\u003eEmail:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:contact@yokokasquest.com\"\u003econtact@yokokasquest.com\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003ePortfolio:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://clefdesoll.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eclefdesoll.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time, and I hope to see you as a patron soon! :3c\u003cbr\u003e"
