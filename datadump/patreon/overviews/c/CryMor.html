This is where you can join and help support #CMGHYPE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imgur.com/Odt7Wsr.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe previously did everything on a Per Video basis because we believe that is a fair and easy way to ensure we create content for your money. We changed this to Per Month after several Patrons complained about the volume of \u0027Paid\u0027 content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember, you can always set your monthly limit after choosing to make a pledge, and you can set that pledge as low as $1 a month, or as high as you feel comfortable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imgur.com/XTsEtQQ.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge goes to help us in several different ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMORE GAMES\u003c/strong\u003e We make 3 videos a week, on several different games every time, which is a lot of games. We try to reach out to developers to limit this cost, but sometimes we have to make a choice between whether or not to make a video on a game based on whether we can afford to purchase it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMORE STREAMS\u003c/strong\u003e We can afford to be at our computers streaming if we can make the time, and we can afford more time if you\u0027re helping us.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMORE SEGMENTS\u003c/strong\u003e We have a lot of really great ideas, and we want to expand on those! More convention footage, a full time editor, interviews with developers, podcasts, and more!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBETTER QUALITY \u003c/strong\u003eEver watch our earlier stuff, and listen to the microphones?

With your pledge, we\u0027ll be able to create the kind of videos you want to see more often, with more quality.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imgur.com/mgwUZPS.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month, we publish between 12-15 videos to our channel. The number of videos we publish DOES NOT affect how much you contribute.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to pledge $1 per month, and that month we publish 30 videos, you\u0027ll contribute $1 for that month. The same is true if we publish 12 videos during the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this, you cannot go \u0027over your budget\u0027 since you\u00a0can easily set a monthly contribution limit when you\u0027re entering your payment info. That way there\u0027s no surprises at the end of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imgur.com/kQXrZnN.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe can lock our content behind a paywall\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe can put ads all over our videos and spam for views\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOr, we can ask you to help \u003cstrong\u003esupport us\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eConsidering that we want to create good content that is actually seen, without giant sponsored ads everywhere, we thought \u003cem\u003e\"Why not let the people who enjoy our videos decide all that instead?\"\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this we can ask you guys what to create, what you want to see, and know that we\u0027re producing the kind of content our die-hard fans actually want to watch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imgur.com/2t6evhT.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo problem, don\u0027t donate, please! We don\u0027t want to be the reason you can\u0027t afford something else!
