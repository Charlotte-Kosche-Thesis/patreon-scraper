It really does mean the world to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello! I\u2019m Amy, also known as Coffee \u0026amp; Kink (CK \nfor short.) I\u0027m a sex writer, sex blogger and sex educator. I used to say that the person who writes \u003ca href=\"http://coffeeandkink.me/\"\u003eat my site\u003c/a\u003e was an \nalter-ego, but I have come to realise that\u2019s inaccurate. What you\u2019ll \nread there is the truest reflection of \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e \u2013 my heart, my mind, my desires, what makes me angry and what makes me tick.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m a twenty-something, queer cis British girl. I define myself as \nfemme-ish (it\u2019s complicated,) polyamorous, an intersectional feminist \nand a submissive switch. I\u2019m also a swinger-ish (also complicated,) \nmentally ill, a Gemini and an INFP if you care about either of these \nthings, and a writer above all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy sex writing?\u003c/h3\u003e\nBecause I find sexuality endlessly fascinating and I think sex has \nthe power to change the world. The sex education most of us receive is \nwoefully lacking \u2013 if we get any at all \u2013 which means we have \ngenerations of grown adults who don\u2019t understand their bodies and live \nunder the weight of massive sexual shame.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI want people to talk openly about sex. I want accurate, \npleasure-focused information for everyone, and I want informed, \nenthusiastic consent to become a minimum standard. \u003cem\u003eCoffee \u0026amp; Kink\u003c/em\u003e is my small attempt at being the change I wish to see in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSex is literally the only topic I never run out of things to say \nabout. For every article, review, rant or story I post, there are at \nleast five more dancing around in my head. A year or so ago, my writing \nwas getting some attention over on Fetlife, so I thought, hey, some \npeople actually care what I have to say! I opened up a free WordPress \naccount, and \u003cem\u003eCoffee \u0026amp; Kink\u003c/em\u003e was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I initially envisioned as a small side-project has become so \nmuch more. The blog, and my sex writing more generally, is now a brand,\n a business and a passion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything I do is underpinned by an intersectional feminist ethos and a desire to further consent culture, in sex and in life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome of the things I do... \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI blog about sex. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI write erotic fiction (the kind which centres enthusiastic consent and mutual pleasure.) I mostly write short vignettes but I\u0027m now working on my first smutty novella. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI blog about sex, typically around twice per week. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI educate on sex, relationships, BDSM/kink, non-monogamy, feminism and consent.\u00a0 \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI organise charity events to raise funds for organisations which support survivors of violence, fight for sexual freedom and defend gender \u0026amp; sexual minorities and more.

And also... \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI love doing this work, but there are only so many hours in the day and it is time consuming and tiring. Some financial reward helps me to keep going, avoid burnout, and dedicate more hours in my busy life towards this stuff.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt will help me towards my eventual goal of going freelance as a writer/educator/etc, which means I can do more great things, create more lovely content for you folks, and hopefully change the world a little bit with sex positivity. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWriting and other creative work is WORK. If you enjoy the things an artist creates, you should consider paying for it - even if only a tiny contribution, it all means so much to me!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe blog is and always will be free. Your support will help to keep that viable and ensure I can continue to prioritise it.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt will help me to pay for the things I need to work, from the hosting for my website to books to keep educating myself. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA small pot of money to throw at it will mean I am able to pay occasional guest bloggers. This means 1) more content for you guys, including topics I could never cover by myself, and 2) more paid work for other sex writers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt will help cover my costs to go to sex-positive conferences and other events, meaning I can meet some of you in person and also learn some incredible things which I can bring back to you all through my writing. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThank you for reading and for your support.
