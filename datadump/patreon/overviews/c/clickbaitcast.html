     "about": "Hello fellow sick-minded friends! We thought it would be nice to tell you a little story about how this page and our Podcasts came about. All our episodes are available on \u003ca href=\"https://clickbaitcasters.podbean.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePodbean\u003c/a\u003e at  and searchable through most Podcast sources like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/click-bait/id1347803051?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiTunes\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/ian-gale/click-bait\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStitcher\u003c/a\u003e. But I\u2019m sure you already knew that, or why would you be here? Duh!\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, back to the why... Gale and I are two like-minded idiots who basically never grew up and thrive on toilet humor, fart jokes, innuendo and all that base silliness that 9 year old\u2019s find so hilarious. Yep, we never grew up at all. \u003cbr\u003eGale and I had the misfortune to meet sometime in 2016. Working for the same company in the same department, we would often take lunch together in the break room and would go off into some insane ramblings about some messed up thing or another and, feeding off each other\u2019s comments (and sometimes each other\u2019s sandwiches and chips), we would crack ourselves up on the stupidest of shit.\u003cbr\u003eGale first introduced me to Podcasts, like some evil drug pusher... I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll end up binge watching YouTube at some point. You know how this crap escalates. We now listen to a bunch of faves such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/brian-smith-2/simply-nonsense\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSimply Nonsense\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/a-sarcastic-mind\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eA Sarcastic Mind\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/wwwstitchercompodcastthoseconspiracyguys/those-conspiracy-guys\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThose Conspiracy Guys\u003c/a\u003e and others. It takes the hum-drum out of the commute, plugging in and listening to something other than the same frigging top-40 pop on the local radio or the one playlist your phone seems to default to at the Gym - you can only workout to \u201cHey Mickey\u201d so many times, you know? Anyway, I digress....\u003cbr\u003eSo Gale pitches to me \u201cWe should do a Podcast - this shit is funny as f**k!\u201d. So we did. The end.... Well, not quite. So we came up with the premise that we would just do crap we found on the Internet. There are hundreds of stories on the Internet that are bizarre and funny as shit just on their own - but then we get hold of them and rip the crap outta them. It\u2019s a ton of fun and we want to share our delight with you, fellow idiots. \u003cbr\u003eWe started with \u003ca href=\"https://clickbaitcasters.podbean.com/e/spectrophilia/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSpectrophilia\u003c/a\u003e and when that one took off, we added \u003ca href=\"https://clickbaitcasters.podbean.com/e/sex-robots-1518766205/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSex Robots\u003c/a\u003e and we found our niche! It\u2019s basically sex with weird backstories and fart humor - but what\u2019s not to love about THAT! There\u2019s more - check out the line-up. One of my fave bits is SHAM Trek, a Star Trek parody we dropped into one of our episodes. It\u2019s awesome!\u003cbr\u003eSome of Gale\u2019s mates helped us out with our jingles and we are eternally grateful for that. We have a solid fan in Judy who was our founder Patreon supporter and she will always hold a special place in our hearts! Thanks Judy - we love you!! \u003cbr\u003eAnd the rest is basically history - sordid and twisted history, but that\u2019s the best kind!! Check out our episodes on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://clickbaitcasters.podbean.com/\"\u003ePodbean\u003c/a\u003e or search your favorite Podcast site for \u003ca href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/ian-gale/click-bait\"\u003eClickBaitCast\u003c/a\u003e and check us out - you will not be disappointed, but if you are, remember to tell your friends anyway and if you have to vote on the crappiest podcast ever, we would love to top that list too! Because we really just don\u2019t give a f**k - in fact that\u2019s part of our business model. If we ever make any money (Ha!) we\u2019ll be sure to spend it irresponsibly!!\u003cbr\u003eThanks for listening and don\u2019t forget to like our \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/clickbaitpodcast/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e page, follow us on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ClickBaitCaster?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter @ClickBaitCaster\u003c/a\u003e, sign over your retirement account to us at Patreon, tell your friends, and especially your enemies, contact us at \u003ca href=\"mailto:clickbaitcasters@gmail.com\"\u003eclickbaitcasters@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e and remember, Love is like farting....
