On my first Patreon page* I asked if supporters could pledge a contribution per video I made, and the backing I had was just brilliant. But what I learned is that in between releasing videos not having a steady creative income stream could make it difficult to make steady creative progress. Also, I do a lot more than just making videos -- in particular I\u0027m currently writing a short series of fantasy books entirely in verse -- and such things were taking me away from the work that could bring in a little money.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhen I\u0027m not actively creating for myself (and you)\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I take occasional professional screen and voice acting jobs, tutor local school students (and sometimes international students via Skype), and at Christmas I step into the role of Santa in my local community. In the past I worked full-time office jobs, but after developing fibromyalgia I found a traditional work pattern couldn\u0027t work any more for me. This was both scary, as it drastically hit my income, and liberating as it opened up possibilities for more time-flexible and creative activities, and work where I could better express my real talents. There aren\u0027t many opportunities to dress up as a Hobbit and play a cutout guitar for laughs in the average office.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo there you go.

The final video in our Middle Earth trilogy, \u003cstrong\u003eRescued By Eagles\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is currently in Eternal Post-Production Hell, but will be released eventually. Honestly. Before the end of the decade for sure.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMy space fantasy verse story, \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Last Moonicorn (a tale of dark whimsy and pies)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, has the interest of an agent, a UK publisher, an illustrator, and a private investor, and we\u0027re currently investigating self-publishing a first edition via a KickStarter pre-sale. I\u0027m currently writing the two sequels to The Last Moonicorn to complete a larger trilogy story. Readers have compared it to the works of Dahl \u0026amp; Seuss, and to \"Le Petit Prince\". My biggest influences (apart from Dahl \u0026amp; Seuss) are probably A. A. Milne, Spike Milligan, John Lennon, and Lewis Carroll. And Tolkien.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m currently researching an upper-middle-grade series of children\u0027s time travel novels, and a historical techno-political war drama which may develop into either a feature screenplay or a pitch for a TV series (it\u0027s currently looking more like the latter).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAnother long term development project has been the animated series \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eKing Bee\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, of which I am co-creator, and it\u0027s associated superhero project \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eKaboombee!\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0To be quite honest, the Kaboombee universe has been in hibernation for quite some time, but given a nudge it could kaboom back into action very fast. I have other animation properties in early stages of development which I\u0027m very happy to talk about with producers!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAs a dual-national Brit and Kiwi, I can work without visas or permits\u00a0in Australia, New Zealand, and (for now)\u00a0throughout the European Union\u00a0(although sadly after the Brexit vote I don\u0027t suppose that will last -- so hire me quick, Europe)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI do have a day job (well, an afternoons and evenings job) tutoring local kids in Maths, English, and Science, and providing some more general mentoring. My wife and I also homeschool our awesome daughter Meg, so there\u0027s lots keeping me busy outside of the directly creative realm.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut until the flood of paid gigs comes in any help to pay my mortgage while I make ossum videos for my screaming fan, pen more magical books for my reader, and other random stuff would be hugely appreciated. It\u0027ll also help with reinvesting into the creative projects as there are always incidental expenses\u2014like paying for a bunch of cheap greenscreen material that may or may not work properly... more about that soonish!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo if you could find a few bucks to back me until I go stellar you\u0027ll be able to say you helped to get me started. (Plus, you get REWARDS! Like actually finding out what I\u0027m really doing occasionally.)\u00a0 Whoop!\u003cbr\u003e",
