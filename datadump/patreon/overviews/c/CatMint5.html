I\u0027m Dilyana\n- a writer, blogger, book reviewer, Beta reader and Wattpad Ambassador.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou know\nhow some people wake up one day and think \"Why don\u0027t I write a book? It\nwill be fun, no?\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not\none of those people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027ve\nbeen coming up with stories for as long as I can remember. I\u0027d like to say that\nit\u0027s a passion, but sometimes it feels more like an obsession. I need to create\ncharacters and then make up a world for them, give them a few problems, solve the\nproblems for them, give them a few more...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor a\nlong, long time my stories stayed in my head, perfectly safe from the scrutiny\nof other people, save from the few I wrote for school and private lessons. I\nlater changed one of these stories and made into a script for a play that a few\nchildren from my acting class and I presented to our (\u003cem\u003eI hope!\u003c/em\u003e) adoring audience\nwhen I was in sixth grade.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut yes,\nhomework and play aside, my stories stayed in my head... Until I found Wattpad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt first\nI was only reading what others had created and posted there, but I soon felt\nthe urge to upload something of my own. The thought terrified me, and yet I\ntook that step - more of a huge leap for an introvert like me - and posted the\nfirst chapters to \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Green Girl\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. Surprisingly, the story took off, staying on\nWattpad\u0027s Hot List even after I\u0027d completed it and even though it\u0027s only a\ndraft. Now it has over 1.8M reads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat and\nthe feedback I was getting from the Wattpad community encouraged me to keep sharing\nmy stories and to even begin thinking about a career in writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nstarted a blog on which I post what I\u0027ve learned about writing, editing and\nWattpad; I also try to help other writers out by uploading interviews with them\nand reviewing their books. After all, it\u0027s a tough publishing world out there\nand us writers need to stick together. Interviews and reviews are good for my\nblog readers as well; they might find their next favorite book through my posts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn\nshort, everyone wins: I do what I love, I help out my fellow writers and I keep\nmy readers entertained.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt all\nwould\u0027ve been perfect - well, deadlines and the occasional creativity slump\naside - if only I could afford to do that forever. But sadly, I live in a real\nworld with very real bills to pay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd\nthus, this Patreon account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith a\nlittle support from you, I can keep doing what I love and even improve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI dream\nthat one day I will not only finish a draft, but have a book in its final\nstage, a book that\u0027s worthy of being published; that I will hold something I\u0027ve\ncreated in my hands, something that would entertain and inspire others, just\nlike the books I\u0027ve read entertained and inspired me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWould\nyou help me make my dream come true?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
