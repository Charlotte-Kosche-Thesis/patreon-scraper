I currently have three websites; one which focusses on feminism, relationships and sexuality (including both fiction and non-fiction work). The second on book, film, and game reviews. The third on food, travel and the environment. I\u0027ve joined Patreon because fiction is my passion but I have found myself drifting away from that in favour of writing articles that can pay my bills. If you support me here you are helping me to follow my passion for fiction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am bisexual, body positive, vegan, feminist, environmentalist with purple hair, tattoos, and a love of books and films. Reading is a big passion, and I think what we read has a huge influence on how we see the world. So many books I\u0027ve read gave me new ideas, new thoughts, new ways to look at the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I can write something that helps even just one person see the world in a new way I would feel like I had been a success. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find my websites below:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://vegannomadgeek.com\"\u003eVeganNomadGeek\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://PopcornandPaperbacks.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePopcornandPaperbacks\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://hornygeekgirl.com\"\u003eHornyGeekGirl\u003c/a\u003e"
