The tabletop hobby has undergone a huge boom in popularity over the last decade. Staying up to date on the latest news and announcements can take a lot of time and energy because information is often spread across multiple blogs, podcasts, and videos. I spend the time researching the top stories in the industry and convey those to you in just a few minutes once a week. That way you can spend more of your time PLAYING games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on Patreon asking for your support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been doing these videos weekly since 2013 and I really enjoy making them. However, my personal and professional life has gotten much busier over the past few years, and my time just has a different value these days. Having your support on Patreon helps me to stay excited and motivated to make news videos (and hopefully other types of videos.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also helps me gauge how much time I can and should be devoting to this project. I would love to expand my video content to cover conventions, vlogs, design diaries, tips and tricks, etc. However, I need your help in figuring out exactly what the next step should be. The more money I raise, the more time I can devote to making videos. The cool part is that by donating, you will get a say in what videos I make. Im really excited about continuing to bring you board game news, as well as seeing what I should make next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will my contribution help achieve?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution will help cover some of the costs of producing videos, and help me stay motivated to make more content. I have a few funding goals set up; you can read about them in more detail in the \"goals\" section on the left. Whenever we achieve 1 goal, a new one will be revealed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- $50 -\u003c/strong\u003e We get rid of YouTube ads!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- $100 -\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ll upload the board game news audio as a weekly podcast!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- $200 -\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ll make an additional video each month and you get to help decide the topic!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m really excited about continuing to bring you board game news.

In addition to weekly board game news, I will be producing at least one new video each month. What video you hypothetically ask in this sentence Im writing? Well, thats entirely up to all of you. By donating, you get to vote on what you want me to create. Maybe you want a video about my game design process. Maybe you want a video about how to produce web content. Maybe you want convention recap videos. Maybe you want something awesome I havent thought of yet!",
