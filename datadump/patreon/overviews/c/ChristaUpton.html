    "summary": "I love writing \nchildren\u0027s books (have published 4 so far). I love children, with all their wonderful \nquirks, energy, and personalities. My books contain humor (and other \ngood things) that I hope will brighten many children\u0027s days. Writing for children has also given me something creative and productive to do while healing from extremely severe Toxic Injury \u0026amp; Bio-toxin Illness. One can only watch so much Netflix! LOL\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy \nown children participate in my projects, from their own photography used in my books to ideas for details to actual\n digital illustrations my daughters have created.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also feel \ncompelled to blog. Through chronic illness, I have learned that \nsometimes what seems important in life isn\u0027t all that important. Illness\n has given me new perspective, increased compassion, and focus. I love \nencouraging others, whether it be regarding  getting through their \nown illness and suffering or parenting their precious children or \nhelping their children through grief.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage will help me continue to do \nthese things, helping to support my family while I continue writing, \nillustrating, and blogging (and rearing my children in between those things! \n:) ) I am able to make some money from my books, but it has not turned \ninto a regular income yet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have plans and ideas for 18 more children\u0027s\n books--I can\u0027t wait to tackle them all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAt\n the moment, you can sign up to pledge $1, $3, or more per month. You \nwill receive rewards at various levels of sponsorship. Each pledge helps\n pay for the yearly website fees or those necessary bills like electricity and water, :) and eventually pledges may be put into marketing so I can \nreach more children with my books and encourage more people with my blogging."
