In that time, we cultivated a culture of completion over on our Youtube channel where we released over a dozen short films in just under a year, while developing our debut feature film, The Three Don\u0027ts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been doing this for the love of it, but now as we\u0027ve secured a space to work on more regular content including web-series, podcasts, sketches and more, we are looking to the people who have supported us in the past to help us develop and grow Celtic Badger Media to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to make more stuff, more regularly... and with your help we can make that a reality! If you can spare anything from $3 a month to $30 per month we can develop even more content and put CBM on the map. For your support you will receive exclusive insights, goodies and involvement in future Celtic Badger Media productions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to support us and help us grow, I honestly cannot thank you enough. You are the reason why we\u0027ve kept doing this, creating unique films like Cuppa, I.R.I.S, Retribution, Rewind, Polly, Passenger Zero and more. Please feel free to check out our Youtube channel \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/celticbadgermedia,\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/celticbadgermedia,\u003c/a\u003e if you want a taste of what CBM has to offer. If you think you\u0027d like to see us tackle bigger and badder productions, please consider supporting us here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for your time \u0026amp; much love from the #BadgerFamily.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch Love,\u003cbr\u003ePaddy Murphy\u003cbr\u003eCEO, Celtic Badger Media"
