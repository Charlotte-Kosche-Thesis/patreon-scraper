I make short comics and zines as well as fiber art sculptures, poetry, and writing. I think I could best be described as a multi-media artist. I work this way because of my multiple disabilities making it hard to make certain kinds of art at different times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e So while you might not get a short story or comic every month you will get an original piece of art or several if you become a patron. I am using this site as a source of income to help pay my medical bills and rent as I am unable to physically work a minimum wage job and hold a higher paying job because of mental illness. My art work brings me joy and it one of the few things I still can do physically and enjoy doing. Please consider becoming a patron so I can afford to live independently and continue to make art.\u00a0"
