Most due but It left me the feeling of loneness most of the time. So I never thought in a million years that I would have millions of views and close to 8 thousand subscribers. It makes me feel like I have the one thing I never had before a group of people who support and care about how I am doing, that in itself is probably why I still post videos . I love having people believe in me it helped changed my life over the last 4 year as my videos clearly show just how much my life has changed for the better. xoxo thank you to each person who supported me along my way\u00a0"

     "about": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eMy channel started out for my grandmother could see my garden ..My grandmother was bedridden at the time and wanted to see my plants growing. That was over 4 years ago. A lot has happened to change the path of my life.\u00a0 My grandmother has since passed on, I decided that since other people watched my channel I would still post videos. That was 3 million views ago. I would love to be able to post more videos but I really do not have the time to as I work 2 jobs. I am a rcw Or as people would know it as a residential Care worker. I work with people with disabilities of many different forms. This is my passion. My Dream would be to day to be able to open a place that enriches the lives of people with disabilities. I believe with hard work I can get there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you follow my channel you will see that until it was only a few years ago I went back to high school and getting my grade 12 at 35. The video of my walking across the stage to get my grade 12 is on my channel. I posted it because it was the proudest thing I ever did for myself. I then went to college with a $5000 scholarship because someone believed me and wrote a letter to support my journey. I am the type of women that will never forget where I came from and all the many people who helped me along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoing to college and taken my program empowered me in a way that I thought I never was able to do. I did not come from people who supported my dreams and goals so it was easy to not have any. my life is changing. I now not only do I get to have my dream when I sleep I also feel like I am living my dreams getting to do what I love for a living, I might have had a late start in life in following my dreams But I am doing it daily..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been posting videos lately to support other people on a journey of weight loss. I have PTSD and I also like to talk about the struggles of life because lets face it we all face struggles . I hope my journey helps at least one person. If you can wake up in the morning and your only goal is to make at least one person smile your day\u00a0 will be okay.\u003cbr\u003e Much love Christina\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e",
