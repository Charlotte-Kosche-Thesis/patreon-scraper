    "summary": "By the time I was in my Junior year at SCAD, I was already working on graphic novel projects for some really cool companies. Unfortunately, the big book project I was working on fell through shortly after I graduated, and those pages never saw the light of day, sadly. It happens, that\u0027s just the industry. At the time though, it was a huge bummer, and I sort of... fell headfirst into fandom again, devoting all of my creativity to drawing fanart and creating fanworks. This eventually gained me a larger following than ever, and ultimately paid off when I started creating Fandom Inspired tea blends through Adagio.com. The popularity of this idea went viral and sparked a huge, new trend in fandom creations. Since then I\u0027ve been lucky enough to travel all over the country, attending cons as an artist and occasionally throwing huge, nerdy tea parties for fans. \u003cbr\u003eSo while obviously fandom has been incredible for me, I\u0027m itching to go back to creating original content again. Already this year I\u0027ve been able to pencil out 3 short, 12-25 page original comics, with one already finished and printed. I\u0027d love love LOVE to be able to finish a new short comic at least every other month this year, as a challenge to myself. However, still having to hold down a day job while also prepping to table at 2 or 3 cons a month is keeping me from creating at any sort of decent pace. I want to believe that I\u0027m in a good place in my artistic career that I can probably take the plunge and go full time freelance to work on comic pages, but I need all the support I can get. I want to make the comics I create available online for free eventually, but I also want to be able to create and sell hard copies of them available at cons, or, if I can find the time/resources, available to order from an online shop. Without my day job, I\u0027d also have more time to create more fandom tea blends and possibly throw more tea parties in new cities, since I know some of you are also interested in that ;) (That may eventually just have to be a separate patreon project though, this one is pretty much just so I can focus on comics and art).\u003cbr\u003eThank you SO Much for all of your support and consideration!\u003cbr\u003e"
