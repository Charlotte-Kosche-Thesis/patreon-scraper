I loved these wild stories with pictures that would just bring me into my own world (often getting me into trouble at school and home) But I could never find the perfect blending of the Eastern style and Western Style books and comic books that I so craved. Enter the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hells-Gate-Awakening-Book-One-ebook/dp/B073C7B7HM/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Hell\u0027s Gate Book Series \u00a0 \u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0my collection of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS0NLmOfKhq4OEuJDFwf9flNhNUZ9GYOD\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e audiobooks\u003c/a\u003e . Most of my work embraces the two cultures, bringing them together in harmony. \u00a0I was raised in\u00a0both Chinese and Japanese culture by a Chinese Step-father. I would sit and listen as I would draw inspiration from his folklore stories and his equal love for Japanese culture. \u00a0And so, with his memory in mind, I create my vision of a perfectly balanced universe of Eastern and Western cultures, philosophies, and folklore.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs one that has struggled with high functioning Autism her entire life, you can imagine what it\u0027s like to explain myself constantly. I once had a manager in the same sentence say, \u0027You have a mind like no other and your creativity and ability to think outside of the box is amazing. Now please, keep that to yourself.\u0027 I am often overworked and underpaid and finally decided to take the plunge and devote myself to my passions. I work 60+ hours a week and would love to devote \u003cem\u003eall of my time\u003c/em\u003e to my craft instead to share with all of you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIllustrating my worlds through film, audiobooks, and creating stories are my one true happy place. I don\u0027t know what meditation is, but I think I can understand it. When I create audio stories, draw, or write I\u0027m lost to them for hours on end. And I want to share my creations with all of you. You can find examples of my other projects such as podcasts\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIHFIcz0BAk\u0026amp;list=PLS0NLmOfKhq4KvAmE3gEZy203ytgLj2mv\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e As demand for my time and writing has increased, my full-time job has turned into part-time pay as I have been taking more time to complete my projects. It\u0027s quickly depleting all of my earnings and savings. This is where all of you come in!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027m currently doing is not the most conventional approach\u2500 I try to release pretty much all of my artistic content for free: the podcasts, comics, audiobooks on my site, wherever. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to do this because not everybody wants to buy it\u2500 and that\u0027s OK! It\u0027s yours, it\u0027s everybody\u0027s\u2500 take it, and you can share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect much until you see my level of dedication to my work, which is why I list all of it on here. \u00a0Pledge as little or as much as you like to the cause!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy subscribing to me on Patreon, you instantly become a patron of my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich leads to many great things for both you and me: (cue happy love song and touching butts...er, I mean hands.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe more support I receive, the more time I can set aside to provide you with comics, books, monthly podcasts, and audiobooks.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI will send exclusive patrons ONLY behind the scenes of each work in progress they choose to fund, and early access to the films and books.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHighest levels of support will get access to my art as you watch me create and interact.

This is a novel series being turned into an audiobook and I currently have books 1 and 2 written. The story follows Celeste, a girl adopted out of Tokyo by an American family. As an adult, she views herself as cursed. How do you convince yourself that you can defy what destiny has laid out for you? Love, betrayal, war between the realms\u2500 Celeste must fight it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI combined all of my research (including 2 trips to Japan) interviewed several penpals and friends and spent hours curled up to Japanese and Chinese legends. I weaved the tales and folklore into the story and added my own spin to these classics to create a unique blend I hope that you can enjoy. You can learn about more of my journey\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3067vLCpdY\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor my Patrons and supporters, I want to offer a full character bio, artbook, and fully illustrated books of all the folklore included in my graphic novel and books! (think of them like little graphic novellas with story and pictures) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also like to offer an audiobook version of the story for those that don\u0027t have time to read.The larger the patronage, the more, of course, I can take time off to give.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, thank you, to anyone and everyone that is generous and kind enough to help see my vision through to the end!",
