My name is Freeland, Christopher Freeland.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nMy focus in\nlife is to share with kindred spirits the harmony I have spent my life\ndeveloping. That may well be an utopic ideal but well worth the effort.  What I have to offer is the ongoing harvest from\na life spent searching for solutions to what I perceive to be the issues facing\nus today. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe emphasis is on the practical, what we can actually do to protect\nourselves and those we love, by maintaining our health through careful\ncooperation with Nature (Wholistic Living), calling on neglected and forgotten\nmeans (Ancient Sciences) to help in the process, with a sure-fire method to\ndetermine if the solution is right for you (Radiesthesia). All this covers remedies\nagainst radiation, microwave, nuclear or electromagnetic, taking care of and\nre-energizing water, dispelling the illusions and removing mystification -\nwhich might be fun and sensational, but not the way to real and lasting wellbeing.\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFunding me\non Patreon will allow me to continue this research, experimentation and creating\ncontent for you all to use. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nLet\u2019s party\non with Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e"

No, that is the task for a Superior Intelligence.\u003cdiv\u003eSpiritual teacher? No, all is spirit, a material entity can only set an example.\u003cbr\u003eInventor? No, Nature shows us how when we stop interfering for there is nothing new under the sun.\u003cbr\u003eMagician? Yes, like us all, we have the power to create our own reality.\u003cbr\u003ePassionate? Yes, about understanding Life, what makes it tick and not making people pay for their birthright.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eMy work is all about harmony. If, as seems to be the case, life energy is an extension of Consciousness, there is every reason to believe that the feeling most of us have of unity or love is due to our being a part of the totality, quite inseparable from it. That discovery can only be made and lived individually. It took me a lot of searching, contemplation and a few hard knocks. It was worth every instant to discover what wise people have been telling us since time immemorial. Now, that understanding has to be nurtured and attended to, like a garden that you want to nourish your body with wholesome and healthy food. Such care needs to be applied on all the planes we are fortunate enough to experience and Neter Energies is about that unique adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
