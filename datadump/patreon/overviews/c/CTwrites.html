I\u0027m so happy to meet you! Let me tell you a bit about myself and my work. \n(Links coming soon.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho I Am\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nI am an independent author, artist, college student, game designer, and freelance copy editor living in the Larchmere district on the east side of Cleveland, Ohio. I\u0027ve been writing avidly since grade school, and have been the recipient of a handful of awards, including the Rosalind Franklin Creative Writing Award in 2002. I published a book of poetry, \n\u003cem\u003eKnives in Suburbia \u003c/em\u003e(Lumberjack Press)\u003cem\u003e, \u003c/em\u003eat age 17, and have since been published in various \u0027zines, compilations, literary mags, and anthologies. Notably, I was featured on the cover of \u003cem\u003eHotel Poem: Poets of Cleveland\u003c/em\u003e, an anthology of local poetry with photography  by Charlotte Mann, and released a spoken word CD entitled \u003cem\u003eCircle of Blood \u003c/em\u003ethrough the Language Foundry. Most recently, I self-published a small untitled anti-capitalist art \u0027zine and a larger-format \u0027zine of poetry and collage entitled \u003cem\u003eGNDRD, \u003c/em\u003ewhich is about my evolving relationship to gender, trauma, and identity throughout my life. I am currently working on two collaborative projects: a queer space pirate dating sim entitled \u003cem\u003eTransPlanetrary, \u003c/em\u003eand a LGBT+ geek con right here in Cleveland. Check back soon for updates on these recent projects and links to images from my \u0027zines. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m Here\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\tI joined Patreon because I\u0027d like to focus on my art and schoolwork, but I currently don\u0027t have the mental or emotional capacity to juggle all the things. While I\u0027ll always create, regardless of how much or how little I make, I know I could be creating stronger work and more of it if I had the resources (financial, psychological, emotional, physical) to devote to taking it seriously. (For more about the financial side, you can see my Goals to the left of this page.) I\u0027m living hand-to-mouth, and that comes with a ton of stress, which interferes with the openness and spontaneity needed for the best creative work. It\u0027s hard to compose a perfect sestina or find the exact right metaphor when all I can think about is whether I\u0027ll be able to keep the lights on, or if you\u0027re sick but can\u0027t afford to go to the doctor. I\u0027m a genderqueer trauma survivor living with major depression and PTSD (and I just lost my insurance!), which poses another hurdle; knowing I could afford treatment and even some time off to deal with this stuff would go a long way to alleviating that burden. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAlthough it feels weird asking for money for my art, I\u0027m not asking for a handout; I\u0027m putting my work out there and asking anyone who sees merit in it to consider making a contribution, for which you will receive in exchange more and better work (and fabulous bonuses to boot). I think that\u0027s fair, and I hope you do too. \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWhat I Write\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nMy work treats themes of gender, power, trauma, and mental illness as seen through a warped glass of psychedelics, philosophy, paradoxes, puzzles, and physics. My poetry can best be described as avant-garde free verse, though I have done some work with poetic forms, concrete poetry, and prose poetry. I also like to play with non-traditional subjects and forms such as text messages and instant messaging, video games, chaos magic and divination, choose-your-own-adventure-style writing, and real-time collaborative exquisite corpses. Links to my work will be coming soon; I\u0027m currently building a website!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition to poetry, I have published short fiction and creative \nnon-fiction, and I write longer-form science fiction and fantasy \nwith a feminist slant, featuring strong female and LGBT+ protagonists, \nthough I have yet to publish the latter. I curate \n\u003ca href=\"http://diydungeon.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea few\u003c/a\u003e / \u003ca href=\"http://fuckyeahvillainesses.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e / \u003ca href=\"http://fyeahsuperheroeskissing.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eblogs\u003c/a\u003e, and intermittently write articles for \nthese, generally about pop culture (mostly comics and video games) \nand/or gender. I\u0027ve done copy writing and\n copy editing professionally for individuals and organizations (from writing cover letters for colleagues to helping with the launch of a \ngrassroots tech start-up to editing an essay for the owner of our local comic shop), and I love giving \nconstructive feedback and collaborating across genres and media.\nMy favorite place is the place where art and technology, science and the humanities intersect.\nI\u0027m so excited to be the lead writer on \u003cem\u003eTransPlanetary, \u003c/em\u003ea game I\u0027m developing with some of my closest friends, which will represent various genders and sexualities in a way that I personally haven\u0027t seen done yet in a dating simulator. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePerformance \u0026amp; Other Media\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nI have performed as a featured reader throughout the greater Cleveland and as far away as New York City, and can\u0027t wait to see where in the world art takes me next. I previously hosted the poetry open mic at the Enclave coffee shop and at Loganberry Books, where I was also in charge of local author outreach and promotion. I get so much satisfaction from reaching out to and signal-boosting the local authors and artists I believe in, especially those whose voices are otherwise marginalized. We have so much more to offer as a community than we do in isolation. Much of this work benefits organizations such as the Seeds of Literacy adult literacy program and LitCleveland, our tireless local literary organization. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I\u0027ve provided drums, vocals, and electronic instrumentation with musical acts such as Mirror Maze (Jason Rodriguez), Physics (Dylan Tracey and Eric Spinks), and Iron Dragon (Rob Rosin). Drama is another passion, albeit one I\u0027ve lost touch with in recent years. I was a member of the International Thespian Society from 1999-2001, and I\u0027ve had roles in \n\u003cem\u003eThe Sound of Music, Madame Butterfly, Inherit the Wind, \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eFaust. \u003c/em\u003eMy biggest role was Hermia in \u003cem\u003eA Midsummer Night\u0027s Dream. \u003c/em\u003eI have written or adapted several dramatic pieces, and during high school I wrote staged, directed, built sets, and starred as the villain in a one-act play with my co-author Carrie Fetzek. I have self-published a few \u0027zines, seeing them through every phase from conception through visual design and content creation to completion, and I dabble in collage and painting as well. The next skill I would like to learn is character design and illustration so I can bring to life my mostly-complete script for a SF/F graphic novel set during the Crusades. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMy Values\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nAbove all else, I value rational inquiry, empathy, interconnectedness, lifelong learning, and nuanced understanding of complex issues. I\u0027m a skeptical humanist and an intersectional feminist, and I feel passionately about body positivity, sex positivity, reproductive healthcare, mental healthcare, environmental conservation, science education, consent education, and equal rights for women, LGBTQ+ people, ethnic minorities, PoC, displaced people, and other marginalized populations. My gender is non-binary (AFAB, I use they/them pronouns) and I desperately want better representation for trans, queer, agender, and non-binary identities in popular culture. My creative work has benefited Preterm abortion clinic, and I have done activism and fundraising for Planned Parenthood and the Cleveland Rape Crisis Center. I\u0027m a survivor of sexual violence and of suicidal ideation, and am an advocate for greater acceptance and destigmatization of these experiences in our society. I support the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, the Cleveland Zoo (I adore animals and find a lot of inspiration in nature), and the Cleveland Museum of Art. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m currently in school studying biology and philosophy, among other things, and pursuing my Associate\u0027s degree (at age 33! Never too late!) at the local community college. I\u0027d like to help women, PoC, people with disabilities, and LGBT+ people get more involved in STEM/STEAM careers; to help bridge the gap between the sciences and the humanities; and to help everyone on the planet become more scientifically literate. My dream is to travel and write about science topics (particularly animal conservation) for a living until I can support myself through creative writing alone, but regardless of how I make rent I\u0027ll never stop writing weird poetry for one-person audiences, fantasizing about queer astronauts in bio-mechanical space suits, obsessing about sloths, keeping at least 8 browser tabs open at once so I can KNOW ALL THE THINGS, or blogging about the sexual ethics of Catwoman. Most of all I\u0027ll never stop learning. I get bored easily and so learning and trying new things is my reason for living. If I had to pick one word to describe myself, it would be \"hungry.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eGet in Touch!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nPlease don\u0027t hesitate to contact me if you want to know more; I always love meeting and talking with new people, and I consider everyone a potential friend (unless you\u0027re a bigot, then you can fuck right off out of here). I\u0027m very much an open book and candid to a fault, so you can probably get me to say some pretty incriminating stuff on the record. ;)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks so much for reading this far, and thanks again for your support!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
