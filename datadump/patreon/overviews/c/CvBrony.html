I\u0027ve started to cut my teeth on Rites of Ascension, an epic Alternate Universe MLP:FiM fanfic. I\u0027ve already completed the first book in that saga, and I\u0027m well into the second. I\u0027ve also started my first from-scratch novel that promises to be the first of many. I\u0027ve been diving into writing more and more lately, and have discovered what I truly want to do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledging any level of support is greatly appreciated, and will help me stabilize here in my new home and dive head-first into the world of writing full time. It will also help pay for medical expenses not covered by insurance, as I cannot do much typing thanks to an injury to my hands. (I write with voice dictation software.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have other projects in the starting stages as well, so stay tuned!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for your time and support!\u003cbr\u003e-Cv"

There, you can not only chat with me and other patrons (I\u0027m online a LOT), but even get previews of upcoming chapters! My goal is to interact with my biggest fans to get feedback and help better my writing. As such, fans that are in the channel will be able to get links to upcoming stuff non-patrons have to wait to see! So, if you want to have input on what is hopefully your favorite story, or if you just want to chat with people who are as hyped about the world of Rites as you are, this is the pledge level for you!",
