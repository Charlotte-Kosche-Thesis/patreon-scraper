    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page! I\u0027m just a young artist who wants to begin a new chapter in my growth for artistic expression and make something I\u0027m passionate about more of a priority.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/a120edb21ee9ade5117a8ff5871d7245/tumblr_or0bmbUrCt1qjla21o2_r1_540.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a female artist who lives in a small apartment with my best friend, Daco, and my tuxedo cat Riley. I spent about 3 years in college studying animation and illustration, and I currently work a simple part time job and just make enough to keep myself afloat. But my passion to make art has dwindled and stayed hidden for a long time while I just focused on whats in front of me. I want to change this and become more serious about my work again, completing projects and works of art that has been piling up on my \"To Do\" list, but also maybe reach out to others interested in my work a little easier with Patreon. I have become very reserved over the years from my growing experiences and suffering from depression and anxiety, but I \u00a0hope to become more involved again and I chose this platform to keep me motivated, and more scheduled to produce more content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are you making, exactly?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/fda842bc8467b658df425bee4e28e14e/tumblr_or0bmbUrCt1qjla21o1_r1_540.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo, my main works include your average digital art and character drawings, but I also love creating comics and have a passion for animation. The comics I work on can be one-shot or short stories for scenarios, but I also have about 4 graphic novel or webcomic like projects I want to work on each at a time. As for animation, well, I\u0027m still mostly in practice. I wish to start out with animated gifs and exploration in the medium, but also creating short videos or \"animation memes\" for more practice! (I also do NSFW stuff with all of these categories!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever there is technically a lot more I wish to do in the future other than just digital art, which is why I describe this whole goal as an exploration or journey. It may seem a bit silly, but I am honestly interested in multiple media, and want to work in other trades. It may turn out successfully, or I might find out its not for me, but expect to see other media such as sculpting, music making, videogame streaming, or whatever other fun stuff I just want to involve you guys in for the heck of it! Consider them just little extra content thrown in with my main work for you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRight now, I\u0027m in a position where I can\u0027t offer much other than sneak peaks and first looks at my work. In the future I hope to add more rewards that I have planned, and very excited to give out but I\u0027m just not able to do so at this time. For the moment, I\u0027m hoping that this Patreon can maybe start the motion I need to push me forward to a more artistic future. So if you can donate at least 1 or 5 dollars a month, I\u0027d be very greatful!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m very new to all of this right now, and I\u0027m very nervous about launching my page and keeping up with my goals, but I\u0027m very determined to keep doing what I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
