    "summary": "Hello friends, and welcome to the official patreon page for \u003cem\u003eThe Convention Kid,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0a show about fan conventions and the exciting culture that surrounds them. I\u0027m your host, Elayna Mae Darcy, and this is my first solo podcast I\u0027m launching, though it is not my first podcast rodeo. For the last two years, I\u0027ve co-produced\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://speakbeasty.com/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSpeakBeasty\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and previously launched a pilot for a show I hope to continue in 2018, called\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://indiepenink.com/tavern/story-slayers/\"\u003eStory Slayers\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/em\u003eI\u0027ve also guest hosted on several shows, and am an avid podcast listener. All of that is why I attended PodCon 2017, where I had a life changing weekend, that led to the creation of this show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust before leaving to catch my flight, I was telling my roommate about the con, and he was like, \"Have you ever thought about reviewing cons? Or writing about them on a blog or something?\" and I was like, \"Thought about it, but not sure how\", and then the universe was like, \"Here\u0027s an incredible weekend that\u0027s all about podcasts and chasing your dreams and bringing to life things only you and your unique voice can,\" and so I was like, \"Damn, I guess I\u0027m starting a new podcast.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe name for the show holds even more meaning that goes all the way back to September 1990, because true story,\u003cem\u003e I was\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eborn during a convention. \u003c/em\u003eMind it wasn\u0027t the kind I go to now\u2014ones about fandom, and books, and other such geeky things\u2014but it was a convention none the less. A Pennsylvania State Fireman\u0027s convention, to be exact. My grandfather had been a fire chief, and so every September they would go to this convention, and the year I was born, my mom missed it because she was at the hospital having me. Because of that, growing up, whenever we went to these conventions, my mom\u0027s friends would see me and be like, \"It\u0027s the convention kid!\" The fact that I would go on to be a massive nerd who goes to several cons a year is just the best kind of poetic irony.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so here I am, and here you are. I decided to put this love of podcasting and cons together to create this show, where I\u0027ll not only review cons I attend, but talk about all the things that go hand in hand with con life, such as packing tips, the kinds of panels that are great to hit up, why fandom culture matters so much to us\u2014all that fun stuff. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing that really stood out to me at the inaugural PodCon, was when Franchesca Ramsey and her husband, Patrick Kondas, (who together host\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://lastnamebasis.com/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eLast Name Basis\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) talked about how the idea for their show came from doing something they already liked doing (sitting on the couch and talking about stuff) but doing it in front of a mic. So here we are together, and I\u0027m excited to have you along for the adventure as I do something I love in front of a mic\u2014be a very excited nerd."
