    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello fellow Patreons\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0My name is Chris and I live in a small town in New Jersey surrounded by farms and lots of woods. \u00a0Growing up my parents always encouraged me to be artistic in one way or another. \u00a0From drawing and painting when I was younger to graphic design, playing guitar in a metal band and finally finding \u003cstrong\u003ephotography\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0Aside from that I love to spend time with my pit bull rescue named Missy.  She likes belly rubs, ass scratches and of course napping.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is how we ended up here. \u00a0I enjoy taking way too many photos, but who doesn\u0027t and sharing them with the world. \u00a0Most of my photos are released through my Tumblr and Instagram pages where I post a single new photo each day. \u00a0With this Patreon I plan to give supporters the option to be able to see my images once they are ready and not have to wait for them to be posted on the previously mentioned sites in addition to some exclusive \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon only\u003c/strong\u003e content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this Patreon I plan to release many images from my archives that have never see the light of day and some that have. \u00a0Currently I plan on releasing content either twice a month or on a monthly basis, depending on how everything goes of course. \u00a0Besides the content that will be released from the archives, my newer content will be available to the higher tiers so you get to see everything before anyone else does plus some \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon only\u003c/strong\u003e content! \u00a0Being part of the cool kids club will have it\u0027s perks. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can probably guess. \u00a0The cost of arranging shoots, booking models, location, traveling (either me to the model or the model to me), keeping my camera and computer running all adds up. \u00a0All while trying to pay my bills like rent, keeping the lights on, and feeding myself and my dog. \u00a0With your help I will be able to arrange even more shoots and have even more content to share with minimizing the stress of trying to make ends meet. \u00a0Every little bit helps, even if everyone of my Tumblr or Instagram followers pledged only $1 that would give me the ability to book many more shoots per month. \u00a0\u003cem\u003eCurrently I am only going to be releasing content at the beginning of each week\u003c/em\u003e.  This will depend on how many shoots I am able to book, which is directly related to how many backers I have.  I may increase this to multiple times a week.  The more backers I have, the more of an ability it will give me to arrange shoots with new and old models.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a man of few words and would much rather my images speak for themselves.  So my posts will probably include more images and just a short blurb. \u00a0I\u0027m sure you would rather see what I\u0027m creating then reading about it anyways. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c3.patreon.com/2/patreon-posts/U98WG4fgwokc7Qqx1Fbhb7vxq3K424KNEUUXHgsqEf6z19v74bxwXi0Pb30EtPZR.jpg?t=1496966400\u0026amp;w=620\u0026amp;v=pPgPExQSJlSeBhvN6mGRE_WUcP1xqfMyZQT0JNLWz2I%3D\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.chrismday.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWebsite\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://chrismday.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/chrismday\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://a.co/jiWxehC\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon Wishlist\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHIS PATREON IS 18+ ONLY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll content posted to Patreon is copyrighted, it is not for public distribution outside of this Patreon.
