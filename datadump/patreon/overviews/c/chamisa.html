    "summary": "Hi! I am an illustrator, children\u0027s book writer, fine artist and teacher who also dabbles in animation, woodworking, and baking. Being a professional artist is a hustle, and hustling is not always conducive to creating. Patreon is a way to help open up a space in my schedule where I can make something new, without restrictions. It may be an illustration, an animation, a wooden puzzle, a comic strip. These are all things I\u0027d like to explore and share with you. The central theme of most of my work involves getting in touch with our inner kid -- that part of us that responds to life with wonder and an open mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/OEPzbK9.jpg[/img]\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy contributing a small amount each month, you\u0027re helping me explore these different methods of art-making, and you get to be a witness to the first release of any work I share with the world, as well as exclusive projects that I won\u0027t share anywhere else."
