I came to realize being a \u2018super-hero\u2019 was pretty much impossible, but I discovered I can write myself as a superhero in stories of my own is very possible! And it\u2019s something I love to do. Write and draw my own stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLater in life, I discovered it\u2019s possible to make money, and in some cases even a living, as a professional video game player. And you can do this without resorting to things like mindless Q/A in-house paid style game tests, or being a top tier eSports professional.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis led me to where I am now, a place where I can live my dreams in a way that makes me happy, and makes me feel fulfilled. Patreon, to me, is a gateway to fulfilling those dreams! So here I am, presenting what I have, to the world, and hoping to provide service and entertainment to you that you will feel worth your time and compensation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy watching me reach to make my dreams come true, I ask you to please subscribe for even a dollar a month so that I can strive to make the world a happier place by providing entertaining and fulfilling media, and help others realize they can reach their dreams too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is my DeviantArt\u00a0Page\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://chance-penwilder.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://chance-penwilder.deviantart.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eLink to My Superhero Discussion and Toy review Channel Is linked below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi8h8o3ThT52M0CJ-Tlg10A\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi8h8o3ThT52M0CJ-...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
