In the beginning, I\nscribbled my imaginations into school books. I wanted to become a journalist\none day, but people kept telling me that writing would never be able to feed me\nwell. Not deterred, I tried my hand at Fanfiction and thoroughly enjoyed\ninteracting with my followers and letting my stories be dynamic rather than\nstatic. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow, I\u2019m a University student trying to earn some extra\npocket money for food with my thoughts. Every dollar you pledge has a direct\nlifeline to my stomach as well as my confidence. I write about anything and\neverything that comes to mind. Sometimes my mind doesn\u2019t stray far, and I write\nmemoirs or novels inspired by my diary. More often than not, I\u2019m carried a\ndistance by the unicorns in my imagination and I write pure fiction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
