    "summary": "Given the subject matter I cover, you\u2019re probably either a student or a working professional trying to tool up. Good for you! You\u2019re in good company. If you\u0027re not, that\u0027s okay too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI love education. I paid a lot of money in tuition to learn software that is a) incredibly useful while being incredibly expensive and b) constantly going obsolete and being updated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEssentially, learning software in a University is a frustratingly expensive sham. You pay a lot of money to learn a tool that you will probably forget how to use by the time you need to use it and then need to re-learn because the version you were taught is now obsolete. In addition to this, chances are that the faculty you\u2019re paying to teach you this software probably haven\u2019t used the software they\u2019re teaching in a production environment for a long time and aren\u2019t aware of or understand the application of the new features added (the ones rendering the old versions obsolete) that you are now expected to use professionally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, I can\u2019t teach you your industry, but I\u2019m super good at teaching about and staying on top of software and software updates. I\u2019m also a huge fan of information being free. I think it\u2019s awesome to be able to go online when I am at a dead end and pull up answers from active, qualified professionals who have donated their knowledge for the general benefit of humanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, here\u2019s how this works. My content will always and forever be yours, for free. Because I care about you and because I care about producing quality content, you can become my patron. This is totally voluntary. This is also awesome for both of us, plus the entire rest of the internet. Together, we can prioritize training content creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAt the end of the month, you donate an amount equal to the number of video tutorials I produce times the amount you want to donate per video. You can also set a monthly maximum so I can\u2019t accidentally render you bankrupt. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI, in no way shape or form, intend to change the \u201cforever available for free\u201d thing I\u2019ve got going on. Regardless of whether or not you become a patron, these videos will always be there, for you, for free. This is because I really enjoy sharing what I know through making videos and answering questions. With your support, I can continue to prioritize training content creation and get rid of some of those video ads! Advertising money is wonderful, but even minimally invasive ads get annoying. Annoying means you get sick of it and leave or use sneaky methods to disable ads, which in the end means less ads are played and it\u2019s harder to justify the time to create the content that both you and I would like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThink it over. Regardless of what you decide to do, thank you for taking the time to view my content!"
