    "summary": "Hello! I am creating the comic High School\u0027s A Nightmare. It\u0027s a comic about a young girl who has a crippling fear for all things supernatural. On her 16th birthday she wakes up to find that she\u0027s one of the things she\u0027s terrified of, a werewolf, and must now go to a school with all the other creatures she fears. My intention with this comic is to combine a silly and humorous slice of life theme, with the twist of Raven\u0027s special situation, and with hope make a story that warms the heart and tells a few life lessons on the way. This comic has been in the making for years now, the story is something my best friend and I came up with when we were 13 and with her blessing I have started bringing that story to life. This project is something that is super near and dear to my heart and I am really excited to be making this a reality. Hopefully with your support I can continue this on to completion! I thank you for stopping by and I hope you\u0027ll take a read on all that I offer.\u00a0"
