    "summary": "Many people in our culture, especially women, grow up thinking of their bodies as objects to be seen rather than as subjects that do. Strength and movement training provides a powerful opportunity for shifting from focusing on the body as an object to the body as the subject of experience, meaning we can learn to experience the body from the inside out at the same time as we achieve strength milestones like our first or tenth pull-up, a bodyweight or double-bodyweight deadlift, or grace and ease in bodyweight movement drills. Cultivating this mind-body connection as we grow in strength and ability supports us in better sustaining growth and healing in all areas of our lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first priority with clients is to cultivate a sense of agency and to support the skill of self-regulation. I emphasize mindfulness and self-compassion practices as we work on making progressive and sustainable improvements in both strength and movement skills, and I also provide a trauma-sensitive emphasis for clients that may need a little extra care as they explore movement. My aim is to help clients feel connected with their bodies and empowered to make good decisions over time, while learning to trust that health, well-being, and aesthetic changes can and do happen when we consistently rest well, eat well, and train well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike many trainers, my personal journey into fitness has a strong influence on the work that I am doing now. Coming from a background of severe interpersonal trauma and navigating issues related to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, I found that my first priority in exercising was to just experience what it was like to be *in* my body, as opposed to being dissociative and disconnected from my inner world. I needed to be gentle, steady, and kind as I met myself where I was, and I learned to gradually lean into ability, strength, and intensity from there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a supplement to trauma therapy, strength training gave me gradual practice with being able to respond, being able to do, and just being able, which was powerful medicine for counteracting the ingrained helplessness that can be a devastating part of the legacy of trauma. Through meeting resistance progressively over time, my relationship with my body has fundamentally changed, and I strive to hold a space for this sort of shift when working with my clients.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spent a year as an apprentice at \u003ca href=\"http://www.bodytribe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBodyTribe Fitness\u003c/a\u003e, and my contemplative strength practice borrows liberally from the physical culture and traditional strength training, yoga, martial arts, powerlifting, Olympic lifting, and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction programs. Along with learning traditional movements like squatting, deadlifting, pressing, pulling, and crawling, my clients learn to cultivate self-compassion, self-empathy, and presence. I\u2019ve been training clients for 7 years, and I love working with anyone who wants to bring mindfulness and embodiment training into their lifting programs, as well as with people who might not otherwise feel comfortable in a traditional gym environment, including beginners, women, members of the LGBTQ community, and trauma survivors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLearning to experience my body as an unfolding process, instead of as an object, and cultivating strength and grace in both stillness and in movement has led me to a larger and more expansive sense of self, and I\u2019d love to support you in your version of this journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
