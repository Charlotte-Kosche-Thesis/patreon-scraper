    "summary": "ConCardia is a new kind of collectible card game that runs at conventions and more. In any collectible card game, there are two aspects to play: acquiring cards and playing the game. With traditional CCGs, acquiring cards is a necessary evil of forking over a big pile of cash for some cards so you can get to the fun part of playing the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConCardia makes acquisition as awesome as play. You acquire cards by attending conventions and exploring the con to find cards. Some vendors who support the game through sponsorships have cards, there are cards at performances, panels, and other places. There are even some quests you can go on to get cards. For many players, the fun of ConCardia is just finding the cards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the new C4 rules, the game is quicker to learn, multiplayer, and easier to play. It is a multiplayer game that combines the easy fun of a party game with the strategy of serious card game... even if some of those serious cards require you to cluck like a chicken.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe C4 rules also allow us to make more licensed and theme decks. We are making decks for bands, charities, indie films, and more. There is no limit to the variety of decks that we can make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFull rules can be found at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.concardia.info/p/the-rules.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.concardia.info\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are participating in \u003ca href=\"http://darksideofthecon.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDark Side of the Con\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.lunacon.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLunacon\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.steampunkworldsfair.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSteampunk World\u0027s Fair\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.chessiecon.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eChessieCon\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ro-con.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRo-Con\u003c/a\u003e, and we being invited to new conventions all the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why do I need your support? Currently, I run ConCardia in my spare time, a few hours here and there between work and family and everything else. This very much limits how much I can do for the game and how awesome I can make it. However, at a certain point, I could run the game full time. At an even higher point, we could do fancy things like hire staff to make the game even more awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo contribute and be part of the game. No, seriously, I\u0027ll put your face on a card."
