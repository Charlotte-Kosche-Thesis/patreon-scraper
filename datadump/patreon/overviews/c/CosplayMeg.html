Looks like you\u0027ve stumbled on to my Patreon page. I\u0027m trying to branch out, to do more than just create/wear my cosplays. I\u0027d love to start doing more photoshoots, Twitch streams, live chats, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m no stranger to all things nerdy, but I\u0027m a relative newcomer to the convention scene. I took the plunge and attended San Diego Comic Con on a whim in 2015. I was hooked. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/2rzdkkj.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little about me... An IT Geek by day, I do my best to devote what spare time I have to the design and construction of my next project. That\u0027s probably my favorite part, honestly, getting to (re)create the characters I love. I also enjoy propmaking, and have a store on Etsy where I sell a few things, and am open to commissions as well. I tend to cosplay characters I can relate to in some way, or those who are often overlooked. These days I\u0027m getting more towards cosplaying whoever I want, just because I tell myself I can, regardless of whether or not I look like them. I think that\u0027s the amazing thing about cosplay and the surrounding community, the support and encouragement, especially along the lines of body positivity and acceptance. I love the idea that it\u0027s never a question of whether or not someone can \"pull it off\"! That\u0027s one of my \"goals\", I guess you could call it, as a cosplayer, to inspire people and show them that anyone can cosplay, as long as you enjoy what you do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve created this Patreon to help me financially so I can continue doing what I love. As much as I\u0027m doing this for myself, I sincerely hope that I\u0027ve provided enjoyment or inspiration through my work to others, and hope to continue to do so!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rewards are constantly evolving as I have more to offer... Keep checking back for opportunities to earn props, crafts, and other awesome stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/ek3n9y.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always open to input, as well! Is there something I\u0027m missing that you\u0027d like to see? Tell me! I\u0027d love to hear from you!"
