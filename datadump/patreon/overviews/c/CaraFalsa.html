If you\u0027ve followed my work before (\u003ca href=\"https://carafalsa.deviantart.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e) (\u003ca href=\"https://carafalsa.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHere\u003c/a\u003e) \u003ca href=\"https://www.furaffinity.net/user/fakerface45/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e(And Here\u003c/a\u003e) or just looked me up at this very second, then thank you and I\u0027m sorry respectively hahaha. For the most part I\u0027m a fetish artist who draws lady poots and poops in an attempt to perfect the style and quality of my own art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo me, drawing this subject matter is a convenient vehicle for my main goal: gradually learn as much as I can about art. And it would appear as though I need to make more money to satiate my financial needs. So I thought patreon would be the best place to get that \"two birds with this one stone\" action and expand my knowledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf things work out as planned, I\u0027ll be staying here for the long haul and meeting the needs of our niche community or just general art. I can guarantee I\u0027ll able to draw more than just fetish art so don\u0027t be afraid ta ask.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e In any case I\u0027ll be implementing a reward system I\u0027ve seen work out well. Different level tiers will be able to make suggestions and requests on what I should use my totally objective powers of drawing lines for. I will be randomly choosing requests from each tier level that offers a raffle as a reward and produce that drawing the following month. Along with whatever else I create in the meantime. So it goes request, raffle little sketches over here some tiny gifs over there and then the month after, the reward (or it will for the most part at least).\u003cbr\u003e"
