I just want to play some games and maybe teach people something they did not know before. The equipment I\u0027m using for this is... probably on its last legs, and I don\u0027t want to be forced to stop for that reason. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo the money I receive will only be used to help improve the quality of the content I put up. My main goal right now is to put together a new computer, nothing crazy, but something that will work well and last for awhile. I currently use a $500 HP desktop with a decent GPU crammed inside. Seriously, the thing barely fit in there. But amazingly it has done a pretty good job so far, but the limitations are there nonetheless. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect people to start throwing their cash at me for nothing. Check out my videos, and if you like them\u00a0 and wish to support me, I would be more than gracious for your support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003eCzarPeppers\u003cbr\u003e"
