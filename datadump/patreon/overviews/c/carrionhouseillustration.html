    "summary": "Storytelling itself is the most tried and tested form of communicating an idea or belief to\nsomeone else. It\u2019s gone off in many directions via religious texts, journalism,\nchildren\u2019s books, fiction, blogs etc. but the idea has remained the same.\nHelping to translate other people\u2019s narratives into something visual is a huge\nresponsibility and I like to think that people approach me not just because the\naesthetic of my work appeals to them but also because they see me as a safe\npair of hands for the world that they\u2019ve created. I want their characters to be\nable to deliver the message they\u2019ve been designed to carry because the world\nwill ultimately be richer for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/max_1200/e4e43431831927.5662154a197f8.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing an illustrator is my full time job but it is very literally my lifestyle; I work and compose pieces alone, market my work and style alone, research and get to grips with source material myself and correspond with my diverse range of clients first hand. There\u0027s no middle men or third party cracking the whip and although it sounds liberating (it is, it really is) it\u0027s also an all consuming practice. If I stop working then there\u0027s nobody else staying late to pick up the slack\u00a0or somebody to go and stock up on art supplies. I live and breathe what I do and this Patreon page should allow you a little more insight into the things that come out of that constant, unrelenting cycle of creating.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/max_1200/f270e345483699.5832cbb29217b.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to see sketches, paintings, reflections on projects, developmental work that will never make it into the eye of the general public, time lapse videos on how I make a painting or drawing - even be a part of writing a song or two (yes, really!) then you\u0027re in the right place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRest assured that any form of funding will go straight back into making more artwork by helping to buy tools and materials that will help to keep the artwork rate up and running at full power for as long as possible :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cimg src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/disp/58c5ae45543037.583481b215b7d.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eFor more work visit:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCarrion House\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
