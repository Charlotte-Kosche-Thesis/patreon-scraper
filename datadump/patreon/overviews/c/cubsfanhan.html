I fell into YouTube by accident really, simply seeking to create guides for members of my guild and community in Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes. I work for an insurance company full time, have a wife and a 3 year old daughter (with another on the way due in November!), love the Chicago Cubs and even find time to do some community theater on the side. I recently played Farquaad in Shrek, Patsy in Spamalot, and Corny Collins in Hairspray!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere is my money going?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou have my commitment that 100% of the Patreon support I receive will go directly into the channel. There are still so many upgrades I\u0027d love to make to help the quality of content go to the next level. Lighting, camera quality, microphone quality, and other misc items go a long way to make the videos as solid as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank you all so much for the support and welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e"

This is a long term goal!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I reach 200, I\u0027ll be hosting a Patreon only party!
