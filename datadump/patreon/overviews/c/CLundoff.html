After patrons have had a chance to read the posts, they will be made public here and crossposted to my \"\u003ca href=\"https://queerscifi.com/out-of-the-past/\"\u003eOut of the Past\u003c/a\u003e\" column at Queer Sci Fi. Because I\u0027m still gearing up, there will still be intermittent resource lists, just like last year. The levels will remain as is for the foreseeable future and proceeds will be still be donated to nonprofits unless my financial situation changes.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat kind of recommendation lists and why do you want them? \u003c/strong\u003eThe short answer: because I\u2019m good at collecting information and have an  encyclopedic knowledge of an enormous amount of stuff. Also, my search and research skills are excellent and I\u2019m very straight-forward about my biases and experiences so you can make your own calls on what works for you.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get out of it?\u003c/strong\u003e I plan to donate what you give me so I get to support cool organizations\u00a0 and creators and I get to work on a nonfiction book that I\u0027ve been contemplating for the last several years. Your lovely and much appreciated support will help me prioritize work on this.  So I get your money for donations/supporting other creators and you get to read a bunch of stuff about various aspects of queer science fiction, fantasy and horror. And I get to keep to a schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNonprofits I hope to donate to in 2018:\u003cbr\u003ePlanned Parenthood\u003cbr\u003eSouthern Poverty Law Center\u003cbr\u003eNAACP\u003cbr\u003eADAPT\u003cbr\u003eUltraviolet\u003cbr\u003eNational Center for Lesbian Rights\u003cbr\u003eNational Center for Transgender Equality\u003cbr\u003eThe Nature Conservancy\u003cbr\u003eRainbow Railroad\u003cbr\u003eCenter for Biological Diversity\u003cbr\u003e"
