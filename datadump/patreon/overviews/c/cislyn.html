    "summary": "Hello friends! I\u0027m Cislyn, a creator of strange words and worlds, an avid consumer of geeky media, and a maker of many crafty things. My poetry and fiction has appeared in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.fairwoodpress.com/catalog/item/7650871/10098125.htm\"\u003eThe Best of Electric Velocipede\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://strangehorizons.com/poetry/hot/\"\u003eStrange Horizons\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://flashfictiononline.com/main/article/the-secret-life-of-sea-monsters/\"\u003eFlash Fiction Online\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://remixtmag.wordpress.com/2016/09/12/volume-1-issue-1-move-inonout/\"\u003eReMixt Magazine\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love lots of things with a big, bouncy enthusiasm. Including deadlines and limitations, actually - in early September of 2017 I finished up a year-long collaborative writing and art project (\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/CC_Otherworlds\"\u003eCC:Otherworlds\u003c/a\u003e)\u00a0which had me writing something new once every two weeks, and I loved it! I knew as soon as it ended that I\u0027d want to do something similar on my own, but with a little less pressure and on a more forgiving time scale. And maybe (definitely) with some other stuff thrown in, because I am a pretty random soul.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here we are! This is what I am proposing: I\u0027ll pick a prompt once a month, and write a thing. This thing is guaranteed to be weird in some way - all of my work is. My genres are all speculative: fantasy, science fiction, horror, reimagined fairy tales, weird west... you get the picture. As I write, I\u0027ll post at least two process posts. I\u0027ll talk about writing for this particular prompt, where I\u0027m going with the story, inspiration, revision, and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou, my nifty patrons, will have access to all the process posts and will get first glance at the story or poem I produce. I\u0027m happy to get feedback and input for future versions! For those of you who are into such things, I will print it out on spiffy paper, seal it with a pretty wax seal, and send it off in the mail to you (why? Because getting physical mail is awesome and fun, that\u0027s why).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also going to commit to doing at least one media review a month - I play a lot of games, watch movies \u0026amp; tv shows (sometimes years after other folks, but hey, y\u0027all won\u0027t mind, I hope), and read goshtons of books, poems, and short stories. You\u0027ll have access to those reviews!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Will there be crafty stuff?,\" you ask, knowing full well there will be. \"Why yes!,\" I answer, excitedly looking around at my piles of goodies. I really enjoy making things. I really enjoy writing things to go along with the things I make. And I\u0027m looking forward to sharing some of those things with you all! Sometimes the crafty thing will be a physical object with a story literally attached to it. Sometimes the crafty thing will be an odd shape made in yarn which inspires a bit of microfiction or poetry. I have a small set of Key Stories already written (and a bag of keys to attach to them), more yarn than it\u0027s really reasonable for one human to own, and many odd little things in my house I\u0027ve been itching to write stories for. I\u0027ll be posting those, and a few lucky people will also get access to them. If I do a piece that is one of a kind, I\u0027ll choose randomly from among the patrons at that level to receive the physical thing, and the other folks will get a key story or other nifty thing from my supply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a lot of possibilities here. I love working with other people, and I\u0027m going to try to entice folks to come over thisaway and collaborate with me. There will be polls, there will maybe be videos, and there will definitely be pictures of my three awesome fluffy cats. Come explore the possibilities with me. I think it\u0027ll be fun!"
