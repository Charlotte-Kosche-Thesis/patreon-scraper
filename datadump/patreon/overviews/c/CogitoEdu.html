I create videos in order to inspire curiosity. My goal is to teach people about the fascinating world we live in without being too dry or academic. I usually try to cover ideas or topics that aren\u0027t covered very often and sometimes I cover things that I just find interesting. Through the power of the internet and mediocre animation I hope to educate and entertain. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I create these videos by myself in my spare time. Which makes it a fairly slow process. Meaning that you, most valued viewer, only get one Cogito video every month or so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat is why I am asking for your support.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eWhy Use Patreon\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eMy ambition is to transform this channel into a consistent and sustainable project. With your support, I could improve the overall quality of the content I produce. It would allow me to increase the number of videos I can put out each month. As well other content, such as a podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make Cogito into a truly international Youtube channel too. With you donations I could invest more time into translating episodes into different languages.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I could begin investing in better equipment and software. I could purchase stock footage and music. As well as books and access to academic journals which would vastly improve the quality of each video. With enough donations I could begin incorporating filmed footage into the videos, visiting locations, and even conducting interviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u00a0Thank You For Your Support!\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eTo all of you that watch Cogito you have my deepest thanks. The community around this channel is amazing and I love creating videos because of you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are under no obligation to donate. If you can\u0027t afford to then I would prefer that you did not. Nothing will change for regular viewers and I still appreciate that you enjoy these weird videos that I make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy ultimate goal is to create content that you all enjoy. This is a tool that allows me to do that.\u003c/strong\u003e"
