    "summary": "Hi there, I am Carlo Cruz. I am a writer and artist. This blog chronicles my journey as I strive to live a life of faith and contribution. By sharing the lessons I learn, I also wish to help others in their own journeys, or at least make them a little bit lighter through my drawings. If you have read any of my blog posts or seen my drawings, thanks for your interest in supporting my project here on Patreon! If not, you can learn more about my blog and project\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.carlocruz.ph/about\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWHY CARLO\u2019S BLOG IS ON PATREON\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my blog in 2014 and it has changed a lot since then. But, one thing has never changed \u2014 its mission. Over the years of writing and drawing, I realized that I find purpose and fulfillment in bringing God closer to His people and challenging remarkable people like you to be true to themselves, to be vulnerable, to be brave, to create, to work hard, to make a contribution, and to never stop learning.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI simply wish to be able to continue this project for a long time\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from that, here are two other reasons why I\u0027m on Patreon:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. To focus on the project full-time\u003c/strong\u003e. Aside from writing and creating art on the blog (almost) every day, I also write for technology companies and other clients. My day job allows me to pay our bills and keep the blog afloat. But, most of the time, work gets really busy and the project takes a back seat. By supporting the project here on Patreon, you will be helping me take a step closer to becoming a full-time blogger. But more than that, you will also be helping me spread God\u0027s love to others by being able to focus on creating more (and hopefully better) content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. To keep the project free (and ad-free)\u003c/strong\u003e. All the art and writings on the blog are and will always be free in order to reach more of God\u0027s children. Also, keeping the blog ad-free helps create a clean and pure reading and learning experience. But, all these will not be possible without the generous support of readers and angels like you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWHERE YOUR PLEDGES WILL GO\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHosting\u003c/strong\u003e. This is what allows my blog to be connected to and be viewed on the internet. Without it, my thoughts would live only in my mind and my laptop\u2019s memory.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmail services\u003c/strong\u003e. FeedBlitz, my email services provider, allows readers to subscribe to the blog and receive my art and writing straight to their inbox (almost) every day. Just as important as hosting, email services allow me to create a long-lasting relationship with you and other readers. But as the mailing list grows, so do the fees.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarketing\u003c/strong\u003e. Facebook and other social networks no longer work like they used to. Now, it is almost required to pay a small fee in order for posts to reach those who \u201cliked\u201d our pages. Boosting posts also allows the project to reach those who really need it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDaily expenses\u003c/strong\u003e. I still need access to basic needs like food, shelter, and clothing. But, don\u2019t worry. My needs are minimal.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTithe\u003c/strong\u003e. Ten percent of what you pledge will go back to the Creator and His Church through ministries and other initiatives for the less privileged. More than feeding the hungry, we want to equip them through sustainable programs.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of today, these are the essential expenses of the project. But one day, I also dream of hiring community champions to create and manage online communities that will allow readers to support each other in their own faith journeys. I also have other plans to expand the project, start new ones, and serve you even more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for any support that you decide to offer. But more than anything else, thank you for simply being there. The best is yet to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2014 Carlo\u003cbr\u003e"
