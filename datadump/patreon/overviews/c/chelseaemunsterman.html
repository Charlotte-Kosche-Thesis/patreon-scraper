    "summary": "Hey guys! Thank you so much for taking the time to check out my patreon page. I know that there are so many authors out there and so many books to choose from. I am so blessed to be able to have this gift of creativity and I want nothing more then to share it with all of you!!! I\u0027m not in this to make millions with my writing (if that happens I won\u0027t be upset BTW). I was able to published the first book in my debut book series because of all the love and support I received from my readers on Wattpad and family members.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is an amazing day and age where anyone who wants can write there own book and publish it. That\u0027s crazy amazing right!?!!? Well the one thing that people never really tell you is that is costs quite a chunk of change to write and publish your own book, any where from $1,500 - $5,000 depending on how many edits you do or how you trick out your manuscript.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I published my first book it cost me about $2000 to do it and it would have been more but money got tight. So I had to give up some details in my formatting and not give it the polish I really wanted too as my first ever published work of art. So one of my readers who fallows me on Wattpad approached me about when my second book was coming out and I had to be honest with her. I told her that my finances are not where I would like to be able to put out for an editor and to start the whole project over again. That wonderful reader of mine is the one who inspired me to build this page, she made me realize that there are people that want to support me and help me achive my goals. So here\u0027s to you girl thank you for speaking up and letting me know that people are more amazing then you give them credit for!\u003cbr\u003e"

I live and work in Arizona but grew up in the Chicago land area. I have been writing since 2007 and am an avid lover of ancient history. I use to spend a lot of time in the Field Museum in Chicago studying all I could about different cultures. I am a veracious reader of books and blessed to be able to call myself an author. I love to volunteer my time fostering Shar-pei\u0027s with a Shar-pei rescue called Peipeople.",
