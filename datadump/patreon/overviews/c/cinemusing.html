My name is Josh Lewis and I\u0027m a freelance writer and video producer in Toronto, Canada, but mostly I\u0027m just a guy that loves movies. I studied film production at the Toronto Film School and have been making videos \u0026amp; writing about/reviewing movies on the internet for years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO I MAKE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll kinds of things! In the past I\u0027ve worked on \u0026amp; wrote about movies in all kinds of different capacities but for now I\u0027m making (monthly-ish) analytical video essays on films, discussing many aspects of film form, aesthetics and themes to expand my own knowledge and yours. To muse about cinema, if you will. (If you won\u0027t, I apologize.) The primary goal here is to spark intelligent discourse and shine light on new perspectives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBetween research, writing and editing, each Cinemusing video essay ranges from about 3-4 weeks of work (mostly because I give each video my all \u0026amp; don\u0027t try to cheat you guys), depending on the amount of time I can afford to allocate to them, of course. Support on Patreon frees up time which means less hassle for me, and better/more content for you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT CAN YOU DO?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny and all support is welcome. Obviously, if you can afford it, monetary support here on Patreon is optimal as it is the most effective way to free up time for me -- the dream is to eventually be able to provide this kind of content two, or even three (!!!) times a month, right now that just isn\u0027t possible -- but simply watching, discussing and sharing the essays helps too. At the end of the day I just want to make great content for you guys and spark great discussions in the community so the videos will never stop as long as I have the capacity to make them... Support on here is to give me the opportunity to make more of them and make them even better, and also, depending on which level of patron you choose to become, to bring you and I a little closer together.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
