     "about": "Hey I am Suzanne and I am a PT and Fitness Instructor who deals with chronic pain \u0026amp; fatigue, but in my search to find restorative, low impact medium intensity workouts that my body could handle but that could still help me to function, feel and look better fast, I could find NOTHING that worked, and I wanted more than just easy stretches and outdated workouts. So thats when I decided to design my own routines that I could look forward to doing each day but that didn\u0027t cause me any unnecessary pain or fatigue after,  and now I want to share them with you! These workouts are stress reducing so they prevent cortisol spikes, non repetitive, easy to follow, great for all levels, and help chronic fatigue and pain sufferers (like those with Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue) to look and feel better naturally.  They are also great for beginners and those who are sick of difficult, high intense routines that are so exhausting and hard on the joints, bad for your hormones and heart. The workouts range from 5 minutes all the way up to 60 minutes in length and cover a wide variety of classes and formats such as: kickboxing, dancing, isometrics, light weight training, bodyweight training, dynabands, warmups \u0026amp; cool downs, lengthening \u0026amp; stretching, traditional aerobics \u0026amp; cardio, chair work, and much more all done in an easier, yet very effective way so that you see results fast and feel better more often. If you are consistent with these routines I promise that you will also start to have less pain \u0026amp; fatigue because regular moderate intensity exercise has been proven to heal the body long term way more than sporadic high intensity exercise. I hope you enjoy the channel. If you ever have any suggestions for me as to how to improve the workouts or ideas for future videos you would like me to make, please make sure to leave that in the comments below. I appreciate any input you can offer. Thank you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThese workouts are safe for: \nFibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue, Adrenal Fatigue, Hypothyroidism, Hashimotos Syndrome, Joint Pain Issues, Insomnia, Depression \u0026amp; Anxiety Disorders, Stress, Beginners and Intermediates \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCocolime Fitness offers super effective workouts for people dealing with chronic pain \u0026amp; fatigue issues who want to feel and look better fast! (Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue, Adrenal Fatigue, Thyroid Issues, Hashimotos Syndrome, Joint Pain, Depression \u0026amp; Anxiety and Insomnia)  It is also for people who get bored easily and want variety in their workouts and no repetition in their routines, and for people who hate doing stressful, exhausting high intensity workouts but who still want super effective routines that are medium intensity and easy to perform.\n\nDon\u0027t forget to subscribe to join our community and get new videos every week! However, since I am dealing with health problems, I am not able to make promises about uploading on a specific day of the week (all of my fellow sick friends out there know what I\u0027m talking about, right? ...lol) So please bear with me...",
