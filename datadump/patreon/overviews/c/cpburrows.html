I have been practicing photography since about 2010 and over time have gravitated toward these unusual forms of lighting. Years ago I modified a camera to photograph infrared light, and since mid-2014 I have been executing Ultraviolet-Induced Visible Fluorescence (UVIVF) photography with moderate enthusiasm from viewers. Thus, when I submitted a collection of photos to Colossal it was with a certain degree of skepticism. I was shocked by their posting my photos and have since been absolutely blown away by the international reception to the collection. My work with this photography is ongoing, and with your help, I am hoping we can take it to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(38, 38, 38);\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/34303190@N06/24071351593/sizes/l\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1507/24071351593_e62c9b4ca9_b.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(38, 38, 38);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(38, 38, 38);\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 63, 63);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003eWhy are you on Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter starting doing UVIVF photography, I realized there was a world of untapped potential outside of what little bits I could bring into my darkened human caves. I want to vastly scale up the scope of my project with portable high-intensity lighting and a camera better suited to low-light photography. Having been unable to receive previous grants I\u0027ve applied for, and with my realization that so many people have been enjoying seeing my photography, it is my hope that through Patreon I might be able to fund a project like I have in mind. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/34303190@N06/31670921530/sizes/l\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/739/31670921530_3b7041873e_b.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003eSo what is your vision for the project you have in mind?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m using a 30W UV LED source right now, and I want to scale that up at least 1000% in order to illuminate entire scenes. The fine details of single flowers are very cool, but I have a hunch that seeing entire scenes glowing like a glade in Avatar would be staggering. I imagine going to the redwood forests of the Pacific Northwest and lighting scenes of clover and foxgloves, fields of wildflowers in Santa Barbara, abandoned properties, or even grungy alleys at night. Even \n\u003cem\u003epeople \u003c/em\u003eglow under this light, revealing forgotten scars and freckles like an inverted sky of stars and nebulae. There is vast potential.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u0027t know with total certainty that it would be as fantastic as I imagine.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI do know that I want it to be, and I do know that I want to find out if it is.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you have an imagination, if you want to find out, if you want to explore these invisible worlds with me... please consider becoming a patron.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/503/32478164185_2a573c0d50_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003eShould we know anything else?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nProbably lots.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut about me, well...\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m very much a DIY/jack-of-all-trades sort of person, inclusive of photography. To support the habit, I have bought and sold camera gear, and in order to afford to practice my passion, I\u0027ve never bought gear firsthand. For both my infrared cameras, I pioneered their modification and published a guide on my website. My lenses are all in good shape, but are mostly from the film-era, and some that I\u0027ve used have been broken when I received them. Even my UV-lighting equipment has been items I\u0027ve put together myself. I do it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI didn\u0027t start out wanting to do photography. I originally wanted to be a writer, and I still do. I\u0027ve also wanted to be a teacher, graphic designer, engineer, product designer, and plenty of other things.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBack to the writing though: On occasion I write stories, usually with tragic, humanist aspects. As a perk for my patrons, I am likely to offer a read of some of my short stories.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy love of photography has eclipsed that of writing, but I certainly have not lost the interest and eventually hope to finish the novel that I\u0027m slowly writing. If somehow I can integrate the two, or let one facilitate the other, that is all the better because regardless of what I am making, creating things people enjoy makes me happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003eCan I see more of your work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eNo. I mean...
