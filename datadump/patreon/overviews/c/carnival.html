    "summary": "Welcome... Step right up... let me introduce you... wait... haven\u0027t you watched our beautiful video? ... you should! For then you know... we are the Carnival de Resistance! We are holy fools longing for transformation, threading church into Big top dream and big band protest, creating space to deviate from the norm. We are artists, activists, and teachers animating old sacred stories, listening to the groan of creation, and reclaiming the legacy of resistance within the Christian faith tradition. Within our Carnival residencies we enchant in the Carnival midway and bigtop, we embody sustainable alternatives in our village, and we engage with various components of local communities. Within a festival context, we bring in talented friends (musical projects and teachers) to amplify our rich offerings. There is a great deal more you may learn about \u003ca href=\"http://carnivalderesistance.com/the-vision/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eour vision\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://carnivalderesistance.com/past-manifestations/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eour past\u003c/a\u003e at the project website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe intend to improve on past efforts and go deeper with this Carnival project!

You choose any amount that works for you, even $1 dollar, to give on a monthly basis and Patreon will automatically draw this from your account. You can change your amount or cancel at anytime. For you, it\u0027s pretty simply. For us, it means a Carnival world! Every little bit matters, and any amount of generosity will build us up! We, in turn, will provide various \u003cstrong\u003eways for you to engage with our creative processes\u003c/strong\u003e and our thought experiments, to learn about our individual and collective efforts. We will share the fruit of our endeavors with you, and to whatever degree suits you, share the journey with you.

Patreon is an awesome way to pool community support, and we are excited to use this platform to support our Carnival community! Your support will help our Organizing Team that is working year round and will enable our international Carnival Crew to converge. These are courageous folks, familiar with financial strain, and the uncertainty of following vocational callings and living an alternative life. Your support will help us sustain each other (as a community) and live into the abundance of this project for the long haul.

Government and corporations don\u2019t value our ceremonial art and lifestyle experiments and learning spaces. They will not finance this project!
