    "summary": "It\u0027s a new era for me on the internet. I\u0027m going totally and completely independent on YouTube. I\u0027ve decided to opt out of the traditional ad and sponsor based way of earning income in order to focus more on what it is about creating videos that excites, inspires, and betters me as a person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is going to be the only way I make money through my videos, and I\u0027m so okay with that. The kind of support I want is from people who genuinely love what I do, and who want to enable me to continue that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so grateful that I have even 10 people who like what I make, and I want to be able to share that in whatever way speaks to me in the moment. Welcome to my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou probably have questions, here\u0027s some answers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. What happens if I don\u0027t pledge?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNothing. My videos on YouTube are and will forever be free unless they fundamentally change how it works. This is just an opportunity to directly help support me in creating art for y\u0027all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. How often does it charge me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSince I want to do so much, it\u0027s monthly! At the beginning of each month is when it will charge you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Can I cancel?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely forever and always. I do not want you financially pledging anything you will struggle to pay. This is completely optional. The absolute last thing I want is for people to feel obligated in any way to participate here, or to go beyond their means for me. Pledge what you can, and what you enthusiastically want to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any more questions, please always feel free to ask on social media. I\u0027m very easily reachable on twitter. Thank you for reading, for watching, for doing whatever it is you do in participating at all in my content. I appreciate you more than words can do justice, and feel like the luckiest person in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;3 Connor\u003cbr\u003e"
