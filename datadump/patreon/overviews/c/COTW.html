This art-style has been developed over many years in conjunction with the narrative and will be the perfect vessle to transport the message of the film.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/152968606@N07/33551563155/in/datetaken/\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"500\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2867/33551563155_fb5e01d6bf.jpg\" width=\"309\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is it about?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nThe setting is a dystopic, soviet-like, retrofuturistic world. In the middle of it we find our protagonist, a highly sensitive and emphatic cybernetic hermaphrodite who struggles greatly with her confidence, due to her deep understanding of emotions and desire, which stands in strong contrast to her environmental perception, shaped by a phenomenon, called \"hypernormalisation\". A state describing a severe sociological lethargy. This dissonance forces her to alter her inner workings. At first with a low degree of success, leading to more self-destruction, later with the help of an android mechanic, finally gaining the long-lost confidence by examining her suppressed past.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goal is to create an extremely strong visual, symbolic and auditive story with the focus on the dystopic atmosphere and character\u0027s catharsis. The short-film is planned to be without dialogue, dedicated to show the character\u0027s emotions trough optical und musical storytelling alone. I hope to create a statement, that challenges psycho-social and philosophical issues on a solely audio-visual level.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/152968606@N07/33551562905/in/datetaken/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2819/33551562905_556340db26.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the plan?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently, I am a one man team.

This is a very technical and timeconsuming process and will take up several months to half a year.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAfterwards I will assemle the fist scenes and put my focus on the muscial and auditive layer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe goal then is to create a series of pitch videos/teasers to prototype the workflow and give a vertical slice of the audio-visual quality, meanwhile, create a fan base and attract more investors.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe more investors/patreons I can convince, the more time I can spend on working and marketing this film.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce a significant amount of funding is secured I will hire additional artists to increase the production-speed and eventually finish this film. The projected length will be appx. 7 minutes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom there on I will apply at short film festivals and push the recognition value.
