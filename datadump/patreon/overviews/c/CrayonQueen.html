Ever since then, I\u0027ve practically dedicated my free time to thinking up stories and characters, to put them to paper. But drawing, coloring, and writing stories take up a lot of work, work that\u0027s very difficult to do while working full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you were to pledge to me, I\u0027d be able to pay my bills easier, and require less time at work, to stay home and continue doing what I love, providing comics and content to all of you! I would absolutely appreciate any help I receive from everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only that, pledgers can also receive personal art from me, sneak peeks of raw unedited pages, and get all sorts of cool benefits!!

Lately, all live-streams fill up very quickly, and the maximum number of 50 is reached quite fast. This way, you get exclusive access to a live-stream, without having to worry about not getting in! Also, the time and date of the Live-streams will be picked in ADVANCE to try and give everyone who wants to come, come! This livestream will also come with requests, so it\u0027ll all be about what you want to see! (A total of six requests, because they\u0027ll all be fully colored)",

Instead of working on my own art, in these bi-monthly live-streams, I will also take requests, a total of ten per live-stream. ALSO, free wallpapers will be doubled, so instead of one wallpaper per month, there will be TWO free wallpapers per month!",

This would actually make it possible for my comics to have 3 UPDATES PER WEEK! Primarily Gloomverse, of course! The updates would be Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, but you would get all the pages a day early, as usual.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of right now, I have to juggle Patreon between conventions, to be able to afford food and rent. I would still do conventions around the country, but I wouldn\u0027t have to stress so much focus to make profitable merchandise for Conventions, and I could put more time and effort towards my comics, like I truly want to do!",

     "description": "OK OK- if we hit the 2k MILESTONE, I will do TWO THINGS! One, GUARANTEED, and SCHEDULED, Livestreams, every single week, just for my ten dollar and up awesome Patreon peeps! That\u0027s right, more likely then not they\u0027ll juggle between my morningtime and my eveningtime, to try and make room for EVERYONE, regardless of timezones! AND, with more GUARANTEED livestreams, we can actually get requests back on track! Wouldn\u0027t that be nifty?? Ya know, especially since that is technically a tier reward? (Man I\u0027m so sorry)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSECOND THING for you great people-- VLOGS! That\u0027s right, I\u0027ll start doing more Vlogs to update you on current plans, future plans, ALL plans! Only available for the ten dollar and up bros! Warning: These videos will be silly and dumb, you are warned. The VLOGs wont be scheduled, but they\u0027d randomly take place instead of text updates. YUP YUP!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd- my personal one, is this. I will quit my job, and do my art full time. I\u0027ve cut hours, but to be able to focus exclusively on comics is my dreams come true. Not ONLY that, but it will make preparing my website easier, preparing comics for publication easier, and getting ready for conventions easier. I\u0027d love to travel to all sorts of cons and sell things but MOSTLY, to hang out and meet great people!!! And getting rid of my job entirely would take ALL that \"asking time off\" stress away, and give me chances to REALLY focus on the important stuff- and the important people-- all of YOU! Because I love you all, you\u0027re absolutely amazin!!",
