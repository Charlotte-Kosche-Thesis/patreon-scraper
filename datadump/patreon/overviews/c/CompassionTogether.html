At that time, I realized that creators on YouTube were massively influential and capable of doing huge incredible things if they set their minds to it. I determined that I wanted to be an active participant in organizing the allocation of resources to do good things for people in need. When we get to $50 a month, I would like to use this money to reach people in my own community and upload videos to the YouTube channel showing people what their money can do. Every penny of the $50 goal will go toward doing something tangible for someone real and in need - and you\u0027ll get to see it all happen.",
