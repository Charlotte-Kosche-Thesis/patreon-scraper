ALL of my client\u0027s requests \u0026amp; jobs keep my job ridiculously entertaining \u0026amp; challenging at the same time. I also teach art at an amazing private school to Kindergarten-6th graders which further challenges me \u0026amp; endlessly inspires me.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWith all of these amazing projects I\u0027m lucky enough to be a part of, I felt some of you may be interested in joining this \"Art Family\" I\u0027m creating here \u0026amp; be included in these creations \u0026amp; watch the process of (\u0026amp;/or even OWN) these pieces!

It can be a stressful position when you\u0027re unsure when or IF that next project will introduce itself, so the funds made from this page will help me focus on what I love to do while relieving a little of that pressure of financial stability. Being new to Patreon, I\u0027ll be making slight adjustments \u0026amp; additions here \u0026amp; there (with my Patrons\u0027 feedback \u0026amp; suggestions) \u0026amp; constantly working towards goals\u00a0that will not only benefit me, but more importantly, YOU, my Art Family.
