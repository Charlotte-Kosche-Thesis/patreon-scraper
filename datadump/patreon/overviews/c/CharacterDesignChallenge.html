Thank you so much for making your way to our Patreon page. We have some really big plans for the future and we are asking you to be a part of it all! But first, let\u0027s tell the artists who might not be familiar with our community yet, who we are! ^^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the Ch\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003earacter Design Challenge?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe Character Design Challenge (or CDChallenge) is an international community of 2D artists of all skill levels and styles who share common goals: grow as artists, learn from each other, promote their work online and having fun designing characters together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce a month the members gather\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/CharacterDesignChallenge\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon a Facebook Group\u003c/a\u003e to\u00a0challenge each other in a contest, in which they share their unique design of characters, based on a common theme, along with the links to promote their blogs and online stores. The finest designs\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://characterdesignreferences.com/winners-of-the-character-design-challenge/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewin the challenge\u003c/a\u003e and a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://characterdesignreferences.com/news/theme-of-the-month\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enew theme\u003c/a\u003e is announced on the 7th day of each month. \u003cbr\u003eThe CDChallenge is an initiative of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://characterdesignreferences.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCharacter Design References\u2122 (CDR)\u003c/a\u003e, an independent webzine dedicated to sequential, illustrative and concept art from animation, games and comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy the Character Design Challenge is using Patreon?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54fc8146e4b02a22841f4df7/t/57d559b559cc684a2331de0d/1473599939775/Website-Patreon-Cover5.png?format=1000w\"\u003eInterest and participation in the past two years has been incredible. Artists from all over the world have contributed with thousands of stunning artworks, creating one the most compelling collective art projects on the Internet. This response has been one of the most rewarding parts of running the Character Design Challenge, but unfortunately this high level of participation has also made it increasingly difficult to keep it going. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOrganising all the monthly challenges, managing thousands of entries, deleting\u00a0spam,\u00a0inviting the jurors, replying to hundreds of questions and moderating the community is a full time commitment which requires a great deal of time, money and energy. This level of organisation is hard to achieve and very difficult to maintain without any help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this Patreon page is to create a simple way for fans, individual artists, art schools and private companies to support this project. The main goal is to make the Character Design Challenge our first priority, so that we can fully commit to promote the work of all the incredible designers who have made this community great.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work exactly?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon works a bit like Kickstarter, but instead of asking you to invest a bunch of money on a product that still needs to be created, it makes you leave a small tip every month to support an already existing project and, by doing so, also access exclusive perks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make it even more simple, think of it as just chucking a few coins to a street musician, only you are doing it online. Patreon is way to join your favourite creator\u0027s community and help them for making the stuff you love. You can also watch this \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH-IDF809fQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003evideo\u003c/a\u003e to learn more about how Patreon works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get by supporting the CDChallenge on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54fc8146e4b02a22841f4df7/t/5a32b24424a694a9e0bd2842/1513271879446/Prizes+White.jpg?format=1000w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eQuite a LOT of good stuff!
