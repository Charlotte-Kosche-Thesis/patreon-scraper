I \nworked for The Associated Press for ten years, covering stories that ranged from the horrific \narrest and insanity trial of Jeffrey Dahmer to a quirky mermaid reunion \nshow in Weeki Wachi Springs.  I\u2019ve covered hurricanes and wildfires, \nriots, manatee deaths,  breakfast cereal, mayoral and gubernatorial \nelections, the ValuJet crash in the Florida Everglades, presidential \ncampaigns, automotive earnings reports, high-profile trials,\n the actions of suicide doctor Jack Kevorkian, the first deaf contestant\n in the National Spelling Bee and many, many other newsworthy events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter leaving the AP, I freelanced, wrote a book about teachers and then became a teacher myself. I currently teach fourth-, fifth- and sixth-grade students.  I began holding daily news meetings with\n my upper elementary class about four years ago, as a way to discuss \nimportant events going on in the world around us and help to them \nconnect with their own communities. I saw how discussing the news helped\n my students feel less isolated, more aware and more willing to engage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019d love for all elementary school students to have the opportunity \nto have these discussions in their classrooms.  But it\u2019s a tricky \nthing.  How do you talk to kids about events \nthat even adults sometimes can\u2019t understand?  How much information is \ntoo much? Should there be limits on what elementary school students are \ntold and can discuss? These are important questions for teachers to ask before they start \nhaving these conversations.  I\u2019d like to provide a forum for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI also recognize that, unlike most elementary school teachers, I came into my \nown class news meetings with a clear advantage: my journalism experience and\n first-hand understanding of how reporters do their jobs. And so, I\u2019d like to share that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTeachers can use \u003ca href=\"http://www.classnewsmeeting.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website and blog\u003c/a\u003e to learn about how newspapers work, the role of the press in our society, who reporters are and what they really do.\u00a0 I\u0027ll share resources for teaching elementary school students about journalism. And most importantly, I\u0027ll help teachers begin their own daily class news \nmeetings. Each day of the school year, I\u0027ll share what stories I plan to discuss as a starting point for ideas, and then update with how it went, what worked and what didn\u0027t. Teachers can share details of their own news \nmeetings, offer ideas, or ask questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m hoping we can become a community that grows together and supports\n each other as we have these important, but difficult, conversations \nwith our students, helping them understand and impact the world around \nthem.\u003cbr\u003e"
