They take a fair bit of time and investment to make; which is why I\u0027ve decided to take a step forward in this direction.\u00a0After releasing my first short, \u003cem\u003eHis Angels,\u003c/em\u003e I hadn\u0027t expected to see a passionate demand for more, as well as people offering to help me make more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince this is all done in my free time, a monetary income would greatly increase both the amount and the frequency of my films as I would be able to shift focus from earning money for expenses of living to working on these more full-time, as I would be able to shift my income to invest into the projects themselves. Ideally, I\u0027d like to get a hold of some sort of budget, so I would, at the very least, be able to buy a drink for the people who help me out in the making of these, such as voice artists and additional modelers who, up until now, helped me out of kindness.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, and yes, it \u003cem\u003edoes\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0make a difference!\u003cbr\u003e"
