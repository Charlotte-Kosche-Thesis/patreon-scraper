And it\u0027s becoming more and more difficult these days, with so many small presses closing their doors. Since we started in 2012, a lot of hardworking folks have supported our\nmission for little or no money. From proofreaders to submission readers, it\u2019s\ntime to pay them back. I want to look well into the future and ensure that Crystal Lake Publishing remains financially strong, while also releasing at least two great fiction anthologies and one non-fiction anthology every year. We want to be\nhere for generations to come, for our readers and authors. And in doing so, we eventually want to pay our\nauthors a bonus on the number of books sold per month, as well as a monthly\npercentage bonus on their royalties. Another goal would be to continue our Writers on Writing series on our blog, paying authors professional rates.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eEvery bit helps, since this will give\nus the steady monthly income we need to expand our borders. We\u2019d rather not\nrisk our current operating funds on such ventures. Too many small presses have\nfallen off the map for similar reasons. It used to be that small presses could take a chance on a young author, but these days it\u0027s becoming more and more of a risk. I don\u0027t know about you, but I\u0027d like to continue looking for young talent, shaping and then publishing that talent. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, Crystal Lake Publishing\nwill be around for a very long time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks for your support,\u003cbr\u003eJoe Mynhardt\u003cbr\u003eFounder \u0026amp; CEO\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Crystal Lake Publishing have been a real pleasure to work with - professional, prompt, and with a true passion for the genre.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u2014\u003c/em\u003eT\u003cstrong\u003eim Lebbon, author of \u003cem\u003eThe Silence\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Rage War\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u2019s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nIn return for your monthly patronage, you\nwill receive amazing rewards and discounts from Crystal Lake Publishing.
