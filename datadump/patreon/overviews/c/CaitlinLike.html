I\u2019m a cartoonist based out of Portland, Oregon and I like to make comics with fancy dresses, egregious floral motifs, occasional horror, and even more occasional face-punching.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nMy primary project is my ongoing free-to-read webcomic\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://maidenmachine.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMaiden of the Machine\u003c/a\u003e, about a young woman named Elizabeth Watson who finds herself being the protagonist of a completely wrong kind of story. Too traditional to take part of her adventurer family lineage and too poor and obscure to be a true society lady, Elizabeth\u2019s fortunes change with the introduction of famed industrialist Mr. Victor Lovelace in her life. She is soon pulled into his world of industry and conspiracy- where violence is the norm, sky pirates roam the skies and a woman with wings made of brass and steel hunts in the night.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past few years I\u2019ve been working on a variety of projects as both a full time artist and as an assistant. Unfortunately, most of this work is under some kind of paywall. But that\u2019s where you come in! With your help I can create a lot more short comics and keep my long term projects on a steady pace without having to sacrifice sleep and sanity.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis patreon primarily serves as a tip jar towards Maiden of the Machine and as a host for other short comics I make! The short comics are available to all patrons levels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nSo how does this work?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nGo ahead and select your preferred pledge tier if you\u2019d like to support me! I\u2019ll continue taking freelance work but this page will really give me an opportunity to make the new short comics that I just haven\u2019t had the time to make in the past. Every little bit you give helps, so thank you so much. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLove y\u2019all, and thank you for your support! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
