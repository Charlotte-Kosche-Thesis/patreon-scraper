It is a play on my last name - \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCerrillo\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, my niche - \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003exeriscaping\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, and the word \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eescapades\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. At \u003cstrong\u003eCerriscapades\u003c/strong\u003e, you get to see me play around in my garden, while learning along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy main content is a series called \"\n\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s Plant\u003c/strong\u003e\". To put it simply, it is my gardening vlog, but it is much more than that. You get to see my garden, listen to me talk about what I plan to do with it, and see me do it. Sounds simple, right?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the most part, gardening is my hobby. Like any other hobby, it is a money sink. I am very passionate about this hobby though. At the very least it provides me an escape from the stress of my day job, but I\u0027ve also found it an excellent creative outlet because not only am I designing my garden, I\u0027m also making videos about it!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003e\nCreating an online show costs me some time and money. I have lots of plans for my show, but not enough resources to make it happen. This platform allows you to support me with a steady stream of revenue. What that means for me is that I get to worry less about my video production and focus on being creative.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBy pledging your support, you are investing part of your own time and money to helping my show grow and I will be eternally grateful for that.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhere does all the money go?\u003c/h4\u003e\nI fully intend to use it to cover operational expenses, while any extras will mainly go towards upgrades to my video production, and for those taking the Sponsor tier, towards the upkeep of the plants (fertilizer, insecticides, fungicides, etc).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat are my operational expenses you ask?\u003c/h4\u003e\nMy operational expenses are the recurring expenses that I pay out of pocket every month. This includes:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003emy internet connection\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003emy website -\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ecerriscapades.com\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003emy subscription to \u003cstrong\u003eEpidemicSound \u003c/strong\u003e(where I get my awesome music without worrying about copyright issues)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003emy subscription to \u003cstrong\u003eAdobe Creative Cloud \u003c/strong\u003e(I\u0027m currently on the basic photography plan, but I\u0027d like to go for the full suite at some point)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eand\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eTubeBuddy \u003c/strong\u003e(a tool I use to make my life on YouTube a lot easier).\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eCan I support Cerriscapades in some other way instead?\u003c/h4\u003e\nOf course you can! If you are not comfortable with the idea of a recurring donation, that\u0027s really fine. You can do a one-time donation via\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/chuckcerrillo\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epaypal.me/chuckcerrillo\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re not comfortable giving away money to strangers on the internet though, that\u0027s also fine. What you can do is to keep watching my videos, and maybe even tell your friends about it. You might get served an ad once in a while, but I do get a few cents from several views.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you have read this far, I thank you so much for taking your time to read the entire thing. Whatever you decide to do, pledge or not, I am still grateful that you make the Cerriscapades show a part of your day!"
