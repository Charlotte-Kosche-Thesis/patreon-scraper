    "summary": "Hi there. Cyndi here. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m here on Patreon to express my love of dogs and to fulfill my passion for \nsaving dogs lives by educating people and providing solutions to common issues.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI know I\u0027m not the typical \"creator\" on Patreon. I\u0027m not an artist but I do use \nmy creativity in a way to save dogs lives. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI write books, articles and blog posts about pet care/pet nutrition/pet \ncommunication and dog training. I want to create videos and do training courses.\u00a0Here\u0027s a \nsample of a few of my creations and pets I\u0027ve helped: (\u003ca href=\"http://cyndismasal.com/patreon/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://cyndismasal.com/patreon/\u003c/a\u003e). I appreciate that you made it to my patreon page. Just the fact that you\u0027re here tells me that you\u0027re a dog/cat/animal lover like me and you want to help more dogs/cats/animals (like me). Thank you!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy?\u003c/strong\u003e Supporting me on Patreon will allow me to do worthwhile stuff like helping \npeople who have dogs with cancer, liver disease, kidney disease or diabetes. Or \ntalk to pets with emotional issues that need help. Or work with dogs in shelters \nwho need training in order to get adopted. Or create balanced home-cooked diets that can help \ndogs heal. Or even help YOU with your dog. By not having to spend time doing the \nmarketing to \"sell\" my services or products, it frees me up to do more to help \nsave more dogs than I could do if I was charging fees. Plus I could help dogs \nwho have owners who can\u0027t afford to pay for my services. Or maybe you can\u0027t pay \nwhat you\u0027d like to pay, so being my patron will give back to me for what I\u0027ve \nhelped you with. Maybe I\u0027ve already helped you save your dogs\u0027 life. This is a \ngreat way to thank me and help me save more!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow?\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon is basically setup like a subscription. You choose \nthe level or amount you\u0027d like to give on a monthly basis. These levels are \ncalled \"rewards levels\" and they allow you to tailor your subscription. For each \nlevel, I reward you with specific things. But for some people it\u0027s not so much \nabout what you will get, but how much you are willing to give. Of course, the \nmore you give, the more I reward you with. I would like to inspire you to choose a level, even at $1, \nyou have access to my newsfeed here at Patreon where I post content in advance \nof formal publication. If you sign up via Patreon you\u0027ll be notified directly when I upload a video or post new \ntip/diet/content, which is pretty awesome!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat? \u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0027d like to go above and beyond to help me do things like \npublish my next book, interview the movers and shakers in the pet industry, invest in training materials and video software, help other doggie mamma\u0027s \nsave their sick dogs, and pay for my current and future pet nutritionist/care education.... picking any of the larger support levels will certainly help \nme do these things! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe it goes without saying that I would greatly appreciate your financial support. I\u0027ll say it anyways though. \n\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e I greatly appreciate it!!! The Patreon model has us place rewards here to entice you to donate, but if we\u0027re both honest... you\u0027re here because you understand what I\u0027m trying to do, and you think the time and talent I put into \nhelping people with their dogs through books, custom dog diets and instructional videos are worth it! You \"get it\". You\u0027re a fellow doggie mamma/daddy. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWarm Regards,\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCyndi Smasal\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eP.S.
