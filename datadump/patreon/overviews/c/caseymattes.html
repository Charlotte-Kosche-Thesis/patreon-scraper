It can also allow us to think outside of the box and take larger chances with our art!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is very similar to other pledge platforms like Kickstarter, however, instead of pledging money for a single project, you would pledge a smaller amount that would act as a reoccurring tip that I would receive for every upload of content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone who pledges will be rewarded with exclusive access to different levels of cool stuff which I encourage you to check out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to pledge as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Please don\u0027t give if you are low on money, I know what that feels like and I don\u0027t want anyone to feel like they HAVE to donate anything. I will continue to create content no matter how much I see from this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Your Money Goes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI try my best to create 4 videos a month and production can be EXPENSIVE. The money generated from this page will go back into making better and better music videos. And with your support, I will be able to focus more on what really matters, the music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: I will be posting 2-4 music videos a month so only pledge an amount that you feel comfortable donating per music video. You can cancel or change your pledge at ANY TIME! There is also an easy way to set a monthly maximum for yourself when entering your payment info.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 160px;\"\u003eLet\u0027s go somewhere, together!\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0Thank you so much!
