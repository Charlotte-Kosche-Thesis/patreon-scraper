     "description": "A feature length YouTube video... yep. A YouTube Wheresmychallenge Movie. Okay. I highly doubt we will get this far. But if we do we will make an hour+ WheresMyChallenge Movie. We can make something extremely fun and totally free on YouTube. Obviously as you helped us get this far. You\u0027ll be able to watch this movie a whole month before anyone else. Also everyone on Patreon can discuss with us.. show us their creative ideas.. and help make this something you\u0027d love to see. It could be an hour of us doing one big challenge.. or it could be a mash up lots of mini challenges with a theme. Or literally just challenge/stunt after challenge/stunt. Totally up to you. We can discuss this on Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis wouldnt be something chucked together in a couple of weeks. This would be something we would work hard making perfect. Maybe it\u0027ll take a few months. But I\u0027m sure we would keep you entertained. We know this is a high goal. But realistically. A movie usually costs 100x this. So we would try our best to make this as high quality as possible. With the funds we would have at our disposal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",

The last Q and A we made it as fun as possible by having fun locations and some Easter Eggs.. ever notice the man in the background dancing or the bag of dog poo in the background?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell this time we will use the $100 budget to use new locations \u0026amp; plan some fun stuff to be added to the video.
