Sing it! Nothing that can be remembered with love, can ever be lost!\"\u003cbr\u003e~ Dr. Clarissa Pinkola Est\u00e9s\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e40 000 Dreams Project is a project which was seeded by the above quote from Dr. Clarissa Pinkola Est\u00e9s. For now Dreams is in the collecting phase. The goal is to collect 40 000 dreams from women all over the world. The idea is to have a digital tapestry on the blog. There will be a rolling page in which the latest dream shared will be posted. Stage two will be to share this work with the world. Stage three will be to find a sacred home in the world, in which to house the physical representation of 40 000 women\u0027s dreams. Perhaps as a stupa.\u003cbr\u003eInterpret dream as loosely as you want. A literal dream or your metaphoric dream. As wide reaching as you want to go, or as small as you want to keep it. There are no rules. If you are male and have come across this please share with the women in your life. 40 000 dreams is to be a fair representation of the global population of women, therefore no one country or culture will have a greater share of the dreamspace than another.\u003cbr\u003eFor now I will be collecting dreams though email only although I will have a P.O. box in a year or so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to hearing from you.\u003cbr\u003eSubmission Guidelines:\u003cbr\u003ePlease try and keep your dream to about a page.\u003cbr\u003eHand written and scanned is perfectly acceptable.\u003cbr\u003eDrawn is acceptable as well.\u003cbr\u003eYou must be a woman to submit a dream for this project.\u003cbr\u003eemail submission to: humanitymanual@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
