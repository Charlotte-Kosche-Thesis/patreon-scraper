Very often staying up until 4am working and waking up at 7am for her day job. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing that is worth knowing about the effect that this kind of work has on Callie, is that having already gone through the emotional turmoil of witnessing all of the treatment alongside her own child, every time another email arrives containing another plea for help from a frightened relative, Callie must relive everything all over again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith every person that Callie assists, she is breaking the law and faces up to 14 years in prison. Callie is risking her liberty with each new case but Callie will tell you herself that \u0027When a law is unjust, we have a moral obligation to break it\u0027\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eCallie won\u0027t stop helping those who come to her, regardless of the risk she faces.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon account has been set up to allow Callie to take a sabbatical from her day job, in order to get on top of all of the time sensitive requests for help and advice; In a view to eventually leave her day job and work solely on her life\u0027s work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you believe in the work Callie does and you wish to see her continue, please consider supporting her with as little as \u00a31 a month. Every single penny will help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully, Callie will raise enough support to fund a replacement car as she often spends a great deal of time travelling to meet families affected by prohibition, as well as to meet scientists in the field of Cannabis research.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCallie would never ask this herself, but please give generously and share this page with your friends and loved ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCallie on loose women in October 2017\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YndfjZtkndI\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YndfjZtkndI/hqdefault.jpg\" style=\"width: 473px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\ufffc\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore recently, Callie was outside Parliament where she answered MP Paul Flynn\u0027s invitation to break the law. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEr9KcztVCA\u0026amp;t=28s\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RJ0bwDe8o2M/hqdefault.jpg\" style=\"width: 473px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\ufffc\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/28259722_1520546436.7731_funddescription.png\" style=\"width: 473px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\ufffc\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/28259722_1520546450.8091_funddescription.png\" style=\"width: 473px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\ufffc\u003cbr\u003eAnd after attending Parliament, that\u0027s exactly what happened to Callie, her husband and Jeff Ditchfield, the man who helped them save Deryn\u0027s life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/28259722_1520548494.3476_funddescription.png\" style=\"width: 473px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\ufffc\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCallie: \u003cbr\u003e\u0027Many people tell me that I should slow down and take some time for myself.
