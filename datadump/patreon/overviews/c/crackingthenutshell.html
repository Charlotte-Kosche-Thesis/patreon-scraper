    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Cracking the Nutshell and who is behind it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHi there!\u00a0My name is Dolors, and I am the person behind Cracking the Nutshell, a channel where physics meets metaphysics, where philosophy meets spirituality and where personal experience is seen as the most\u00a0valuable learning tool; the root of\u00a0all knowledge and personal growth. Subjective experience, philosophy and science all have a place in my channel. Humour is a great part of my life too, so I also like to create videos that show that side of me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is the nature of reality? What is time? What is matter? What is information? What is consciousness? What is the self? Is there purpose to life? Does free will exist? These are the type questions that I love to ponder in my videos... I always\u00a0do my best\u00a0to answer these questions from a personal, honest, non-dogmatic, unprejudiced perspective! My attempt at finding answers is not what\u2019s important, but I would say that the success of any of my videos lies in their power to sow the seeds of healthy scepticism and open-mindedness, their power to\u00a0generate even more questions in your mind, questions that may prompt you to take some action, to create some well needed changes in your life! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eControversy is not an issue. Taboo is not an issue either. Subjects such as extra-sensory perception, mind-matter interaction or the power of psychedelics are topics that I find fascinating, and I love to cover them in my channel too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo who is Dolors? If I had to define myself in \u201csquare\u201d vocabulary, I would probably tell you that I am a maths \u0026amp; physics student, a single mum, an (of course!) responsible citizen of the world and\u2026 also a bit of a rebellious woman who does not really like to label or define herself in any kind of \u201csquare\u201d terms :-P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know... I guess I am just a keen reality explorer with a thirst for knowledge and great curiosity, both of which have\u00a0sent me on a journey so exciting that I can\u2019t help but share it with the world! Above all, I\u2019d like to inspire you, to touch you - I just want to humbly share my knowledge, personal thoughts and insights. I always attempt to blend my creative, artistic, intuitive side with my left-brained, logical, mathematical side\u2026 I hope that my videos succeed in finding a balance between the two! The beauty of it all is that - by sharing my personal journey through my videos - I can hopefully help others \u2013 help you! \u2013 find\u00a0your own blissful path.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can I help Cracking the Nutshell?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCracking the Nutshell was born in February 2013, after the release of the \u201cWhat is Time?\u201d video. A few ideas and heartfelt thoughts became a script, the script became a video, and the video ended up being viewed and shared by many many people! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few more videos and some time later, I realise that Cracking the Nutshell cannot survive without some well needed help. Countless hours are spent on the writing of the scripts, the recording of the audio, the editing of the visual content (some of which, such as the animated videos, can take me months to create!). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy what I do, if you want this channel to stay alive, then I would kindly ask you to consider contributing to Cracking the Nutshell as a patron. Even if you can only contribute a dollar per video, your contribution will help! Tremendously! Remember - if I can keep the channel alive - my videos will continue to be FREE to view by everybody!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you think I deserve to be rewarded for my work and it is within your financial capabilities to help me out, then it is your choice, and your choice alone whether you want to become a patron for my channel. Even if you decide not to, I sincerely thank you for taking the time to read and consider this message. I am immensely grateful for having you as a subscriber and for any support you can offer, financial or otherwise. From the bottom of my heart, thank you ever so much!\u003cbr\u003e"
