    "summary": "We are Ashley and Justine and we make The Cutaways Podcast!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are best friends and film editors living in LA. We wanted an excuse to hang out more and watch fun movies that are both aimed at women and get a bad reputation for doing so. It\u0027s also important to us to have women\u0027s voices be a part of the greater conversation about films. So we got over our fears and insecurities and started this podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe decided to watch nearly every Romantic Comedy on Netflix streaming, but we also got requests to add more essential-to-the-genre movies, so our list keeps growing and growing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been making this podcast for over a year and haven\u0027t missed delivering a podcast every week!\u00a0We are having fun exploring the history of Romantic Comedies often with music, guests, and games!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u0027re here you might know us but you might not know what Patreon is.\u00a0Patreon is a platform for artists to get funding from their fans or \u2018patrons\u2019, on a recurring basis. If you want to pay for content we make, that\u0027s cool, if you don\u0027t, that\u0027s cool too. \u00a0We\u0027re not forcing anyone to pay and there still will be a podcast every week for everyone. \u00a0If you choose to donate, Patreon works as a monthly donation and you will be charged at the end of each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat are our plans for any financial assistance you may provide?\u003cbr\u003eAlready, there\u0027s a lot of steps to making this podcast magically appear on the internets every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe watch movies and record for a few hours\u00a0on weekends. Even though we are professional editors, it still takes time trimming down the episode to make it sound the best. We also make sure that interact with our fans and friends on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Not to mention hosting fees. It does add up and of course we do it because we LOVE IT.\u003cbr\u003eBUT with your support we can get better. Nearly all of our equipment is borrowed, and it\u0027s just the minimum that we need. Someday we\u0027d like a mixer and more microphones for more guests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut hey, we joined Patreon so we can\u00a0also give you special goodies!! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out our rewards section!! There\u0027s even a reward that lets YOU tell US what movie to watch. And we will, because a promise is a promise. Because you had us at hello. Because we like you just as you are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support and thanks for joining the slumber party!!!\u003cbr\u003e"
