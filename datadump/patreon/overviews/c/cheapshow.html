One episode could be a regular studio episode, the next could be a \"on location\" report or even a scripted comedy play! It all depends on how we feel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we are planning to do with Patreon is, hopefully, generate enough money to help pay for the basics to carry on making the show... paying for the website, podcast hosting, maybe update our equipment and splashing out on features for the show itself... but we would really like to ask for your help to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d also love to take the show on tour and grow the live, interactive elements of the show and bring ourselves closer to the audiences we have around the UK and even around the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you think you can help, whether its a small donation or a big fat wobbly one, we would greatly appreciate it. In return, we will deliver to you exclusive content, special access to the creators and also bring a few of you into the creative process itself! You can check out our rewards and goals for more details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe adore doing this show and we hope that the infectious fun, in turn, delights our listeners in the same way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe recently got a massive endorsement from The Guardian in the UK \u003cbr\u003e\"...Howl With Laughter\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/hear-here\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGuardian Recommendation\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheapShow - the comedy podcast with modest ambitions to simply take over the world!"
