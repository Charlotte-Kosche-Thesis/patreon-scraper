I\u2019m an illustrator/cartoonist who started out as teenage comic geek, went through art school in NYC and started my career with an absolute dream job working at Marvel Comics for John Romita in the \u0027Marvel Bullpen\u0027. That lead to a substantial freelance career through the infamous \u201c90\u2019s era\u201d of comics, not only for Marvel, but DC Comics, Image, Valiant, Dark Horse, IDW and Dynamite Entertainment, amongst others. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nOne thing I never got the chance to do was publish my own work, whether it be something fictional with my own characters, a collection of original art, or even a \u201chow-to\u201d. Patreon would be an amazing place to start that adventure, with your help and, as everyone that knows me can attest, I\u2019d try my absolute best to make it worth your while and return the favor in spades! Thanks so much for your graciousness, your respect and, most importantly, your humanity!   \u003cbr\u003e"
