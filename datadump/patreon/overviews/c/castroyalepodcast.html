We are Rob \u0026amp; Joe (Left \u0026amp; Right), two brothers that deliver a podcast to listeners about the hit mobile game, Clash Royale. We currently run the show out of our own homes and have to cover the operating and server costs from our own pockets. This isn\u0027t our job, it\u0027s just a fun side project we started to give players of the game a fun place to learn and play together. Help us cover our costs so we can continue to deliver the show to our listeners. Any excess funds will go towards making improvements to the show and helping fund future projects for the Cast Royale Podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e(At this time, we currently cannot offer shipping outside of the US.

He also spent 3 years working at the Apple Store where he developed his passion for technology. In 2015, Rob and his friend wrote and recorded a song on iTunes and he continues to dabble in original music for both personal fun and Cast Royale; In fact, he created the Theme Song you hear at the beginning of every episode! Today, Rob is a Client Service Analyst for an IT Health company. He graduated from The College of New Jersey with a B.S. in Business with a focus in Marketing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAside from being the guy that started the \u2018boom\u2019 movement, Joe is an accountant at a firm that is based in New York City. Although a native to the Garden State, Joe recently moved to North Carolina with his wife and his dog. He graduated from Monmouth University in 2012 with his B.S. in Accounting. Throughout grammar school and high school, he was an active athlete participating in Cross-Country, Track and Field, and Baseball. Despite his athleticism (and great looks), Joe has always been a gamer at heart. When he is not Clashing\u2026 Oh who are we kidding, Joe is always Clashing! Boom!!\u003cbr\u003e"
