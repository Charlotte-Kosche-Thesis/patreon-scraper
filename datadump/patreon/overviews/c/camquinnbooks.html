    "summary": "Hello everyone! I\u0027m the author of the urban fantasy serial, The Starsboro Chronicles. I decided to write this story in shorter pieces so they could be consumed in a single sitting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter I had my first child my love of reading was forced to the end of my to do list. I would start a book, have to put it down and wouldn\u0027t know when I could pick it back up again. As a result I turned to TV shows to get my daily story fix and thought it would be nice if there were books, not just short stories that I could ready in a one to two hour period. Thus, The Starsboro Chronicles were born.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI do plan to jump into full length works with a post apocalyptic zombie series, The Apocalypse Diaries, and a contemporary romance series, A Second Chance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for my personal life, I got married at 19 to my high school sweetheart and moved to North Carolina while he was in the Marine Corps. We moved back up to New England three years later with a toddler and a new born. Now, we are expecting our first baby girl, due in March 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI stay home with the kids, the oldest is six and attends school, I also help other authors on their way to publishing as a member of the Amphibian Press team.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs a home maker, in today\u0027s economy, it\u0027s difficult to make ends meet, let alone pay for covers and professional editing. If you become one of my Patrons, even just at $1 a month, you will be helping me full fill my dreams and share stories with the world. How to Catch a Serial Killer is currently on hold due to lack of funds to pay for proper editing. I would love to see it published and be able to have a proper edit done on the first Second Chance novella, An Accidental Reunion, when it\u0027s complete early next year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this! I look forward to getting to know you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are the links where you can see what I do as an author and in the publishing industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.amphibianpressbooks.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAmphibianPressBooks.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.cameronquinnbooks.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCameronQuinnBooks.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.amphibianauthors.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAmphibianAuthors.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
