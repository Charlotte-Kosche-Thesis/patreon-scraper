I am a writer, model, and cosplayer. Over the past few years, I have had the opportunity to do photo shoots with many different, talented photographers. While I do enjoy traditional types of modeling, cosplay has allowed me to combine costume design, sewing skills, modeling prowess, and creativity in order to portray badass pop-culture characters. My love for cosplay began when I was asked to participate in a themed photo shoot doing a modern take on the Scooby-Doo gang. As Daphne Blake, I got to spend the day in a minidress and heels fighting off zombies. I was hooked. Since then, I have continued to build up my cosplay portfolio, thanks to my friend and photographer \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JeffZoetVisuals/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJeff Zoet Visuals\u003c/a\u003e, who is constantly creating amazing composited images and bringing these costumes to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"425\" src=\"https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7328/28140114175_68d60c25f7_o.jpg\" width=\"340\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"425\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7403/28036262912_46c6799578_o.jpg\" width=\"340\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"510\" src=\"https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7364/28036262932_dd1fc0734d_o.jpg\" width=\"340\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"510\" src=\"https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7373/27524654063_1fd5878a7d_o.jpg\" width=\"340\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started posting a lot of my cosplay photos online, and have built up a great following of people who really seem to enjoy what I\u0027ve been sharing. (I\u0027m currently up to almost 20K likes on my \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ClaireAnastasiaModeling/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e page, and have over 25K followers on \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/claireana/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e.) While people seem to enjoy all of my posts, the most popular are always my cosplay projects. Fortunately, cosplay is something that I\u0027d love to do more of, and I\u0027m hoping that this site can take me to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"510\" src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7425/28140114065_eac5888548_o.jpg\" width=\"340\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"510\" src=\"https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7519/28140114135_e7a7baa84d_o.jpg\" width=\"340\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy amazing fans have been so supportive when I release a new cosplay shoot, and have constantly been asking for more. I would love to be able to portray all of the characters that people have been asking to see, but as anyone who is involved in cosplay knows... it is expensive! So in an effort to try and do more cosplay shoots, and portray more characters, I decided to launch this Patreon page to see if my fans can help raise some of the funds to make future cosplays a reality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"453\" src=\"https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7739/28105481886_a1426120d2_o.jpg\" width=\"680\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is not like a Kickstarter campaign, where I am asking for funds to create one massive project. This is more of a monthly request for potential patrons to chip in and help me make better costumes, more often. It will also pay for photo shoot expenses to ensure the best possible final artwork. Plus, all of my cosplay photo shoots will be with \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JeffZoetVisuals/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJeff Zoet Visuals\u003c/a\u003e, so you know they\u0027ll be awesome!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"510\" src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7443/27524654153_b43342df34_o.jpg\" width=\"340\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"510\" src=\"https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7372/28105481926_8cca22107d_o.jpg\" width=\"340\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd just to clarify - my cosplay photos will continue to be free for all to view, but if you decide to be a patron, you will get the first look at them, behind-the-scenes photos, Snapchats, live feeds from shoots... even the chance to directly collaborate with me to pick out a cosplay of your choosing! Go check out the rewards to see all of the different ways that I\u0027ve come up with to say THANK YOU for helping me take my cosplaying to the next level. And make sure to let me know of other rewards that you\u0027d like to see added!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking a moment to visit my Patreon page. I look forward to sharing new images soon! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay nerdy, my friends.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eClaire Ana\u003cbr\u003e"
