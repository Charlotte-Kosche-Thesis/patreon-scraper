    "summary": "Hi!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my Patreon page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy name is\u00a0Joey Chang aka\u00a0CelloJoe. I play the cello, beatbox, sing, rap, throat sing, do live looping, and go on long distance bicycle music tours with a cello.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOK...straight talk, from the heart.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve put off starting this page for years because I\u0027ve been afraid that no one would support me. I\u0027ve had it on my to do list for \u003cem\u003eliterally\u003c/em\u003e years. Well, it\u0027s better late than never. No one is going to support me if I don\u0027t launch this Patreon campaign in the first place! I don\u0027t know what I\u0027ve been waiting for really. Like most things in life, this Patreon page is a work in progress. Changing, evolving, and growing. It\u0027s an experiment for me to see who my true die hard fans are. I\u0027m looking for 1,000 of you, but I\u0027m going to be thrilled when I find one. Is it you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be bold on the internet like I am on stage and when I perform. I\u0027ve played on the street for many years and it takes a certain amount of guts and chutzpah to go out in public and start playing music with a hat out. I\u0027ve been intimidated by performing on the internet for some reason. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always give advice to people starting out to just go out on the street and start playing music for people. If people don\u0027t want to stop and listen, they won\u0027t. They\u0027ll just keep moving. So, it doesn\u0027t matter if you suck. At least you\u0027re trying and practicing and getting better. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, the street stage teaches you about performance and stage confidence. Over the thousands of hours that I\u0027ve played music on the street, I can remember only a handful of times when someone said, \"You suck!\" or \"Shut up!\" or something mean like that. Thousands of hours over years and all over the world. From the streets of\u00a0San Francisco to Bangkok, Berlin to Toulouse, Guadalajara to Melbourne.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am going to take my own advice and pretend the internet is my street stage. I\u0027ll just play here and if you like it, chuck a tip in the bucket. If you don\u0027t, feel free to keep on clicking.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this day and information age, it seems clear that attention is the new currency. So thank you for your payment if you\u0027ve read this far. I\u0027m hoping this Patreon page will inspire me to create more for you and for the world. All my music is name your price or free on bandcamp\u00a0and streaming services.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I\u0027m making a living by teaching music lessons in piano, guitar, cello, and music production. I supplement that with live performances at corporate events, weddings, recording projects, music festivals, and private events and parties.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love performing and recording and producing and though I do enjoy teaching, I would like to create more original music, more cover songs, more music videos, and more educational videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support on Patreon will help me make it happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
