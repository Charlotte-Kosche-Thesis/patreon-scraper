    "summary": "Hello there, my name is Courtney for those who don\u0027t know me. Welcome to my Patreon page, and thanks for stopping by! A little bit about me...I love to create and be able to make things with my own two hands. My main focus for the past several years has been makeup transformations \u0027from the chest up\u0027, but I\u0027ve really found a love for cosplay over the last year or so. I\u2019ve always loved creating characters, but actually getting to put a full character together from head to toe - with costume, props, wig, contacts, makeup, everything\u2026there\u2019s something so special about it, and even more so when \u003cem\u003eYOU\u003c/em\u003e are putting in the work and fitting all these pieces together. I\u2019ve never quite felt like I fit into the \u0027beauty\u0027 world, which as I\u0027m thinking more about it now as I type this, has contributed some to my inconsistency and feeling unmotivated and uninspired. Cosplay has opened up a whole new world and community for me, and it feels a lot more like home. I feel like a new spark has been lit inside me, and I\u2019m excited!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve been putting tutorials on YouTube for over five years now, and I\u0027m still pushing and dreaming of being able to live off of doing what I love - not necessarily on YouTube. One of the things about YouTube (and other social media and business as well), is that consistency is key - which is something I\u0027ve always struggled with. I do typically go through slow periods and ruts during the holiday season after Halloween, but a lot of the time I\u2019m working on Some kind of project. I knit and crochet as well, and am currently trying to juggle a new shop along with YouTube and cosplay! I\u0027ve decided to wait on creating reward tiers for now, and as my Patreon grows those can be thought out again. You can also change your pledge level from month to month if needed or desired. Any amount is so meaningful, but please don\u2019t feel obligated to pledge anything if you aren\u2019t able - I 100% understand, and I thank you for your support in any way! You\u2019ll still see all my usual content around my other social media pages :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nInstagram: \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/courtneylittlemua/\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/courtneylittlemua/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFacebook: \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CourtneyLittleMUA/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/CourtneyLittleMUA/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYouTube: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CourtneyLittleMakeup\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/CourtneyLittleMakeup\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you again for stopping by and for always being so supportive of me, it means the world and I appreciate it and you all so much.
