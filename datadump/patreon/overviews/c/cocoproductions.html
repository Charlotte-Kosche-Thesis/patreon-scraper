I started publishing my work professionally for the first time almost forty years ago, first in printing, for instance in the magazines of Harmony Communications. And about ten years ago, due to the demise of the printed media, we started a website: Coco Bondage Art Productions (CBAP for short).\u003cbr\u003ehttp://www.cocoproductions.com/home/ \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/2e1vzvn.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy joining Patreon I\u0027m hoping to gain a larger audience for my work, and, hopefully, offer as much people as possible some fun and excitement that way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA few words about my work\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAlthough I have also done some mainstream erotic work, Bondage is the central theme of 95 percent of my output, in a variety of forms. There\u0027s fetish work, rope bondage, metal bondage, stocks, confinement and more. Over the years however, I have also developed interest in a few niches. \u00a0One of those is BBB, female Body Builders in Bondage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/n4ecti.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother one (although today it seems to have become less of a niche) is mature and elderly ladies tied up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i65.tinypic.com/25h245z.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd one of the latest new roads I decided to try ( haven\u0027t done much of it yet, but there is one E-book out there) is \u00a0little women (\u003cem\u003e\u00a0women,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0not girls!) in bondage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i67.tinypic.com/i5awrm.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have worked in pencil, black and white with markers and rothring pens, with the airbrush and, for the last fifteen years or so, in Photoshop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLike I have already mentioned: I hope to get my work out to as many people as possible. And in this day and age, that means having a site, I\u0027m also on Deviant Art and Patreon could play a massive role in achieving that goal.\u003cbr\u003eBut of course I also hope to gain some financial support, as a sixty year old without a pension. Not that I am planning on retiring any time soon: I hope to keep drawing and publishing until my last breath, don\u0027t get me wrong! But this extra funding would give me a bit more security in life, and a bit more room perhaps to take on some bigger projects once more, like the publishing of a new real book, or (as we at CBAP have been dreaming about for a long time), some sort of traveling exposition of my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
