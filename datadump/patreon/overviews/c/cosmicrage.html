My current project is a series called Cosmic Rage, which combines 2D and 3D animation. With your support, I can work and promote Cosmic Rage more. The first episode is close to being completed and was funded from freelance work and an art grant from the South Dakota Arts Council. The downside of that method is that my freelance work and tracking down new projects takes me away from working on Cosmic Rage.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEpisode one has currently finished production, will you join me in the creation of the second episode and to tell my story?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
