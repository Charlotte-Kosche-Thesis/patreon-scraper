I have been making videos since 2009/2010, and there are some wonderful people who have followed my channel for that entire time! My content is primarily craft-related, including scrapbooking and creative journal processes, flip-throughs and planning videos. Additionally I upload weekly vlogs, and these have been a fab chance for my subscribers to get to know me better (who doesn\u0027t enjoy having a nosey at someone else\u0027s life!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always been a papercrafter, for as long as I can remember. I still have scrapbooks from my childhood, bursting with memorabilia, scribbles and things that little kids like to collect. I\u0027m definitely still the same, though nowadays I scrapbook primarily in the form of Project Life, and my creative journaling happens in a traveler\u0027s notebook. It\u0027s no secret that I love getting stuck into a crafty project; I currently work mornings in a school, and whenever something artistic needs doing, they pass it my way!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1216.photobucket.com/albums/dd361/chloeemurray/IMG_0534_zpsfkq4z0sh.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love being a part of the crafty community on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, and I am in awe of my friends who have made this \u0027hobby\u0027 into their livelihood. Unfortunately chronic illness has left me unable to work full-time, so it was always a dream of mine to follow in their footsteps and make a living doing something that I love. This has become harder and harder in recent years, and so some of my wonderful friends have given me a gentle push towards Patreon. I will, of course, continue creating and sharing on YouTube as well. Patreon will simply be an opportunity for people to support my channel and receive extra in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is to offer you content that will be inspiring and helpful, something to really encourage you to indulge in your own crafty interests! There will be exclusive photos, process videos and tutorials, along with chatty videos updating you on current projects.
