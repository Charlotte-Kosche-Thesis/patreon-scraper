    "summary": "Community Mediation is a nonprofit community group that offers free mediation services and conflict management training, and promotes the use of non-violent approaches to conflict, throughout the city of Baltimore, MD.\u00a0 From our home of more than twenty years in the heart of the Waverly neighborhood, our mediation services help to bring communities together by supporting them in making conversations more inclusive and conflicts more productive - helping everyone to make plans that respect what is most important to them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMediators can help with a wide variety of conflicts and difficult conversations.

From the beginning of July 2015 through the end of June 2016, we held 572 mediation sessions, involving 530 people - an average of 47 sessions with 44 participants each month. Making this happens involves the work of many dedicated volunteers, AmeriCorps members, and staff who provide information on mediation to their communities, reach out to people in conflict, coordinate cases, and mediate cases. It also requires a network of partnerships with community partners who let us use their spaces to conduct mediations and help us to spread the word about non-violent conflict resolution. Your contribution helps us purchase materials for use in mediations, pay our staff, provide AmeriCorps stipends, and reward our volunteers with learning opportunities and the occasional potluck to relax.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo learn more about us and our work, watch this space, check us out on Facebook or Twitter, or visit our website: \u003ca href=\"http://www.communitymediation.org.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.communitymediation.org.\u003c/a\u003e You can also give us a call at 410-467-9165. If you\u0027re in Waverly, you can stop by our office at 3333 Greenmount - we\u0027re the green awning in the building with the murals right above 33rd. We\u0027d love to talk with you!\u003cbr\u003e"
