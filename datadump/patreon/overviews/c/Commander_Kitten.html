I\u0027m Commander Kitten, Community Manager of EpikTek community, youtuber, and just overall helpful person when I can be. And this is my Patreon hehe. I try to do youtube as best I can while managing the EpikTek community which is headed by Epiktetus and has amazing Youtubers and their fans. And it\u0027s my home away from home hehe. And so, I look to Patreon to help support where Youtube can\u0027t quite cut it for daily expenses and so forth. So here\u0027s hoping for a better tomorrow, through Patreon. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
