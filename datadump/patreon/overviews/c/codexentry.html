Well, in addition to allowing me to buy the things I need to not die, the extra money will also allow me to cover the basic costs of the show thus far (Games, books, editing software, etc.). In addition, it will allow me to buy the equipment like cameras and lighting that I need to achieve my vision of what I want the channel to ultimately look like. Most of all, if we can reach my final goal, it will allow me to turn off those god awful YouTube ads and you\u0027ll never have to see an actor pretending to be a Twitch streamer to sell you a mediocre mobile game on my channel ever again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIs there anything else I should know?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tend to drop 2-3 videos in the Codex Entry series a month, however there may come times where I take on a project so big that I\u0027m only able to release one video that month. My video on Yoko Taro is a good example of one such project. Should this happen, I will be sure to give plenty of warning in advance so you don\u0027t feel left out of the loop. This is increasingly unlikely given that I\u0027ve gotten better at putting out more side content such as the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUsgGWfJptskXYx-5d-u1Bo-xEv9VR_41\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003eJournal Updates\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, but it\u0027s not outside the realm of possibility and you deserve to know that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always experimenting and trying new things and there will be times I that I do stuff that probably won\u0027t be to your taste, both artistically and personally.

That\u0027s not me, never has been, never will.
