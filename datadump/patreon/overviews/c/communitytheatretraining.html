    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi I\u0027m Maggie Whitcroft\u003c/strong\u003e, \u00a0and I\u0027m creating an online course for community theatre volunteers who have little or no theatre or marketing training so they can learn \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow to Market Your Play\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve been involved in theatre a long time. My training in Theatre Production Management has served me well but my career steered me into television for 17 years. In the past seven years I\u0027ve come back home, so to speak, when I volunteered with my local community theatre group. I\u0027ve been doing their marketing and I\u0027ve increased ticket sales to our shows and we even sell out our musicals now. You\u0027re somewhat of an unsung hero promoting shows but my success hasn\u0027t gone unnoticed. Some of my colleagues at other small community theatre groups started asking me to help them and from there my love of theatre and helping people led me to begin creating an online course - \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow to Market Your Play\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. The idea is to offer my paid online course through webinars by using Facebook ads. My learning curve in this venture is huge. I\u0027ve had to pay for courses, I\u0027ve taken free courses, watched webinars, become part of Facebook groups all to learn how to put my dream together so community theatres can find their audiences to allow them to offer quality shows to their communities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eDo you love theatre as much as I do? Do you see the value in educating volunteers that have no other way of learning this specific form of marketing without having to take a full-time theatre course?\u003cbr\u003eIf so, please, I invite you to be part of this endeavour to create my dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e, everyone, who takes the time in reading or watching my video and supporting me as I embrace my entrepreneurial spirit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaggie Whitcroft"
