    "summary": "Hello Humans is designed to\u00a0help subscribers identify rhetorical red flags and immunise themselves against a sea of bullshit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt consists of a regular column, a weekly newsletter and an e-book. It is because of my subscribers that I have afforded the time and research for my upcoming book about omitted aspects of history, foreign policy, and economics, the myths formed in their absence, and the impact they have had on the current crisis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the reasons I began this subscription experiment was to prove there was a different way to do journalism, that there is a market for the kind of reporting I want to do, and demonstrate the importance of reader-driven publishing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou wouldn\u0027t know it from cracking a paper, or even a textbook, but most economics does not account for the role of money, the people who use it or the jobs which enable that spending.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.edelman.com/trust2017/\"\u003eAccording to Edelmen\u003c/a\u003e, an overwhelming majority of people feel they can no longer trust the news sources they used to rely on to make sense of the world around them. How are people meant to make even the most basic decisions about their lives if most of what they read and hear is informed by policies which do not take their financial lives into account?\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to help readers identify red flags and understand better the context of how the world came to operate the way it does. I want to enable my subscribers to make more informed and empowered decisions both at the ballot box, the checkout, the bank, and all the other domains over which we exercise control. But mostly I want people to learn how to think for themselves, rather than being defined by the paper they read or influenced by ideological peer pressure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to prove there is a market for this kind of journalism. I want to demonstrate to publishers there is a different way to do things.
