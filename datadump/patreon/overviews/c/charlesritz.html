My channel mainly hosts my covers of music from video games and movies in styles such as jazz, electronic, orchestral, and acapella!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating this music and the videos to go with it is no easy task, and I often dedicate a lot of my time to make the best music that I can do at a semi-consistent rate. Being a student, it is constantly a challenge to devote a large chunk of time to my channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to help with the increasing costs of producing and distributing music in a legal format for everyone to hear, I have decided to make this Patreon page for those who choose to support me with a tip for every video I put out. Your donations will go toward making my channel and my musical endeavors bigger and better, with new gear, equipment, and generally more content for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledging to this campaign is completely optional, and I won\u0027t love you any less if you cannot donate, but I would greatly appreciate it. As said before, all of your pledges will be put back into my channel to help me produce better content for you. Thank you so much for checking out my campaign!"
