After lots of talk and not enough walk,\u00a0Craft Heads Podcast was finally born.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt least once a week, you can expect about 30 minutes of banter between Alex \u0026amp; Tommy to keep you company while going about your day in this bad old world. We\u0027re two open-minded individuals with what we\u0027d like to think is a good sense of humor, and you\u0027ll hear about everything from our personal anecdotes and experiences to pop culture and philosophy. If we make you laugh even once or make you think about something in a way that you haven\u0027t before, we\u0027ll consider that episode a success. We\u0027ll welcome guests on the podcast as well, close friends and casual acquaintances alike.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe want to thank each and every one of your for listening, supporting, and checking out the podcast - even if it\u0027s not your cup of tea. We live off feedback, so don\u0027t hesitate to tell us what you think we could do to make it even better!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ll appreciate your support, even if it\u0027s just for a month - the rewards still apply. For those of you who definitely want to do a one-time donation or contribute to the podcast in a bigger way for bigger, tangible rewards, please email us at craftheadspodcast@gmail.com or contact us directly. We\u0027ve got some pretty cool ideas on how to give back to our Patrons, so we look forward to hearing from you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCheers!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlex \u0026amp; Tommy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Sworbachev\"\u003e@Sworbachev\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/TommySpitta\"\u003e@TommySpitta\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
