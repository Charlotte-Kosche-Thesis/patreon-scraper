I love creating my flower people because they tell a story of growth and new beginnings.\u00a0Art has not only saved my life, but it has helped me evolve as a person. There are so many issues today concerning race, I don\u0027t understand treating someone differently because of their color. All of my flowers take on human form. Whether dancing or simply meditating, these people convey a sense of movement."

     "about": "Christian Gabriel was born in Amityville, NY in 1984. Being a war veteran who struggled with PTSD, he found his outlet through painting. It was after going to local art shows that he became inspired \u0026amp; his monochromatic world turned colorful. A world where you can do anything or be anyone. Christian started painting in 2007. In 2010, he opened Christian Gabriel Art, a fine art studio that specializes in traditional commissions as well as digital design. He studied Media Arts \u0026amp; Animation at the Art Institute of Las Vegas where he earned his Bachelors in 2013. After college, Christian gained professional experience working at a high volume fine art production company. In 2016, Christian relocated to Portland where he was invited to join the advisory committee for The Oregon Society of Artists. Gabriel\u0027s most recent addition, The Garden Collection was created as a symbol of growth \u0026amp; new beginnings. Christian uses bright and vibrant colors that represent his personality. His flower people imply movement whether they are dancing or simply meditating. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Love saved my life. I looked everywhere to find it, but I finally found it in myself. We never know how much longer we have on this earth. Tomorrow was never promised. Be yourself, be GREAT!\" -CG\u003cbr\u003e",
