    "summary": "Hey guys! Blue here, just to give you a run down of why I made this page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started on Patreon to hopefully gain some support as I am currently going through some financial trouble. I\u0027m still trying to attend college but with my father unable to help me anymore due to being the place he worked at being shut down as well as jobs being very scarce in the area, I\u0027m definitely going to need all the support I can get and would really appreciate it! Feel free to send in commission requests. I\u0027m willing to try just about anything but I do have some limitations. Send me a message here or on Tumblr to ask about a commission!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also would like to use the support I gain here to help me get new laptop, hopefully a surface pro or something to that extent, to help me achieve my goal of developing better manga, creating games, animations, and so on. It\u0027s always been a passion of mine and something I would like to be able to do throughout my future. Not only that, but the new tech I get will be used in all my different classes! The surface pro would allow me to take it more places as well as replace my current laptop that probably won\u0027t last another year with the current amount of time spent using it and jostling around it on a daily basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, my final goal will be to get my manga chapters out and transform them into a full fledged game! So if you are interested in following these developments, feel free to follow me on Tumblr to get the newest updates on the manga, SplitVerse! I will update Patreon when the first chapter is posted. I will also be adding a YouTube account later on for speed drawings, animations, and possibly some other things when I am able to buy the programs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me achieve my goal of getting through my classes, new laptop, and creating SplitVerse into a game!\u003cbr\u003eIf you are here following me from Tumblr, I thank you for your help! If you are here to pay me for a commission, I am glad to have been able to provide you with what you needed! Thank you all for joining me on this crazy journey, lets see where it takes us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://cereusblue.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://cereusblue.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
