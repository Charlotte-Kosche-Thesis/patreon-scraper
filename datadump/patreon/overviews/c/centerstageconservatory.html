    "summary": "Center Stage Conservatory has been established for over twenty years in California\u2019s Central Valley, but the company has been thriving under Artistic Director Traci Sprague since 2010, with the past five years at our current location in the Lower Level Studio in downtown Modesto. Center Stage is a non-profit forum that provides opportunities for local artists and actors, and of course, for audiences to come witness the work. And with exclusively 5-star ratings, it seems the community likes what we\u2019re doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cProvocative, entertaining, expertly produced theater.\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, after the Lower Level Studio being our home for five years, we are now looking to relocate and re-imagine aspects of Center Stage in order to offer more opportunities to community members.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s a little bit of what to expect in the upcoming year for Center Stage Conservatory:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe conclusion of our 2017 Season\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds\u003c/em\u003e by Paul Zindel\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eJacob Marley\u2019s Christmas Carol \u003c/em\u003eby Tom Mula\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur 2018 Season\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eA Lie of the Mind\u003c/em\u003e by Sam Shepard\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBug\u003c/em\u003e by Tracy Letts\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWaiting for Godot\u003c/em\u003e by Samuel Beckett\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eReally Really\u003c/em\u003e by Paul Downs Colaizzo\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eRomeo \u0026amp; Juliet\u003c/em\u003e  by William Shakespeare (all-female cast)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Wolves\u003c/em\u003e by Sarah DeLappe\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThird Annual Devised Theatre Project\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCenter Stage Conservatory offers a unique blend of beloved plays that are well-known in the theater community, plays that have only been produced a few times, and productions built from the ground up by local artists in the Annual Devised Theatre Project, offering opportunities for participation for anyone in the community interested in acting, writing, or the technical side of theater. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, Center Stage regularly offers special events such as The 24-Hour Playfest, Drinking Games, musical events, spoken word nights, etc.With our upcoming move, we hope to expand these even more, including regularly producing children\u2019s shows at another venue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the core elements of Center Stage Conservatory under Traci Sprague\u2019s direction has been the emphasis on youth education in the theater during summer programs typically studying and performing the classics, fostering a creative environment and inspiring a lifelong involvement in the arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cCenter Stage is the most inclusive and ground-breaking theater in the Central Valley.\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, unless you are directly involved with a production or an event, it\u2019s hard to feel like \u003cem\u003eyou\u2019re a part of this awesome thing\u003c/em\u003e happening in downtown Modesto. \u003cbr\u003eMaybe some of you even have been. Maybe your favorite play you\u2019ve ever been in was with us. Maybe Center Stage Conservatory is home to your favorite artists to work with. \u003cbr\u003eBut even so, one of the best ways to become part of our community is to support us fiscally. As a non-profit, we simply cannot survive on ticket sales alone, and this is a beloved company to so many people. If you\u2019d like to help keep us alive and thriving, find a button that suits you at the right - $2 a month? $5? $10?- whatever you can offer will be greatly appreciated, and we have some awesome perks that go along with each tier of sponsorship aimed at making you feel like you are on the inside, on the ground floor with us and the artists making these shows a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho benefits from this support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCenter Stage is not just our incredible Artistic Director, Traci Sprague, but she has built a community of actors, stage managers, theater technicians, writers, musicians, dancers, painters, and producers whose jobs would all be much easier if the budget wasn\u2019t quite so tight. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd you know who else?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou: there are some really lovely ways we plan to say thank you to our sponsors, especially as you go in the higher tiers of donation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will the theater spend this money on?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith every production, we need to be able to afford rights to the plays we\u2019re producing, pay rent to keep the space we\u2019re working and presenting in, print programs and posters, build and polish the set for that show, concessions for our front-of-house, and so on.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, with a certain amount of support, we would also hope to be able to expand what we\u2019re doing, rather than just continue our work as it\u2019s been. We could really use a new lighting system, headsets for our incredibly dedicated stage managers, and create more opportunities for artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat, exactly do you get out of supporting?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides the satisfaction of keeping art alive in the valley?\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s what we have in mind for starters:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEarly announcements on upcoming seasons and special events -which means you can reserve your ticket before others even know it\u2019s happening!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEarly casting announcements so you know if one of your favorite local actors will soon be on our stage\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusive rehearsal photos\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEarly access to production photos\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA bi-monthly blog post from Traci on the goings-on of the theater\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour name on our website\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFree headshots by local photographer Philip Johnson\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA free ticket and Director\u0027s Choice reserved seating -the directors always know the best seat in the house!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIf we exceed our first goal or someone is especially generous, we\u2019ll be looking at:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAn exclusive performance for you, your fellow patrons, and your friends\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRegular videos\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEither a meet and greet or dinner with the cast and director after the show\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePop-up blog posts from actors or guest directors about their experiences at Center Stage\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatron-only parties with the actors, directors, stage managers from the season\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore special events throughout the season, some of them Patron only\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery artist has an artistic home.
