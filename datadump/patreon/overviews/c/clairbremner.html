I started painting and drawing at a very young age thanks to my artistic mother.

I will be creating challenges, tutorials, step by step videos as well as time lapse videos of me painting complete artworks from start to finish.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will have the opportunity to join my private Facebook group where I will be building a community of like minded artists willing to share ideas, encouragement and troubleshooting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will I\u0027ll be honest, I am new to Patreon myself and I will be working things out as I go.
