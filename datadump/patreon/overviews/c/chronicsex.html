I launched CS in 2015, starting with the chat and growing into a lot more. I know the impact of multiple chronic illnesses/disabilities on QOL issues first-hand from chronic pain affecting my self-worth to PTSD affecting my sex life and a whole lot more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the site, I\u0027ve had the amazing opportunity to snag guest posts from amazing writers. I\u0027ve been on a number of amazing podcasts as well as interviewing fantastic experts. Also,I\u0027ve had the honor of being able to test out a number of sex toys and share with you how accessible I think they are for a number of conditions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016, I started a podcast as well. As someone who is quite enamored with podcasts, I know how much easier it is to be involved with them over weekly chats and websites with URLs you can\u0027t always view at work, etc. Right now, I am working on getting the second season of the podcast going soon.\u00a0You can find the first season of the podcast on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/chronic-sex-podcast/id1125571104?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiTunes\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-836036087-992379708/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSoundCloud\u003c/a\u003e, or your favorite podcast streaming app.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2017 was a huge year for the site and for me as a sex educator. I got to present at a number of conferences, work with a range of organizations and companies (including pharma peeps!), wrote a lot (on CS, Healthline, and elsewhere), and was interviewed quite a bit. CS got featured in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://health.usnews.com/health-care/patient-advice/articles/2017-05-18/dating-with-chronic-pain\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUS News\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/vb3gga/having-a-chronic-illness-doesnt-mean-giving-up-sex\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBroadly\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.theontarion.com/2017/06/guelph-sexuality-conference-explores-sex-ed-through-the-theme-of-pain/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Ontarion\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://helloflo.com/arthritis-doesnt-mean-saying-goodbye-to-sex-heres-why/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHelloFlo\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2018/01/03/disability-shouldnt-limit-your-sex-life-here-are-some-of-the-sex-toy-industrys-most-innovative-solutions-7131576/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMetro UK\u003c/a\u003e, and a quote in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/disabled-sex-ed\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTeen Vogue\u003c/a\u003e, too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow it\u0027s 2018 and I have \u003cem\u003eeven bigger plans\u003c/em\u003e. Still, to do that, I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming part of the Patreon fam, you\u0027ll be helping me to get the word out about the complicated things health issues do to \u003cem\u003eall \u003c/em\u003eparts of our lives. It will free up more time to allow me to get back to the podcast in addition to producing even more content \u003cem\u003eand starting on sexuality research\u003c/em\u003e. I\u0027m also hoping to design merch that isn\u0027t on a mass production site because, let\u0027s face it, that stuff almost never looks great. I\u0027m also hoping to host live sessions online and in-person - and live meet-ups around a number of conferences this year for those interested!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt takes a lot of energy to keep this site going, from the weekly chat and blog posts to\u00a0social media scheduling and podcast episodes. I spend roughly twelve hours a week managing and scheduling social media posts alone, making sure to use my privilege to lift up voices that may not always be heard. Add in writing posts, testing products, helping people in our communities, and more - and it\u0027s a lot. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to have to put things on the backburner as much as I have needed to do to take up money-making projects and contribute to my household.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m super excited about new ideas and plans I have for our community. I can\u0027t even begin to express how much your support means to me - and what it means for others in our communities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
