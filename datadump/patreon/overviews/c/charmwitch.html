I\u0027ve bounced around from place to place and have found it difficult to maintain stable work, so I\u0027ve become a freelancer in the meanwhile. I still quite enjoy what I do and I plan to keep doing it, but I would like to be able to pay rent and focus my drawings to improve my webcomic, freelancing, and also to just continue to make art for everyone to enjoy. Art is a personal passion, one I hope to continue to share, but it has been pretty difficult lately.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really love video games! I love working on them and I love their influence on my life. I want to share these feelings with all of you and continue to help make games and art that can one day inspire and help others in their time of need. I have grown up reading books and playing video games of stories I\u0027ve enjoyed and hope to continue to pass these feelings of passion onto others. I want to be visible, not only as an artist, but also as a young woman in order to help others achieve their dreams. That\u0027s where you come in if you want to help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2605Thank you so much!!\u2605\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
