    "summary": "Welcome to the official Toll of the Lost Patreon Page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToll of the Lost is an episodic fantasy series about the adventures of \"Valdoros\", a golden Dragon who was exiled centuries ago from his kind. Accompanied by a pair of travelling treasure hunters and a sinister, magical book, Valdoros finds his wits tested as he\u0027s plunged, often unwillingly, into saving his people, and others, across the multitudes of civilizations that inhabit their world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my own personal words, I have a love for fantasy and science fiction movies and video games. I\u0027ve always been a massive dork, but I\u0027ve always felt that there\u0027s an imbalance in the representation of either genre. My goal with Toll of the Lost, is to help rectify that and present something that shows fantasy doesn\u0027t always need to be about Orcs and Elves.\u003cbr\u003eTaking strong inspiration from shows like Doctor Who, Star Trek and Sherlock, I wanted to make a fantasy world with it\u0027s own consistent science, about a character who solves problems by bucking societal norms and out-thinking his enemies.\u003cbr\u003eValdoros, being a Dragon who often disguises himself as a person, is probably never exactly what you expect.\u003cbr\u003eHis companions are \u003cem\u003e\u0027Louis Legrande\u0027\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003e\u0027Kaskara\u0027\u003c/em\u003e, an eccentric explorer and a battleaxe wielding woman\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m keeping the pledge tiers relatively low, because I make this show from the heart, and like Valdoros himself, I\u0027m going sort of against the grain in what it means to produce a web-series. I want to surprise audiences, and bring something fairly unique to the table!\u003cbr\u003e"
