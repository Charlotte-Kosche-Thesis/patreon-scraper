    "summary": "We believe that science fiction is important. It expands the mind and drives progress through inspiration. Our purpose is to\u00a0find, publish, and promote the best science fiction stories, and to support and encourage the authors who write them.\u00a0We prefer stories that are self-consistent, scientifically plausible, and technically detailed when necessary. If our goals resonate with you, please support our effort in any way you can.\u00a0Thank you for pushing the world in a direction you\u0027d like it to go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCompelling Science Fiction is published every six months (formerly every two), and costs about $1500-$1800 per issue to produce (varying based on final word count). The vast majority of this budget goes directly to paying authors professional rates for their work. The remainder goes to infrastructure costs (hosting, etc) and less common costs like occasional graphic design contracts and advertising to get the word out. Everyone who helps publish the magazine are volunteers, so there are no costs there. We all do this because we want to see more great science fiction in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more information and to view our current issue, please visit\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://compellingsciencefiction.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ecompellingsciencefiction.com!\u003c/a\u003e"
