    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn 2013 I started my website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://childrenstheatrereviews.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eChildren\u2019s Theatre Reviews\u003c/a\u003e, to help plug the significant gap in criticism and writing about\ntheatre for young audiences. Since then I\u2019ve seen and reviewed as many shows as\npossible \u2013\u00a0without pay and in my spare time \u2013 to help give children\u2019s theatre the\nvoice it deserves. I focus especially on the fringe venues and smaller companies which are most at risk of being overlooked.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe most exciting, terrifying, intense, and moving theatrical moments I\u0027ve experienced have been\u00a0whilst surrounded by\ntoddlers or teenagers. It\u2019s important that all theatre lovers (and would-be\ntheatregoers) recognise that their cultural world will be richer for including\nthe innovative and avant-garde work being created for younger audiences. For those who might doubt the sophistication of children\u0027s theatre, just a couple of examples could make you change your mind. Oily Cart create multi-sensory, immersive productions that redefine what theatre can be, like the recent\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://childrenstheatrereviews.com/2015/09/28/light-show/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLight Show\u003c/a\u003e - rarely is a theatre experience so well-crafted and finely attuned to its audience.\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eTheatre-Rites and 20 Stories High have just toured\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://childrenstheatrereviews.com/2016/04/04/the-broke-n-beat-collective/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Broke \u0027N\u0027 Beat Collective\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, \u003c/em\u003ea hard-hitting piece of gig-theatre which offered as much political bite as any adult show, presenting an\u00a0uncompromising and eloquent musical critique of today\u0027s Britain. I could go on (and indeed I do, on my website!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny sophisticated art form is further enriched by critical writing. The relative\u00a0lack of writing about theatre for young audiences means that:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eshows for young people struggle to gain cultural value and significance\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ecompanies and artists don\u0027t have access to vital feedback and possible publicity\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003etransient productions (usually without a published script or available recording) are at risk of disappearing completely - theatre criticism\u00a0\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\"is a large part of a show\u0027s afterlife\"\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u2019s where Children\u2019s Theatre Reviews comes in!
