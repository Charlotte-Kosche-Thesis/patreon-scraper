We know what a commitment this can be and we could not be more grateful. \u003cbr\u003ePlease give me the opportunity to tell you a little bit about us. \u003cbr\u003eWe are a very small dog training business based in St. Louis Missouri. We focus on teaching household manners, canine good citizen, obedience and even competition obedience. Our focus is pretty simple, reach and help\u00a0as many people as possible so dogs can stay in their homes, where they belong. With that being said we don\u0027t believe dogs are one dimensional beings. We don\u0027t want to just treat the symptoms of behavior we want to treat the whole dog and that can include nutrition, exercise and the family unit. \u003cbr\u003eYour patron each month allows us to make higher quality videos so we can reach more people across the globe."
