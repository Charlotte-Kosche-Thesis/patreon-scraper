They were \nalways about elaborate adventures across deep space, or finding treasure\n in your back yard. Upon discovering Homestar Runner and Newgrounds, \nAnimation became the next leap forward from static images to literally \nbringing these adventures to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating these worlds and \ntelling these stories has been my sole motivation and I want to be \nsuccessful in doing what I feel I\u0027ve been destined to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI aim to work on my projects full-time. Even over-time!\u003cbr\u003eMy passion is what drives me, and if it is fueled enough, I can pull 80 hour work weeks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever\n a lot of my time is consumed by working a full time job, so I have next\n to no time to work on my own projects, other than short loops, sketches\n and simple illustrations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will allow me to freely create animations, cartoons, \ncomics, and illustrations. While my videos will remain free on YouTube, \nthink of this as a tip jar where you pay what you think I deserve!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere is my money going?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money I receive here will go towards living expenses such as rent, food, utilities, and help pay off my student debt!\u003cbr\u003eIf I start getting enough support, I can use the funds to upgrade my computer, work space, and hardware!\u003cbr\u003eI aim to get my own small studio space so I\u0027m not stuck at home 24/7.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get out of it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy videos will be uploaded and remain free to view on Youtube, however \nsupporters will receive behind the scenes perks such as animatics, \nsketches, and even comics and commissions if I can meet certain goals!I\n have a firm belief in sharing assets with aspiring artists. So many of \nmy rewards allow you to learn intimately from my process to apply to your own craft as you see fit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat projects can I expect?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have handfuls of projects in the works, but I have 2 projects ready for production right now!\u003cbr\u003eOne called \u003cstrong\u003e[R.E.M.] \u003c/strong\u003eand the other called \u003cstrong\u003eFlintlock Jones!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e[R.E.M.]\u003c/strong\u003e\n is an action comedy about 6 teens trapped in the dream-scape! They are \non a mission to find a way back to the waking world, but dream logic and\n non sequiturs  warp their perception of the world around them! With the\n help of their guide Virgil and his mysterious briefcase, he bestows the\n gang lucid powers to conquer their nightmares and return home!\u003cbr\u003eThe series will run for 13 episodes, running around 5 minutes per video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFlintlock Jones\u003c/strong\u003e is\n about the titular Paranormal Detective and his overly eager partner Sigaleous \nO\u0027Connor. Sig is clumsy, energetic, and infinitely more \nnaive. Flintlock is dead-set in his ways and sees the world through noir\n tinted glasses; He tries to play it cool and collected, but when \nSigaleous or the  baffling world they live in doesn\u0027t abide by the \nscript in his head, his facade breaks with explosive results.\u003cbr\u003e The \ntwo set off to solve Paranormal crimes and disturbances in the crooked \ncity of Eventide. They tackle pilfering poltergeists, wild werewolves, \nalien agents, and seemingly cordial demons!\u003cbr\u003eThe series will run \nindefinitely. Following a monster of the week formula, that will run the\n course of several plot arcs. Each episode will run between 5 and 7 \nminutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/94466946\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://vimeo.com/94466946\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere can I find your work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://codyhawley.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/CodyAHawley\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://codyhawley.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://wakman111.newgrounds.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNewgrounds\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/chawley\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eVimeo\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hodycawley/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e"
