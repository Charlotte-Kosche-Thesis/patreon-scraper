    "summary": "Hey everyone, my name is Luke Foster. Thanks for checking out the Patreon for my not-all-ages, political/dark comedy comic strip \"Supernatural Suburbs.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Supernatural Suburbs\" is my outlet to address the many wrongs I see in the world today, and there are many. It\u0027s not 100 percent political, though. I know that can get heavy-handed after a while, so I\u0027ll throw other jokes in there as I go. Nothing will be explicit or graphic or NSFW (I think), but the jokes definitely have a darker streak to them. Think \"Rick and Morty\" for a popular TV comparison. Basically, if you like the samples below, you\u0027ll like this comic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/3/e30%3D/patreon-posts/8082177392071599712.jpg?token-time=1511481600\u0026amp;token-hash=7hRmgE8qDRnGw0wNTTlBA0x4Ow-ivYPPq9T25dN9cYg%3D\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why Patreon? Well, like I said, most of my other work is much lighter and all-ages friendly, and I didn\u0027t want to drop this comic on the same web sites I uploaded comics about squirrels playing dodgeball and \"Steven Universe\" fan art. So if politics and dark comedy aren\u0027t your thing, you can check out my other work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/3/e30%3D/patreon-posts/16064415622803514390.jpg?token-time=1511481600\u0026amp;token-hash=1cmoslp7eTCBPLNW2ek2KTeBoX7OWOvqK8HrP2zZYZM%3D\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Supernatural Suburbs\" updates once a week, on Mondays. For $5 a month you can get access to exclusive comics every week, plus you can Ask Me Anything about making comics, and I will write a blog post about it. For $10 you get the weekly comic, the AMAs, and monthly exclusive bonus material. If you don\u0027t like this type of humor but want to support independent artists, for $1 a month you get access to the AMAs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe posting frequency will go up as we reach certain financial thresholds. I\u0027ve been cartooning for almost nine years and not only do I always work ahead but I haven\u0027t missed a deadline yet, so if you haven\u0027t followed my work before I want to reassure that you should have no issues backing this project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I\u0027m going to have lots of other rewards for higher-level patrons. I\u0027m going to experiment with and play around with those upper levels to see what patrons like best, so your opinions could impact things in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/3/e30%3D/patreon-posts/KpD_qf2VPQ1D44iJq9XaNPnHCxroT8lvvJ2u65i0EkFMEGyVJVxuQ-0ttXaDWkau.jpg?token-time=1511481600\u0026amp;token-hash=ubQ_-N4QTt_3cOqKYdzj5eWAaAnZ6aYmudHKNxBOcQU%3D\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you aren\u0027t familiar with me, you can check out my other comics, which include \"The Center of \nSomewhere,\" \"Drawn Away: A Cartoonist Tours America,\" and \"Doctor \nBananas: Monkey Magician.\" The first two can be found at \n\u003ca href=\"http://centerofsomewhere.com.\"\u003ehttp://centerofsomewhere.com.\u003c/a\u003e \"Doctor Bananas\" can be found digitally on\n Comixology.
