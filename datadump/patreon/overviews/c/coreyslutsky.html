If you choose to stop donating regardless of the reason, or you want to donate less, no worries. Any support, no matter how long or how much, is super helpful. You can just log in to change or cancel the account whenever you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eNo, you can pay in any currency! Everything is shown in US dollars on this website, but you can use any currency and it will be automatically converted. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many music videos will you release a month?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIdeally, I\u0027d like to release one or two videos a month. But don\u0027t worry... you can set a monthly maximum when you sign up, so if I release more videos that you want to support, you can put a cap on your monthly donation.\u003cbr\u003e"
