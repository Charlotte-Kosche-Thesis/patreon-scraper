I also had my own singer-songwriter project called Kybele. I recorded my first EP but didn\u0027t release it for various reasons so one day look out for the release of \"Animal Family EP\" by Kybele.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015 I started a four-piece rock n roll project called Betty Petty and self-released my first official EP \"\u003ca href=\"https://bettypetty.bandcamp.com/releases\"\u003eDesperately Seeking Satan\u003c/a\u003e\" online and a limited run of CDs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe toured the West Coast and played shows around LA and even got to headline at the Echo last April, but finally last summer I embarked on my ultimate dream power journey and started an all-girl band w a punk edge and pop melodies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePipe Dreams is about to release our first official music video and currently have two demo/singles out and a full length album in the works, including amazing features with local artists such as Bobb Bruno from Best Coast!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m SO GRATEFUL that I get to be part of an amazingly revolutionary time for music and especially females playing music, and have also overcome so many of my own fears to do so and have had experiences that will remain with me forever - howeverrrrrr it is an insanely ridiculous time in the music industry and the content that we spend hundreds or thousands of hours and dollars from our own pockets creating has been de-commodified while maintaining its personal value for the consumer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSO if you want to help me keep creating content and also organizing/booking music events that support issues like domestic violence prevention, womens\u0027 rights, environmental defense, and other great causes, consider contributing a small or large monthly amount to my wallet! I\u0027ll keep on making music either way :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love\u003cbr\u003e- Caitlin Dee\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePress clips for \"Desperately Seeking Satan\" by Betty Petty (available on iTunes, Spotify, and bandcamp):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"It\u2019s hard to find a flaw in any of the 6 tracks, as every minute is devoted to this perfect harmony Betty Petty emits. The congeniality of the wonderfully executed instrumentation is only exceeded by the goosebumps-inducing voice of Caitlin Dee, only adding to her already stunning delivery in her other project \u003cem\u003ePipe Dreams\u003c/em\u003e. For all the memorable instrumentation, song writing, moods and lyrical ambitions, Desperately Seeking Satan is never overblown or directionless, keeping a good sense of precision and consideration instead of fully getting lost in the dreaded world of pain and hopelessness. These songs are as memorable as Southern California pop-punk can get, a release that indefinitely grows with its own aspirations. Overall, Desperately Seeking Satan is well worth the time to listen to, and despite being pop oriented it still somehow makes sense Caitlin Dee and her band(s) have found their way into the hearts of punks everywhere.\" -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.deathbyboredumb.com/post/157278095362/betty-petty-desperately-seeking-satan\"\u003eBored to Death\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \"There is certainly a punk rock DIY ethos running through Betty Petty\u2018s debut EP, but the pop chops present here should have BP on every \u201cbuzz band\u201d list out there.\" - \u003ca href=\"http://www.50thirdand3rd.com/betty-petty/\"\u003e50thirdand3rd.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"succinct songs of raw garage pop with a punky spirit, candid lyrics, and dreamy delivery.\" - \u003ca href=\"http://freebikevalet.com/2016/01/18/lion-by-betty-petty/\"\u003eFree Bike Valet\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"a project that marries dreamy pop instincts with a more jarring harder edge.\" -\u003ca href=\"http://overblown.co.uk/betty-petty-interview/\"\u003eOverblown\u003c/a\u003e (UK)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
