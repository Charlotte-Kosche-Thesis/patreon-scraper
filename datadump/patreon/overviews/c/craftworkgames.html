It\u0027s designed to help you get a head start on creating your games by providing many commonly needed features that aren\u0027t provided in the core framework. Things like Tiled maps, texture atlases, cameras, viewport adapters, animation, bitmap fonts, input listeners, timers and FPS counters to name just a few.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you contribute?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to dedicate as much time as possible to helping other game developers create great games. I do this because I have a passion for creating game development tools and libraries. Most of my spare time goes into MonoGame.Extended and other game development tools.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, it does come at a cost. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, there\u0027s the real physical cost of hosting websites, build servers and purchasing or renewing software licenses. I currently pay for this stuff out of my own pocket, but I don\u0027t have endless spare cash to give away forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, I would like to support more\u00a03rd party game development tools and a wider variety of file formats in the library. To do this I\u0027ll often need to purchase a license for a tool so that I can create and test the importers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast, but certainly not least, I\u0027d love to spend a lot more time working on the library and other tools. My spare time is already stretched between having a full-time job, a family and supporting the growing community of developers using the library. With enough funding I could flip that around turn my spare-time job into my full-time job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
