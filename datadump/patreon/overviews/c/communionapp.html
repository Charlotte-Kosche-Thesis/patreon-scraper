    "summary": "Hello,\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Nathaniel Webb and I am building Communion: The Church communication platform designed to help bring fellowship, transparency, and community to Evangelical Gospel-centered Churches in light of present day geographical limitations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn our present day world, we are often very geographically separated from other members of our church body. \u00a0Due to this separation, we often lack in extremely valuable communication to other members of our Church body. \u00a0When we arrive at Church on Sunday or Wednesday, we are often totally oblivious to the events / needs / etc. that have been occurring in the lives of our other brothers and sisters. \u00a0Communion is designed to keep everyone in the loop. \u00a0Communion is designed to regain that sense of community that is lost due to geographical limitations by keeping the communication stream open. \u00a0We can now encourage, pray for, help out other from afar. \u00a0If someone has an immediate prayer need, they can let the church know in an instant and immediately have the whole church praying for them. \u00a0That prayer is powerful...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCommunion is a safe place where members of an individual church can share needs, news, prayer requests, plan events, and simply communicate information to members of the Church. \u00a0Because Communion is contained to a local church scope, it enables members of the Church to grow into a family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA brief sampling of the features that I desire to bring to Communion are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eChurch messages and communications to individual church members and groups of members similar to the functionality of most text messaging clients.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eChurchwide communication boards with the following contexts:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eActionable Needs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrayer Requests\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eChurchwide News\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGifts / Donations\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eiOS and Android push notifications.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOptional Email and SMS (text message) notifications.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA church calendar that can be added to by each member of the congregation.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd many more...\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have desired to build this application for several years, but have been limited by both funding and time. \u00a0The need had not been as pressing on me in the past few years because my home church had a alternative tool that we were using. \u00a0While we desired to have many of the features that I anticipate to incorporate into Communion, we were at a place where we could make do. \u00a0Given the lack of urgency, funds, and time, my work on Communion progressed slowly. \u00a0Since the beginning of January, the previous solution our Church had possessed decided to dissolve. \u00a0This prompted me to spend a much greater amount of time creating Communion; desiring first to provide it to my own Church, and from there Churches around the nation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have two goals in mind through my development of Communion. \u00a0My goal in creating Communion specifically is to provide a communication platform designed to help bring fellowship, transparency, and community to Evangelical Gospel-centered Churches in light of present day geographical limitations. \u00a0My goal for working in this manner is not to obtain a great profit, but to be able to create a stable and flexible income for my family in our endeavor to pursue the work of Christ in spreading the Gospel to the nations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am asking for the support of individuals who would like to advance these causes. \u00a0I have great dreams for this application, and I know that many of my brothers and sisters in the faith do as well; unfortunately, it is very difficult to achieve these dreams when I must maintain another full-time position in addition to work on Communion. \u00a0In order to achieve these dreams, I am asking if you would be willing to donate any funds that you deem fitting in order to help the development of Communion. \u00a0The more money that comes in, the more time I will be able to devote to development. \u00a0I have hopes that I might even be able to bring on others in this goal to create a revolutionary communication platform for the Church.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce the development of the application has reached an acceptable state, we will begin to try to obtain our income from subscriptions to the application rather than through donations. \u00a0However, if the donations are numerous enough, we would love to be able to provide this application free of charge to Churches around the nation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease help join me in this mission to bring active community to Churches around the nation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am working to find rewards that I can give to those of you who have graciously donated to help. \u00a0I thank God for you and your help and am trying to find another good way to give back. \u00a0In the mean time, I would like you to know that your rewards will be retroactive. \u00a0When I am able to find out what these gifts will be, I will be happy to give them to all of you who donated the reward amount to the cause. \u00a0Thank you,"
