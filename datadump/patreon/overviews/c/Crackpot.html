    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHey everybody.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a professional developer and hobby artist and enthusiasitc gamer. About a year ago it finally dawned on me that I could perfectly join all of my passions and start making my own video games. So I started doing courses about game development and also practiced more on digital art. Right now I am in love with pixel art, but maybe this will change over time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am still rather at the beginning and learn something new every day, so maybe you want to join and support me on my journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou surely have heard the saying: \"Time is money\" and because this is a simple equation you can turn it around and get \"Money is Time\". That\u0027s it! \u003cbr\u003eWith a bit of cash on my hands I can buy me some time that I can spend on additional content. I know patreon will not pay my day to day bills, but maybe it can pay the neighbors kid to mow my lawn, or pay a craftsman to fix things around the house so I don\u0027t have to spend my time on these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know you want more than just my gratitude. So I was pondering what would be something of worth to you and I came out with a couple of things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFirst of all you will participate in my ongoing studies about game development. What tutorials are good or even essential, what books or articles I can recommend, but also what dead ends I experienced.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSecondly I will regularly show and talk about my current projects with WIP images or videos. Depending on your patreon level you can get all my images in raw format (Photoshop psd files or Aseprite ase files) so you can see how I work, how I use layers or frames (for animations).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThirdly I will be creating my own tutorials, mainly on pixel art, but maybe later on also on game development.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFourthly I will make little gimmicks like stickers, buttons, postcards for my patreons. Depending on your investment you will receive them for free or you will take part in a little draw. These litte events (called \"Tangible-Thoughts\") will take place at least twice a year, maybe more depending on the feedback and number of patreons.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd last but not least you will get access to my games in an early stage so you can play around with them.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope there is something in it for you that could interest you. And I am open for feedback so if there is anything else you would want in the list and that I am able to support I am willing to expand the list.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often do you post?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell since this is a one man show and I am doing it only in my free time I will NOT guarantee you how often or how much I am going to post content. I don\u0027t want to state something and later on neglect the promise, this would be not very fair to you.\u003cbr\u003eI WILL try to post stuff as often as possible, meaning at least once or twice a week but as I said I can\u0027t give you a promise on that. There may be times were I just don\u0027t have enough free time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are you currently working on?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRight now I just finished my first \"Tangible-Thoughts\" project. I just received the first few \"Real Heroes Don\u0027t Need Polygons\" stickers and I am quite happy with them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore I currently have two gaming projects in the works. My main project is a 2D, hack\u0026amp;slay platformer game. I have some artworks and animations ready and the basic controlls are working. There is still much to do and much to learn. This project still has no working title, so right now I only call it my little \"barbarian game\". Any suggestions for a cool title would be great! It will be released mainly for PC.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides this I started a little side project to learn and practice some things I can later use in my barbarian game. This side project will be a (hopefully) fun little zombie shooter for android. It\u0027s called \"Till The Last Bullet\" and the basic gaming mechanic as well as some first artworks are ready. So stay tuned for more updates.\u003cbr\u003e"
