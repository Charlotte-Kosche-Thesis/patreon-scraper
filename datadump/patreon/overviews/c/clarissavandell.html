Rowling, who have inspired me to not just write, but to be confident in my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing seriously since 2007, and I\u0027ve got several stories and ideas in the works that I can\u0027t wait to publish and share with the world.\u00a0 But I want to show people exactly what kind of writer I am, and hopefully provide some examples of my work. That way YOU, dear readers, can help me become a better writer that\u0027s worthy of being paid for my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to see an example of my work before committing to being a patron, some examples of my writing are on Wattpad: https://www.wattpad.com/user/clarissavandell.\u00a0 I\u0027m always looking for readers and feedback, so please don\u0027t feel like you\u0027re intruding if you send me an email or PM me - I love feedback, as long as it\u0027s constructive criticism at worst and flattering praise at best.\u00a0 With your help, I can share my stories with readers like you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support, and have a wonderful day!"
