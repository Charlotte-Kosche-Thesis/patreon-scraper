We do this with the help of our Patrons - whose contributions make it possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn our first series, beginning on 9 October 2017 we tell 20 stories of social change across 10 episodes. It\u2019s an ambitious project. For just this series we have done 150 interviews, covering stories from 14 countries, ten of which we have visited in person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach episode has a theme covering two stories \u2013 one week you are in Moscow hearing about anti-Putin activists then you jump to Standing Rock. The next week you are in South Africa learning about its student movement, then you jump to the refugee movement in Australia.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe aim to show that change is possible by drawing out the lessons from the stories we tell, so together we can learn from other people\u2019s successes and failures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe host Amanda Tattersall is a seasoned ChangeMaker. She co-founded \u003ca href=\"http://getup.org.au/\"\u003eGetUp.org.au\u003c/a\u003e Australia\u2019s Premier digital campaigning organisation, and founded the Sydney Alliance a massive coalition across civil society built in her home city.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project is huge to say the least and that is why we need a hand getting to the finish line. \u00a0Become a Patreon today and you will help us keep telling stories, learning about change and making the world a better place.\u003cbr\u003e"
