I adore both of these jobs, and the amazingly creative people I am surrounded by at both.  Unfortunately, they are both nearly year round work with almost completely seasonal pay.  I do neither for money, simply for the love of the work and environment. \u00a0Another big reason is being able to bring others in to a world where they realize they aren\u0027t so alone in their weirdness.  Many, many years ago, a man I will never forget did that for me, and it is now my honor to pass that on to as many as I can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis\u00a0does, at times, mean struggle and sacrifice, which I have accepted. \u00a0However, as I begin to pursue my life-long dream of traditional publication, I know I will have less time for side jobs and thus began my journey down the rabbit hole that is Patreon. \u00a0My hope is to get enough that side projects don\u0027t have to consume so much of my time, allowing me to focus more on writing without having to sacrifice as much time with the important people in my life. \u00a0I am incredibly grateful for anything you can donate to help bring my dream to life. \u00a0Your donation could mean, a new toy for the cats, finally painting the awful beige walls of our kitchen, purchasing better word processing software and other tools of the trade. \u00a0Being able to afford to build my author website. \u00a0Best of all in my mind, it could mean extra time to spend with my husband and our families, both blood and chosen. \u00a0I promise to make it worth your while!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/mbpd2c.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
