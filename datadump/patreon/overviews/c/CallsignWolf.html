I\u0027m Justin, and this is my Patreon page for my YouTube Channel, \u003cem\u003eVideoGameAddict\u003c/em\u003e. I have been a creator on Youtube for several years now, working with titles such as ARMA, SuperHot, CounterStrike GO and many more. Youtube is not my full-time career though even though many assume it is. This is your opportunity to help my channel become full time, only as a full time creator can I produce more of the content you love.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been gaming for over 25 years now across an expansive variety of titles. I use that knowledge and experience to bring together the strongest and most constructive opinions about upcoming and newly released games. I strongly value my integrity as a creator\u00a0and if I can make it full time I will push that forward with new content and more of it. Not to mention the fact that I do all my own stunts...er.... Graphics!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://pcgamehaven.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/exile-mod-converted-lonesome-road-940x438.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have worked incredibly hard at my channel for the past 3-4 years but \u0027it\u0027s not enough\u0027. To go to the next level I can only do so with your help and support. What does it mean for you? It means: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRegular videos - minimum 4 per week\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA private monthly vlog ( \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eJUST FOR YOU\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e )\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTwo random game livestreams per week\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eQ\u0026amp;A livestreams for the US/UK/EU \u0026amp; NZ/AU timezones\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAll of this will be possible plus I can spend more time producing my videos which means better scripting, better editing and overall a higher end product for all of you watching. I will also offer extra rewards for the people who support me each month on Patreon such as a podcast, a live QA even credits on my videos, and access to the Patreon feed where you can hold discussion with me without the often negative environment of Youtube comments. (AKA Cancer...)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://cdn.wallpapersafari.com/66/34/UHzk09.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the price of a coffee you can support me every month and help me work freelance as a full time creator. If even half the viewers on an average video donated $1 that would hit my maximum goal. Imagine instead of 1 stream night, we had 2 or even 3 each week? I could create a real Tactical Gaming community where I host game nights through the week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.amazeemetrics.com/sites/default/files/youtube-analytics-overview.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this is possible... but only if I work on my channel full time. I cannot do that without your support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso let me be clear I am not looking for anyone to stretch themselves, I don\u0027t want people thinking every month, \"Hmm. I really can\u0027t afford to give this guy $10 this month.\" Then support me with just $1 or $2. This is really important because if I want the content I create to be a full time concern making it something you can afford every month is very important. What I want to achieve here is making this a valid professional living for me just as you would subscribe to any media content, so please choose the level of support that is affordable on a monthly basis. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way in which we consume entertainment and media is changing. 5 years ago I would regularly watch television and watch a few shows when I returned from work. Now I barely turn the thing on, because we do everything online we watch Youtube, Twitch, Netflix. We have streaming sites to enjoy the content we always did but all in one place. Creators of content on both Youtube and live streaming work at what they do because they are passionate about it, and there\u0027s nothing I am more passionate about than gaming. I live it every day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat content do I bring you as a channel? And why do I need your support?\u003cbr\u003eMy channel is focused around longer videos and not posting all of that hype content that turns off a lot of people, over time this has been resonating with my audience. I regularly have people telling me they want to hear my opinion on a new game. And because of that, that is what I bring with the channel is integrity and a promise that I will always tell you exactly what I think of a game as I have been doing for the past 3 years. I also work at producing longer content often editorials for you to enjoy, as this was exactly the content, I was looking for. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy channel demographic is predominantly males aged 18-50, it means the people I am reaching with my content are people much like myself with the same experience in games who enjoy a similar style of content. But I cannot do more, I cant go further without your support you can make this a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my channel now approaches 100 subscribers you might assume \u0027hey things are going well man. You must be making plenty of revenue from Youtube\u0027 right? Nope. This is a huge misconception. For some reason the majority of people who watch Youtube seem to have little understanding of just how revenue works. So let me break it down simply. \u003cbr\u003eThe way you earn revenue on Youtube is you get paid a small amount per thousand views, this is called CPM and generally its as low as say $2 per 1000 views. So that means if you make a video with 10,000 views you might get $20. I say might because if your viewers have ad block, or also dependent on the length of time they watch as well as other factors it may be less or a little more.\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the core of the issue though, despite the channel now just about to break 100 subs and my videos making on average between 100-1k views as a minimum my channel still only generates about $5/ \u00a34.09 \u00a0per month. Realistically speaking, if you want Youtube to be a full-time career your videos need to be bringing in over 50,000 views. Otherwise, it\u0027s just not feasible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite achieving these viewing figures, many larger creators bring in extra income via sponsorship or attending events- most of which aren\u0027t declared. With your support, I would never have to worry about that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoes all this mean that a smaller channel just shouldn\u0027t be full time? Not at all.\u003cbr\u003eThere are many channels some smaller than mine which are funded by their audience because its not just about the size of a channel its about what you provide. I think that the content I create often does not appeal to a mass audience but it does appeal strongly to a smaller userbase. This is why I avoid posting videos about weapons or reading every press release. I would rather look at issues that matter to me and I feel are important and sometimes not spoken about enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat my subscribers value the most are the discussions I create, the integrity I bring and my strength of opinion on gaming issues. You can help to make my channel full time, enabling me to work even harder putting out more content every week and no longer will I have to say the words \u0027I wish I could but I just don\u0027t have the time\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration and support! Hope to see you guys soon!\u003cbr\u003e"
