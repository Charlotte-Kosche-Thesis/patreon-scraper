    "summary": "Hi Patrons! My name is \u003cstrong\u003eCynthia Tran\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m an advocate for the expression and comfortability within one\u0027s body and the connection between that and the earth that we inhibit. Creating this is a way to motivate myself, perhaps other people out there too, that it\u0027s completely natural and beautiful to be confident with the skin that we were born with in a perspective which nudity\n\u003cem\u003e is \u003c/em\u003ea part of nature. I used to be very insecure and self criticizing, as I naively believed that my beauty was solely based on others\u0027 perspective, not bothering to take my own into consideration. Through experiences and life encounters, especially now being a mother, I\u0027ve come to acknowledge that beauty is simply in the eye of the beholder. I\u0027ve finally learned to embrace this temple that is my own and I hope to spread the same message to others. Respect it, cherish the sacredness that we all embody. My work is supposed to target the one topic that makes certain people uncomfortable or flustered, and turn it into something so simplistic and naturally displayed that it becomes nothing but of social norm, just as with everything we are exposed with daily to the point that we forget it is even there.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere you will find an extensive amount of work that I do not release publicly. I will be uploading full sets from some of my favorite sessions. My work is composed of mainly fine arts nudity and I\u0027ve excluded censorship for the full grasp of aesthetic and composition. There will be images of models I\u0027ve had the pleasure to work with, alongside with self portraits that I\u0027ve created myself. Apart from fine arts, you will find updates on my travels, places I\u0027ve been, and the people I\u0027ve encountered. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is a display of my art and ambitions, but also will be a digital, daily reminder for myself to be happy in knowing that I am creating and doing something to connect myself with others in a sense that I would never have been able to if I didn\u0027t delve into the hidden parts of me that I\u0027m truly passionate about. Apart from consistently being an activist for feminine empowerment through photographs, I will also be releasing videos and other side projects that I hope to achieve through this format of gathering likeminded individuals to be interested in my art work... just enough for me to have a bigger budget in doing bigger projects. It\u0027s constantly a strive for artists and photographers alike to be able to afford the vast and expansive ideas that constantly boggle around in our minds everyday.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI heard of the tremendous amount of support that Patreon has offered to all artists out there, so I am here to leave a piece of myself within the community, only hoping that I find people that love the things I do as much as I love doing it. If you pledge to me, I guarantee that not only will I try my best to offer content that is worth your time and effort, but also that it will be motivating me to only spread my wings a little farther and branch out to other abstract forms of creativity, fine arts, nudity, and photography that I wouldn\u0027t have bothered to attempt doing if you guys weren\u0027t in my life. :)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFeel free to find me on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/cynthiadtran\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/cynthiadtran\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/cynthiadtran\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e."
