    "summary": "Hello, I\u0027m Chase! I make art and cosplay here on this page. I\u0027ll be making complete cosplays every few months and will be making art every month. For art, there will be small sketches each week and a major project each month. There will be WIP posts over the course of the month for the major art piece and I\u0027ll try and utilize the various art programs and artist tools that I have. For cosplay, there will be progress updates as I make the various aspects of the cosplay (the costume, wig, props, etc) as well as photos of the cosplay as a whole once finished. Eventually, there may be professional photoshoots, as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u00a0How my rewards will work:\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. \u003c/strong\u003eEach month there will be one major illustration/artwork with WIPs of the art work throughout the month. The medium will vary between digital and traditional. These will be posted with a water mark for patrons and will be sent out to patrons without a water mark through your messages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.\u003c/strong\u003e Each month, there will be several sketches posted. I will try to have at least one per week. These will be posted with small water marks. These will be posted publicly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3.\u003c/strong\u003e Every quarter (3 months), I will make a cosplay and post WIPs throughout that period. I will post the full costume exclusively for patrons initially, then release it to the public. Constructive criticism and helpful advice is always welcome for any part of costuming and prop making. Eventually, there will be some tutorials for wigs, props, costuming parts, etc. as well as some behind the scenes/outtakes for patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.\u003c/strong\u003e There will be polls for what cosplay to do next. I have an extensive wish list of characters that I wish do to, so I\u0027ll put up 3-4 characters before the end of the quarter to decide what direction to go in. These will be public polls, but patron votes will count for double. I will not take suggestions for cosplays outside of the characters that I have posted for polls.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0There will be a Discord sever set up, which has a few patron-only channels and a lot of general channels to chat in. I have already installed the Patreon bot and installed a general bot for the channel. The Discord link it\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/sMky9rR\"\u003eright here\u003c/a\u003e, but if there are any issue, please let me know. And if you are joining through the link and are a patron, please let me know and I will update your role to a patron for access to the patron-only spaces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6.\u003c/strong\u003e I will eventually make videos and do live steams for cosplay and art. I can also do some reviews for materials (mainly for art supplies/programs) in the future. Future live steams will be pretty lax and may include playing video games for some down time if I can manage it on my computer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e7.\u003c/strong\u003e Some months there will be a theme between the art (the main piece and the sketches) and some times between the art and the cosplay (same anime/video game/show/etc.), but don\u0027t regularly expect this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e8.\u003c/strong\u003e For cosplays, I will also upload my cosplay plans. These are little notes that I have written for myself along with small rough doodles on the paper to help with planning out different cosplays. Anything from planning how to do the wig to what kind of fabric I should use to planning out props. I\u0027ll combine images from the same cosplay notes. This will help you guys get a feel for how I plan things out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e9.\u003c/strong\u003e I have posted a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/18758281\"\u003ecosplay list\u003c/a\u003e if you would like to see what year I cosplayed something and what con, initially. I also have added in any award that I have won throughout the years. I will add onto this when I make new cosplays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually I will be able to make some merchandise to ship out to you guys, but that won\u0027t be for a while. I may just start off with thank you cards as that may be easiest and I have a ton of card stock that I\u0027ve been hoarding for use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u00a0Some rules to follow:\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI WILL NOT MAKE ANYTHING NSFW.\u003c/strong\u003e This includes any art work and cosplay that I will do in the future. There may be cosplays or art where there is some skin showing, but there will be nothing lewd/nsfw posted here or anywhere else. Figure studies are exempt from this due to the inherent nature of figure studies since they are not meant to be lewd/nsfw.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI reserve the right to block any individual at any time. I will only block individuals for harassment, bullying, spam, etc. I also will block if I see any individual sharing patron only content to a different website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatron content is for patrons and patrons alone. It is not here for redistribution or for any one to sell on their own site.

You will be charged once a month and you can switch between patron tiers or leave at any time, if you\u0027d like.

They\u0027ll also be helpful in getting better art materials and better fabric and making better props. I will be transparent in where the money also goes each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3.\u003c/strong\u003e To start off, there won\u0027t be any themes for the upcoming months and it\u0027ll just be whatever I happen to want to draw. Eventually I\u0027ll post art with themes, like from a specific series or based around elements or some such. These will not be voted for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.\u003c/strong\u003e Rewards will be sent out toward the end of the month or the beginning of the next month via your patreon inbox.

E.g. If I had bought a piece for a specific cosplay from Amazon, I would give the Amazon link or if I bought from/commissioned a cosplayer for a piece, I would link back to the cosplayer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0Social media!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThese are the different things that I run that are related to my art and cosplay.

The camera will be used primarily for cosplay and some art when I draw traditionally and the tablet will be dedicated solely to art projects. Since I currently have a tablet (a small Wacom Bamboo pen tablet that they don\u0027t sell anymore through the main site), the camera would take precedent. This money will be used in combination of my own earned money from my job as to soften the blow if something comes out more money than expected.",
