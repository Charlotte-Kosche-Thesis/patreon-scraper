The idea was simple, I wanted to work with Artists and Graphic designers, taking their favourite designs and artwork and printing them onto a T-Shirt.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe idea is that by doing this, I can support the artist, create an awesome looking T-Shirt and I can offer any potential customers a unique, limited edition T-Shirt.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI only print 50 of each Design, this means that when I say limited, I mean limited. You won\u0027t see droves of people wearing the same thing as you, and you can be part of a community that supports creativity.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can browse our range of T-Shirts by\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.collaborativeclothing.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eclicking here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\"The Chari-Tee Campaign\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://s349.photobucket.com/user/collaborativeclothing/media/Chari-Tee_zpsor4ylngo.jpeg.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q365/collaborativeclothing/Chari-Tee_zpsor4ylngo.jpeg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOn October 9th 2016, I launched the \"Chari-Tee\" campaign.
