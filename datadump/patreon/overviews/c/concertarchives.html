As many of you know, Concert Archives is a personal labor of love for me. I originally started building the site in November of 2013 as a way to catalog all of the concerts I attended and as an attempt to coax my friends into uploading their photos from the shows :)\u003ca name=\"whatschanged\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, over 4 years later, some things have changed but a lot remain the same: \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch4\u003eWhat\u2019s Changed?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\t\u003col\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe biggest thing that has changed is how big the site has gotten!\u003c/strong\u003e When I launched it, the only users were me and a couple of friends. Now there are thousands of users building their own concert histories, sharing their amazing stories, and posting photos from hundreds of thousands of concerts. And Google keeps sending a bunch of new visitors everyday.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003ca name=\"whatssame\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eAnother thing that\u0027s changed has been pretty gradual. My vision for the site has broadened in some ways. I now look at it almost like Discogs.com but for concerts. Users create their own concert histories (like record collections on Discogs) and all of us together create a comprehensive tour history and library of concert photos/videos for artists (like album discographies on Discogs). It\u2019s really an amazing thing to watch.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003c/ol\u003e\n\t\u003ch4\u003eWhat\u2019s The Same?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\t\u003col\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003e I still have the same passion for the concert experience and believe that \u003cstrong\u003econcerts should live on long after the house lights come back up\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003ca name=\"upsdowns\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m still an army-of-one working on Concert Archives.\u003c/strong\u003e I do all of the website development, design, and maintenance. I answer all the support requests. I also pay for all of the ongoing server costs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003c/ol\u003e\n\t\u003ch4\u003eThe Ups and Downs\u003c/h4\u003e\n\tWhile it\u0027s been super exciting to see the visitor numbers grow, \n\t\u003cstrong\u003ethe server costs have grown as well\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0For a long time, I resisted putting ads on the website in order to keep a pristine user-experience. A couple of years ago, I added the ability for users to donate to help cover the server costs, but that wasn\u0027t very successful. I\u0027m super appreciative of the folks who donated (about 20 of you) and thank you again! Unfortunately that wasn\u0027t enough to really make a dent in the monthly server costs.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter a couple years of paying hundreds of dollars out of my own pocket every month, I found myself getting really demotivated and resentful about the site.\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e Around that same time, a couple of companies reached out about buying Concert Archives. I was really burned out so the idea of getting the site off of my plate and moving on seemed really attractive. The acquisition talks lasted for a few months and, as often happens, eventually fizzled out. That was pretty much rock bottom for my outlook on the site.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nI realized that I needed to figure out how to get re-energized about Concert Archives or just put it to bed. Coincidentally, around that same time, I decided to finally put some banner ads on a few of the most popular pages as an experiment. The ads didn\u0027t do amazing, but they started making a few dollars per day. All of the sudden, I could see a path to making Concert Archives self sustaining if I could figure out how to increase the ad revenue a little bit and if I could reduce the server costs a little bit. \n\t\u003cstrong\u003eAnd that was really motivating.\u003c/strong\u003e I spent a couple of weeks working on site performance improvements that ended up making the site much faster and even about 35% cheaper to run! And then I found a new ad network that basically doubled the ad revenue!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nThe site is just barely making money, but for the first time in over 4 years, it\u0027s no longer costing me hundreds of dollars every month.\n\t\u003ca name=\"whypatreon\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eHaving that burden lifted has been huge! I realized that the mental burden it was causing was even bigger than the financial burden. I\u2019ve been a lot more motivated and a lot more excited about the site and have just released a redesign and the biggest updates since I launched it back in 2014!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nWhich is a perfect segue to talk about Patreon\u2026\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch4\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003e\nThe purpose for creating a Patreon campaign for Concert Archives is twofold:\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003col\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003e I\u0027ve realized that in order to make Concert Archives a sustainable site for the long term and for me to be able to keep dedicating myself to it, it needs to make money every month and not be a financial/mental burden.\u00a0And Patreon can facilitate that.\u003ca name=\"conclusion\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003eAs the user base has grown, I\u0027ve wanted a way to better connect with the users (that\u0027s you guys!).
