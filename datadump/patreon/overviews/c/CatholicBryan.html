I cans till remember walking into the middle of a huge field and sitting near a 150 foot steel cross which towered up into the blue sky. With tears in my eyes and a burning love in my heart, I remember asking God \nto allow me to heal people the way He had healed me,\n to help people the way He had helped me, and to have others encounter Him in a life-transforming way as I had. In short, I looked into the world for the first time and myriads of broken, hurting, lost, confused, and spiritually dead people who were crying for help. At this point my ministry was born, and I desired to bring Christ\u0027s light, love, and truth to as many people as possible. This\n is why my ministry exists!

Who is not concerned about that? Many of these teens are not even sure if God even exists, if Jesus was real, or why the Church is relevant. Mirroring our culture, their skepticism and cynicism intensifies daily. Look around! Our churches are closing and merging, there is a severe lack of priests and religious sisters. In my diocese alone, 80% of the deacons are 68 or older and 90% of the nuns are 80 or older. Polls reveal that Catholics are at the bottom for passing on their faith which is why when we look around, where are all the young people? People are leaving the church in droves, we are not being engaged, and there is a mass confusion.

Your support of $50-$150 a month will help to create a solid and effective outreach platform from which this ministry can operate to save souls, change lives, reach, train, equip, and inspire. Of course, if you would like to jump into the deep end and invest more, it is welcome. More financial goals that are met means more souls being reached. Conversely, if the amount above is too much, feel free to give what you can. Scripture says to give generously but according to your means.\u00a0 Perhaps $35, $25, or even $15 a month would be more doable. We don\u0027t just want money, we want YOU!\u00a0 We desire for people who believe in this mission, realize its importance, and want to make a difference in whatever way they can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJESUS NEEDED SUPPORT TOO!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eDid you know that the Lord Jesus and His Apostles needed continually support too?

This includes believers and unbelievers. So, the goal is to create\na vast library of educational and inspirational YouTube videos on a whole plethora of topics including: Love and relationships, prayer and spirituality; apologetics and evangelization, the existence of God and deep questions of faith, culture, society, and more. This is huge.

They do. My first book, \"Why Do You Believe in God\" offers proof for God\u0027s existence, and answers other deep questions of faith. Recently, a 4-foot something 7th grader bought my book and devoured it in two days. A high school girl also read my book three times in order to memorize the arguments and defend her faith. This is happening in the lives of teens and adults everywhere, and this will surely prevent them from losing their faith in our modernistic and atheistic culture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne reason people are leaving the church in droves is because they have not receiving answers to their good questions and objections. No one has ever told them why God is important and life-changing or why the Catholic faith is relevant. Thus, they go and search for answers elsewhere. These books will not only keep people from leaving the Church but will bring people back to the church. If you doubt that I am a go-getter, I am working on 6 books right now and have more books and smaller booklets in mind.

A fully-funded ministry will enable and allow me to continue cultivating and fostering these ever important Catholic communities which are the bedrock of our church and our individual faith journeys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eIMAGES\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e AND TESTIMONIALS:\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.catholicbryan.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Speaking-Veritas.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e Speaking to hundreds of teens at Camp Veritas\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\"This was the best retreat of my life!\u00a0 I\u0027m so glad I had the opportunity \nto experience this!!

I see a therapist.  \nBut, today at the end of the retreat\nwhen we prayed, everything was taken out of me. I gave it all over to \nJesus my\nLord and Savior and I haven\u2019t been happier in my entire life. My low \nself-esteem is gone I feel like nothing bad is there. At that prayer \nservice, unlike\nany other time, I prayed really hard just to let Jesus inside of me and \nhe came\nthrough. I\u2019m just so happy.

In turn, we are all called to tithe or give back to Him in different amounts, in different way, and in different places according to our means. If you feel God calling you to partner with our ministry, then please see the different giving tiers (to the right on computers and the section above on phones).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ask everyone to consider giving between $75-$250 a month toward this mission. If you can more or cannot give that much, please join our team to save souls and change lives at whatever amount you can. That is between you and God. After all, it\u0027s His ministry He is calling me to. To reach our goals, we do need many generous ministry partners who invest at least $50, $75, $100, $150, $200, or more a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis does not have to be \u003cem\u003ein addition\u003c/em\u003e to your tithing but can \u003cem\u003ebe\u003c/em\u003e your tithing, your giving back to God. Some like to give to their local church while others do not. Some prefer to give to missionary organizations, and others choose a combination of both. So, please pray and ask God if this is the ministry He would like you to invest in and how much He would like you to give each month. That way, you can be assured that you are joining in the work of God that He has called us too, and that you are becoming part of a ministry to save souls and change lives that is much bigger than yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany Catholics would like to do more for God and to feel like they are making a difference in this world. Joining this mission is a great way to join in the fight for souls and to help make a difference. Your financial support coupled with prayers and other aids will create a strong foundation to make a big difference in the lives of those who believe and in the lives of those tho don\u0027t, those who live in darkness, and those who live in the light, now and in the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will the money go to? We are starting a non-profit organization currently for this ministry. While most positions will be volunteer, there will be some paid positions. You will also allow me to to the full-time ministry work that God has called me to. You will enable much missionary work to be done, along with helping us to buy supplies, do marketing and advertising, have free book giveaways, buying better YouTube studios: cameras, lighting, sound equipment, and faster rendering and processing computers, etc. You will also allow us to reach many teens and parishes who don\u0027t have the money for retreats or speakers... and so much more. In short, everything we need to make this ministry as effective as possible and to reach as many souls as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis first goal pays the very basic expenses.\u003cbr\u003e",
