    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my Patreon Page! My name is Christina Grace Mastrangelo (\u003ca href=\"http://www.christinamastrangelo.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.christinamastrangelo.com\u003c/a\u003e) and I\u0027m a classically trained painter. I studied in Europe at the Angel Academy of Art in Florence, Italy from 2006-2009, and have been pursuing this career ever since. I\u0027ve learned a TON about what it takes to live the life of a professional artist and would love to share some of that with you on this amazing platform! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe there is endless freedom in knowing the foundations of painting and drawing.\u00a0If you subscribe to this page you will have access to knowledge gained through studying under a strong lineage of master painters. There is a lot of misguided information on the internet about painting- this platform is a hub of researched knowledge, all in one place, for all types of artists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee inside the studio and classroom, learning from exclusive Patreon photos, podcast, videos, and Q\u0026amp;A opportunities. Click my \"posts\" page to preview the free video (on oil painting materials) and podcast (About the Artist) before you sign up! Scroll all the way down to view it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour subscription will help fund a large multiple-figure painting series that I am in the midst of creating. It has been slow going because hiring so many models for so long is expensive. Your pledge will go directly towards funding this project, and in addition to the regular posts, I will share images of the project as it unfolds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, by choosing to become a patron, you will be able to:\u003cbr\u003e-watch up-close drawing \u0026amp; painting tutorials on a variety of subjects\u003cbr\u003e-see step-by-step images of work from conception to finish\u003cbr\u003e-learn about the tools and techniques of the trade as taught in the European ateliers\u003cbr\u003e-have access to\u00a0information about the art business\u003cbr\u003e-get advice on anything and everything involved in pursuing this path\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-listen to podcasts that explore the life of a painter and get loads of knowledge. This has been my career since 2009 and there\u0027s a lot to know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe possibilities are endless and I\u0027m so excited to get this going!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the multiple figure series, I\u0027m currently working on some landscapes, a few flower paintings, a couple portraits, and a still life. There\u0027s a plethora of information to be gathered from watching over the shoulder of an artist and I invite you to join me in the studio and follow along with me on this awesome journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more information about my work (see what I do!!) and resume, visit my website at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.christinamastrangelo.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.christinamastrangelo.com\u003c/a\u003e and my Instagram at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/christina_mastrangelo_artwork/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echristina_mastrangelo_artwork\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so glad you stopped by and thank you for your interest!\u003cbr\u003e"
