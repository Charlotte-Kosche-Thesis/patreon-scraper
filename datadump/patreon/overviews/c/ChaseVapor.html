    "summary": "Chase Vapor is a story anyone can enjoy, but it\u0027s story FOR geeks,\n most specifically kids who don\u0027t know they\u0027re geeks yet. Being a geek \nor nerd or whatever your preferred nomenclature is, can be a hard sad \nlonely time. The world isn\u0027t kind to people who don\u0027t fit in, especially\n when you\u0027re young. Weirdness is seldom treated as the commodity that it\n should be. As a weird young kid whose brain was full of \u0027What ifs\u0027 Star\n Trek was the perfect show. Every episode was a \u0027What if\u0027 with a mystery\n and a moral conundrum thrown in, and ultimately a franchise about good \npeople struggling to figure out what the right thing to do is. A \nuniverse where you could be a large gruff crinkly headed alien, and \nstill have a ship full of friends who respected you, or a morphing glob \nof goo who solved crimes and was uncomfortable in social situations, but\n still got invited to them. And like any space faring sci-fi show, it \ngave you the stars. No matter how bad your day was you just had to wait \n\u0027til nightfall and look up. To a geek the night sky is no mere black \ncurtain with holes poked in it, every star becomes an adventure just \nwaiting to be imagined. The outcast, picked \non, left out kids of the world need that. The opportunity to turn a \nspeck of distant light into a spark of magic. That spark can turn you \nfrom feeling like a loser, to chasing the dream of becoming an \nastronomer, or an engineer, or an astronaut, or a doctor, or if you\u0027re \nvery unlucky a writer. It is vitally important that the next generation \nbelieve that they can save the world just like Chase, because they will \nvery likely need to. Right now there is a child sitting somewhere \nfeeling left out cause she isn\u0027t really into the pink princess doll she \ngot for Christmas, or feeling confused because no one the same color as \nhim ever seems to save the day in any of the shows he watches. Give them\n Chase Vapor, Chase Vapor will give them the stars.\""
