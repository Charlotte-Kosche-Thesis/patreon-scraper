     "about": "I could say that \u201cthe HuntFishTravel Podcast was created out of the need for quality podcasts in a hunting and fishing culture that was lacking them\u201d.  But let\u2019s face it, that\u2019s not really the case at all.\u003cbr\u003eQuite simply, the podcast was born out of my personal need for knowledge, I always want to be a better hunter or fisherman, the guests I interview are people I genuinely want to learn from.  I enjoy chatting with them about their respective expertise.\u003cbr\u003eIt also gives me another outlet for my own articles and topics.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I very much enjoy being a writer, I\u2019m very good at it, but in a world of 181 million blogs I needed a way to stand out from the crowd.\u003cbr\u003eThere are currently 115,000 podcasts in the ITunes database, I would be willing to bet a full 1/3 are old or obsolete.\u003cbr\u003eAnd out of the 2/3 remaining, how many are hunting/fishing/outdoor related?  500?  Maybe 1,000.\u003cbr\u003eAs many as 40% of Americans listen to digital media which is projected to double by 2016 and 45% of Americans report knowing what a podcast is.\u003cbr\u003eSo my exposure in this media outlet is much greater than my exposure as a blogger.\u003cbr\u003eI got my start in the outdoor industry with BowCast, a now defunct archery niche podcast and website.  During my time with them I learned a ton about podcasts and podcasting.\u003cbr\u003eThat podcast was always one of the most professionally produced podcasts in its heyday (literally, they had a professional sound guy that they paid to put the show together every week) and I do strive to emulate that professionalism.\u003cbr\u003eBut I would say the best thing I learned from working with Aneal and Anthony as hosts of BowCast was to think outside the box.  To refuse to conform to what others think my podcast should be.\u003cbr\u003eThis has led to some really great guest interviews over the years.  I too am always learning and always want to learn.  So I tend to invite guests on the show that I personally will take something away from the conversation.  I\u2019m not really all that interested in having a guest on because in doing so their fans will then be exposed to my show.  It makes no difference if they have 50 followers or 50,000; if they can teach me tips on how to be a better hunter, I want to talk to them.\u003cbr\u003eThe show will always be evolving as new technology and software become available.  And I think that\u2019s a good thing.  I will always strive to be better, to put out a better show and to provide the listener with a show they want to listen to.\u003cbr\u003eRecently I was honored to receive an award for Episode 109 \u201c\u003ca href=\"http://traffic.libsyn.com/outdoorpodcastchannel/HFTEp109.mp3\"\u003eFishing for Salmon on Kodiak Island in Alaska\u003c/a\u003e\u201c.\u003cbr\u003eHuntFishTravel is the first podcast to win an Award in Craft with the Association of Great Lakes Outdoor Writers in the Radio category.\u003cbr\u003eMost of all I\u2019m having fun with it. I don\u2019t stress over the format or guests, I don\u2019t stress about numbers or download counts or timetables or schedules.  It makes no difference if 1,000 listen to an episode or 10, because those 10 are just as important as 1,000.  It\u2019s a very relaxed and informative environment and I hope that comes through.\u003cbr\u003eHappy listening!\u003cbr\u003e",
