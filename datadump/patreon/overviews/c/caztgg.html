In all\nseriousness, the main goal behind this Patreon is to help make my YouTube\nchannel a sustainable part-time, if not, full-time job while improving the overall\nquality of my work.  This is not a\ndream:  It\u0027s a goal, and every bit of\nsupport helps contribute to achieving that.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s say I say yes. \u00a0Where is it going?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eThe majority will be put towards improving\nproduction values and introducing a greater variety of video content; one of the planed projects is to have a weekly or bi-weekly podcast covering (mostly) gaming \u0026amp; gaming-related news along with consistently streaming every month or so.\u00a0 In addition,\u00a0 some of the funding will go towards obtaining more obscure systems and games that are\nhard to come by on said systems in order to cover them.\u00a0 Should it ever reaches a high enough threshold, i\u0027ll even be able hire an\neditor so that videos will be out more frequently.  Editing is by far the most time-consuming\npart of the process, and I can\u0027t pay anyone to make myself write or record\nthings faster to speed up the other steps it involves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn addition, I plan to up the\namount of written content I produce while keeping up the standard quality i\u0027ve\ndisplayed in the past, namely with more written reviews and shorter editorial-esque\ncontent. As an example of what to expect, here is an in-depth piece on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://screwattack.com/post/51230842\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe character of Soleil and the problem with how Fire Emblem If treats her\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoes this mean that you\u0027re...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eNo.  The content I make will always be free to\nwatch, regardless of whether or not you choose to support me.  I want to make this very clear since as\nsomeone who genuinely loves writing and making videos, I fully understand the\nconcern that may arise from a creator adopting the Patreon model, especially\nsince not everyone may be able to support them via Patreon. \u00a0Regardless of the platform of which I release\nmy various written and video work in the future, I can promise you that this is\nsomething that will never change. \u00a0To end this with something I\nnormally wouldn\u0027t ask of my viewership, even if you can\u0027t support me or any\nother content creators, please share our work with friends, family, anyone who\nyou think would like what they do. \u00a0As\nmentioned earlier, every bit of support helps, so sharing your favorite content\ncreators goes a heartwarming and long way in terms of aiding their goals. \u00a0If not, please continue to enjoy what\u0027s here and\nwhat\u0027s to come in the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nUntil next time, game on my\nfriends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n\n-Caz\u003c/div\u003e"
