    "summary": "Thanks for checking out the page and for signing up for The Spags Email. A lot of people have said \"Hey Spags, I\u0027ve noticed you\u0027re churning out all this great content and I really don\u0027t want you to have to pimp yourself out to truck drivers at rest stops to bankroll your life. How can I support The Spags Email?\" And that\u0027s a great question namely because it doesn\u0027t involve me getting mouth herpes from a man with swamp ass named Cletus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is the easiest way to support The Spags Email while I try to turn it into an actual worthwhile media venture for readers and myself. And more importantly contributing to this makes you a trendsetter. Someone who doesn\u0027t wait for others. But really you\u0027re helping me find ways to bring you more content and start to build this into an actual business instead of just a dream of doing something different in media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything about the email, including my promise to reply to each and every email I get from someone signing up, is free and will stay free. But now you can get more and help support me as I build this Spags Email into something we\u0027ll all enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s what your money will go to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Our email and website providers, whose costs go up with every signup\u003cbr\u003e-Promoting The Spags Email to new audiences to help it grow (this is a HUGE part of it, the more I can invest in growing our subscribers, the better the content can get)\u003cbr\u003e-Eventually hiring other people to create things or help sell things and promote things\u003cbr\u003e-Merch that\u0027s tasteful and comfortable because lord knows we need more people selling merch online\u003cbr\u003e-Feeding me, my dogs, and my weed habit that helps create such stellar content\u003cbr\u003e-Podcasts, videos, and whatever else you could dream of. But the writing comes first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all starts with the email but as things grow and we hopefully pick up support, there\u0027s no limit to what this can be.\u003cbr\u003e"
