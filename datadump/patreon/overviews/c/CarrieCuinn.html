I\u0027d love to say I\u0027ll use these funds to buy a cup of coffee so that I can sit in a cafe and write without them kicking me out. I\u0027d like to spend it on a sitter who\u0027s trained to care for my son and his special needs, so I can leave the house to write once in a while -- which I haven\u0027t been able to do consistently for a few years.\u00a0The truth is, those are my goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNow\u003c/em\u003e though, this Patreon helps me to pay bills, and feed my son. With a little less stress over whether our power will be shut off or if we\u0027ve had dinner that day, I can find a little more energy to focus on this work. With your support, I\u0027m better able write something new.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd in exchange, you\u0027ll get new stories I\u0027ve written just for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor every $50 per month this Patreon raises, I will share at least 500 words of fiction not seen anywhere else. At the $50 level, this means a 500-word micro fiction, a complete story told in a handful of words. (When we reach $100, I\u0027ll share a 1000 word flash story, for $150, I\u0027ll share a new 1500 word story, and so on.) After we reach $300, I\u0027ll be able to start recording myself reading these stories, and only you will have access to those audio files.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, you\u0027ll get \u003cem\u003eexclusive access\u003c/em\u003e to posts on my writing process, thoughts about my current projects, and other writing-related notes that you won\u0027t find anywhere else. PLUS larger support tiers get one-of-a-kind hand crafted cards and zines featuring my fiction, thoughts, art, and more... multiple times a year. You definitely won\u0027t find that anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou you\u0027re new to my writing, you can check out what else I\u0027ve published at:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://carriecuinn.com/fiction/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://carriecuinn.com/fiction/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(New to Patreon? Please note that you can pledge as little as $1, or as much as you like. You can choose specific rewards, or give whatever amount you\u0027re comfortable with. You will be charged on the 1st of each month. Everyone\u0027s pledges are added together to reach the monthly goals. So, a little help really can go a long way!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU!
