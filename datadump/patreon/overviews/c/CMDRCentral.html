    "summary": "Hello and welcome to CMDR Central (Commander Central)!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery week we aim to bring our Tier 1.5 advice and our Tier 2 opinions to make\nyou a better Commander / EDH player.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWho are we you ask?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re just three guys from Eau Claire Wisconsin who love\nplaying Commander / EDH.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDana has been playing since revised and then took a break for a long time finally\ncoming back around Return to Ravnica. Out of everyone Dana builds the most\nthematic decks of us all. (See his Deathtouch Tribal Deck). Besides co-hosting\nCMDR Central, Dana writes the \u201cIn the Margins\u201d series over at EDHRec.com. While\nat our LGS you can usually find Dana playing his Reki History of Kamigawa or\nIsperia, Supreme Judge deck.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMax has been playing since Innistrad block. After a few\nshort weeks of 60 card kitchen table magic, he opened his mind to the world of\nEDH and hasn\u2019t turned back. \u003cbr\u003e\nWhile at the LGS, Max is typically piloting his Brago, King Eternal or\nDragonlord Dromoka Decks. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eChris played from Invasion Block all the way to Futuresight.\nAfter a break he jumped back into the game just in time for Theros Block. Out\nof all of us Chris is the \u201call around\u201d player, being competitive in Standard,\nLimited, but most importantly Modern.  Chris\ncan be described as the aggro player of the bunch, even if it means he dies\njust to make sure you don\u2019t win. When at the LGS, Chris will play anything you\nwant, but when it comes to Commander / EDH he\u2019ll pilot his Alesha, Who Smiles\nat Death deck all night long.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhy listen to us?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWell as we said earlier, we bring you Tier\n1.5 advice accompanied by our Tier 2 opinions. But really, together the three\nof us have played together almost every week for the last 5 years. And over\nthose five years we think we\u2019ve learned a lot about the game. So we want to\nshare our experiences, thoughts, and theories with you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEach week we bring you our thoughts on topics such as the color pie, how to\nintroduce players to Commander / EDH, deck techs, and overall game play strategies. But before that we\nalways talk about the games we played. We want you to feel like you are a\nmember of our meta. So we break down the sweet plays, awesome wins, and idiotic\nplay mistakes of our games that week.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFinally we just want to say thank you. Thank you for spending an hour or so\nevery week listening to us speak our mind on the game we love. \u003cbr\u003e"
