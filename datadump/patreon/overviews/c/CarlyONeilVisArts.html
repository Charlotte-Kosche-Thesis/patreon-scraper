Cinema was the sentence; photography was the word. Overall I rather enjoy this limitation that photography brings- the open-ended-ness of just one word. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I was now wanting to express was more complicated- more complex, and something rooted deep within me and tied very closely to my identity as a dancer and musician. Something only movement and pacing and sudden stops could satisfy. It even illustrated the causation of my boredom with self-portraiture as a photographer. I wanted to speak sentences- not words. Words were easy. Paragraphs carefully constructed of perfected words was where the challenge lay. And where I plan to follow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
