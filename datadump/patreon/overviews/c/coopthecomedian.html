I want to keep pursuing comedy everyday since I believe this is the industry I belong in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been pursuing many goals while adding something to my broadcasting background. I would first like to write \u0026amp; understand as much comedy as possible. I enjoy writing scripts \u0026amp; directing television shows, while enjoying the freedom of exercising my brain with laughter.\u003cbr\u003eI also want to make an act strong enough to start performing at any venue. I have always had a passion for being an MC, doing voice overs \u0026amp; acting improv, so I would have no problem with trying out all sorts of styles to make a great act. With my broadcasting background, I\u2019ve always wanted to create one man shows. This means I can use my writing creativity, stage design \u0026amp; directing all together. Once I am finish with one act, I would start working on a new one.\u003cbr\u003eOne of the most important things I\u2019d like to accomplish in comedy is to be a better person each \u0026amp; every day. Comedy is a form of therapy for me \u0026amp; I hope to make a difference on people in a positive way while pursuing my career in comedy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am using Patreon because I want to afford pursuing a second job I enjoy doing, while keeping my family safe. I\u0027ve been doing volunteer work and have lived all across Canada for 15 years, and I want to start affording to live.\u00a0I\u0027m scared that doing things for free is not helping me succeed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you become a Patreon, you\u0027ll have access to rewards, including my Discord channel, early access to special announcements, unlimited access to my recorded sets and open mics and you\u0027ll get to be in my Facebook writing group, which includes my closest friends and other comedians testing out jokes before using them on stage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for those who have been supporting me along my journey.\u003cbr\u003e"
