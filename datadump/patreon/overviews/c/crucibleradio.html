We\u0027re the podcast that aims to win and have fun doing it by bringing our listeners a high quality show full of advice, tips, interviews with top players, personal stories of success and growth, and a few bad jokes here and there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCR features regular interviews from extremely talented and proven Crucible warriors as well as the designers and developers who build the game we play.

What about interviews with entertainers, sports psych professionals, and even former NFL players?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe make sure to do our research. All of our tips, facts, and advice come backed with stats and research, as well as in-game experience; you won\u0027t find any speculation or guesses here. Since the early days we\u0027ve worked closely with Crucible scientists from the PvP community to find out exactly how Destiny works, because a thorough understanding of the game and all its nuances is a necessary element of improvement.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCrucible Radio began with a mission to improve \u003cem\u003ewith \u003c/em\u003eour listeners so that we could all reach our goals together. It started small - three guys with a common objective, meeting on the internet to talk about a game we love. Since then, we\u0027ve grown as a community, as players, as hosts, and as competitors. The road has been full of victories, along with plenty of defeats - but those losses only offer more opportunities to learn. We\u0027re in it for the long haul, because winning isn\u0027t easy. We\u0027ve already begun to find that the victories aren\u0027t limited to what the scoreboard shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCrucible Radio is our\npassion. We want it to be everything it can be. To do that, we ask for your\nhelp. With you behind us, Crucible Radio can be a journey that isn\u0027t limited by\nnew content or DLCs and patches. With great teammates we gain the drive to keep\nplaying and keep building this incredible community that has already become something\nwe never imagined. If you\u2019d like to join us, then you\u2019re in the right place.\u003cbr\u003e"
