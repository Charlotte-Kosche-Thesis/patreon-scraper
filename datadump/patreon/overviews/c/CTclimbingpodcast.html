    "summary": "My name is John Blomquist and I am the Host/Producer/Writer/Editor (and just about everything else) behind Chalk Talk Climbing Podcast. I created Chalk Talk out of a love for the climbing industry and a deep appreciation for podcasts as a media outlet. Podcasts are a unique way to have deep, meaningful conversation with folks who are generally out of reach to most of us. That is what I\u0027m trying to do with Chalk Talk. I want to have conversations with the climbing industry\u0027s leaders and bring those words and ideas to you! \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I\u0027ve gotten tired of listening to scores of ads on the podcasts I enjoy and would love to keep this podcast\u0027s ads to a minimum. However, in order to keep the podcast growing and progressing, money is a necessary evil. That\u0027s where you come in. As a patron, you will be helping to make this podcast even more successful. \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 If I even get $1 from half of Chalk Talk\u0027s listeners, I can quit working my two day jobs, devote my entire work week to this podcast, potentially hire some help, visit more live events, do more in-person interviews, write more articles, possible live podcasts, the potential is endless! So, if you want more from Chalk Talk, please donate. As little as $1 per month will make all the difference. Thanks!"
