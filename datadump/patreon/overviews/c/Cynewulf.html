    "summary": "In the larger scale of things, I\u0027m on Patreon to help me push towards releasing more stories with slightly less stress. Fiction of any sort is difficult. Even the dime romance novel trash we\u0027ve all secretly read a few pages of are tiny roadside shrines to someone\u0027s intestinal fortitude. Some poor bastard typed all of that, spent hours writing it, probably had some sort of outline... Well. The point being that it\u0027s a taxing experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I write for the joy of it, I also write out of a serious obligation I feel that creation places on me. Donating to my patreon will put a little gas money in my pocket so as to help me be a little more secure in that creation. And beyond that... It is a gift. I struggled over whether or not to create a patreon at all for a lot of reasons. I was worried that it might alienate people I admired or trusted, or that it might alter the magic of the whole thing for me. But the truth is that those arguments no longer saw me. The one that does is this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write stories that fit into a lot of different generic categories. While many of my stories are darker in tone, touching on unpleasant or bleak themes, many are not! I\u0027ve written everything from surrealistic comedy to Lovecraftian horror to calm, quiet slice of life. Historically, most of my work is comprised of \"Oneshots\" or more accurately, short stories. However, I\u0027ve written plenty of longer works--under the name Cynewulf I\u0027ve written one long epic (\u003cem\u003eThe Night is Passing\u003c/em\u003e, 525K+ words!) as well as several shorter novels/novella length stories. (\u003cem\u003eThe Warmth of Alien Suns;\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cem\u003eRedeem Us In Our Solemn Hour;\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cem\u003eAgeless, Or Celestia Plays Dice With the Universe; Absolution\u003c/em\u003e). In all, under the name Cynewulf, there are published at present 70 stories which constitute... wait for it.....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1,066,939\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0words and \u003cu\u003egrowing\u003c/u\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eYou can imagine how taxing that can be from time to time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write mostly pony fanfiction. That isn\u0027t to say, obviously, that ponyfics are the only thing I write--I dabble in poetry and work on original fiction pretty regularly. I expect that this page will have a lot of all three of these things, as well as possibly videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn videos--all my writing is free and remains so, as far as pony fiction is concerned! But your pledge of support and confidence will go a long way as I put aside the time and sit down to actually work on putting out review videos. I\u0027ve done this before! Here\u0027s a link to one I did for KitsuneRisu\u0027s fantastic \u003cem\u003eRomancing the Clouds\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0that was from three years ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/blog/175691/hey-a-review-and-my-voice-romancing-the-clouds\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRomancing the Clouds\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGifts are important to me. Signs--tangible signs--of trust and favor are important to me. I give my friends gifts to remember me by, do things to affirm their place in my life. Calvin Miller, who is sadly dead now, once wrote a smaller and more impressionable me that \"affirmation holds the world together\" and I took it to heart. A lot of people asked me if I had one and several people have wanted to donate to one that did not exist. It now exists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether or not you donate, remember that in reading my stories you carry with you all of the love I\u0027ve got. My readers are amazing and I genuinely treasure them. Hearing from a reader usually makes my day! You\u0027re always free to drop me a line about almost literally anything on FiMFic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Cynewulf\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMy FimFiction account!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
