You may call me Deanna M. aka cosmosgirl87 or peipei depending on where you\u0027ve heard from me. I am the artist and writer of the comic Cosmos Song. It is the 3rd comic i\u0027ve worked on thus far and I hope to be able to take it pretty far some day. :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://cosmos-song.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/roxy-cute.jpg\" style=\"width: 378px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Comic\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tapastic.com/series/Cosmos-Song\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCosmos Song\u003c/a\u003e is  a fantasy romance webcomic about a carefree young sorceress named Roxy living in a secluded fishing village known as Pyll\u2019ar. The Outlandian villagers of Py\u2019llar consist primarily of individuals from the old Lasochy\u2019an commune, known for their great knowledge and fascination with the Earth, stars and the universe. The day she happens upon a mysterious individual from a distant continent, her world seemingly becomes a tidal wave of uncertainty over night. Was it the cosmos that fated their meeting or did something much more sinister bring the mysterious traveler to Roxy\u2019s humble abode?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://cosmos-song.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tapastic-cover-real-2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout The Artist\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, I do all of my comics including Cosmos Song for free and for the enjoyment of fantasy and comic lovers out there alike. I am a 29 year old female from California, a full time freelance artist, web designer and an SEO director for a living. I have an awesome and very sweet boyfriend who I also must care for due to his paraplegia caused by an automobile accident years ago. I love playing video games and watching anime in my spare time, but I haven\u0027t really had time for game playing in quite some years.\u00a0As you might be able to tell, my schedule is pretty booked! I have a smidgen of time every week to get 2 pages up on Tuesdays and Friday\u0027s, even that\u0027s becoming a little difficult.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Dish\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo you might be wondering why I\u0027ve bothered to set up a Patreon page like this all of a sudden. Well, the truth is, I absolutely love working on this comic, its what I live to do and I wish to be able to continue updating Cosmos Song twice a week, but that\u0027s really hard to do sometimes. So i\u0027m asking for a bit of support from fans like you in order to free up more time to continue delivering high quality pages every Tuesday and Friday. Donations of $1 or more would be incredibly wonderful. Just know that your donation will be much appreciated and perks will be included (progress updates to the Patreon donation feed, concept art, early page updates eventually and even give aways in the future :3!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLinks:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRead Cosmos Song at the following Links:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://cosmos-song.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://cosmos-song.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://tapastic.com/series/Cosmos-Song\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://tapastic.com/series/Cosmos-Song\u003cbr\u003ehttps://twitter.com/cosmosgirl87\u003cbr\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/cosmossongwebcomic/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy DA Profile:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://peipei22.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://peipei22.deviantart.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther Comics i\u0027m working on:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.theduckwebcomics.com/DeadFingers\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.theduckwebcomics.com/DeadFingers\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
