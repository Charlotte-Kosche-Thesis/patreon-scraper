Drawing was great, but I was inspired by clay and actually went the 3D sculpture/ceramics route. It was fun until I hit grad school and got through that only to find myself uninspired and tired.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So a year or several of searching, I remembered my love for telling stories and more specifically drawing stories. I made it my mission to get back to drawing and make it possible to create my own world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eJoin me as I continue to learn and grow as a storyteller and artist.\u003c/div\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By becoming a Patron, you will help offset business and living costs for me (The Artist) and my family. This means more content and comics for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eAnd now a quick synopsis:\u003c/div\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn 1895 scientists and mystics tried to combine their talents to create a power source that would end the need for future power sources. The resulting cataclysm tore holes in reality releasing monsters and radiation throughout the world. Cities fortified themselves and took in as many people as they could.\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThe city of North Platte was the largest railway connection in the United States at the time. To protect the city it was put up on rails and started migrating through the States between the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. This city\u0027s name was changed to New Platte and now boasts itself the biggest trade city in the world.\u003cbr\u003eOne hundred years later the city has grown, being built on top of itself countless times.\u003cbr\u003eThis is the tale of the people who have come to call New Platte home.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://img08.deviantart.net/8c84/i/2017/088/8/2/patreon_cover_by_ralston1850-db3xmjb.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eSound like fun?\u003cbr\u003eRead \u003ca href=\"http://thethirdrail.thewebcomic.com\"\u003eThe Third Rail\u003c/a\u003e here.\u003c/div\u003eBecome a Patron and get the scoop and some exclusive goodies from New Platte and the world they strive to survive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThank you to my Patrons:\u003cbr\u003eLisa Turner\u003cbr\u003eBecky Heath\u003cbr\u003eJesse Kiefer\u003cbr\u003eDana Bataille\u003cbr\u003eEric Smith\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhats all this \"The White Crow\" stuff you ask?\u003cbr\u003eWell it does mean a lengthy break from \"The Third Rail\" (at least it looks that way at the moment). But it is a collaboration between me and Eric Jones to create an awesome new graphic novel.\u003cbr\u003eWe plan to present it for the Creators for Creators grant but follow through no matter the results and finish the book in December of 2018. That means about 10 pages a month for me to draw and share here. Come along with us and cheer us on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
