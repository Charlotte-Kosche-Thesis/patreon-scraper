I\u0027m Jodina Meehan\u003c/strong\u003e, an artist in Southern Vermont who paints with sound waves, using a process known as \"Cymatics.\" \u00a0I have been creating videos, photos, and metal art plates using cymatics for the past 9 years...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring that time, I\u0027ve had the honor of creating cymatics commissions for Cirque Du Soleil and National Geographic\u0027s Brain Games, as well as founding The Journal Of Cymatics and The School Of Cymatics (800 students currently enrolled).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have taught the art of cymatics to school children who have gone on to win their science fairs, held open studios where visitors can sing into a microphone and see the shape of their voice, and built 4 different devices for capturing sound and making it visible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut I\u0027m just getting started :-)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the next few months and years, I will be creating more cymatics videos, putting together a stage show called \u0027cymatics,\u0027 and collaborating with many more artists, musicians and scientists to help showcase this amazing phenomenon and bring the magic of cymatics to millions more around the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you would like to join us, you can help by supporting cymatics here on patreon for $1 (or more) per month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, I am focused on writing CYMATICA, a 3 book fantasy series about a world where sound is magic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have completed the draft of the first book, CYMATICA Book One, and am in the process of editing and finishing the book for publication. Finishing the book includes completing art, maps, and a soundtrack to go with the book, as well as finishing a 26 letter Cymatic Alphabet, that will allow readers to use the symbols (called the CODEX)...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the CODEX you ask? Well...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout the book(s) there will be secret messages written in cymatic symbols, that each represent one letter of the alphabet. Readers will be able to collect the symbols of this Cymatic Alphabet one symbol at a time, so they can read the secret messages printed throughout the books. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe letters of the Cymatic Alphabet will be created in my studio using sound waves to form them in salt, then recorded and turned into the CODEX. Normally, the CODEX will only be available for purchase on a time-release basis as they get made and the first book gets closer and closer to publishing time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut YOU can get access to the Cymatic Alphabet first...\u003c/strong\u003eas well as character sketches...pages from my working notebook...early release samples of the cymatica soundtrack...pieces of the Map of Cymatica...and background pages from the World of Cymatica.
