    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eHi! I\u0027m Chad Sell, a cartoonist and illustrator in Chicago. I make comics and draw drag queens.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you\u0027re reading this, you probably already know who I am. (If not, check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.chadsellcomics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e, I guess?) However, you might not know what this Patreon thing is. Basically, it\u0027s a way for you to directly support artists you like so that they can keep doing what they do. Cool, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been on Patreon since 2015 --it\u0027s been really amazing and an incredible help to me. My supporters sign up to send me a monthly pledge amount (whatever you want!), and it gives me a level of security and stability that I wouldn\u0027t otherwise have as a self-employed cartoonist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/589dd0568419c25ff48303fb/t/58a883c9197aea3df2723c67/1487438821817/\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to make it worthwhile for my supporters, too! Supporters at any level get access to all my Patreon posts and exclusive content. And if you pledge as little as $5 per month, I\u0027ll mail you cool stuff! Although most of my professional work is done digitally, I create custom postcard sketches that I send out to my patrons every month! Some months, I\u0027ll pick certain themes, like sci-fi, cartoon characters, or exotic animals! And during the seasons of RuPaul\u0027s Drag Race, I draw lots and lots of drag queens! My supporters can always request specific characters or queens to draw, too! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s how it works:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e$5/month supporters will get a limited edition 4x6 postcard print of one of my favorite sketches that month! (This tier is limited to supporters in the US because of postage costs)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$7/month supporters receive TWO DIFFERENT limited edition postcard prints each month, because sometimes it\u0027s too hard to choose just one! I\u0027m opening this one up to international supporters!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$10/month supporters receive a custom 4x6 postcard sketch every month, shipped anywhere in the world! I try to cater the original art to your specific requests, so go crazy! (At times, I may limit the number of these pledges, because I can only do so many of them each month!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$15/month supporters receive that custom 4x6 postcard sketch and one of that month\u0027s limited edition postcard prints.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$20/month supporters will get the custom 4x6 postcard sketch and BOTH of that month\u0027s limited edition postcard prints!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can absolutely feel free to pledge even more, but I can\u0027t really send you anything cooler than the $20/month stuff!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really love the monthly interactions with my supporters, and doing these sketch cards has been a great opportunity to experiment with new techniques and fall back in love with simple pen and paper!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe support of my Patreon participants has also allowed me to invest a ton of time over the past two years into a really amazing project called \u003cem\u003eThe Cardboard Kingdom\u003c/em\u003e that will be coming out in 2018! It\u0027s a kids\u0027 comic that I put together with a team of amazing collaborators.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a graphic novelist, it can be nearly impossible to find the time and energy to sink into a large-scale project, especially when you don\u0027t know if you\u0027ll ever find a publisher for it. But \u003cem\u003eThe Cardboard Kingdom\u003c/em\u003e has found a home at Knopf Books for Young Readers, and I couldn\u0027t be more thrilled about it! I hope to share a lot more about \u003cem\u003eThe Cardboard Kingdom\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite the excitement of landing my first book deal, I\u0027ve come to realize that publishing is a very long, drawn out process, especially when you\u0027re trying to make really worthwhile, amazing books! So your support on Patreon helps me stay afloat and productive month-by-month during the long, long production process in publishing!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd yes, as always, I\u0027ll be drawing my favorite looks from each episode of RuPaul\u0027s Drag Race! Thanks for helping me do that, too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust a quick note on how my particular Patreon works: when you sign up, you aren\u0027t actually billed until the first of the following month, and I send out my postcards by the end of that month. So you may not receive your cool stuff until the end of *next* month -- does that make sense? You can always feel free to message me with any questions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
