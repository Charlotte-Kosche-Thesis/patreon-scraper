We do\u003cstrong\u003e Youtube-Videos\u003c/strong\u003e and try our best to entertain our audience. We do \u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e have\u003cstrong\u003e the perfect equipment\u003c/strong\u003e for doing what we try to do, but we do our best with what we have. We set up this Patreon page for our fans and supporters to even support us a little bit more by donating \u003cstrong\u003ea small amount\u003c/strong\u003e of money. We do know that we have to work on our creations, but as mentioned, we try our best. You can help us out to get better equipment for what we do and possibly make even better content in the future. \u003cstrong\u003eWe would like to thank each and everyone\u003c/strong\u003e that is considering to help us out and hope you have a nice day. :) If there are going to be some donations we will \u003cstrong\u003euse the money to buy new camera equipment for better quality, new editing software\u003c/strong\u003e (we are using the free program shotcut at the moment) \u003cstrong\u003eand maybe even stuff for our motocycles like repairs and gas\u003c/strong\u003e. Currently we are still \u003cstrong\u003estudents\u003c/strong\u003e, so we do not have as much time to create content and in addition to that, creating motocycle videos in the winter and with bad weather is kind of hard. Usually we upload \u003cstrong\u003eone video each month\u003c/strong\u003e. For the upcoming year 2018, \u003cstrong\u003ewe try to set a new goal of two videos each month\u003c/strong\u003e and maybe do some more stuff like \u003cstrong\u003epossibly motovlogs\u003c/strong\u003e (we aren\u0027t sure about that...). We even started to design and publish our own \u003cstrong\u003emerchandise\u003c/strong\u003e, but we are still working on that. If any of you could help us with even a small donating we can not thank you enough.\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and thank you for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarelessRiders\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDown below you can see our latest upload. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
