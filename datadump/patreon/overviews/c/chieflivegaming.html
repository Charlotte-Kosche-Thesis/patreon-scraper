I drink way too much coffee and stay up way too late!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was in a motorcycle accident in 2013 which caused me to have to drop out of school and leave my job. I suddenly found out that I had a lot of free time and created Chief Live Gaming while I recovered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI quickly discovered that this endeavor fulfilled a lot of different passions of mine. I love teaching, helping and sharing knowledge with others, and producing videos. This fused with my mad obsession with Warhammer 40k has led to my desire to take Chief Live Gaming farther than I ever thought possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the help from my Patrons, I plan to expand Chief Live Gaming into a fantastic gaming community! I love doing battle reports, painting tutorials, terrain tutorials, and more. To keep this content fresh, donations help me bring new things to the channel. To reward my Patrons, I offer extra entries into any giveaways I host on my Youtube channel. I plan to do multiple giveaways a year as well as subscriber milestone giveaways to thank you guys for your continued support!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for stopping by and taking a look into my passion, have a great day!\u003cbr\u003e",
