I run a small Youtube gaming channel called Cynthric\u0027s Gaming Channel (that is pronounced Sin Thric). I also occasionally stream on Twitch. You may call me Cynthric or Eric depending on which you prefer.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAs I\u0027m sure most of you already know, the Adpocalypse has hit Youtube because Google for some reason still hasn\u0027t figured out how to change a single thing about Youtube without it hurting the people that create their content after repeated foolish mistakes year after year with little to no communication with their content creators whenever they do so. Not only is it starving large successful channels of ad revenue but it has completely destroyed any chance of ad revenue for any channel that doesn\u0027t have at least 10,000 total views which makes it nearly impossible for new channels to get started up. That second thing in particular unfortunately has affected my channel. \u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eIn response, I have created this Patreon page in the hopes of being able to sustain/improve my channel and to create a way for my viewers/Patrons to influence my channel if they wish to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Often Do You Post Videos and Stream?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI mostly post 2 videos per day every day. Currently, I post videos of single player games on Monday through Friday and post videos of multiplayer games on Saturday and Sunday. My streaming schedule is kind of irregular because I haven\u0027t completely figured out a good set time to stream. If there is a specific time that would be most convenient for my viewers/Patrons I would be happy to work toward making that a regular schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy schedule of posting single player games during the weekdays and multiplayer during the weekends may eventually change if I can find people with less busy schedules to record with. I am open to recording/playing games with subscribers/viewers/Patrons/Youtubers/Streamers if there are any that would like to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Does My Pledge Go Toward?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eFirst and foremost, it goes toward general living expenses, I have to pay bills after all. \u003cbr\u003eSecond, it goes toward buying new games to record new videos for the channel along with equipment and tools for improving the quality of the channel\u0027s videos and to expand on what kind of content I can make for the channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there are any specific games you would like to see me play on the channel please feel free to let me know whether it be in the comments of my videos or through Twitter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWill There Be Rewards For Pledging A Certain Amount?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot in the beginning, because I currently lack the money required to make rewards. But in the future if there are enough pledges to have a stable income, I would love to create rewards whether that be T-shirts, plushies, or anything else I can think of or you viewers/Patrons would like to suggest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Don\u0027t You Get A \"Real Job\"?/Why Did You Make This Channel?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDue to circumstances within my family/household I am unable to get a normal job. My household consists of myself, my elderly mother and aunt both of whom aren\u0027t in the best of health, my uncle who has vascular dementia which taking care of him/keeping an eye on him is like a full time job by itself, and my cousin who is also not in the best of health. Due to my uncle\u0027s illness, he has a bad habit of getting up and walking around when no one\u0027s looking and falling on the ground and when he does so he is essentially dead weight. Without me around the house to get him back up on his feet my family would have to call an ambulance every time he falls (which is often) just to get him off the ground which would not only be ridiculously expensive but would also be a waste of emergency hospital resources/time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to these circumstances I decided to start a Youtube channel in the hopes of being able to earn money to support my family while at home. Also because my mother is in her late 60s yet is still having to work a full time job so I would really like for her to be able to retire at some point in her life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Don\u0027t You Use Facecam?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eBecause I\u0027m not entirely comfortable with my appearance and because of shyness in general. Another reason I started this channel is to try to get over said shyness and try to improve my self confidence, also to try to get used to interacting with people publicly (I\u0027m a bit of a introvert). As you will probably notice in my current and past videos, I\u0027m far better at articulating myself through text than I am through talking, at least when it\u0027s just me talking in single player videos that is. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future, when I am more comfortable with my appearance and have more self confidence, I may do a face reveal and possibly start using Facecam in my videos if enough people really want me to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre You Done Ranting Yet?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI think that covers most of it o.o at least for now. I may add some things later if I can think of anything. If you\u0027re still reading this, thank you for your patience. Whether you decide to pledge to my channel or not I hope you have a nice day. If there is any helpful advice you\u0027d like to give me in regards to my videos/channel please feel free to let me know.
