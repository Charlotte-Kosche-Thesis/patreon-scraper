The pregnant bloat of dirigibles float overhead, their rust eaten bellies filled with poison gas. Constables flash badges and take bribes on the corner, while the company men carry on with the quiet business of murder. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to The City. It\u0027s hungry. And it\u0027s waiting for you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe City of Smoke and Iron is your source for bite sized audio-dramas and diesel-pulp fiction stories. Each is sent straight to your inbox, and tells the tales of femme fatales, private eyes and dirigible pilots who never quite know if they\u0027ll see tomorrow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch like the lives of its residents, stories from the City of Smoke and Iron are bloody and short.

You can send a bit money toward me on a per-project basis so I can do things like eat and make more art for you to \u00a0enjoy. Donating through Patreon means that you also get access to bonus content\u2014like voting for which story becomes an audio drama next - that aren\u0027t available for non-Patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s diesel-pulp fiction?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDiesel-pulp fiction is a phrase I made up. I know, I know. Think noir crime thrillers mixed with dieselpunk tech. It\u0027s a world where airship raids and zombie trench warfare won\u0027t keep\u00a0hard-boiled detectives and femme-fatales from trying to make ends meet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will you be releasing stories?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe plan is to release text based, Patron only short stories two to four times a month. Audio-dramas will be released about once a month. If this Patreon makes more than 25 bucks a story, expect to get a story a week in your inbox, like clockwork.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I stop donating any time I want?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDefinitely.
