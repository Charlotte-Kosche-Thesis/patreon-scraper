A few months ago, a certain tweet of mine involving a game\u0027s virtual currency vs the currency of the country with the world\u0027s most proven oil reserves exploded and landed on Fortune, Fox News Radio, Reddit, 4chan, \u003cem\u003eeverywhere\u003c/em\u003e. As absurd as it sounds, it encapsulates just a tiny consequence of the bigger collapse my country is sadly going through, and a glimpse at the death of our currency, one that at some point in its history was worth more than the mighty US Dollar.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, not a single \"journalist\" bothered to contact me about it, even though I got them all them sweet juicy clicks. It doesn\u0027t matter when you read the above paragraph, by the time you read it the situation has become much worse than the week before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSince we live in a world of e-fame and e-celebs, I might as well use my unwarranted self importance and grossly overestimated fake e-fame to open a Patreon, cause lets be honest here: if people donate to others for the promise of lewds/nudes, donate to catfish that exploit the malleable nature of the male thirst, and donate to accounts whose purpose is to dox citizens because of their political beliefs, \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003ethen why the hell not.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, as you may or may have not heard, my country is on a pretty dire situation, not just politically, but socially and economically. Our currency is \u003cstrong\u003edead \u003c/strong\u003eand hyperinflation has destroyed our acquisitive power; things that you take for granted have become a luxury few can afford here, people earn less than $3 per month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith each passing week, the situation continues to become much worse, hyperinflation is out of control, everything becomes more expensive at a rapid and exponential rate and no matter how hard you work here, it\u0027s a fight you cannot ever hope to possibly win without some sort of external help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition to that, if you\u0027ve checked my twitter timeline you\u0027d know of the three-year long fight against cancer that my mother went through, it was a hard fight with everything stacked against her,\u00a0especially in Venezuela\u0027s obliterated health system, where you can\u0027t even find the simplest over-the-counter meds.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was thanks to the support of my Patrons, and everyone else that helped out that I was able to support her and take care of her during the last eight months of her life, I will be eternally grateful for that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince Patreon is about actually making content, I am working on a fiction novel, it\u0027s my dream project long in the planning, I\u0027m hoping to finish the first draft in a couple months so I can clean it up and figure out how to publish it worldwide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also slowly building a blog, ckaleb.com, in order to publish articles about living in Venezuela, from my point of view and experiences, as well as other topics of interest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Goal.\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eObjective: Survive and Escape.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this Patreon is to help me and my brother survive through this Socialist Utopia, with hyperinflation so out of control, everything becomes more expensive at such a rapid pace, some meds have skyrocketed in price (if you can find them that is). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGetting basic things such as rice, flour, toiletries, etc. has to be done through contraband if you don\u0027t want to spend hours and hours on a line just to see if they allow you to buy a limited amount of X or Y item.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution will help cover all of our expenses, and it would grant me more free time and ease of mind to work on my novel manuscript, even the slightest contribution goes a long way here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour help will also allow me to gather enough funds to be able to afford an escape plan for my my brother and I. This is the ultimate goal in all this, my original plan intended for the three of us to escape together, but with my mother\u0027s passing it\u0027ll be a bittersweet plan. Getting the two of us out as soon as possible so that my young brother can have a future, it is what I promised my mother I would do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Disclosure:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I will use your hard earned money on.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBeing completely honest about all of this is paramount to me; that being said, I will use your money in the following order of priority:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cdel\u003eHelp my mother by covering all of her ever increasing medical expenses derived from her cancer, from medicine to scans and all that\u0027s in between, and hopefully her chemotherapy costs if we finally are able to find it.\u003c/del\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for helping me with this for the past 8 months, one day I\u0027ll be able to repay you all in some form.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eCover the Food costs for my family, hyperinflation is showing no signs of slowing down and things are exponentially increasing in price so hard and fast.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eThe \"Get out of Venezuela, Kaleb!\" fund.
