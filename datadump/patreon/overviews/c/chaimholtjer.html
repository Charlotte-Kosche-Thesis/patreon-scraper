    "summary": "As a writer I want to be able to spend as much\ntime as I possibly can on creating new and exciting stories. Though\nunfortunately it is as they say: \"Time is money\". And I indeed have\nto earn a basic income one way or another. Writing on an empty stomach while\nliving in a cardboard box will not do anybody any good, least of all myself.\nTherefore I currently work a fulltime job and juggle my spare time around to\nencompass relaxation, socialisation and written creation. My dream is that I\ncan change this financially induced lack of time around to being a full time\nwriter with a job on the side.Or if I\u0027m very lucky, sustain myself entirely by scribblings.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe stories I write are as diverse as my interests\nare, though in all of them I encapsulate my own voice: meaning witty humour,\ncritical insights, and interesting characters and situations that will hopefully\nleave you wanting for more. I will write regardless of the money that comes in,\nand write not for wealth but because writing is very entertaining, relaxing and\nstimulating at the same time.I\nwant to share at least some part of this experience with you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe more I can support myself by writing, the more\nI am able to write, and the more everybody will be able to read what I\u0027ve\nwritten. So if you like what you\u2019ve read so far, I would be most thankful\nto you for everything you are willing to spare to support my writing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
