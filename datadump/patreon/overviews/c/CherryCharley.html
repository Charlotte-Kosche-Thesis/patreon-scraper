I try my best to interact as much as possible with my viewers, replying to most, if not all their comments and messages. \u003cbr\u003eThe more patreon I get, the more likely my dream of becoming a true YouTuber will come true. If I\u0027m honest I\u0027m not expecting any donations at all, but a lot of people suggested making it as I know a few people who have had trouble with paypal in the past. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not begging for donations and please do not feel obligated to make a donation.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve made this so people who think I deserve it, can give. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not expecting to become a huge youtuber, and to be honest I feel like it most likely wont ever happen, but with the slightest chance of it, I\u0027ll admit, it\u0027s a dream job. \u003cbr\u003eI ranted for way too long and this all probably doesn\u0027t make sense. \u003cbr\u003eJust know if you do donate, I appreciate it more than you know. \u003cbr\u003eThe donations will go towards savings for new equipment to make my content better.\u00a0With any donation amount, you\u0027re welcome to choose a game you wish for me to play or any song you would like me to learn and sing as I would love to show my gratitude for your kindness.\u003cbr\u003eWith anyone\u0027s and everyone\u0027s help we can all have so much fun on this channel and become something amazing! \u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not about the money but how much fun with can have along the way with new equipment for new videos...maybe even one day we won\u0027t need this website to keep us stable and the channel would be self sustaining. Never give up hope :D\u003cbr\u003eTh-h-h-that\u0027s all folks!\u003cbr\u003eThank you :P"
