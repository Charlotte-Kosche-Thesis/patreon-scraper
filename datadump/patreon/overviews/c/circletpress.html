    "summary": "Hi! We are\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.circlet.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCirclet Press\u003c/a\u003e, publishers of erotic science fiction and fantasy. We\u0027ve been around since 1992 when our founder, Cecilia Tan, self-published a teensy chapbook entitled \u003cem\u003eTelepaths Don\u0027t Need Safewords\u003c/em\u003e. At the time no other publisher in the English language would touch any combination of erotica with fantasy or science fiction, and especially not BDSM, bisexuality, or any of the other \"alternative sexuality\" themes represented in the book.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.circlet.com/wp-content/images/circlet-3-covers.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTelepaths Don\u0027t Need Safewords\u003c/em\u003e was a bona fide underground self-published hit, with over 5,000 copies in print, and the story was later reprinted in other volumes including \u003cem\u003eBest SM Short Stories, Black Feathers, \u003c/em\u003eand others. Since that time Circlet Press has published over 200 novels, anthologies, and collections of short stories covering nearly every sf/f genre and nearly every human sexual variation we can legally depict. We seek out representations of sexuality, gender, attractions, and relationships outside of the \"mainstream norms\" and we are committed to expanding diversity in other realms as well. We were the first pro sale for many award-winning and amazing writers, including Mary Anne Mohanraj, TammyJo Eckhart, and Raven Kaldera, and editors at Strange Horizons, Betwixt, and Horticulture magazines got their starts in publishing through our intern program. Circlet Press is an incubator for sex-positive science fiction and fantasy even for those who go on to non-erotic creative work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd we want to continue to incubate and instigate great erotic imaginations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years we have seen the book industry change drastically. Our staple customers were once indie booksellers including LGBT stores, erotica speciality shops, and underground lit stores. For a while our books were shelved prominently in chains like Borders, Barnes \u0026amp; Noble, and Tower Books. In 2007-2008 we were on the vanguard of bestsellers in the newly launched Kindle Store. But now as the Kindle marketplace has grown crowded and Amazon has pushed readers to \"Kindle Unlimited\" (\"Netflix-style\" model), sales have tanked and revenue has been cut to the bone once again.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.circlet.com/wp-content/images/circlet_3_kink_covers.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo it\u0027s time for a new model to reach readers and dedicated customers. We pioneered crowdfunding *before* Kickstarter existed when we crowdfunded a \"best of Circlet\" anthology in 2008. We did it with our \"Circlet 100\" campaign, asking for one hundred donors to raise the money to print and produce an anthology and give the writers a decent rate of pay. Now it\u0027s time for something more sustainable, though, something that can keep our freelance staff working all year round.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where this Patreon campaign comes in. Your monthly support will allow us to do many things. You can support for as little as $1 per month! And look at the fantastic benefits you can receive! Think of it like joining the coolest book club ever. We publish a steady stream of high quality erotica and by becoming a Patreon supporter you\u0027ll be the first to receive what we publish, as follows:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$1 PER MONTH\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGive $1 per month and your perks will include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou\u0027re a supporter of diverse, intelligent erotica!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour immediate choice of any 1 backlist ebook as a thank you!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e10% off on purchases of Circlet Press paperbacks \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInvites to Circlet Patreon events and patron-only discussions online\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$2 PER MONTH\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGive $2 per month and your perks will include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour choice of any 4 backlist ebooks as your immediate patron thank you!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFree ebooks of each erotica \u003cem\u003eanthology\u003c/em\u003e we release (5 to 10 per year, valued at $2.99 to $9.99 each)!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e10% off on purchases of Circlet Press paperbacks\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInvites to Circlet Patreon events and patron-only discussions online\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVote on upcoming anthology topics\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$5 PER MONTH\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGive $5 per month and your perks will include:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour choice of any 8 backlist ebooks as your immediate patron thank you!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFree ebooks of EVERY book we release including novels and anthologies (10-20 per year, valued at $2.99 to $9.99 each)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e15% off on purchases of Circlet Press paperbacks\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInvites to Circlet Patreon events and patron-only discussions online\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVote on upcoming anthology topics\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA Circlet Press flashlight pen\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$10 PER MONTH\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGive $10 per month and your perks will include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour choice of any 8 backlist ebooks as your immediate patron thank you!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFree copies of EVERY ebook we release including novels and anthologies (10-20 per year, valued at $2.99 to $9.99 each)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour choice of one printed paperback per year of membership including free shipping (valued at $9.95 to $19.95 each plus shippping)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e20% off on purchases of paperbacks\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInvites to Circlet Patreon events and patron-only discussions online\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVote on upcoming anthology topics\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA Circlet Press book tote bag\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$25 PER MONTH\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGive $25 per month and your perks will include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour choice of any 10 backlist ebooks as your immediate patron thank you!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAfter 6 months, complete access to the entire Circlet digital backlist!
