I publish most of my animations under the name \"Yossi Productions\" and while\u00a0most of my work so far consists of skits and jokes, I plan to create content in both the comedic and dramatic genres!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy Patreon is, for now, meant to just be a way to donate to me to help out with my animated projects. I\u0027ll be writing a couple blog posts talking about what I\u0027ve been working on and thinking about to show my progress. ALL donations will be used solely for the animation projects (for things like Adobe, music, etc.). My animations, blog entries, and behind the scenes stuff are free for all to see, though I may look into special rewards and incentives in the future. For now, as a way to thank those who do decide to donate, patrons will receive shoutouts and special thanks in the credits as well as sneak peeks at upcoming projects!*\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*Rewards and prices are subject to change.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n The donation will be per animation (as opposed to per month) meaning, if you decide to donate, you\u0027ll only be charged for each finished animation I post (instead of being charged for a month that may not even have an animation released in it). If enough people believe I should charge per month, I will consider switching it over, provided they let me know.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for checking out my work! Become a patron today!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-DEMO REEL COMING SOON-\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e---------------------------------------------------------------\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nQ\u0026amp;A:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-\u00a0What will I be charged for?\u003cbr\u003e\n- You will only be charged for full, finished animations. You will NOT be charged for blog posts, behind the scenes posts, animation tests, etc.. Only finished work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- What will you use the money for?\u003cbr\u003e\n- I use Adobe to create some parts of my animations, and that is a monthly payment (about $30 per month for the programs I use), so it\u0027ll go to that first. What\u0027s left will go to making the animations better, such as paying for extra features I may want to use, paying for someone to compose an original soundtrack, and I\u0027d eventually like to pay the voice actors that do work for my animations.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Why do I have to pay to see sneak peek stuff?\u003cbr\u003e\n- To be honest, I don\u0027t want just anyone seeing what I\u0027m working on too far ahead of time. I worry about disappointing people if they don\u0027t work out and I worry about the possibility of someone stealing my ideas (yes, I\u0027m a bit paranoid). I needed a way to thank those who donate a good amount of money, and I thought that was something I\u0027d possibly be willing to offer as a thank you. \u00a0I may decide to change that later, but we\u0027ll just see how things go.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- What do you mean \"rewards and prices are subject to change\"?\u003cbr\u003e\n- Patreon is a new thing for me, and I\u0027m still seeing how it goes. If I become more popular and make more of a name for myself, I may want to make some rewards more exclusive (like the Executive Producer credit thing). I\u0027ll provide notice to everyone before I change anything.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Why pay per project instead of per month?\u003cbr\u003e\n- I, unfortunately, cannot yet devote too much time to my personal animations (job, errands, life and whatnot) and there may be times where I\u0027m not able to release an animation for a month. I don\u0027t want people to feel like they\u0027re paying me for nothing. If a good majority of my patrons say they\u0027re willing to pay per month, then I\u0027ll consider changing it, but in the meantime I don\u0027t want anyone to feel like I\u0027m just taking money from them for nothing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Why aren\u0027t there more rewards?\u003cbr\u003e\n- This is all new to me, and I\u0027m still figuring out how this is all going to work out for me. I\u0027m not sure what I can offer yet, especially since I don\u0027t have too much time for things and am not famous enough to provide value from things like autographs or personal things. As ti\u0010me goes on I may come up with more rewards and more ways to thank those who become patrons. For the time being I can send you an autograph, if you\u0027d like."
