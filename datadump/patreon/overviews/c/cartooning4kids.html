    "summary": "As more and more of my video art tutorials get demonetized on Youtube I am now seeking community support on Patreon to help keep my content going and to keep it free for everyone to enjoy. This is my third year on Youtube which brings in record high views and subscribers but also marks another year of record low ad revenue numbers- 56% lower to be exact. The revenue generated from Youtube is how I am able to support my channel and my family but as Youtube continues to make questionable changes to their platform, the future of my channel becomes uncertain. This is why I am turning my attention to Patreon. I am grateful to all my fans and subscribers for your continued support. If you find value in what I do and believe in what I do then please consider supporting my Patreon campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\nis Cartooning 4 Kids?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am an artist. I used to work in the animated\nfilm and software industry. When my kids were old enough to hold crayons, they started\ndrawing on their own\u2026and sometimes on the wall too. Then, they started asking me how to\ndraw like me. But they were at different ages so I started recording my drawing\nlessons for them so they could learn at their own individual pace. One thing\nled to another, and in 2014, my YouTube channel was launched. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nToday, Cartooning 4 Kids has hundreds of thousands of subscribers and nearly a quarter billion views. This is now my full-time job. I create and share new video tutorials every single day on my main channel and now my recently added second channel for younger artists and beginners. My goal is to\nintroduce the basic fundamentals of drawing and help build confidence to\nchildren and aspiring artists around the world. Exercising creativity should be\nfun and free. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\ndo I need your help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI love teaching art and I love making\nvideos, but it\u2019s becoming more of a challenge each year. The advertising\nrevenue we make on Youtube has become unstable with each passing year. For the past 3 years I have been supplementing\nproduction funding through various freelance jobs I pick up elsewhere. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy mission is quite simple. I want to provide the largest creative arts education resource for all to enjoy. I believe I can help build confidence in young children and encourage everyone to discover their creative talents. I\u2019m hoping that this Patreon will\nhelp make production less stressful and provide a way for me to continue\ncreating free content for you and to all my fans around the world. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI can promise you that I will always do my\nbest and will continue to dedicate my life to building this Youtube channel for\neveryone to enjoy. Your support is incredibly important to me so I thank you so\nmuch for your love and generosity. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\nI will do with your money:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYour support will allow me to stop relying solely on ad revenue to fund my channel. With more and more advertisers pulling away from Youtube each month it can get a bit challenging to plan for the future of my channel. Your support will allow me\nto focus 100% on the lessons I create and not lose valuable time hunting for\nother work to fund production. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI can invest more time into broadening the\nrange of lessons I create. I would love to produce more lessons for my younger\naudience and also for my advanced artists. The short amount of time I have\nmakes it nearly impossible for me to provide enriching lessons suited to all\nskill levels. Your support will allow me to better plan my lessons and even\nincrease production in many ways.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd, mainly, it will allow me to spend more\ntime with my children, for whom all this began. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo simply put, you allow me the time to\nimprove and maintain a healthy and happy Youtube channel for everyone to enjoy\nfor free, forever. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
