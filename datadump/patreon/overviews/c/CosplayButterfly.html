    "summary": "Hola, Konnichiwa, Bienvenue, Willkommen, Welcome!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/U5SeNPX.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0Please sit down, relax, and let me entertain your wildest artistic desires! Now, you may know me as Cosplay Butterfly! \u00a0My real name is Jessie but my nickname is Butterfly, and I\u0027ve held that title since I was a little girl thanks to one of my grandfathers. So the name \u0027Butterfly\u0027 holds a special place in my heart, but please, feel free to address me with whichever you\u0027d like! : D\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I think I\u0027d like to start off by telling you a little about myself and then go on to give you an overview of what you can expect to discover on here, from me. I\u0027m a professionally trained makeup artist who currently specializes in fashion, bridal, and beauty makeup. I work for a cosmetic artistry company called MAC. However, I was fully trained in film/television, theatrical, time period, and special effects makeup as well. I am able to make my own prosthetic pieces, as well as apply them. This more extreme makeup style comes in handy for one of my other passions, COSPLAY!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/FFmRGUT.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 I have been cosplaying since I was around 13 years old! That was the age when I moved to a city 6 hours away from my best friend. In order to see each other at least once a year, we decided to attend a convention and cosplay for it. Her mother made our costumes and we always had the most amazing time! This quickly became a tradition for us and we found ourselves cosplaying yearly. As I grew I started to branch off and learn how to create my own cosplays with the help of different friends. cosplay has always come hand in hand with friendship for me and has since become pretty much a way of life for me. I honestly always have cosplay on the mind, even when it comes to shopping for every day items and clothing, I\u0027m always asking myself how it can be applied to a cosplay I want to create, hahaha! Over the years people started to inquire about where they could find my work online, so three years ago I created a Face Book Page, and more recently, an Instagram Page. Ever since then my cosplay life has turned into an amazing adventure! I have found myself invited as a guest to Canadian conventions ( I. AM. CANADIAN! btw), American conventions, and mostly Mexican conventions! This Butterfly has been flying all around North America to transform into different characters and meet my fans in different lands! I absolutely love it and really cherish these experiences! It inspires me to do better. I want to give back and make the people who have supported me very happy and excited. I want to become their favorite characters and meet them in person, and inspire people to be anything they want to be. Cosplay isn\u0027t\u00a0about the individual, it is about the whole community. Cosplayers make fans happy and in return the fans motivate the cosplayers to strive to be the best they can be! I really want to give back to the community that has supported me all this time. And this is what brings me to Patreon! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/AcRJuFs.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 I am here because this is the best way for me to organize my cosplay life. Cosplay, makeup, and visual art (I\u0027ll get into that) take A LOT of time and effort! Time is provided by (lets be real) money. The more funding I have for these artistic conquests, the more time and hard work I can put towards them. Here is what I strive to give you all. I want to create big, beautiful, and complicated cosplays. I want to fully transform into the characters of your dreams! That means crafting tools, materials, armor builds, makeup/ prosthetic builds and transformations, quality photo and video shoots and a means to travel to and attend conventions that I am not guesting at. But that isn\u0027t\u00a0all! I want people to join me on my adventures and have help engaging on their own adventures!!! I want to provide you with behind the scenes crafting tutorials and videos so that you can see what goes into these cosplay builds (and all the crazy shenanigans too XD), makeup tutorials so that you can transform into your favorite characters as well (this will be for both men and women), fun reviews of different comics, anime, manga, and games so that you can be in the now of what is going on in the \u0027geeky world\u0027, and I want to be friends. As I said earlier, cosplay and friendship go hand in hand. It is difficult to completely be myself on social media and this is the place where you will really get to know me. I want to give you my all!!!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/gM1Yw6y.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0Giving you my all is a way for me to work harder on bringing full art creations into the world. Ever since I was a little kid I have been drawing and painting. I always thought I was going to be an Illustrator. But life happened and I went through some very rough times and my inspiration to draw left me. In recent years I have started creating traditional art again. I think that art is what brings us all together in this community to begin with. We all love the stories, characters and visuals of comics, manga, games, anime, cartoons, and singular illustrations. Cosplay, to me, is the next step to bringing characters to life. Drawing is limited to paper and a screen, while cosplay is living and breathing as that character. Both give birth to thought, inspiration, and happiness! I am going to draw and create traditional art specifically for you! I want to give back and my artwork comes straight from my heart for you in the most personal way!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/2jANh8J.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/8h65D0P.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 So there you have it! This is a little taste of me and what you can expect from investing your time on this adventure! Im not forcing you to be here, if you dont like what you\u0027re reading or what you see then you can certainly move on to something else you enjoy. If you do choose to stick around then let me warn you. you\u0027re about to embark on one hell of a sexy adventure, fore I am here to bring your wildest fantasies to life. Together we will transform our dreams into reality. So again, please sit back, relax, and let me entertain you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love,\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Butterfly XOXO \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ENfhkP2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

If I am able to make this monthly goal then I will be able to invest a Hell of a lot more time and effort into my art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be able to purchase the equipment and supplies needed to create amazing cosplays, increase the quality of my photo and film shoots, and expand my armor making skills. The important thing to remember is that money= TIME! Time gives me the ability to cater to all your fantasy needs ; D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be able to expand my Makeup kit in order to give you the latest and greatest tutorials and reviews in the makeup world. I think that makeup is a very important part of cosplay and want to help people realize their own talent and beauty when it comes to transforming into the character of your dreams.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best part of achieving this goal is that I will be able to potentially meet YOU in person! I will have the funds needed to travel to different conventions that I\u0027m not invited as a guest to. I\u0027ve never been able to do this before and would love to be your Butterfly and fly right to where you are! This will allow me to expand my convention tours!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically what I\u0027m saying here, is that with your amazing help, I\u0027ll be able to give you the VERY BEST of me. Together we can escape to go on the most fun of geeky adventures, play together, review new anime, games, comics, makeup, manga, EVERYTHING!!! Bring your favorite characters to LIFE, learn together, BE SEXY! Laugh and have fun, and let this Butterfly soar to higher heights! I want to grow and give back to all of you who have been there for me and have brought me to where I am today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you choose to accompany me on this adventure, I THANK YOU SO DAMN MUCH!
