    "summary": "Hi! and welcome to my Patreon page! Thank you for dropping by!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAllow me to introduce myself. My name is Christine Slagman..... but you probably already knew that. You may have seen my name around voice acting projects, mainly in Skyrim mods. Maybe you have listened to some of my covers. Otherwise I might be a stranger to you who rather spends a lot of time on the computer xD\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSince 2010 I have dived in the world of media. While drawing was my main thing back in the day, I have developed a hobby into audio which mostly took over. I shyly started with voice acting and at the same time also uploaded a cover once in a while. Now that hobby has turned into something bigger, something I don\u0027t want to let go of. I have graduaded in media design and aim to continue this road to creativity. At the moment there sadly isn\u0027t much work to be found in the Netherlands, but a good thing the internet exists!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere you can find some samples of what I do and what you can expect to see on Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yLaaxMFhwqA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a website where you can show support to creators who work on projects they enjoy. You can compare it to Kickstarter in a way, only instead of a one time donation, Patreon is an ongoing support system that goes into the form of a monthly contribution or per creation offered. The cool thing is that every supporter receives rewards for their genorosity! By donating $1,- or more, you\u0027ll be included in a community in which you can take a closer look into someone\u0027s creative process. And depending on how much you contribute, you can receive all sorts of personal goodies!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you rather want to donate once, you can donate through my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://paypal.me/ChristineSlagman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePaypal\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love being creative and would like to share more with you! This website is an ideal place to start a fun and supporting community in which we can help each other out and help each other grow. For me, and hopefully for you, it will be an inspirational place where we can showcase what we are proud of. Your voice will be heard and any feedback or idea will be appreciated.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided to give Patreon a shot to improve in what I am working on and to be closer connected with you guys. While I have software available, I aim to improve the quality of my works. \u00a0Some of that sadly requires some money which I unfortunately don\u0027t have a lot of. With Patreon it also gives an opportunity to turn a hobby into a job and thus more content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, becoming a Patron is completely optional. It\u0027s fantastic if you choose to help out, but know that every form of support, whether it\u0027s a message or you viewing a video of mine is so much appreciated. It means a lot to me that you already spend time watching my work and I truly thank you for that. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
