This isn\u0027t great since I love creating so much and want to be able to deliver my absolute best to everyone.I would really love to have the opportunity to continue learning and fine tuning my skills to become the type of artist I want to be and deliver high quality content to everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso,if it\u0027s not too much to ask I\u0027d also like to be able to give back to some of the content creators that have inspired me and my work for years but haven\u0027t been able to due to the aforementioned financial block.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any of this sounds compelling and you would like to help me out,thank you so much! I\u0027m eternally grateful and appreciative!\u003cbr\u003eIf not,that\u0027s totally cool as well! I\u0027m thankful you\u0027ve decided to take the time to read this or even check out my content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few disclosures:\u003cbr\u003e-All funds raised on this page are strictly meant for supporting content creation,being art supplies/video capture equipment/software/lighting or small donations towards other content creators on occasion. I will disclose each purchase/decision and explain it\u0027s purpose in full if necessary\u003cbr\u003e-That said,you choosing to be a Patron is a free,self made action and does not carry any obligations. Feel free to cancel any time,for any reason without any explanation necessary\u003cbr\u003e-I will be adding some perks and incentives as a way to show my gratitude. These are subject to change at any time with prior notice based on ability and availability. This will not have an affect on my regular content\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat about wraps it up I think! Hope you have a great day!"
