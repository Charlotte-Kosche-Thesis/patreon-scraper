    "summary": "Hi, and welcome to Cameryn Moore\u0027s Take-Out Smut Palace and Theatrical Salon! \u003cstrong\u003eI do this work because you want it and the world needs it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConversations happen where I appear. They just do. My award-winning plays and shows are often full of sex, but they are not only, or even primarily, about sex. That just turns out to be a remarkably powerful way to get to the deep-down stuff--imagination and fear and personal autonomy and desire--all the things at the core of our human experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am the creator and sometimes-host of\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSmut Slam, \u003c/strong\u003ea family of\u00a0storytelling events dedicated to real-life, first-person sex stories. My first Smut Slam took place in Boston in February 2011. Since then, this exciting, engaging, and occasionally awkward storytelling experience has landed all over North America, the UK, Europe, and Australia. Every Smut Slam event is created with one goal in mind: \u003cstrong\u003eto facilitate an encouraging, fun, open space where audiences of all types and amounts of sexual experiences can share their own stories.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past eight years I\u0027ve established myself around the world as a thought-provoking solo playwright/performer who is unafraid to drill down to that core, with plays like \u003cem\u003ePhone Whore, slut (r)evolution, for | play\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eDesire, \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003enerdfucker\u003c/em\u003e. Among my awards are Artist Risk (2016 Vancouver Fringe), Best One (Wo)man Show (2014 Houston Fringe), Critics\u0027 Choice (2013 Houston Fringe), Best of Fest (2011 Winnipeg Fringe), Pick of the Fringe (2011 Victoria Fringe), and Best Female Solo (2010 San Francisco Fringe).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my work in theatre, I am a writer. A sidewalk pornographer, to be specific, possibly the only one in the world, certainly the only one doing it the way I do. While touring with my plays, I set up a manual typewriter on my nights off and create custom erotica for people in busy bohemian or nightlife districts. Many passersby treat my \"Smut While U Wait\" signs with fear or scorn or hilarity, even hostility, but the others who stop and ask for a piece of smut receive a supportive, non-judgmental consultation that leads to a well-crafted literary creation with their authentic desires and experiences in mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTalking about sex with strangers is my thing, in other words. Everything I do in my professional and creative life revolves around that, and every day I discover new things: about individuals, about our society, about me. I share that work and those discoveries through keeping my blog going (without ads for five years), but I\u0027m trying to get other channels open as well--a book, a podcast, a self-help advice video series. Thanks to my patrons, I can begin to tackle these creative new projects, while keeping up to date with \"reports from the field\" in phone sex and Sidewalk Smut AND continuing to create and perform challenging theatrical works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I am an award-winning playwright/performer, a sidewalk pornographer, an accidental sex educator, a lover AND a fighter, oh, yeah, and a phone sex operator. (Really. Yes. I still do it when I\u0027m not on tour.) I tour 6-7 months annually, and hole up during the winter to write new shows and get all the cooking done that I don\u0027t get to do the rest of the year. I love talking with people about sex, mostly because I hate the way our society currently dictates the terms of that discourse and I want to open it up. I write for my own blogs, and my work occasionally appears in other blogs and publications as well (Cleis Press\u0027 Best Sex Writing of 2015, for example). My Smut Stand appears on sidewalks around the world.",
