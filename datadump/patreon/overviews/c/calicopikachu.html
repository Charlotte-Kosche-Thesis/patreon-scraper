    "summary": "What do I do? I create art, yo. Mostly of organic stuff. Still can\u0027t draw Zoids. But my Frozen fanart has gotten quite popular since the film\u0027s release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027m usually known for are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Character designs\u003cbr\u003e- Pokemon teams\u003cbr\u003e- Frozen\u003cbr\u003e- Maleficent comic\u003cbr\u003e- Comics\u003cbr\u003e- Goo girls\u003cbr\u003e- Anthros\u003cbr\u003e- NSFW (but there\u0027s a big price for that, and I\u0027ll only draw certain things)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also working on a few personal projects at once! Including but not limited to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFuck You, Scooby Doo - A horror/comedy short story comic about the Scooby Doo gang during the zombie apocalypse. Some of you may remember when I started this back on Deviantart. It\u0027s still gonna happen! I just decided to take the story into a different direction, even tho it starts off exactly the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove And Hope - Title under construction. An action/comedy comic about the city\u0027s local heroine, Torpedo, and the city\u0027s local villain, Robin hood, becoming roommates oblivious to each other\u0027s secret lives. Basic concept, so what\u0027s it got to offer? Lesbians, a dominatrix, goo girls, and plenty of other goodies I think y\u0027all will really enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRed Riding Hood - Another title under construction. But its a more mature lesbian story. It was originally going to take place in a not-so-distant future utopia, but putting it in America 1920\u0027s might make things a little more familiar. Owner of a successful speakeasy in New Orleans located underneath a cozy hole-in-the-wall family restaurant, Louissa puts in an order for cherry pie. Expecting an adorable little old lady, the young Vivian delivers the pie only to find a beautiful woman. She gets involved with the business, and discovers another secret Louissa has: That she is a werewolf.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePortfolio projects:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWonderland - An Alice in Wonderland themed portfolio. A more serious take on horror, from my Scooby Doo comic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Snow Queen - Young lesbian romance, very loose retelling of one of my favorite fairy tales.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRudolph - Yes, the one and only Rudolph the Red-Nosed reindeer. Finally getting a proper revamp, unlike that last animated fiasco. Little guy deserves a good story. It borrows from the original story, but I take a lot of liberties with the characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, I would love to just have my work focused entirely on art. Drawing and designing characters is a big passion of mine. Unfortunately, it doesn\u0027t pay enough for me to live. I\u0027m sure everyone is aware of the economy at this point, so simple day jobs simply don\u0027t pay enough for the effort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you become a monthly patron\u00a0it helps me keep from struggling to pay the rent and feed myself, while at the same time allowing me to do what I love, stress-free. Eventually prints will become a thing, but for now only digital work will be done.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eAll\u003c/em\u003e patrons will get to see work in progress images that I won\u0027t post anywhere else but here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf y\u0027all are interested in Patreon exclusives, you\u0027ll be able to see more of my own personal works, as opposed to just fanart and commissions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can choose from any of the rewards below or donate whatever you feel like!  Any little bit is appreciated and goes a long way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for the love and support!"

Some of you may know me from my Jotunn Elsa comic on Tumblr, or maybe for my Pokemon team art, or Life is Strange, or perhaps from Tapas. I\u0027m striving to make a living out of what I do. But it\u0027s hard to show my full potential on just commissions alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love all of my commissioners, and I\u0027m very grateful for them helping me out and giving me the business I need to survive. But I need to expand. I need to go back to doing original work, so that I can expand a number of different portfolios, and eventually continue entertaining with art and comics without worry of whether I\u0027m going to make ends meet by the end of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a number of projects I would love to finish. Like a portfolio of animated versions of Once Upon a Time, my own personal Maleficent comic, monster art to present to various gaming companies, my bee books, and a number of other comics, children\u0027s book illustrations, and portfolios that I\u0027d love to share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s hard to make time to do them when my main source of income is commissions, and I have to constantly be taking them. I would love the support so I can go back to doing my own ideas. And with a little luck get a job out of it. And once I get that job, I can finally move to a place I love.",
