YOU\u0027RE HERE SO YOU MUST BE COOL:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, thank you \u003cstrong\u003eso much\u003c/strong\u003e for coming through and supporting my work! \u00a0In the many years since using my Mother\u0027s Minolta to take \"portraits\" of my dolls (especially my Addy American doll, she was the fiercest), my work has served as a compass guiding my personal evolution as a black woman in America, and your contribution to this creative endeavor is invaluable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY I SHOOT:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI strive to create strong, reverent, vulnerable portraits, primarily of women, within various photographic genres. I\u0027m based in Los Angeles (which is as amazing as it sounds), but from San Francisco (also super amazing) aspiring to ascend to the heights of fashion/portrait photography and lend my aesthetic to this generations\u0027 photographic representation. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY PATREON/WHAT\u0027S IN IT FOR ME (the patron)?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA friend introduced me to Patreon and I have a feeling that I will be deeply indebted to her (\u003cem\u003elike, \u0027give her my first born\u0027 deep\u003c/em\u003e) for changing the way I approach my creative career. I am very passionate about creating a conversation around my work that furthers the generalization of non-European beauty standards. Your support will not only allow me to more consistently create these images, but also to pay other talented creatives their wage to contribute their gifts (styling, makeup, editing, studio space). \u00a0Your support helps me produce images and build viable photo projects outside of the magazine/fashion/industry purview. Simply put, \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eyou\u0027re a badass patron of the arts.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI won\u0027t give us BOTH the headache of trying to parcel out \"levels of support,\" whatever you feel you want to contribute is both appreciated and humbling. So you know, ball out.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI won\u0027t keep you for long with my blah blahs, you\u0027re here for photos right?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME AND ENCOURAGEMENT.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e"
