I am Cheetahs, a furry writer who specializes in feral characters but who doesn\u0027t shy from writing about anthros and humans too. Right now, my bread and butter is fantasy, along with the species associated with it. Dragons and gryphons are my all time favorite fantasy species, and you can be sure they will make their appearance quite often in my stories. I also hold a deep level of affection for feral/anthro characters of all sorts, especially felines and canines. After all, we all have our loves :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo help you envision my characters better, or the scenarios they go through, I use a portion of this money to commission artworks that bring color and life to my stories. So, as you can see, the money I get from this endeavor is funneled back into the furry community through the commission I purchase, so that I can support other artists just the way you support me here ^^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e It goes without saying that your support is invaluable to me. It does not only provide me with financial comfort, but it allows me to commission more artworks for all of us to enjoy and it paves the way towards goals that include story requests and illustrated stories in which you, the patrons, get to have a saying on! There are so many wonderful things I can achieve with your help, so if you find my aspirations to be worth your money, then please pledge yourself to my worthy cause. With so many rewards to choose from, it\u0027s hard to say no to it, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease take heed that most of the content posted on this Patreon account is NSFW, but that\u0027s what most of you are here for, so just enjoy yourselves ^^\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
