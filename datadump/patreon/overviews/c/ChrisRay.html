Thank you for visiting my \u003cstrong\u003eOfficial Patreon Page. \u003c/strong\u003eEven if you aren\u0027t supporting the channel through this avenue, it means a lot that you even thought to consider it. Thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe video you see above is the perfect example of the content that I would like to continue making. Long form, highly edited, commentary with sketches, proper camera work and collaborative elements.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create video content, normally political but not exclusively. With YouTube continually proving itself to be unstable, creators who spend a lot of time crafting a single projects like the one linked above need to look elsewhere to be able to continue creating. Consider supporting if you are able to. There are now rewards and you can set a monthly cap to avoid paying any amount you feel is too much. This and merchandise are the best ways to support creators like me, who\u0027s content normally get\u0027s flagged by YouTube\u0027s demonetization system.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for visiting and considering. It means so much.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027ve always wanted to fly my best friend from the UK out here to work with me as my cameraman and pay him well. This would mean more field videos (like the Franchesca Ramsey video) and more opportunities to collaborate with the creators you love. The goal is high because I wanted everyone who works for me to be as well of as I\u0027d be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis would help\u00a0facilitate a consistent Snark Tank Podcast and more frequent high quality content.
