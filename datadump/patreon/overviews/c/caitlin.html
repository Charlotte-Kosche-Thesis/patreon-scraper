Thanks for checking out my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShort story:\u003c/strong\u003e If you\u0027d like to help me release music and music videos more regularly, as well as help me boost the quality of the videos I do release - please consider becoming my Patron and you\u0027ll be doing just that!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNot so short story...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause the majority of my supporters are spread somewhere between South America - Indonesia and indeed nowhere near South Africa; YouTube is currently the best way for me to perform for everyone that can\u0027t see me LIVE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMyself and a group of 2-3 incredibly talented friends of mine have handled every element of most of my videos to date. From composing, recording, producing, mastering of music to styling the videos (set design, make-up, bodypainting), to direction and filming to editing and special effects - we do it all ourselves and in my friends\u0027 cases - they do it all for me. \u003cem\u003eI have used production companies in the past but it would have been too expensive to carry on doing so and release videos as regularly as I\u0027d like to.\u003c/em\u003e My friends and I learn something new every time we work together and more importantly we all love what we do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInitial Goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027d really like to be able to start paying all the creative crazies that help me more/at all (even if it\u0027s just a tiny amount) for their efforts\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUp the production levels on future videos - maybe with your help I can do just that!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eWorld Domination!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMy ultimate\ngoal is to one day be able to afford to travel and put on real life performances near the people\nthat want to see me perform the most. I need to keep producing\nvideos to get myself out there and stay creative (and sane) and keep entertaining\nyou guys. I\u2019m a performer first and foremost; if you\nguys help me out even the smallest amount could lead to the biggest mostest\nspecialist opportunities someday. \n\n\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon-ize me!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider becoming my Patron for $1 per music video (only if you can afford it/have the means to do so!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can set your monthly limit as low as you\u0027d like so even if I release a ridiculous number of music videos in a month you won\u0027t go over budget. I\u0027d like to try and release one music video a month. Vlogs and any extras do NOT count as Patreon funded videos - I\u0027ll only claim the loot for music videos of covers as well as originals that I need help to produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanking you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf what I do excites or inspires you - and you can\u0027t afford to be my Patron then pretty-please just share my music and videos with the world and I\u0027ll love you anyway.\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for reading all of this.\u003cbr\u003eCaitlin x\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePs.
