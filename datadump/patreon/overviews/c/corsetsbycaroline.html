    "summary": "Precision patterning in AutoCAD is my obsession - I\u00a0am researching the wonderful historical world of corsetry, creating unique and contemporary designs as well as bringing forgotten patterns to a modern audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am fanatical about corsets and a complete cadaholic. I have been using AutoCAD for many years and started creating my own patterns in 2014 which are commercially available through Etsy and my website \u003ca href=\"http://www.corsetsbycaroline.co.uk.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.corsetsbycaroline.co.uk.\u003c/a\u003e It is a marriage made in heaven for me and I have taken some time off from my paid employment to explore and develop this artform. I want to bring to life the historical patterns of the past, but give them a modern twist for the discerning corset maker of today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron of mine you will share my love of corsets and make them for yourself, friends or clients.\u00a0You might be frustrated at the number and variety\u00a0of patterns commercially available - it is a very niche market after all. You might not have the time to draft numerous patterns in different sizes - it is a time-consuming affair. You will relish the challenge of a new corset pattern for very little outlay,\u00a0and maybe just like the idea that somebody has taken on the challenge of patterning designs that were once\u00a0ubiquitous but have been lost in the midst of time. You may not make every pattern of course but the designs may inspire you and you are perfectly at liberty to amend them to suit your own needs and designs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor anyone pledging for corset patterns (known here as rewards)\u00a0there will be under-busts, over-busts, cupped corsets, 10 - 20-panelled corsets. There will be gores and gussets.\u00a0There will be full instructions. All patterns will be graded from size\u00a010 -\u00a020 (UK), 6-16 (US). For anyone pledging smaller amounts there will be information - hint, tips and photos of what I\u0027m working on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease check out my work on my website \u003ca href=\"http://www.corsetsbycaroline.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.corsetsbycaroline.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCover photo: Model and photography - Liv Free\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
