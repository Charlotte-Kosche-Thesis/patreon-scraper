I\u0027m a struggling artist who has been discouraged from pursuing anything more than the occasional drawing for much of my life, trying to finally eke out something for myself. I am currently homeless, and it is extremely difficult to find a safe place to stay, let alone ample opportunity to draw, but I am doing my best, and I would really appreciate any support that people are willing to offer.\u003cbr\u003eBesides traditional artwork, I have also been writing for most of my life, and I have a significant reserve of characters that I\u0027ve been trying to flesh out a setting for. A fair goal for me would be to give shape to this world and these characters in a way that others beside myself can enjoy, and perhaps in time I can do just that with your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
