So with much of the same encouragement; I\u0027ve decided that if i can go full-time into this, I can deliver not just with greater quantity (but that\u0027s never a bad thing) but also greater quality.\u00a0 If the pledges reach or exceed the monthly amounts, there is no doubt that with the time it affords me, I can concentrate all of that into doing what I love most, which is what the fans love as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith some extras thrown in, there\u0027s more than just time. It can open the possibilities of being able to host more content and even upgrade the blog into something that definitely suits our needs. As of the time of writing, my current host for my works is already halfway through, and therefore, if we can pool our resources together we can make room for the doubtless more that\u0027s to come. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, extra funding will allow me to secure a premium for my site, allowing the hosting of media files and enhanced storage.
