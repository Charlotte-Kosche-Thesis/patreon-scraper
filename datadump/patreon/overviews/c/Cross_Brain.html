We are the Cross-Brain, a joint account held between three writers who have found that they work together exceptionally well. These three writers are The Patient One, who functions as our creative Id, CV12Hornet, who functions as our detail-attentive Superego, and Xomniac, who serves as an imaginative bridge between the two.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe supremely enjoy writing our stories for the world, and seeing how fun writing is, we thought that we might as well try and use Patreon to do the one thing they said you \u003cem\u003ecouldn\u0027t\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0do with writing skills: make a profit! XD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAh, but seriously, folks.\u00a0We put a lot of work into our stories to get them out in a timely manner, but alas, life has its obligations, and at times it necessarily delays us from meeting together and writing out our chapters. We certainly don\u0027t want this thing to take too much of a backseat with how fun it is, so we\u0027re trying to make it beneficial both through the sheer enjoyment of writing and through the reward of a cash influx to boot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeep in mind though that this is just meant to be a \u003cem\u003ebonus\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0for us. We genuinely enjoy writing our stories, and even should this Patreon account flop, then we\u0027ll just shrug, dust ourselves off and keep. Moving. \u003cem\u003eForwards.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Because at the end of the day... we love writing, and that\u0027s what\u0027s important.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut rest assured, this Patreon \u003cem\u003ewon\u0027t \u003c/em\u003ebe a one-way street! By funding our stories, you\u0027ll be giving us money we can put towards improving your reading experience, primarily by hiring the ever-expensive services of artists to render images of our stories! For every goal met, yet another commission will be, well, commissioned! Heck, who knows; fund us enough and we might even see about turning this story into a straight-up comic! It all depends on how well this venture goes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, with that said, feel free to read, review and enjoy our stories on Fanfiction.Net, Spacebattles, and Sufficient Velocity Forums, where Xomniac is posting our current primary project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting, and thanks even more for your Patronage!"
