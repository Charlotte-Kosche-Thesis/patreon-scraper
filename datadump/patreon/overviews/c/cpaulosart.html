In addition to having her work featured in two books, Garden Of Eye Candy and La Luz de Jesus 25: The Little Gallery That Could. Her films have screened at festivals in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and she has collaborated with numerous puppeteers to create toy theatre puppetry performances.  She recently completed an animation short for the \u201cLife Is Beautiful Festival\u201d located in Downtown Las Vegas. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA BFA graduate of the California Institute of the Arts, Paulos grew up in the San Fernando Valley but has made Las Vegas her home since 2002. She has been the recipient of several grants from the Nevada Arts Council, including twice winning the NAC\u0027s Jackpot Grant and a 2008 Artist Fellowship, as well as a 2005 Sesame Street Workshop Scholarship. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an artist, Paulos incorporates a variety of materials and techniques, including ink, paint, dye, handmade paper, canvas, wood and mixed media. Her work is a mixture of fine art and illustration, primarily focusing on imagery of twinned and mirrored characters, as well as portraiture and imagery and subject matter drawn from life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cMy artwork derives from life, juxtaposed with the cartoon world,\u201d says Paulos. \u201cMy art is created from the philosophies of drawing. Using these philosophies, my goal is to reveal the marks and capture the articles we often remove from ourselves and in our personal identities whether in cartoon form or from life, of the perception. These would including our flaws, our uncomfortableness and our explorations of our own vulnerabilities when truly, completely naked, apart from our bodies and form. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cUsing the materials of drawing loose graphite, charcoal, sumi inks, dyes, found material and handmade papers, I hope to create work which show the organic foundations of humanness.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
