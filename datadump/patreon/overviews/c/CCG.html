We not only want followers of competitive Halo, Smash Bros, and Evolve to have a community where they can get their fix of competitive content whether it be the results of the latest competitive tournament for their favorite game, or whether it be who\u0027s doing what in the competitive community, but we even want the fans contribute to the community themselves! Making maps in Halo? Contact us and show us some of your stuff and you may get featured on the channel and get your name and content out there!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn our YouTube channel we cover eSports news, Halo map features like in the video above, tips and tricks, and of course some competitive gameplay! It isn\u0027t just about the fans though! For up and coming competitors, we plan on launching competitive tournaments in Halo, Super Smash Bros. 4, Project M, Evolve, Pokemon, and more within the next year and half here in sunny San Diego, California! If all this doesn\u0027t tickle your fancy, we also stream to Twitch on a regular basis! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll support from patrons will go towards furthering the channel and our endeavors. As far as what we can give to you, patrons may be eligible to get into and participate in our future tournaments and events for free! Keep in mind that these events are not going to be possible for quite some time so it will be a while before this will be an option, but we may be able to come up with some fun controller and/or headset giveaways until then! And of course we encourage our patrons to show us their content! We want to find up and coming talent whether they be awesome competitors or epic map makers and let us help them show their content to the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope fans of the competitive eSports community join us in our goal to create a more unified world for competitive gaming! See you on the battlefield!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- aardvark, Founder of Competitive Console Gaming\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore success comes competition."
