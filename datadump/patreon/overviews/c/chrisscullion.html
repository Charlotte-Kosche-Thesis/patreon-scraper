Although I was best known for writing for Official Nintendo Magazine UK, Nintendo Gamer and CVG, I\u0027ve also written for the likes of Vice, Official Xbox Magazine UK, Official PlayStation Magazine UK, GamesTM, Gamesmaster and Red Bull.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Sqwe9lF.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince mid-2015 I\u0027ve been doing freelance work while slowly building my own games site,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tiredoldhack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTired Old Hack\u003c/a\u003e. Now that the foundations have been laid it\u0027s time for me to take it to the next step and try to turn it into a regularly updated website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you aren\u0027t familiar with my work, my writing style is laid back and conversational. I try to make it funny when possible, but there\u0027s always clear passion there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been gaming for 30 years now \u2013 my first consoles were my NES and my dad\u0027s Atari 2600 \u2013 and my love for games has never wavered, so while my site covers new games there\u0027s also a heavy focus on retro.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tiredoldhack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTired Old Hack\u003c/a\u003e (or alternatively\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tiredoldhack.com/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis profile page\u003c/a\u003e explaining a bit more about me) and if you like what you see please do consider chucking a little my way to support my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have big dreams for Tired Old Hack, but those will come later as new goals are reached. For now, I\u0027m realistic: let\u0027s see where we can get with it. This will very much be a slow burner and I\u0027m dedicated to growing the site\u0027s popularity and hoping the Patron count will grow organically as a result.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: Although there are numerous rewards for being one of my Patrons, none of my planned website content will be made exclusive. I don\u0027t believe in punishing those who may not be able to afford to pay for my work, so any contributions you make will go towards improving the site and updating it more regularly, not focusing my attention away from it."
