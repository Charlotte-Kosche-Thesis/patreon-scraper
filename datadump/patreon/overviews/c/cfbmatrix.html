In addition I have done thousands of segments on radio shows nationwide in an effort to build awareness to my work.\u00a0 The downside is the public, in general, is focused less on written work and more on audio/video and expects content for free.\u00a0 That\u0027s great if you own a huge site that can survive off click and page views and a lot of mind numbing subjects.\u00a0 My way of thinking and what I produce cannot.\u00a0 I will post a video that goes into greater detail of what I hope to accomplish and provide with my Patreon account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e For starters the goal is a minimum of a weekly podcast detailing each CFB week, CFB picks/leans in season and pre-season, NFL pick projections and upset alerts plus a weekly patron Q\u0026amp;A. In the off-season, I\u0027ll post recruiting trends and charts, recruiting profiles from every school, spring guides as available, all team stats, player stats, team schedules and team profiles.\u00a0 The difference between Tier I and Tier II is spreadsheets.\u00a0 Tier II members get access to our excel sheets we make.\u00a0 We can make anything to save you a ton of time, just ask.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll members get a follow on Twitter and I\u0027ll send you my cell phone for texting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
