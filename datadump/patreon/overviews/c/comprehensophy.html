With each person that joins us and sees what we\u0027re doing, this takes on greater meaning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour support will help us spend more time on this and help to take this further and have greater influence.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 We\u0027re grateful for your interest in our work and hope you continue to enjoy."

     "about": "Most people are not driven by any values of\ntheir own. Understanding why this happens and what this means takes some\neducation and thinking. Our problem now is a culture of thinking.\u00a0Thus far, there has only been a tiny few who have been able to think and act highly independently to escape this (think Ghandi, Steve Jobs, Walt Whitman, Thoreau, and many others to varying degrees.). They managed to do this because of their assumptions about the nature of man, society, and nature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019d like to attempt to democratise these principles, once and for all.\u00a0 Some, throughout history (Socrates, Buckminster Fuller, etc.), have made steps towards this.\u00a0 We are at a critical point in the development of our\ncivilisation, and we need to change the discourse.\u00a0 If these insights continue to be understood by only very few,\nit could be very dangerous. At best, it would squander most of our potential\nas a species. To do this, none of us need anything more than a shift in\nawareness. It\u0027s simple and free. Where Comprehensophy fits in is in raising awareness of this need\nand providing the necessary tools to facilitate this shift.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will be used to fund the incubation of this project. It will be used to fund advertising to get free resources in the hands of more people. You will contribute to the dissemination of wisdom. Your contribution excites us because it means that these critical values are finding a material foothold in today\u0027s world.",
