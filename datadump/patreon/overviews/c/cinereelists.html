    "summary": "The Cinereelists is a twice-weekly podcast focused on film, lists of films, games tangentially associated to films, and anything else film-related that we decide to throw into the mix over time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Appeal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Cinereelists is a very special movie-podcast to us. As life-long movie fans the dream was to create a show that is wholly ours, produced on our own terms, and presented in a way that highlights great work while maintaining the fun sensibilities of the films we all have grown up with and into and love to obsess over. We feel we\u0027ve accomplished that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we can do so much more! Fans of the show have been supportive beyond our wildest dreams so far and the reaction has inspired us to go out on a limb and ask you to trust us with your hard earned dollar. We are serious about making the Cinereelists a \u201cthing\u201d and we want you along for the ride. Your pledge will not only go to helping out two independent artists but it will also help us to make the Cinereelists bigger and better and more often for you the listener - and in return we\u2019ve gathered up some awesome rewards to say thanks for the vote of confidence."
