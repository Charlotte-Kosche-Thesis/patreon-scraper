    "summary": "Hello, My name is Jack, online i\u0027m \"Captain Jack.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo give you a little bit of information about myself, i started making YouTube videos back in 2010 (Feel old writing that) but didn\u0027t take it \"fully\" seriously until 2015. Gaming is a super strong passion of mine, mostly stemming from playing classics like Star Wars Rouge Squadron (N64) but now i have found \"Space Engineers\" which allows me to create epic series and videos for everyone enjoyment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you might imagine, producing multiple videos a week can take a lot of time. Especially when editing comes into play. One of my primary principles for YouTube is Quality over Quantity, and it always will be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs i move into 2018 i want to up the quality even more on my videos, I\u0027ve started to introduce \"Multi-Cam\" into my Space Engineers Colony Survival series, this is one step along a very long path to even better videos some of the next steps include more POV\u0027s in main series as well as better upload schedules = more content for everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am i asking for your support? Simply put, i would like to be in a position where i have the ability to create fantastic and amazing content for everyone without having to worry about making ends meet all the tine. This would allow me to spend more time on creating content for you to watch and enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is some of the rewards i offer to my Patrons:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSpace Engineers Server access (Faction Wars)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBe in videos! (EPIC Battles etc.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBehind the Scenes access (Red Wood / Planet Wars / Enigma)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAnd many more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately money is needed for survival.\u003cbr\u003eAny donations that are received will be used to support myself but primarily build out the channel to create amazing new content for you all to enjoy! Regardless if you chose to donate or not i still extremely appreciate the support everyone gives to myself and the channel!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time!\u003cbr\u003e- Jack"
