What originally started as a simple gaming channel has grown into a production team which brings you 3 Channels worth of content. It was at the start of 2015 that we decided to expand beyond what was capable of two people. Things only ramped up from there as we tried our best to bring daily content to the channels. But anyone who has been around for awhile will be well aware of the fact we can barely make that happen with the primary Comicstorian channel, never mind trying to do it on the gaming channels and Manga Channels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/GDsTR2R.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to maintain content on all 3 channels because we cover such a broad scope of video games, comic books and Manga that the best way to cover everything an try to make everyone happy is to provide daily content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/sr4wliJ.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to keep up with daily content (Situations do happen, but overall it should be daily) on all of our projects we need to not be panicing and growing anxious over decisions that Youtube is making. So we would like to feel more secure here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e"
