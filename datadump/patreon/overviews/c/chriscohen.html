    "summary": "Hello, I\u0027m Chris!\u003cp\u003eA load of you will know me as the Cat vs Printer guy. Essentially, I take animal videos from the World of the internet, and add voices to the animals to give them even more personality (and hopefully make them funnier).\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo far a RIDICULOUS amount of you have watched my videos, millions of you in fact, and that\u0027s incredibly overwhelming but also makes me feel like I should be giving you all more. Loads of my videos have comments like \u0027Please make more of these!\u0027 and \u0027Please try and make these longer!\u0027 and \u0027I thought this was going to be a Justin Timberlake video.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo with my Patreon page, I am hoping to give you all what you\u0027ve been asking for. It\u0027s really difficult to find the time to do these at present, and the reason they are so sporadic and short is because I have to squeeze them into little free periods of my life. What I\u0027d love to do is to be able to set whole chunks of my time aside and make great videos for you lot to enjoy AND make them even better. It\u0027s loads of fun making these clips using uploaded content, but there\u0027s loads more I could be doing with specially shot content and higher quality clips. I\u0027d also love to be able to up the production values and make them sound and look better than they currently do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, this all takes money and time.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSoooo here\u0027s what I\u0027m proposing. If you amazing folks wouldn\u0027t mind donating anything, even if its a dollar a video, all the money I raise I\u0027ll reinvest in making more, better, longer videos for you. It\u0027ll give me more time and opportunity to create more content, so everyone wins!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not asking you to buy anything, or commit a huge wad of cash, just give what you think the clips are worth and donate an amount that you think is fair to see more. I can\u0027t promise 500 a week, they still take quite some time to do, but I can promise there will be more and they will be better and they will make you laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo for more videos like these:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5ok5KhpXkk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5ok5KhpXkk\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJRxK8PNDF4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJRxK8PNDF4\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT4XdWuwoNs\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT4XdWuwoNs\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease become a patron and we\u0027ll have lots of fun.
