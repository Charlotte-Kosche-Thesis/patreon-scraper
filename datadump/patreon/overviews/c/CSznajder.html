    "summary": "My name is Corey Sznajder. I used to run the Carolina Hurricanes blog,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.shutdownline.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eShutdown Line,\u003c/a\u003e and something I was known for was tracking stats like scoring chances, zone entries \u0026amp; zone exits and using them in my game recaps. I did this for three years until 2014 when I started the All Three Zones Project where I tracked zone entries \u0026amp; zone exits for every NHL game in the 2013-14 season. The data was released in the fall of 2015 and is available for purchase\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://t.co/uxdOpqM2dz\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. Now, I\u0027m looking to do the same thing for the 2016-17 season, only I plan to start at the beginning of the season and have the stats posted in more real-time. My goal is to have the full season tracked not too long after it is completed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have spent the last two years working as a consultant for an NHL team and the most fun I had writing about hockey and doing this type of analysis was when I was working publicly a couple years ago. The discussions were usually great and it was cool to see what people were doing with the data I tracked, which is why I\u0027m looking to do this again for the 2016-17 season and hopefully more beyond that. To get an idea of what I hope to accomplish,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://the10c.proboards.com/post/212058/thread\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003echeck out my series on the 2015-16 NHL Playoffs\u003c/a\u003e and the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://theenergyline.wordpress.com/playoff-data-archives/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edata archive\u003c/a\u003e I\u0027ve been posting at the end of every round. I want to have an archive like this available for every team next year and hopefully the two years before that. This type of data is very interesting and really important when it comes to analyzing teams, players \u0026amp; systems, but multiple seasons worth of it aren\u0027t available anywhere and I\u0027m aiming to change that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can imagine, collecting this data is extremely time consuming and labor intensive, so any sort of funding provided is appreciated. Whether it\u0027s to cover server costs for the eventual web site or to keep the internet running at my house, anything helps. I\u0027m trying to think of some reward levels \u0026amp; cool ideas for this page (maybe giving first priority to people who donate?), but I\u0027ll iron out those details later. As of right now, the data is going to be hosted on my blog, The Energy Line, and I\u0027ll have the raw data shared in a Dropbox file, but it will be open to the public for everyone to use and I\u0027ll be making advancements as the site continues to grow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also open to suggestions on stats you feel I should track since I want this to be a cool, interactive project. If you want a list of what I\u0027m going to be tracking for this coming year, check out the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://theenergyline.wordpress.com/stats-i-track/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eglossary page\u003c/a\u003e on my blog.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not interested in pledging per month and still want to support this, you can visit my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/CoreySzn\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePayPal page\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
