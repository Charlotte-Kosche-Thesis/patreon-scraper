    "summary": "Hello! \u00a0I am Crystal Allen, a fine art photographer \u0026amp; nature enthusiast. \u00a0I create fine art portraits of women utilizing natural light. \u00a0I travel all over the US, meeting amazing women and making images that showcase their spirit and erotic femininity. \u00a0My portraits are of women for women. \u00a0They are a celebration, and are meant to inspire. \u00a0This doesn\u0027t mean that they cannot be enjoyed by men, it just means that I make them with the intention of inspiring women to celebrate themselves, their bodies, and their sexuality. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs an artist, I have found it forever challenging \u0026amp; frustrating to create the work that I feel passionate about, while at the same time trying to make it financially viable. \u00a0Patreon allows individuals to support an artist and the work that they are compelled to create, whether or not that work is financially viable at that moment. \u00a0It allows for the art to be created. \u00a0And that is what is most important. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to reach more women. \u00a0To travel to more incredible scenic locations. \u00a0To create more work. \u00a0My patreon page is the first place that I will share my work (and in most cases the only place I will share full sets), and with the most in depth look at my process. \u00a0Any contribution made will go towards my creative projects: paying models, traveling to shoot locations, equipment upgrades, and book production. \u00a0I have been donating to the Veerni Institute (a project that works to provide education to girls and young women in rural India), and any support here will help to continue that, and hopefully increase it. \u00a0Thank you so much for your support! \u00a0xoxoxo\u003cbr\u003e"
