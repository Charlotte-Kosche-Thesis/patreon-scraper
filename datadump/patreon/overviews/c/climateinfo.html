    "summary": "I have been working on responses\nto climate change and climate change decision-making for almost 30 years. I\u2019ve\nserved on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and worked with organizations around the world\non almost everything to do with climate change. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhether\ncalling it climate change or global warming, almost all climate scientists\ncharacterize as dangerous our departure from the \u201cclimatic normal\u201d human\nsocieties have evolved in over the last 10,000 years. But if it\u2019s that\ndangerous, why haven\u2019t we done more to prevent it? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOne\nreason is the enormous gap between our collective knowledge about climate\nchange and individual decision-making when it comes to climate change, as reflected\nin Carla O\u2019Dell\u2019s \u201c[I]f only we knew what we know\u201d quote. Notwithstanding and\nto some extent because of virtually unlimited collective knowledge regarding\nthe science, risks, and solutions to climate change,  individuals rarely spot the\n\u201cactionable knowledge\u201d that would significantly influence \u003cstrong\u003etheir\u003c/strong\u003e decisions as concerned citizens, business executives, or policy makers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInadequate access\nto actionable climate knowledge is the biggest barrier we face in\ntackling climate change, and it is only getting harder every year. Your social media streams do little but confirm your current views. Google almost any climate-relevant search term or question\nand you\u2019ll get millions of hits. How many do you look at? How much of the information do you remember a month later?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBased on our 20+ years working on climate change, and a longstanding interest in knowledge management, about six years ago my environmental lawyer\nwife and I started building an \u201cactionable knowledge\u201d solution for climate\nchange. We call it the \u003ca href=\"http://www.theclimateweb.com/\"\u003eClimate Web\u003c/a\u003e,\nand it uses powerful \u003ca href=\"http://www.thebrain.com/\"\u003eTheBrain\u00ae\u003c/a\u003e software\nto organize information in ways that make it accessible to anyone interested in climate change,\nfrom concerned citizens and philanthropists to business executives and policy\nmakers. It starts by linking more than 40,000 books, reports, journal articles, news\nstories, videos, and websites, with new materials added almost daily. But the\nClimate Web also does much more, extracting and linking together thousands of\nindividual ideas and powerful graphics that can help deliver knowledge that can influence perceptions and decisions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"height: 0;\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vd8jwvHidCc?ecver=2\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the process of building the Climate Web I suspect we\u2019ve read more\nclimate-related literature, visited more climate-related websites, and watched\nmore climate-related videos than any other two people on the planet. The\nClimate Web has turned into a massive resource that we\u0027re confident can help make a\ndifference on climate change.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\nhave gone to great lengths to make the Climate Web an open-access resource that\nanyone can use. Want to\nlearn about climate science, how to communicate climate change, or what experts\nare forecasting when it comes to a low-carbon transition? It\u2019s in the Climate\nWeb. Want to find out what experts are saying about carbon pricing and\ncap-and-trade policy? It\u0027s in the Climate Web. In fact, if there is an answer\nto climate change it\u0027s probably in the Climate Web! The Climate Web can save you hours, days, or even more of your time. It can point you to great resources you would never otherwise see. It can help you think about climate change or climate change\nsolutions in a completely new way. It can provide you with all kinds of new resources\nfor communicating with or teaching others about climate change. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve only scratched the surface of what you can find in the\nClimate Web; in fact, its sheer size is the biggest challenge users face in using the Climate\nWeb. After investing 16,000 hours in building\nthe Climate Web, this Patreon project has two goals: 1) to help us keep the Climate Web open access; and 2) to help users more easily access their specific actionable\nknowledge in the Climate Web.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe\nsolution is Climate Web Doorways:\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAudience Doorways\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003elead to curated collections aimed at the needs of particular user audiences, from\n\u201cConcerned Individuals\u201d to \u201cCorporate Risk Managers\u201d and \u201cK-12 Teachers.\u201d\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTopic Doorways\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0lead to curated collections that help you understand and track important climate topics, from\na \"2oC Climate Target\u201d to the Water-Food-Energy Nexus\u201d and \u201cExtreme\nEvents.\u201d\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ePersonal Doorways\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0lead to curated collections customized for individual users,\u00a0and\ncan include an eclectic collection of resources from all over the Climate Web.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eDoorways mean you don\u0027t have to try and keep track of where you saw great resources in the Climate Web, and retrace your steps every time you go in.

     "about": "I have advised clients around the world on\nclimate change risk and risk management for more than 25 years. My work on\nclimate change began in 1988 when I joined the World Resources Institute in\nWashington, DC. When we returned to the West Coast in 1991 I founded Trexler\nClimate + Energy Services, working with electric sector and other energy\nclients, manufacturers ranging from Nike to Stonyfield Farm, NGOs, and national\nand international governmental agencies on all aspects of climate change. I\u2019m\nproud of our many accomplishments including working on the first carbon mitigation\nprojects, taking the first company carbon neutral, developing the first carbon\nmarket model, and working as part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange. In 2007 we sold TC+ES to a global firm where I directed global\nconsulting operations across 20 countries. I later was Director of Climate Risk\nfor the Oslo-based global risk management firm Det Norske Veritas (DNV) from\n2009-2012. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve published widely on climate change, carbon markets, and risk\nmanagement, with a particular focus on ensuring the environmental integrity of climate\npolicies and market mechanisms. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eToday\nI see the barriers to getting \u201cthe right climate information to the right decision-maker\nat the right time\u201d as the biggest problem we face in accelerating a low-carbon\ntransition. My Climate Web project is specifically intended to help overcome\nthat problem, and with Patreon I hope to accomplish more!\u003cbr\u003e",
