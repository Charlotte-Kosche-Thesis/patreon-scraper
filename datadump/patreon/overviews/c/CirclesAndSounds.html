     "about": "About Jesse:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello! My name is Jesse Donovan. I am a composer. I am an artist and musician. I perform in sounds and colors. My life is not about me; it is about what I can give to others. Where I am trained and gifted, experienced and impassioned, I long to share, to touch lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy father introduced me to the love of all things musical and artistic, getting me involved from the time that I was old enough to press a record button on a tape deck or hold an instrument while he set up the mic\u0027s. Both of my parents always encouraged me to pursue my passions for music, art, and media, and I began composing and performing in professional capacities before I furthered my music and arts education in college. In the 10 years since graduating college, I have employed my abilities in every way that I can in order to reach out and share my passion with others, hoping to spark something of life and joy within them. For years, my work was more pronounced in localized groups and venues. I am now working with my lovely wife, Kara, to launch an online platform that will allow us, together, to reach, and hopefully touch with meaning, more lives than we\u0027ve been able to in public and private venues on the east coast of the US.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that art and music should speak with flexibility and power to people in all walks of life, to their needs, addressing them in a way that words never can. That\u0027s what we aim for in our work, coming from our hearts with specific meaning to us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in ardent study and practice in order to create and perform skillfully with passion, originality, and versatility. If my art and music touches one life, that, to me, is success.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout Kara:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was a skinny, uncoordinated teenager with no sense of spacial awareness. When I was 13, I had a friend who was a jazz dancer. She was limber, graceful, and confident, the kind of girl that teenage boys brought their friends to gawk at in sheepish awe. The first time I tried to dance, I was ecstatic. It felt liberating. My friend laughed until she cried.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years afterward, I told people that I couldn\u0027t dance, despite the fact that I desperately wanted to learn. Then, I discovered hooping. At 21, the hoop taught me movement that did not come naturally at 13. When people ask how I learned, they\u0027re usually surprised that the answer is YouTube. Now, three years later, it seems fitting that we\u0027ve started our own channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027m outside of the hoop, I\u0027m a poet, an editor, a painter, and a teacher. I\u0027ve found that my chosen mediums are interconnected. Hooping is a kind of improvisational poetry \u2014 patterns of motion and rhythm that are unique and transformative. When my husband and I began dating, we talked about establishing an organization to bring the arts into economically disadvantaged areas. Circles and Sounds was conceived from this desire, in hopes that our ability to reach the global community will allow us to inspire, encourage, and unite other artists and introduce a new blend of expressions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for joining us!\u003cbr\u003e",
