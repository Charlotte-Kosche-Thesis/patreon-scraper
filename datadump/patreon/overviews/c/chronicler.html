    "summary": "All the Chronicles of Adalmearc are made freely available to the public. The hours of labour involved are done by the volunteers at the Society of Bibliology, and all costs are born by the main creator, i.e. me. The reasoning is that art should not come with a price tag, and everybody should have the possibility to enjoy it regardless of financial circumstances. The Society is committed to this principle and will never charge for any of the Chronicles. Of course, with financial support, more works can be made and done so faster. If you have enjoyed reading from the Annals and wish to show your appreciation, or you are anxiously awaiting to read more and wish to speed up the process, any donation (of any amount) that you can afford will go towards this effort.\u003cbr\u003e"

Apart from the book, the patron will receive either a dedication including this information (that this is a first edition) or a letter from the author proving this, should the patron not desire a dedication. Be aware that this is the only difference at all from the book received in this reward and the one at 100. They are identical in every way, except this reward will ship books from the author\u0027s small supply of remaining first editions (hence why it is also limited).\u003cbr\u003e\n",

The essay will deal with the language of Adal, and the etymology that has gone into writing the books, naming the different places, characters, titles etc. If you have ever wondered why certain names have a Germanic touch to them while others are clearly of French or Latin origin (even within the same realm), and some are Germanic in nature but with French spelling, and you want the explanation why, this is the goal to reach.\u003cbr\u003e",
