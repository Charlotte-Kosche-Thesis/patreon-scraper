    "summary": "Thank you so much for coming this far and looking at my page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Cameron and I have created a new life for myself as a jeweller. Currently, I love making bracelets, earrings, necklaces and brooches in sterling silver, plated silver and other metals. I love using a variety of different stones, gems, semi-precious stones and natural products as part of my designs. I also have a passion for viking weave and anything intricate that helps me relax and produce something beautiful at the end of the process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone has a story and I would like to share a little of mine with you. \u00a0Originally I was a trained concert pianist but after suffering from kidney cancer 8 years ago I had a stroke during the operation to remove the tumour and kidney. At first I was paralysed from the neck down, but within a few weeks regained full use of the right hand side of my body. I was then sent to a special rehab hospital for cancer and stroke recoverers and spent 4 months there learning to try and walk again as well as change my life. Unfortunately, I never regained feeling in my left leg or left hand so had to give up my professional career as a musician. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic was my only creative voice from aged 6 until 32 and it became the way I could express all my emotions. Suddenly, after the cancer and stroke I felt I was left without a creative voice.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter some turmoil and trying to learn to live again and be comfortable with the new me, I decided 15 months ago to start making jewellery for fun. I loved it, and finally I had a new creative voice back again. It was amazing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, unable to work due to my disability I now make jewellery everyday to 1. Keep my mind strong and focussed and 2. To share my new.creative voice with the world. I have watched 1000s of hours of YouTube videos and am completely self taught.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love now to be able to follow me dream and to study on some jewellery making courses as well as buy some disabled friendly tools to help me work. I would also like to experiment more with materials.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always found it difficult swallowing my pride and asking for help, but have spent my whole life being kind, \u00a0sharing and giving to everyone I meet, that a friend recently suggested I should try this site. Perhaps other people can help me achieve my dream.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you chose not to become a patron I would like to thank you for taking the time to read my story.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCameron\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
