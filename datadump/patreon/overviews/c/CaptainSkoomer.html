    "summary": "Hey guys,\u003cbr\u003ethanks for visiting my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started creating Machinimas a few years ago, but now, for the first time in my \"Youtube-Career\" I\u0027m creating those for the english community in the game Elite: Dangerous. I\u0027m originally from germany so this is a big step for me and I\u0027m really excited to see where this will lead me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently working really hard on a new series called \"Elite: Strange Worlds\" which is about two friends who are making a journey across the galaxy, visiting the most exciting \"Strange Worlds\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s special about this series is that the focus not only lies in showing beautiful scenery, but also taking the viewers on an adventure which includes storytelling, character progression - even emotional journeys. \u003cbr\u003eEvery episode got its own script with different dialogues, happenings, funny moments, and so on. The whole journey will be written in a five act dramatic structure - which means there will be much variety in how the story will unfold after time. Plot twists, turning points, critical moments. Drama. \u003cbr\u003eIn the End, not those \"Strange Worlds\" will be the highlight, but the journey itself - altough visiting those POI\u0027s is always the foundation of every episode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started this Patreon page with the thought of reducing the costs I encounter while doing this hobby. This includes monthly payments for the Adobe Suite which I need for editing those videos and licenses to legally use the music I\u0027m using for my videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis project will be around for at least a couple of months, if not half a year or more. So those costs will stack up and covering those would be really helpful!\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Hey,\u003cbr\u003emy name is Till and I come from germany.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always loved to make videos. I began as a child, running around with a camcorder and filming some nonsense. Someday this evolved into having a Youtube Channel where I uploaded typical lets plays. (Starting with Minecraft *cough*)\u003cbr\u003eSomeday I figured that I could use those game engines to make movies in them. So I started doing this and even had some success doing so. This was in the year 2011/2012.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis hobby quickly became more present in my reallife because I managed to get an apprentienceship as a cutter in a film and tv-production firm here in germany. Since then I\u0027m able to do my hobby as a profession.\u003cbr\u003eI actually did a lot of private film projects from there on, especially in video games. Speaking of GTA V, Minecraft, Space Engineers. Those are all wonderful games/engines to actually film in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that Frontier released the new camera suite with 2.3 I\u0027m more than in love with this new tool and doing my best to use all my knowledge of film-procution to make my new series \"Elite: Strange worlds\"\u00a0something special.",
