Who are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Caith Esra Ulvar - I go by Esra ;) - and I am a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up in rural Scandinavia but I have spent most of my adult life living in the UK.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the Brexit vote I had trouble finding work and relocated to northern Germany to be closer to my family. So now I am living in a teeny tiny village in the middle of nowhere with a couple of cats and a seedling that grows in my kitchen sink - it seems to be the only plant I ever managed to keep alive, btw.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing far away from any and all amenities of urban life gives me plenty of time to read, take long walks through a sodden countryside, watch my favourite Netflix, and to write novels and short stories, of course. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you write about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write literary fiction, with a twist. The twist is me incorporating all kinds of genres into my stories. I do this to capture and transport emotional states that cannot be expressed through language alone. So my stories inhabit a space between reality and dreaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write what I know. I know a lot. I write about marginalised characters, people whose backgrounds keep them from realising their dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy subjects are urban life, love, friendship, family, trauma, addiction, unconventional mental states, LGBTQ, criminal behaviour and many more, relating to the human condition in general and every once in a while someone gets killed. I\u0027m not a traditional crime writer, though.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a crowd-sourcing website kinda like Kickstarter. But instead of funding a product, you fund content and the process that goes into creating it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month you are charged a set amount, let\u0027s say $3. For those $3 you get to download an ebook with the story/chapter I publish that month and I, the creator, get to use that money for rent, groceries and other luxury items like that ;) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIdeally this creates a regular income for me that allows me to write full-time and in any case, you get a kickass ebook (or audio book or whatever reward strikes your fancy) every month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve published my early work traditionally and I am a little disenchanted with the process. I spend a month working on a story and another month editing it until it shines, then a literary magazine publishes it (and doesn\u0027t pay me, btw). And I guess people read it, but I never get to hear from them. It\u0027s like there\u0027s a barrier between me and my readers...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write to connect with other people. I\u0027m not a very eloquent person, I wasn\u0027t raised to wear my heart on my sleeve. Most of what I\u0027m going through I keep inside my head until it tears me apart. Through my stories I reach out to you - I say to you, this is how it\u0027s like for me. I ask you, do you know that feeling?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page is basically me tearing that barrier down that keeps my stories from being a shared experience, an exchange of sorts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, you don\u0027t have to support me unless you want to do so. I\u0027m not holding a gun to your head here. All I\u0027m doing is asking for a little token in exchange for my art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, it is really up to you, why you want to support me. Maybe you\u0027ve been to my website and read some of my short stories there and you like my writing. Maybe we\u0027ve met on social media and you think I\u0027m a fun broad and you want to help me out. Maybe you\u0027ve seen the promotion for my new novel \"Romka\" and now you just have to find out what happened to her. It\u0027s all up to you, no pressure.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do decide to sign up, know that your contribution makes a real difference in my life and my career. It helps me earn a living with my writing - nothing grand just rent, bills and groceries - and that is what I wish for most in this life. My writing is my everything, it\u0027s what keeps me going no matter how deep the shit I\u0027m shoveling. Not to mention that if you sign up, I get to share my stories with you on a regular basis and that is just so much icing on the cake...\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSounds good, how can I sign up?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSigning up to become a patron is really easy. Just click on the big red button in the top right corner of your screen, the one that says \"become a patron\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will take you to a page where you can choose how much money you want to spend on your patreon subscription. You can choose from a variety of options or come up with your own amount, starting from $1 per month.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also shows you which rewards/perks/extras you can expect after signing up. Personally I recommend \"The eBook\" or \"The Audio book\" - depending on your reading preference - to get you started. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext you put in your payment details, either a credit card or a paypal account. I\u0027m paying the creators I support here with my paypal account, for example. It\u0027s super easy and you don\u0027t have to deal with bills and paperwork.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce you have signed up you get immediate access to your chosen medium, an eBook download or an audio book download for example. As well as all of my older eBooks and audio books. And you can start reading right away.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
