If you\u0027ve come here from the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://daron.ceciliatan.com\"\u003eDaron\u0027s Guitar Chronicles website\u003c/a\u003e you already know that I\u0027ve been writing and posting a web fiction serial there since 2009. [Zomg that sounds like a long time ago. Because it is.] Regular posts happen there twice a week, with some exceptions... like I sometimes post 3 or 4 times if enough donations come in through the website \"Tip Jar\" (i.e. paypal donations).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut in addition to the regular tip jar link on the webserial site, we have Patreon, too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNothing is changing over at DGC: \u003cstrong\u003econtent is still completely free\u003c/strong\u003e and readers are still welcome to donate whenever they feel moved to (or to get periodic bonus content). But Patreon makes it easy for folks to make ongoing microdonations based on the volume of the content. I\u0027m asking for the equivalent of a dollar a week minimum which works out to basically $4 a month. That would mean $48 for a whole year. Cool, eh?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons at the $4/month level get access to some nice perks. Patrons get all the bonus content that regular readers would have to make a la carte donations to get, as well as copies of the finished DGC ebooks whenever they periodically appear. I share other goodies from time to time, too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(With the switch from manually charging patrons $1 per week to $4/month automatic I\u0027m revamping the funding targets, also, more to come on that!)\u003cbr\u003e"
