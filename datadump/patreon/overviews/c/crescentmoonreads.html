I create booktube\u00a0content for the enjoyment of my fellow readers, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. I also act and teach acting courses for students of all ages, and even that is not all! I create poetry which I post on my twitter from time to time, and I am working on publishing a collection in the near future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Here\u0027s where you come in- \u003c/strong\u003eWe all know how hard it can be to make it as an artist in this world, but by becoming a patron, you directly influence my ability to continue creating content. With the freedom to take time to put into my work, you also directly influence the quantity and quality of the content I am producing. Your patronage is part of a very old tradition of people supporting the art that enriches them, and on a personal level it is so incredibly appreciated by me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo if you are considering becoming a patron! \u003c/strong\u003eCheck out my tiers and choose the one that best fits your needs, any amount helps and I cannot thank you enough for the support. But I will try... THANK YOUUUUUU!!!!!!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you are just looking for now- \u003c/strong\u003eThank you for taking the time to look around and see what I am up to.
