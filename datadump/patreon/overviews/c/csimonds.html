If it\u0027s creative, I\u0027ve at least attempted it -- some with less success than others; music will forever escape me and I\u0027m, at best, a mediocre cook. What you\u0027ll find here is my photography, modeling, stock photos, makeup work, art, videos, writing, clothing and accessory design, and whatever else!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere you\u0027ll get sneak peeks, full sets shown nowhere else, exclusive stock from Sinned-Angel-Stock, prints, tutorials, behind the scenes, future project ideas, works-in-progress, and best of all --\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll be supporting someone who is chronically ill and takes care of her severely disabled combat veteran husband (PTSD and bipolar) and two children on top of it. I can\u0027t work; this is what I do to supplement my husband\u0027s disability payments. My medical bills are huge and exhaustive. My condition, Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, is congenital, incurable, and degenerative. If anyone is interested I could upload a video of my past, current and future health challenges as well as progress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming my patron would help us in our daily lives and also help me to make bigger and better projects, which I can then share with my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming my patron would also help me to delve into things I have been unable to because of funds: underwater photography (which is one of my real passions but is very expensive) and also allow me to travel, to work with new models, designers and photographers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost importantly, I\u0027d love to hear what you think! As my patron, what do you want to see more of from me? I love doing work for other people that makes people happy. (The current rewards tiers are the best I could come up with, but as time goes on I hope to conduct polls and hear from everyone what they\u0027d like to see, and I hope to customize them to be exciting and fun for everyone!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you so much for checking me out and I hope you like my work/passion!"
