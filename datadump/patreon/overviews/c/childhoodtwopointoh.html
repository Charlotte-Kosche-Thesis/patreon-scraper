I have been telling stories for even longer. And I\u0027ve been telling stories via art for as long as I\u0027ve understood the concept, much to the annoyance of my friends and family who wanted me to just stop shoving badly done kid drawings in their faces. (Hey, they were masterpieces. They just didn\u0027t know it.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd then one day, it clicked in my head that, you know, I could probably make a living off of this. Just a thought. So I started drawing with more sincerity. Not more seriousness, mind you. Perish the thought. I plan to stay a kid forever if I can help it, so trying to be serious and \"realistic\" with my drawings is out of the question. I mean seriously, why draw an accurate representation of the night sky when you could just... paint it?\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://s98.photobucket.com/user/Reincarnated_Alphonse/media/20160523_180418.jpg.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l275/Reincarnated_Alphonse/20160523_180418.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOr why draw a simple shooting star when there\u0027s the option to hop on that star and go for a ride?\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://s98.photobucket.com/user/Reincarnated_Alphonse/media/20160529_183430.jpg.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l275/Reincarnated_Alphonse/20160529_183430.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo take a jump back into the world of your inner child and climb on board.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://s98.photobucket.com/user/Reincarnated_Alphonse/media/20160729_133454.jpg.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l275/Reincarnated_Alphonse/20160729_133454.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour dreams aren\u0027t as far away as you think.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://s98.photobucket.com/user/Reincarnated_Alphonse/media/20160630_144812.jpg.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l275/Reincarnated_Alphonse/20160630_144812.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\n\nMy coloring pages are all playful and unique. I create them with the intention of helping to heal and reconnect with one\u0027s inner child. I have not seen pages like mine elsewhere at all. (Though if you happen to see some, please point them out! I\u0027d love to color them myself!) \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will continue to try to create my art no matter what, but when the stress of not having enough finances to make ends meet gets too high, art becomes impossible. It\u0027s hard to draw on an empty stomach, and while there\u0027s nothing physically preventing you from drawing without a roof over your head, the rain just isn\u0027t very nice to your drawings.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is where you guys come in. You can pledge a lot or a little, but every dollar you pledge makes my creating art just a little bit easier, which means yay, more art! It\u0027s a win for everybody! I can create faster and with less stress, and can even start working on trickier projects because I will suddenly have the mental bandwidth to do so since I\u0027m not wasting that bandwidth worrying about money.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn return, I will keep you up to date with how things are going in my art world and try to entertain you with stories about my daily life. And if you\u0027re pledging on a higher tier, then you\u0027ll even have some other rewards as well. It\u0027s the least I can do to say thanks for being such a huge help. Seriously, everything helps. Don\u0027t feel guilty if you can\u0027t afford a higher tier. Everything helps more than you realize. And if you can\u0027t even contribute that much, perhaps you could help me out by telling a friend about this page. :)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks so much for taking the time to read this. Now let\u0027s get coloring!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the rules regarding use of your coloring pages?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m honestly pretty easy going about this, but I suppose that I have to be a grown up about this and actually spell out my rules. Basically, if you get a link to a digital coloring page file, you\u0027re allowed to download it and print it out as many times as you darn well please. Just please don\u0027t do anything with it that\u0027ll deprive me of money, like selling the download link or the coloring page, sharing the link with people who haven\u0027t paid me, or using the artwork for commercial use. I don\u0027t mind non-commercial derivative works though so long as you give me credit. I honestly find that exciting. Just don\u0027t take any money from me, okay? If you want to use my art commercially, just contact me. I don\u0027t bite. ;)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I get your digital coloring pages?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI will post links in my feed as they become available. All tiers will get sneak peeks of what is being released, but only the $2 tier and up will actually get the links to download them. Make sure to download and save these pages during the month that they\u0027re posted, because they\u0027ll disappear by next month, except for the $10 tier and above.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI missed a coloring page or only want a specific one. Can I get it?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eSure! I will post all my coloring pages to my Etsy account in addition to posting them here, and you are free to go there and buy coloring pages anytime you please. There will be a delay though, as I will post my newest creations here a couple weeks before I post them on Etsy. I will also be releasing a physical coloring book soon if you prefer to get your coloring pages in that form.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCan I see some other examples of your art?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eOf course! Just hop on over to my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/childhood2.0/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e and have a look around. I try to update my Instagram page fairly regularly, which means there are a fair amount of art examples on that account."

At present, my Crayola pencils and I are having a disagreement on what is appropriate treatment of my hands. I think they should not cause so much pain, but they apparently disagree with me, so I would like to spring for a set of Prismacolor pencils that won\u0027t have this reservation with regards to the well being of my fingers. This would also let me illustrate and color a lot more since I would suddenly be able to color things with a lot less effort, so win win for everyone! (Except for the Crayolas. Unless they\u0027re tired and want to sleep. Maybe they\u0027ll feel better once they finally get enough sleep. We\u0027ll go with that.)",

While that may simply be a sign that I need to go to bed, it would also be really nice to be able to actually finish a project without overheating my computer once in a while.
