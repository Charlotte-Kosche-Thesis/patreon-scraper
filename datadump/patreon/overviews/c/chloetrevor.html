    "summary": "www.chloetrevormusicacademy.org\u003cbr\u003eHi, I\u0027m Chlo\u00e9! I\u0027m a concert violinist, touring the world with big dreams!\u00a0I\u0027ve always had big dreams - when I was 10 my dream was to buy a Stradavarius violin. Ha - \u00a0kids and their big ideas! These days my dreams are just as big... but instead of the Strad, I want to give back to the vibrant musical communities that have encouraged me to get to where I am today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy musical journey has been full of exciting opportunities, but none of them have come without a price. I\u0027ve had countless setbacks and disappointments but no one seemed to want to talk to me about the difficult parts of being a classical musician. I think this is exactly why so many talented and incredible students give up on their journeys -\u003cem\u003e they don\u0027t know that setbacks are normal, inevitable, and necessary\u003c/em\u003e! Along my own path I found that I had a passion for teaching - not just violin technique, but also what it means to be a musician \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003ehow to make the most of your unique talents and gifts regardless of the hurdles you come across\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nInstagram has become a remarkable tool that I have used to teach and mentor young musicians; but I want to take things to \u003cstrong\u003ea new\u00a0level,\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ewhich is why I\u0027m launching this Patreon campaign (but don\u0027t worry, my usual content will always be \u003cstrong\u003eFREE\u003c/strong\u003e!) \u00a0What do I mean by new level? The single most influential experience in my career was the music camp that I attended from the age of 9 until 18. The friends I made, the concerts I attended, the teachers I worked with, and the performance opportunities I was given made me the musician that I am today. At this camp I worked with my late teacher and mentor, Arkady Fomin, where I witnessed his insatiable passion for giving everything of himself to his students. He truly inspired and changed the lives of so many young musicians, and I would love nothing more than to follow in his footsteps. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy biggest dream has been to start a music camp of my own for talented, young instrumentalists who are passionate about making the world a better place.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eActually... maybe this is bigger than the Strad...\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI realize that I have to start this now. I have over 150,000 followers across all social media platforms who have helped to spread my message of positivity and hope, so I know that the support is here. Starting my own music camp will be a difficult process but I know that I will be successful with your help! In this campaign I have included my other musical goals that are similar in educational nature but are slightly easier to reach. \u003cstrong\u003eI will develop three new Chlo\u00e9 Initiatives:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelease a brand new album that will be publicly available for one dollar\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFree concerts and masterclasses at schools around the USA\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreate artistically produced classical music videos that will inspire today\u0027s youth\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe point of this campaign is that I want to give back to \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. For years I have been providing video and audio content to my fans for free and I promise \u003cem\u003eIT WILL\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cem\u003eSTAY FREE\u003c/em\u003e. But now I want to do even more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat does this mean for you? You now have the opportunity to join my mission and play a personal part in making my biggest dreams a reality! I am not asking for your help to pay my living expenses as I already support myself through my career as a touring concert artist. But like any mission that aims to change people\u0027s lives, this project is much bigger than I am and for it to truly be successful I need the support of a broader community - \u003cem\u003eand that includes you! \u003c/em\u003eYour pledge of \u003cstrong\u003eANY\u003c/strong\u003e amount is going to \u003cem\u003ehelp aspiring young musicians who will go on to change the world!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo Patreon is about you -\u003cstrong\u003e the Patrons\u003c/strong\u003e. You are the reason I have been successful thus far, and are the reason this camp will be put in motion so I want to give you all of the credit you deserve! On the right hand side of this page you will find the Reward Tiers. I have put careful thought and consideration into how I can best show my Patrons that their pledge means the world to me and that they are the reason I am able to help change people\u0027s lives. If you choose to support me and my projects, simply select one of the monthly pledge amounts (or enter your own pledge amount after selecting a Tier), enter your payment information (all pledges are deducted the first of each month), and enjoy the awesome rewards! \u003cem\u003eYou will also be immediately added to the community of my current Patrons where you can ask questions, discuss musical topics, post fan art, or whatever else you choose!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I know that a very large percentage of my fanbase is under the age of 18, and I am telling you - do not, I repeat, \u003cstrong\u003edo NOT\u003c/strong\u003e take your parents credit card without their permission! :P If you are wondering what part you can play in supporting me, the answer is to keep doing what you already have been doing so fabulously! Keep watching and sharing my Instagram and YouTube videos with your friends and family, and keep spreading the message of positivity and kindness so that the next generation of students your age will benefit from a better world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this far, it means a lot that my thoughts and ideas are reaching more and more people every day.
