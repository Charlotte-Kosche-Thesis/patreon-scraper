    "summary": "I\u0027ve had a lot of people express interest in my artwork, and many of them have asked about commissions. To help expand access to my artwork and give people more flexibility in their support, I\u0027m going to give this Patreon a shot.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny support offered is greatly appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eNOTES ON COMMISSION REWARDS:\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings that \u003cstrong\u003eARE NOT\u003c/strong\u003e allowed in commissions: \u003cbr\u003e1. Guys that look masculine. Sorry, but you would not even want me to draw men for free. Guys are harder for me to draw and they always look bad. So this is just a hard line. Now if you want a female version of a male character, I\u0027m fine with that. But they\u0027re going to look female and not look male at all. \u003cbr\u003e2. Violence. Violence is not okay in real life, and it is not okay in my artwork. I understand that there is a very big difference between fantasy and reality, but art shapes the culture we live in. I do not want to live in a society where anybody is ostracized or experiences violence and, although that is not likely to ever fully happen, I will not in any way, shape, or form, contribute to any social constructs that support or glamorize such ideals. This includes things that may be popular in kinky artwork, including things like choking, slapping, rape, and slavery. If you want artwork with that in it, that is your own prerogative, but I will not participate. You do your thing, I\u0027ll do mine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e3. Mind Control \u0026amp; Brainwashing. Similar to Point 2 above, mind control and brainwashing are not things I will include in my commissions.\u003cbr\u003e4. Vore/Gore/Bestiality/bukkake/pregnancy/scat. If you like any of these, then that\u0027s great for you. I don\u0027t, and I am nauseated by them. So please do not request them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e5. Not as harsh on this, but I also do not do exaggerated anatomy like super large breasts and prefer to not do contortions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings that \u003cstrong\u003eARE\u003c/strong\u003e allowed in commissions:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e1. Girls! Girls are pretty much what I stick to because I can draw them pretty easily, and I like them too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e2. BDSM is pretty standard for me, so if that\u0027s up your alley, you\u0027ll do well here!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e3. Characters that are obviously consenting to whatever predicaments they\u0027re in are preferable!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e4. Furries! I\u0027m not terribly good at them, but I\u0027m decent enough that I feel comfortable drawing furries!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e5. Fun! It\u0027s one thing to consent to whatever, it\u0027s another thing to be having fun. Kink can be positive!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
