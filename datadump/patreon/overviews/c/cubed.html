    "summary": "We grew up in the heyday of the video games press, waiting anxiously for the next issue of Nintendo Official Magazine UK, or Official PlayStation Magazine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo in 2011, we started our own website dedicated to exploring the best of the games industry, from features to opinion pieces to reviews. We\u0027ve had some great successes in that time, but we want to take it further.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBy funding us, you can help secure a new brand of games journalism, created by experienced players and writers. We will operate without fear or favour, with an open mind and an open mouth. We won\u0027t shy away from controversial opinions or reviews that go against the grain.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can do that most effectively if we\u0027re funded by our readers. Our costs are low, because all our writers are volunteers, so it doesn\u0027t take much to keep us ticking along. But the more we raise, the more we can do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur costs:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrinting, shipping, software and font licensing to produce our magazine.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWebsite hosting.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSocial media promotion.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBuying games for contributors to review.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eOnce these are covered, we can expand further. We\u0027ll be able to add more pages to the magazine, drive more traffic to the website, and fund better equipment to make our content even higher quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCubed Gamers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.cubedgamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CG-Homepage-1024x581.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur website has been running since 2011 and has gone through a lot of changes in that time. But when we were just a blog run by three friends who barely knew how to write, we were driven by a love of the industry that helped make us who we are. We still are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell funded, we can have our finger on the pulse of the games industry, responding quickly and in depth to ongoing news, providing high quality features and interviews, and telling you what you need to know about the latest games and developers, big or small.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith enough money, we can move to our own dedicated server, massively improving load times and giving us the space to bring the site even more content and functionality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideo\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur website is where we started, but we\u0027ve since expanded into video too. We\u0027re launching a new network of YouTube channels from our contributors, bringing you Let\u0027s Plays, reviews, gaming history, live streams and much more besides.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExtra funds will help us buy equipment like cameras, new microphones, soundproof backing and green screens, as well as helping us shoot on location and travel to interviews and events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll be able to bring you more live streams on Twitch, upgrade our internet to bring you higher quality content faster, and take on group projects and requests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCubed Magazine\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ssl-forum-files.fobby.net/forum_attachments/0040/6421/Issue_1_-.jpg\" style=\"width: 387px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eSince January 2016, we\u0027ve published a monthly gaming magazine, Cubed, with exclusive journalism not on the website. We\u0027ve had praise from all over for our quality, our dedication and our professionalism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy backing us, you\u0027ll be in line for a free digital copy of the magazine every month, and those willing to put up a little more will have a print copy drop through their door every month, just like it\u0027s 1998 again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt isn\u0027t a nostalgia piece, or a retro magazine - it brings high quality insight into the modern games industry, while carrying forward the colourful, community-focused and often irreverent attitude of the magazines that came before.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a collective several years of experience working on newspapers and the web, we love carrying forward the legacy of the publications we all loved as kids. With your help, we can expand our number of pages, have it perfect bound, and bring the cost to you down with bigger print runs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eIt\u0027s been a pleasure bringing you incisive, independent and international games journalism over the last five years.
