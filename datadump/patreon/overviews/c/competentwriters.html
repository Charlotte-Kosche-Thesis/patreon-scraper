I also talk about teaching, because that\u0027s how I make a living at the moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps you\u0027ve been writing fiction for a while, and maybe you\u0027ve done an MFA, but you still feel like you don\u0027t have a great handle on it. After all that talk about craft, and all those rounds of workshops, you still feel as though you have a lot to learn.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFor myself, I did a really good MFA in fiction writing, with excellent teachers, generous funding, and very talented classmates. But despite all those advantages, I finished the degree feeling like I still didn\u0027t really \"get\" how this fiction thing worked.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy blog is where I try to explain what I\u0027ve figured out.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor an example of what I write there, see my page on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://incompetentwriter.com/style\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eimproving your prose style\u003c/a\u003e, which my readers have viewed over six thousand times this year.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI love writing. I\u0027ve been blogging unpaid for the last ten years. But as interest in the site has been growing, I\u0027d like to be able to devote more time and energy to producing really good posts for my readers. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you become a \"patron\" of my blog, that will help me immensely. And if enough people sign up, I can expand the blog to include videos and -- even -- podcasts."
