    "summary": "I am a creative person and for me this means a lot (!) of things are interesting and I want to do a lot of different things! So what do I do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI run an on-location recording studio, to record those artists who can not afford a big studio or who prefer a recording in a special place. It means buying or renting equipment, maintaining the equipment, travelling and spending time to make everything as good is possible. This, while trying to stay affordable for the artist. Recently, I also found a spot to make a more permanent project studio. The goal is to create a place where the smaller artists can record their music without spending a lot of money. I want to give these musicians a chance to be heard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI play in different bands. A little jazz band called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DeMasjien/\"\u003eDr. Goo\u0027s Masjien\u003c/a\u003e, an Irish band called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thecoincidences.nl/\"\u003eThe Coincidences\u003c/a\u003e and some more coincidental projects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started making woodcarvings. For now, mainly coasters made from slabs of very hard hazelnut wood. I am teaching myself the process on the go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made my own Irish drum (a Bodhr\u00e1n) with the plan to make more of them and to start making other drums as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started writing at \u003ca href=\"https://mortenwrites.tumblr.com/\"\u003eMorten Writes\u003c/a\u003e, to see if my writing style and stories are interesting. I started writing short stories on the age of six, but never really pushed on with it. Now, I decided it is time to start writing for an audience. It\u0027s a learning process and feedback is more than welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I get the chance, other ideas I really would like to start on are: creating castings in my own little smeltoven, designing own parts and printing them out in a 3D printer, create interactive sound ambiences for games or for tabletop games like Dungeon and Dragons and create other instruments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe world has to many things to do, to many options just to stick with one thing. Go out and explore your possibilities!\u003cbr\u003e"
