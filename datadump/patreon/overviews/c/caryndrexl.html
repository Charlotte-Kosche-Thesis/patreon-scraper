    "summary": "I\u0027m a self taught photographer taking conceptual and surreal portraits of myself, as well as others. Often described as creepy and weird, my intention with my images is mainly to show that there is beauty in all that\u0027s imperfect, and, yes, even creepy and weird. You can see more of my work and read my ramblings at \u003ca href=\"http://www.caryndrexl.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.caryndrexl.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my shoots I tackle from the ground up, creating or modifying clothes, hair, backdrops, even props themselves. Given the look I\u0027m usually going for, the items I do buy tend to be old and/or unique. While I\u0027ve had to learn how to do this as cheaply as possible over the last 10+ years, the amounts pile up quickly even before you even get to the necessary expensive equipment like cameras, lenses and lighting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of this I\u0027m currently only able to shoot my ideas or create my photo based mixed media pieces when I have the money to buy what I need for them, money which comes largely from stock and print sales. These sales are unpredictable, both in timing and amount, making it difficult to know when I can get shoots done, what I\u0027ll be using, or causing me to have to scale down the ideas. (That last one tends to happen a LOT and makes me cranky with the final images no matter how nice they turn out, since they weren\u0027t really what I wanted to do.) And as far as bills and feeding myself, i\u0027m mostly using money from school, which isn\u0027t a lot, won\u0027t last forever and just adds to my debt! Woohoo! Anything beyond the basics, both personally and professionally, happens very rarely. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo basically, any help is welcomed help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I started going to school the amount of work i\u0027ve been able to produce has been reduced to almost nothing, which I expect would also be the case were I to take on a full time job. However, i\u0027m opting out of summer semester so that I can focus solely on photography projects, something that feels much needed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve set up the pledges per month for the time being, since per creation/shoot seems like it might be a bit much to ask during my upcoming busy months. Incentives per \"tier\" of pledge might be adjusted some (to add more, such as monthly giveaways, not remove anything) as I figure out what I might be able to handle providing on a monthly basis. And don\u0027t forget you can change or stop your pledge at any point. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s about it I guess! I am incredibly grateful for all the support I get, from those who can contribute financially by purchasing prints or making pledges, as well as those unable to do so, and hope one day i\u0027m in a better position to help other artists as well.\u003cbr\u003e"
