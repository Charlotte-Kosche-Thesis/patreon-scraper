Truth is stranger than fiction and there is no objective reality. Existence is ineffable and unique to every single human being that has ever, and will ever walk this planet. Cryptic Chronicles aims to podcast hidden knowledge or supernaturally related lore brushed aside by common people. This can cover a variety of topics spanning many different categories. From the unexplained, to the fantastic but true from the depths of history. From the UFO phenomenon, to the lurking red eyed shadow people gazing at you as you sleep, to ghosts, gods, philosophies, and science of the mind.\u00a0 But it is all thanks to you dear listener. Without your support, our show would not be possible. Expect consistent content to be released throughout every month, with episodes exclusive to members of the Chroniclers Vault. We thank you so much! With an over abundance of gratitude. If it was not for you, Cryptic Chronicles would cease to be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16949116.Brandon_Garic_Notch\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e"
