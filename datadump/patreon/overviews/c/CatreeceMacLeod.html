Games like The Burning Wheel are nice, but also far too complex for the average player new to role playing. D\u0026amp;D is wonderful for murdering everything in a dungeon, but leaves players almost completely on their own when it comes to actually playing their character. With such a huge gap in the market, I\u0027ve dedicated my skills toward plugging the hole over the last few months by creating a game specifically dedicated to easing players into role playing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSaorsa\u0027s mechanics are designed around showing players and GMs the options they have to work with in all aspects of the game, from providing a framework for role playing out intimidating a shopkeeper, to sneaking into a castle, building your own spells fit for the occasion, or unleashing a series of precise actions in a combo during combat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be blunt, Saorsa\u0027s going to be released free of charge no matter what. Pledge $0 and you\u0027ll still get a game on par with Pathfinder, Shadowrun and D\u0026amp;D. What pledges give me are the ability to add artwork (more and higher quality) to the books, multiple language translations, additional play testing and more of the stuff I simply don\u0027t have the capacity to do by myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m paying for Saorsa completely out of my own pocket right now, and I\u0027m totally cool with that, but my pockets are only deep enough to create amazing gameplay. With your help, we can make role playing more accessible to people from around the world than ever before!\u003cbr\u003e"
