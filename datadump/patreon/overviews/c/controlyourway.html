    "summary": "We are designing an Internet of Things platform which will make it easier for users to send their own data. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we have done so far:\u003cbr\u003e1. We have developed software libraries for C#, Python, Javascript and Java which can be used to exchange data. We have properly tested each of these modules, documented each one properly on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.controlyourway.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eControl Your Way\u003c/a\u003e and have an example and tutorial for each library. All the code for the examples and tutorials can be downloaded from Github.\u00a0Using our software libraries it will be easy for software developers and hobbyists to send any data easily between their devices and PCs. The Python library can be used on your Raspberry Pi to gather data or monitor something and you can control it from a web page on your iPad or from your own app on a PC.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. We have a well tested server architecture. There are no limits on the number of devices you can connect. On our website you can configure any number of networks. Your devices can subscribe to one or more networks, depending on what data you want it to receive. When sending data, you can send it to the same networks the device is listening to, to specific networks or to specific device IDs. Please have a look at our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.controlyourway.com/Resources/HowItWorks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHow it works\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.controlyourway.com/Resources/GettingStarted\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGetting Started\u003c/a\u003e pages for more information.\u00a0We can set up any number of servers to handle communication. We can configure a server for you if you have high data usage needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help we want to add the following to our service:\u003cbr\u003e1. We are working with a Windows Driver writer to design an application that will instantiate serial ports on a PC. This will make it possible to connect to any virtual serial port device that normally can only be accessed from the PC it is connected to over the internet. For example, using this application you will be able to print to your 3D printer from anywhere in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. We are busy developing a C library. The C library is useful for writing any Linux C app that wants to use our service. My smaller Linux boards do not have the resources to run Python, their applications have to written in C. This will allow these devices to communicate easily to anything you want. The C library is also useful for writing firmware that needs to be web connected. We are planning to have examples using LWIP and a number of Wifi modules.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3.\u00a0With your help we plan to add tons of examples using modules from 3rd party companies so it will be easy for anybody experimenting at home to get going easily. We are busy with examples for the Raspberry Pi and the Intel Edison.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. Add more servers all around the world. The closer you are to one of our servers, the faster our service will run."

     "description": "Windows Driver writing is a very specific skill and unfortunately we don\u0027t have the in house skills for this. We are talking to a Driver writer to help us develop a UMDF driver which can instantiate serial ports. This will allow us to instantiate COM port that will show up in device manager, which the user can use in your applications to connect to. Instead of sending data directly to your device, you can send data over the internet. This will allow you to do things like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrint to your 3D printer over the internet.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReceive data from your debug serial port on something you are developing and receive the data in a terminal program like Realterm.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eListen to an RS485 bus over the internet.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThis goal will make it possible to get a driver written.",
