I\u0027ve had a lot of fun working on the blog until now (\u003ca href=\"http://concernedpony.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://concernedpony.tumblr.com\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/concerned_pony),\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://twitter.com/concerned_pony),\u003c/a\u003e and I\u0027d love to be able to expand on it! For that reason, I\u0027ve decided to start taking donations for the blog, so we can afford new, exciting adventures! Our first adventure will be a button machine, and if things go well, maybe we can even start traveling to pony conventions to make new friends and meet our followers! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love the Concerned Pony blog and want to help support it, that\u0027s great! Donating to my Patreon will help me to afford more types of pony adventures, maybe even flying across the country to attend Bronycon! As someone with occasional part-time work, this isn\u0027t something I can afford on my own. You\u0027ll get lots of bonuses, like behind the scenes photos, customized art from the pony herself, and shout-outs from Concerned Pony to thank you for your support! You\u0027ll also get more say in what kind of adventures she goes on, and be able to vote for what she does next! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t want to donate, or can\u0027t afford it, that\u0027s okay! Nothing about the original Concerned Pony blog will be changed as a result of Patreon, so you don\u0027t have to worry! But if you\u0027d like to buy a button with Concerned Pony\u0027s face on it, then please consider donating so we can make that happen! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorking on Concerned Pony brings me a lot of joy, and knowing that it brings a lot of joy to her followers is an awesome feeling! Thank you for reading, and thank you for following! \u003cbr\u003e"

Concerned Pony is a \"fakie\"/bootleg of a My Little Pony - that means, she is not created by Hasbro, but by another company creating knockoff pony toys. In this case, it created a pony with a very \u003cem\u003eunique \u003c/em\u003eexpression of woe and concern, and so my blog was born! Concerned Pony goes on many adventures, including exciting excursions to the local grocery store, Disneyland, and even to meet fellow ponies in the wild!
