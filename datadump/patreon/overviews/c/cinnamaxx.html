    "summary": "I\u0027m Cinnamon Maxxine. I\u0027m a San Francisco Bay Area born and raised, \u00a0black, fat, queer, non binary femme. In addition, I live with anxiety, paranoia, and agoraphobia. Much of what I do is around sex work, adult entertainment, sex and sexuality, race, body positivity, fatphobia,\u00a0 and the intersectionality of all those things. And more recently, I\u0027ve been talking about my disability. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been doing this work for almost 10 years. I feel that my voice often gets dismissed or ignored altogether. I keep seeing the same skinny white femmes take up space in the fight for sex workers rights, the same type of people get all the work and all the opportunities. People only ask me what I think when they want to add diversity or need the input of someone of color, or a fat person, or both. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd to top it off, they often expect me to do this work for free or for cheap. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started this Patreon to give myself a platform to talk about all the whack ass shit I experience and also the empowering parts of my work. To give myself a way to be heard, on my terms. And \u00a0honestly, hopefully make some money doing it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not promise that my writing will be professional. I am a high school graduate with some college experience, but definitely no degree.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not promise that any videos I post will be perfect and the most amazing quality you will ever see. I am poor and use equipment that I borrow for free because I can\u0027t afford my own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not promise that all my work, or any of my work for that matter, will make you feel good and tingly inside. Because that\u0027s not my reality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not promise that my work will ever be for white folks or easily relatable or that you will agree with what I say if you\u0027re white, not fat, not disabled, or otherwise privileged. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I will say is that if you just want some decent reads, entertainment, and maybe to learn something every now and then, my Patreon is a good place to support. Not only that, but your pledge will help support a Bay Area black femme former/sometimes sex worker, entertainer and artist living with a disability that prevents them from getting \"real\" work and is therefore always struggling. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you! \u003cbr\u003eCinnamon Maxxine\u003cbr\u003e"
