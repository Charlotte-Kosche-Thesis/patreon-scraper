Thanks for stopping by. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u2019re probably here because you love dance as much as I do. Perhaps you like to take class, maybe you perform, and we ALL love to boogie in our living rooms, amiright?! The exclusive content I offer on this page is going to bring the joy and creative expression of my studio directly into your home. Whether you want air-tight abs, flexier flexibility, or perfect pirouettes, I\u2019ve got you covered!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon is a special place where you support MY artistry, receive art in return, which then expands YOUR artistry. What a beautiful cycle to participate in ! I love me some synchronicity, y\u2019all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: Class content will be released on Sunday June, 11th!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.auplod.com/i-uaodlp97d93.html\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.auplod.com/u/uaodlp97d93.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m Christopher Liddell, a Director, Choreographer, performer, and teaching artist. I grew up and trained in sunny LA/Hollywood, then I worked as a professional in bustling NYC for ten years. There I did literally everything; danced with top notch dance companies, sang at Lincoln Center, choreographed for the nation\u0027s best dancers, and even waited tables for a while haha! Eventually I was on faculty at the world-renowned dance studio, Steps on Broadway and was a guest teacher at several well known institutions including Yale University.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.auplod.com/i-oupald97d94.html\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.auplod.com/u/oupald97d94.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing an artist and teacher is wonderfully fulfilling work. I\u2019ve worked with thousands of dancers from around the world but eventually we have to part ways. Well now, we can be together again! Through Patreon, I can be your dance teacher, coach, and friend wherever you are in the world! And if we haven\u2019t met before, this is a perfect avenue to establish our rapport.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut there are always two sides to the arts career coin. As a full-time, freelance artist and teacher I\u2019m usually juggling 4-5 projects at a time to makes ends meet. However there are times like spring, Christmas, and summer where companies and schools are on break and I don\u2019t have full-time or even part-time employment. Patreon is a great way to send my work out into the world and receive steady support so that I can be my best in the classroom, on stage, and in my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.auplod.com/i-adolpu97d95.html\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.auplod.com/i-upadol98301.html\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.auplod.com/u/upadol98301.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour monthly pass will grant you access to a treasure trove of fitness, dance, and career instruction videos starring me and my fabulous students! With this support I can further my education at American Ballet Theatre, make even more compelling Patreon content, or even produce another dance film.  But hold on, there\u2019s more! You\u2019ll also receive my eternal gratitude and you\u2019ll be contributing to my growth as an artist, teacher, and community member.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease have a look at my 2015 short film below to see how I turned the wonderful support from my GoFundMe contributors into moving art. \u201cB.A.L.L.E.T. a Romance\u201d, became a Pointe Magazine Editor\u0027s Choice prompting its stars to grace the cover of Dance Magazine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0fm1mVG4oyM\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProfile and cover photos: Kelly Ross\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecial thanks to Harry and Leta Soza, the Dynamic Father/Daughter duo, who helped me cook this up from the beginning!!\u003cbr\u003e"
