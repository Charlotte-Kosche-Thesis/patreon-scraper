Although our IndieGogo campaign went extremely well, we didn\u0027t quite hit our goal.

Despite being text-based, we have a lot planned visually, such as a bestiary for all the flora and fauna of the world, and a journal to help you keep track of the NPC\u0027s, as well as a slick GUI.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo begin with only the Backers and above from the Indiegogo campaign will have access to the explicit artwork, but we plan to extend this to Patreon backers later down the line as well. All other artwork, backgrounds, items and non-explicit character art will be accessible to everyone, however.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://www.carnalsouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PatreonRaces3.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the planned features?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\nYou can see some more detailed posts about planned features on \u003ca href=\"http://www.carnalsouls.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eour site\u003c/a\u003e, but here\u0027s a breakdown:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRPG essentials: Experience and leveling, skills, perks, generated loot, spells,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.carnalsouls.com/feature-feature-bounties-random-and-emergent-quests/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003equests\u003c/a\u003e, and exploration.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn open world containing large cities, small settlements, ruins, caves, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.carnalsouls.com/feature-feature-dungeons/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edangerous dungeons\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.carnalsouls.com/feature-feature-battles-skills-and-gear/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTurn-based combat with a wide range of unique enemies, tactics, and bosses.
