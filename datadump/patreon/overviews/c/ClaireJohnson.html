    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Claire and I live in the U.S.! \u00a0I\u0027m currently 22, and do digital art, make stickers, and phone charms out of clay! How I decided to make my own Patreon page is I\u0027ve seen a lot of other fantastic artists out there who display their own art on on DeviantArt, Twitter, Tumblr, and here with amazing art styles of their own! So I decided why not make a Patreon page of my own so I can get more support for my own art as well! I currently don\u0027t have a job and only earning about 100$ a month from my mom as an allowance which isn\u0027t too bad cause it\u0027s a lot, but considering how much I spend it on every month depending on how many things I buy with the money, it\u0027s not so much even though I appreciate the money. If you ever wanna contact me, my tumblr, twitter, and DeviantArt pages are:https://animeartistgirl.tumblr.com/ \u00a0https://twitter.com/splatoonfangirl and https://spikeybluehedgehog.deviantart.com/\u00a0 Here\u0027s my art blog on tumblr!:\u00a0https://www.tumblr.com/blog/clairescuteandfunart\u003cbr\u003e Here\u0027s some examples of my art so you can have a sense of how it looks! :)\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://orig10.deviantart.net/e2b3/f/2017/057/d/c/holiday_cuteness__by_spikeybluehedgehog-db0jleu.jpg\"\u003eThis one I decided to make for myself for a holiday drawing~\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://orig10.deviantart.net/ad9e/f/2017/057/3/1/hamsters_on_a_kite___by_spikeybluehedgehog-db0jl35.jpg\"\u003eThis one above is of some of my friend\u0027s splatoon Ocs as hamsters flying on a kite~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig00.deviantart.net/e72e/f/2017/057/b/b/another_birthday_drawing___by_spikeybluehedgehog-db0jkvn.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis one above is another birthday drawing for another friend!
