I\u2019ve dedicated my life to playing and promoting indie games. It\u2019s really rewarding to have my job blend so well with my hobby. I can proudly say I am independently self-employed. Thanks in part to my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDiscord\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in January 2017 I started a Discord server. At first is was meant to host some video content creators. At some point game developers joined and the server evolved. Today CFN is a server for anyone involved with gaming. Most of the members are game developers but we also house content creators, streamers, game press, artists and even some gamers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLink:\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/CFN\"\u003e https://discord.gg/CFN\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCFN is a Discord partner and all are welcome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCFN_Gaming\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the beginning I had a website. It was called \u2018computerfiguur.com\u2019. The way it was laid out felt more like my personal blog. It didn\u2019t feel right hosting an entire team of writers on this tiny site. The gaming blogs got renamed: CFNGaming.com. You can sign in to leave feedback, comments and opinions. We also provide social media buttons to make it easier to share our work. I own the website but I have a team of writers and creators helping me by submitting content.\u003cbr\u003eThese guys are amazing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCFNGaming.com hosts indie-game related news, articles and reviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYoutube\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in January 2016 I started my own YouTube channel. It shared the name \u2018ComputerFiguur\u2019 with the original website. When the website was moved we also re-branded as the CFN (ComputerFiguur\u2019s Network) channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLinks:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtube.com/computerfiguur\"\u003ehttps://youtube.com/computerfiguur\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtube.com/computerfiguursnetwork\"\u003ehttps://youtube.com/computerfiguursnetwork\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I promote games and I want to be fair and objective the main channel is often used to host video reviews made by others sometimes using codes we provide for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwitter\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo promote my original YouTube channel I started using Twitter. Around May of 2016 this account had 9000 followers. By the start of 2017 that account had 60,000 followers and now it\u2019s more than 110,000 total followers. Twitter can be an amazing tool for outreach and exposure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy personal twitter:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/castoredward\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/castoredward\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCompany / indie game twitter:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/computerfiguur\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/computerfiguur\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCFN_Gaming twitter:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/CFN_Gaming\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/CFN_Gaming\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy own website\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore CFNGaming.com there was computerfiguur.com. I downgraded it to being my company website. The name was too \u201cme\u201d and it didn\u2019t feel like a team effort. Computerfiguur.com is still around and you can take a look but it\u2019s intentionally boring so you\u2019ll check out the awesome writers on CFNGaming.com instead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecoming a Patron\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy support me?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInitially I hadn\u2019t thought to make a Patreon. After a while people started asking if they could donate. A Patreon account was started to make that easier. When you donate to CFN gaming you are supporting a team and rewarding their effort. The creators who submit content are all volunteers. There\u2019s no budget to pay them for their work. With Patreon support I\u2019m able to pay for all the hosting and also share with the team. For some members I pledge on their Patreons. For a few I help get them review codes. Submissions to CFN are free. When I choose a creator and offer to host them there\u2019s no fees involved. Paying for CFNGaming hosting is my responsibility. I pay for everything that involves hosting our volunteer\u2019s hard work. In the future I plan to invest even more. More in the site and more in the creators. Your donations make that sort of investment possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons get a special role on the CFN Discord server. This is the exclusive Patron-room. When a Patron has a comment or concern I will be around to answer.\u003cbr\u003e"
