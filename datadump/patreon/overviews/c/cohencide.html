Once a week there will be a brand new full color page of excitement and hilarity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://partycrashertshirts.com/catalog/view/theme/tshart/images/pat/ladygunky.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWait. Back up. What is this Patreon thing?\u00a0\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\nOkay. So it works like this. People are creating work on the internet for free and other people wanted an easy way to show their appreciation in the form of small monetary payments. I don\u0027t like to think of them as donations. Donations implies that it\u0027s charity. \u003cstrong\u003eGood work has value.\u003c/strong\u003e You pay when you go to the movies, you pay for cable tv, you pay for your Netflix account. This is no different. \u00a0Well, it is different in that \u003cstrong\u003eyou pay what you want\u003c/strong\u003e. It\u0027s debited every month securely, automatically, and \u003cstrong\u003eyou can cancel anytime\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0In addition to supporting something you enjoy, you get added benefits that the cheapskates don\u0027t get. \u00a0(More on that later in the \u003cstrong\u003ePledge\u003c/strong\u003e section)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGreat. Tell me more about Mallville Rules!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\nMallville Rules! is a weekly webcomic about five high school friends who go to a high school where all of the students have super powers. But it\u0027s not a special high school where they learn how to control their powers and use them for good. Instead, it\u0027s a regular high school where they learn almost nothing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://partycrashertshirts.com/catalog/view/theme/tshart/images/pat/guidance.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey have their share of wacky adventures but mostly the comic is about the most powerful super power in the universe: \u003cem\u003ethe power of friendship\u003c/em\u003e! Seriously!\u003cimg src=\"http://partycrashertshirts.com/catalog/view/theme/tshart/images/pat/powertest-smaller.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut don\u0027t worry; it is a comic about high school so\u00a0there are a lot of dick jokes along with some very insightful social commentary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://partycrashertshirts.com/catalog/view/theme/tshart/images/pat/jewish-dog.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://partycrashertshirts.com/catalog/view/theme/tshart/images/pat/ivegotyoubladder.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.partycrashertshirts.com/catalog/view/theme/tshart/images/pat/dontmakemekickyourass.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd there are plenty of jokes\u00a0about superheroes \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.partycrashertshirts.com/catalog/view/theme/tshart/images/pat/fastballspecial.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://partycrashertshirts.com/catalog/view/theme/tshart/images/pat/batman.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand pop culture in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.partycrashertshirts.com/catalog/view/theme/tshart/images/pat/game-of-thongs.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFine. But I still don\u0027t see why I have to give you money.\u00a0\u003c/h2\u003eWell, you don\u0027t have to do anything. But let\u0027s be honest. You get what you pay for. Did you ever notice that Game of Thrones is better than Two Broke Girls?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the biggest problems we\u0027ve had in being able to consistently bring you new pages is that drawing comic pages takes a long time. And in the past, all of the artists have donated their time. The flip side of that is that when they get the opportunity to do paid gigs, they take them. So, we have made drawing Mallville Rules! a paid gig.\u00a0Now, it\u0027s not a lot of money, considering what they do, but it means Mallville Rules is not just free, it actually costs money to bring it to you every week. \u003cstrong\u003eBeing able to pay the artist means we will be able to consistently bring you new pages and new stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAnd let\u0027s be honest. It\u0027s nice to feel like people appreciate what you\u0027re doing. And what better way to show your appreciation than with cold hard cash. Skip that mocha frappucino once a month and you will be able to pitch in. Or stop putting money in that college fund. I mean honestly, who are you kidding?\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook below for some of the\u003cstrong\u003e sweet rewards\u003c/strong\u003e you get in exchange for your contribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
