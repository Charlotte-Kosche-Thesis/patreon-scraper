    "summary": "Howdy, Charleston. I\u0027m Jared Smith, more commonly known as the \"Charleston weather Twitter guy.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/chswx\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@chswx on Twitter\u003c/a\u003e in April 2008, I wanted to provide no-nonsense, hype-free, straight-to-the-point weather as an experiment in what Twitter could do. Nine years later, we\u0027ve braved a hurricane, a giant flood, countless strong thunderstorms, heat waves, ice storms, conversational snowflakes...a little bit of everything. To be able to do this has been a phenomenal opportunity, one 11-year-old me would be absolutely awestruck by. More to the point, though, I\u0027m awestruck by \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0-- this doesn\u0027t work without your reports, retweets, and most importantly, your \u003cstrong\u003etrust. \u003c/strong\u003eThank you for that, and for all of your support over the last 9+ years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the intervening nine years, I\u0027ve added presences on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://facebook.com/chswx\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://instagram.com/chswx\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e in addition to Twitter. I\u0027ve also been running a companion website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://chswx.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echswx.com\u003c/a\u003e, which is by far the fastest way in town to get a look at the current weather and the forecast for the next three days. With your support, I can expand these offerings and make them better than ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why a Patreon page?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst and foremost, I want to make clear that @chswx is \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0going behind a paywall. I never want to clutter it with ads, and I never want to give the impression that it is somehow motivated by money. There\u0027s a lot of weather clickbait in social media, and I want @chswx to be the antidote.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, a lot of you ask how you can give back. Reports and retweets (when I\u0027ve done something worthy) are amazing. But some have even gone further, wondering how to donate. I\u0027ve not had a good answer for this because I\u0027ve not been sure how I want to manage it to this point. Fortunately, Patreon has created a pretty nice and reliable platform that will help me not only provide a trustworthy outlet for supporters, but also gives me the ability to create even more great stuff for y\u0027all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, I want to cement @chswx\u0027s place in #chstwitter (and beyond) for the long term. It\u0027s pretty clear you like it, and nine years in I love doing the weather for y\u0027all more than ever. Becoming a supporter of @chswx helps ensure that I\u0027ll be around geeking out about the weather for years to come, and will be able to do it in a way that is true to my mission of keeping things straight and to the point. You\u0027ll get access to enhanced content, sneak previews of some work I have in the hopper, and much more. The funds will be entirely reinvested in data feeds, server costs, and development costs for new platforms (and, with any luck, will give me the headroom I need to start working on what people have most requested -- a @chswx app!)\u003cbr\u003e"
