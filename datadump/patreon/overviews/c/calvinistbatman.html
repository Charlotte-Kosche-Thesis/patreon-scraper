    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is \u003cstrong\u003eCalvinist Batman\u003c/strong\u003e, but seriously, call me Bruce...mostly because he does all the fundraising.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eTHE PLAN\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m excited to announce that starting January 2017, I will be launching a new podcast called\u003cem\u003e Calvinist Batman Reads Systematic Theology\u003c/em\u003e. I have been hosting my other podcast\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/calvinist-batman-friends/id949628132?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCalvinist Batman \u0026amp; Friends\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003efor 2 years with over 105 episodes recorded. It has taught me a lot about consistency and how to launch a great show from day one. Each week on\u00a0\u003cem\u003eCalvinist Batman Reads Systematic Theology \u003c/em\u003eI will read a 15-20 minute section from a systematic theology (starting with Vos\u0027 \u003cem\u003eReformed Dogmatics: Parts 1-5\u003c/em\u003e) with no commentary. Just straight reading. Every couple months I plan on doing a summary episode talking to a guest about the sections I have been reading through. I will also be inviting some guests, both well-known and not well-known, to guest-host a reading here and there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eTHE GOAL\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy \u003cu\u003egoal\u003c/u\u003e is to help people study theology by making systematic theologies more easily accessible financially (since the books are quite expensive) and comprehensively (since not many people will ever pick up one of these old big books). By doing this, along with my efforts at \u003cem\u003eCalvinist Batman \u0026amp; Friends\u003c/em\u003e, I hope to help people who are new to Reformed Theology who are eager to learn from well-known church doctors a chance to learn especially when they are strapped for time and money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eTHE NEED\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why do I need help if I already have a podcast? It\u0027s funny actually. I never knew the cost of a podcast until I did one, and that was just to air it. That\u0027s not mentioning getting good hardware and software equipment to make it sound \u003cem\u003egood\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past few years, I have done a t-shirt fundraiser every year to raise enough money to continue paying the hosting fees for another year. Again, just the hosting fees, not any of the other expenses. While the shirt sales have definitely helped keep the podcast afloat, the truth is that the show has had to dip into my personal pockets more and more. I hate fundraising and begging people to buy t-shirts so I can *hopefully* keep the show going. With this new podcast I decided to do something different: to start a Patreon and ask you to partner with me for this effort. \u003cstrong\u003eI am committed to this for the long-term. If you find the goal above to be something you believe in and desire, please partner with me in making this show a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUltimately, I am hopeful that I have done my last t-shirt \"fundraiser\". I still would love to sell swag, though at for-cost prices. So in reality, \u003cstrong\u003ethis won\u0027t just\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003esupport creating ONE podcast, but TWO podcasts\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0since this will also help support my other show. I \u003cem\u003ealso \u003c/em\u003eplan on writing blog posts again and doing interviews via blog post with even more influential authors and theologians. 2017 is looking bright! To do all of this though, I need your help. I pray and hope you will consider joining me in this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e-- CB\u003cbr\u003e"
