    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSo here\u0027s why we need a Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCosmetic Sanctuary\u00a0went live on December 31st of 2011 as a hobby that we were passionate about. We grew rapidly since then gaining so much support from our fans and readers. When we are not at our day jobs (Most of the time even then) swatches, writing, testing, interacting and so much more is being done. Cosmetic Sanctuary is no longer just a hobby, but a full-time job in and of itself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing we promised ourselves was that we were not going to fill our website with intrusive ads all over the place. We have kept it simple and clean having ads out of the way on the side bar of our site.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) We want to go on for a long time.\u003c/strong\u003e We love doing what we do and are so excited to see that our readers do as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) We want to continue the growth.\u003c/strong\u003e Our goal is to have Cosmetic Sanctuary be self-sustaining. Ads are the most common way to accomplish this. Ads are annoying and hurt the user experience. We have ideas on how to accomplish the same goal but without the annoyance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we plan on doing with Patreon donations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul style=\"\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHosting - \u003c/strong\u003eWe want to make sure we continue to be able to handle spikes of traffic when new products are being released and not pulling our hair out if our website crashes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOngoing Web Development - \u003c/strong\u003eWe have many features in mind when it comes to the website and want to continue developing these.
