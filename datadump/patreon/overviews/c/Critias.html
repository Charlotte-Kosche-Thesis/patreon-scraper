fanfic, believe it or not.\u00a0 I used to just type up a story on a forum just for fun, hit \"post\" and call it a day.\u00a0 Whether \u003cem\u003eWarmachine\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eShadowrun\u003c/em\u003e, folks got to \u003cstrong\u003eimmediately \u003c/strong\u003eread, enjoy, and give feedback.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s not how it works once you go pro.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll too \noften, the art of freelancing isn\u0027t rushing to meet a \ndeadline, it\u0027s (a) hearing about a new product, (b) getting product \ndetails from an editor, (c) getting psyched about a cool story idea, (d)\n struggling to condense that cool story idea into an elevator pitch, (e)\n waiting to hear back about that pitch, (f) handling contract and NDA \ndetails, (g) writing the actual story, (h) waiting to hear back about \nthat first draft, (i) handling editing on that draft, (j) waiting for \nthe story to actually make it to publication after all the other editing, layout, printing, shipping, and distribution, and THEN (k) finally showing the \nworld the cool story idea you were excited about, like, six or nine or twelve months ago (or longer). \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a lot of \"hurry up and wait,\" and -- more importantly -- even in this era of internet connectivity, I often feel pretty far away from the work I\u0027m doing and the readers I\u0027m doing it for.\u00a0 None of this is anybody\u0027s \u003cem\u003efault\u003c/em\u003e, the editors do their job, the proofers, the layout guy, the printers, everybody.\u00a0 It\u0027s a complicated process (that\u0027s part of why I did \u003cem\u003eStrays\u003c/em\u003e, to better understand and appreciate all that).\u00a0 But sometimes it\u0027s still frustrating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT THE CAMPAIGN IS:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where \u003cstrong\u003eyou \u003c/strong\u003ecome in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether, we can skip straight to (c) getting psyched about a cool story idea, (g) writing the cool story, and (k) sharing the cool story with you.\u00a0 Here.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore writing!\u00a0 Every month!\u00a0\u00a0 Without me going broke!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of that will be \"franchise fiction,\" basically fanfic, just whatever little ideas pop into my head in an established setting.\u00a0 If you like \u003cem\u003eShadowrun \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e and just whatever other random stories might bebop into my skull based on a game or some movies or what-not?\u00a0 I\u0027ll post it here.\u00a0 It\u0027ll be non-canon, it\u0027ll be rough around the edges, it\u0027ll be fast and sharp and just for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of that will be random essays.\u00a0 I\u0027m a historian by education, not a fiction writer.\u00a0 Sometimes I\u0027ll \"cross the streams,\" by going back into Professor Zimmerman mode.\u00a0 I\u0027ll write or talk about a certain aspect of a game world, I\u0027ll review something, or I\u0027ll just generally overthink stuff related to some popular game world or aspect of the hobby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast but \u003cem\u003ecertainly \u003c/em\u003enot least, some of that will be early access to my other work.\u00a0 I can\u0027t share any official \u003cem\u003eShadowrun\u003c/em\u003e work, for instance, because part of contracted writing is a non-disclosure agreement.\u00a0 But anything I\u0027m working on that\u0027s not under NDA?\u00a0 I\u0027ll post bits of it here.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT I\u0027VE DONE
