Since I was probably 5 or 6. I got into gaming because it was something to do, but as time passed, it became a way of bonding with friends and family.\u00a0 I played a lot of First Person Shooters, and RPGs.\u00a0 I played the franchise Delta Force, and Socom, for a long time.\u00a0 My dad and I played Delta Force 2, Delta Force Land Warrior, and Task Force Dagger for a few years.\u00a0 My dad worked a lot, and that was one of the few ways we were able to bond.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI played the Socom franchise for a while.\u00a0 It was awesome, and I was pretty good at it.\u00a0 I met a lot of people through the clan I was in, and also had a lot of fun in games and bsing with others.\u00a0 It was unfortunate to see both of these franchises disappear into the abyss.\u00a0 Perhaps one day, I can revitalize those companies and I can provide that experience to everyone else..\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve played a few other games that I have watched burn to the ground.\u00a0 It\u0027s mainly because the brains behind it lose interest and go to what they want to do.\u00a0 I\u0027ve seen many of companies stick around and change their approach to revitalize their product, making a better on than before (D3). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a various amount of other passions, and one of them is writing. At the moment, I will express this mostly through Patreon.\u00a0 I\u0027ve been writing a lot on my phone, journals, and also other Social Media outlets.\u00a0 I will be creating a website to contain my expressions in the coming weeks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy what I have to write.\u00a0 I feel it might have value to someone, which is what I hope to accomplish via this site.\u003cbr\u003e",
