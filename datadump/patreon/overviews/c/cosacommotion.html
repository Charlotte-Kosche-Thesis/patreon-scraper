     "about": "Cos A Commotion began as an idea from its creators Shellane and Dean Demarest. At first, it was the overwhelming reaction from Shellane\u2019s initial cosplay convention appearance as The Walking Dead\u2019s Michonne. When she arrived home that day, she told Dean what happened. The experience peaked Dean\u0027s curiosity. He wanted Shellane to test the waters at MegaCon Orlando 2016.\u00a0They decided to experiment with a new cosplay, Lady Boss Fish Mooney from Gotham. The reaction was beyond what either could imagine. At that moment, Dean decided he would cosplay Oswald Cobblepot, and from there they attended many other conventions. Whether or not you watched Gotham, people enjoyed their commitment to the authenticity of their cosplay as well as the fact they are an actual married couple. From there they\u00a0were joined by prominent cosplayers such as Dennis Cutter, Elizabeth Skye, Alyssa Turner, David Hankerson, Reg Padgett, Justin Grubb, Sean Hall and Marty Grifka\u00a0to join their\u00a0\u201cset play\u201d as other Gotham characters in a custom-built Gotham City\u00a0back alley Dean built himself. Guests can join in their authentic set play to experience a fully interactive photo shoot experience with their favorite cosplay characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides the iconic characters from Gotham, Dean and Shellane also cosplay \u201cRichonne\u201d from the Walking Dead and Starlord and Gamora from Guardians of the Galaxy. The convention determines the scene of their set play. Therefore, they are always looking for additional cast members to add their cast. They ask if there are any cosplayers interested in joining that they contact them at Info@CosACommotion.com.",
