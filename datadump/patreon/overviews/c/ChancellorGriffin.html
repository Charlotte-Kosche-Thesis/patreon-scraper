    "summary": "One of the things I love the most about the Kabby fandom is how generous\n people are with their talents.  I love that I can support the fan \nartists I love by buying their prints to hang on my wall.  I love the \nrich treasure trove of incredible fic and meta writers we have in our \nfandom, the people who create amazing fanmix playlists and edits and \ngifsets.  And one of the most beautiful, amazing things about fanwork \ncreators is that they just \u003cem\u003egive us all this stuff for free\u003c/em\u003e, it just drops miraculously into our laps from the sky like magic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd\n yet, here I am, slightly afraid it\u0027s going to make me look like an \nasshole but swallowing my pride anyway, to ask for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\n love writing fanfic.  I have an inbox full of requests I can\u0027t get \nthrough fast enough, and a long list of ideas for projects both big and \nsmall that I am yearning to tackle - a Kabby/\u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e crossover, a \u003cem\u003eLeverage\u003c/em\u003e\n AU, a large-scale Season 3 fix-it fic where Callie and Vera come to \nEarth on Farm Station - and nowhere near enough time to get to them.  \nI\u0027m a full-time writer, which means writing is how I pay my bills.  \nFreelancing is hard work, and you have to say yes to every job - no \nmatter how time-consuming or boring - because there\u0027s no stability.  So \nin between doing stuff that is artistically rewarding but doesn\u0027t pay \nthat well - like writing plays - I spend a lot of time doing boring work\n for clients to buy groceries and pay my electric bill.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what I \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e\n love is writing things for you guys.  I love the relationships I\u0027ve \nbuilt over the past year with the people who read my work and send me \nfic requests; I love writing things that make you squee or cry or scream\n at me on Twitter.  It\u0027s the thing that really brings me joy, and I want\n to be able to devote more time to it than I\u0027m currently able to do.  So\n here I am, taking a chance that maybe there are people out there \nwilling to toss me a few extra bucks per month so I can keep writing \nthings for you.  If every AO3 hit I\u0027ve ever received equaled one dollar,\n this could be my full-time job.  And while I know that there are a lot \nof people out there who aren\u0027t able to donate (and don\u0027t worry, friends,\n I\u0027ll keep writing things for y\u0027all no matter what!), every dollar that \ncomes in through Patreon equals more time I can spend doing the thing I \nreally love, which is an incredibly precious gift.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much, friends!  I\u0027m so grateful for you all!\u003cbr\u003e"
