    "summary": "In 2014, veteran\u00a0Canadian television journalist Stuart McNish got an itch. Gone were the days of Barbara Walters or Walter Cronkite when families would gather around the TV to watch these incredible interviewers tease the stories out of some of the world\u0027s most remarkable people. Soundbites, the internet, media competition, and social media had diluted the conversations about issues that are most important to us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis curiosity about issues, passion for people, and journalistic sensibility took over and Stu set out to revise the art of the single-guest, long-form television interview with a modern twist \u2014 webcasting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, Stu and his small, independent team of videographers and journalists have produced more than 160 episodes of Conversations That Matter on topics ranging from racism, indigenous rights and energy transition to the series we launched 2018 with - a 7-part series examining the state of democracy and the media\u0027s role in protecting our freedoms.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out our website: \u003ca href=\"http://www.conversationsthatmatter.tv/\"\u003ewww.conversationsthatmatter.tv\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eBlog: \u003ca href=\"http://www.conversationsthatmatter.blog\"\u003ewww.conversationsthatmatter.blog\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eand YouTube page: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaOBg1kkPaM-cluL6D2DNoQ?disable_polymer=true\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaOBg1kkPaM-cluL...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, you\u0027ll get a sense of all we have accomplished\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why haven\u0027t you heard of us until now? Well, that\u0027s the thing about independent media. Gaining traction in a loud, chaotic marketplace dominated by pundits and media conglomerates is no easy feat. That\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re so excited that you are here. Independent media are redefining journalism and re-igniting a passion for protecting the rights of our voices to have an impact on society.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeep coming back. We post new videos on provocative topics each week and our patrons earn lots of goodies just by the simple act of helping us keep the long-form television interview a vibrant, meaningful part of the media landscape.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
