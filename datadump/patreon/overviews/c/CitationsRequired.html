His sites attempt to provide a unique perspective on current events and news, with an eye towards defining a historical context for today\u0027s headlines. Be a part of community-supported news and help support Bert in presenting on-going examinations of news and events (and maybe finish my novel)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to those who encouraged me to do this and have always been my biggest supporters in my efforts to make sense of the news and opinions were all inundated with daily. I would not be here without the readers who\u0027ve always been there, wondering what I\u0027ll say next. Thank you is not nearly enough, and I hope I do you all proud."
