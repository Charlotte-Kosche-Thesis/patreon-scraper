    "summary": "I am a writer and speaker, dedicated to serving the emergence of a new and ancient story on this earth. I work for the evolution of the deep narratives, the invisible mythologies, that run our civilization. My best-known books are \u003cem\u003eSacred Economics\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe More Beautiful World our Hearts Know is Possible\u003c/em\u003e. I like to bridge activism and spirituality, systems change and consciousness change, heart logic and intellectual logic. Since 2016 I\u0027ve been working on a new book about climate change, social transformation, political strategy, and the inner dimensions of all of these.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI operate as much as I dare in gift economy, following an impulse that I share with many artists, musicians, healers... in fact anyone whose work is sacred to them. We don\u0027t want to withhold our creations in search of a payment, and we don\u0027t want money to limit who receives them. Therefore, the proper price is zero. On the other hand, we hold those gifts as valuable and precious, and prefer not to reduce them to a fixed price. Therefore, the proper price is infinity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn other words, any amount we charge is both too much and too little. What to do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe solution I\u0027ve been exploring is to offer my creations as a gift, letting the receiver decide what the return gift should be. People can let their gratitude, goodwill, and desire to support my work guide them. That is a very different energy from \"I have to pay $X to receive Y.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGift is especially appropriate for me since I don\u0027t see the work I do as \"my\" work at all. The things I write and speak about come to me as gifts, whether in the mundane sense of drawing on a cultural and intellectual context, books and conversations, or more mysteriously as sudden, unbidden insights and intuitive downloads. Sometimes these take my breath away and leave me on my knees in gratitude, gratitude for this gift that has come from beyond my self. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cannot in all honesty sell my creations as if they were mine.\u00a0The voluntary financial support of my contributors is what enables me to keep 100% of my work outside pay walls, to put the full text of all my books on line, and to free my choices about where to speak from financial pressure. It enables me to fully devote my gifts toward their true purpose, and to lose myself in their service.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you give to me through Patreon, you are making a leap of faith. You don\u0027t get an immediate, tangible product. You are saying, \"I trust you.\" Maybe it is because you value my previous creations and want to see me continue. Maybe it is because you are inspired by what I intend for the future. Or maybe it is... just because.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year, as I dive deep into writing a new book, this kind of unconditional support is even more important. It is easy to reciprocate for a tangible, immediate product like a workshop or online course. A book is different -- it will take a year or more to write it, and I cannot know in advance where the journey will take me. For this, I depend on the people who have deep confidence in me -- sometimes, it seems, deeper than the confidence I have in myself. I want to thank those of you who offer this kind of support. Your faith in the value of what I am doing is a reminder to trust my own faith in it, to persevere through doubts and setbacks, to hold a vision over time and submit myself to that vision. You remind me that I am working on behalf of a community, a tribe, a planet, upon which I am inseparably dependent. You keep me thankful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money I receive funds the needs of me, my four beautiful sons, and other of my loved ones. It also supports the people who support me, with website maintenance, logistics as a speaker, sound and video editing, live and online events, healing and counseling... all kinds of things. (When there is surplus, I give it away in the most beautiful way I can, for example to the amazing edge-workers I encounter in my travels who are doing important work without money or recognition.) My commitment and my practice is non-accumulation -- I don\u0027t accumulate savings, investments, retirement funds, or anything like that. I\u0027m not saying these are wrong, it is just my personal path. It is what helps me stay in flow and in trust.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for joining me there, in flow and in trust."

     "about": "Here are some excerpts from the bio on my website, charleseisenstein.net:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will give you some of my background, although the intense transitions of the last few years have left me feeling like a new person. Hmm, I wrote that sentence two years ago, and it is still true today. I was born in 1967 and was a very sensitive, intellectual and dreamy child. I was always consumed by questions like, \u201cWhere did I come from?\u201d\u201dWhy am I here?\u201d \u201cWhere am I going?\u201d so of course, embedded as I was in a culture that sees science and reason as the source of truth, I tried to \u201cfigure out\u201d the answers. I graduated from Yale University with a degree in Mathematics and Philosophy, but my development of reason and intellect brought me no closer to any truth I really cared about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u2019t know what I was searching for, but I knew that none of the usual options life presents a Yale graduate attracted me. I went to Taiwan, learned Chinese, and soon found myself working as a translator. I spent most of my 20s there, educating myself broadly (though not at all rigorously \u2013 it was more through osmosis) in Eastern spiritual traditions. I also read voraciously: books on health, nutrition, globalization, physics, and biology. Translation led to other business opportunities, and I became familiar with this dimension of the human experience. In Taiwan, I met my dear friend and ex-wife Patsy, with whom I have three children, all boys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my late 20s I entered what was to be a long period of intensifying crisis. It started when all my professional work became intolerable. It became excruciating to do work I didn\u2019t care about. Even though a million reasons told me why it was irresponsible, impractical, and foolish to quit, I eventually could not make myself do it anymore. An irrepressible feeling, \u201cI am not here to be doing this!\u201d took control of my life. So I entered a long period of searching. I spent time teaching yoga, learning about herbs, and teaching at Penn State\u2019s department of Science, Technology, and Society. All of these endeavors have contributed to my present and future, but none were really me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next five years were much like a birthing process. The old world dissolved, and the contractions birthing me into the new took the form of a collapse of all that I once held onto. Crises in health, marriage, and money forced me to let go of a \u201clife under control.\u201d In my helplessness, I accepted help, discovering a generous universe that has always met my needs, somehow, in unexpected ways. I have never made much money, but I have become rich in connections to other people. Friends and strangers from all over the world write to tell me how my books have affected them; they sustain my faith and nourish my passion for my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to writing books and essays, I have been doing a tremendous amount of public speaking. Sometimes, especially when I am tired from traveling, I wonder if the world needs yet another man performing \u201cspeaker up in front of an audience.\u201d Why not stay at home and use technology? But I find that something happens in person that is irreplaceable. For one thing, at live events I can see the expressions on people\u2019s faces, and I respond to that in real-time, engaging in a sort of dialog. Secondly, my speaking is not just about conveying ideas. Something else rides the vehicle of the words, even if the topic is something mundane like steady-state economics. I sometimes describe my experience as a speaker as being plugged into a field that is not my creation, but is generated by the audience and by something beyond the audience. Besides, I find that my thinking stagnates and my heart atrophies when I am in front of my computer too much. I need to interact with real people, face to face. That\u2019s why I travel and speak.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the other hand, I am increasingly drawn to developing the non-verbal, embodied gifts that I\u2019ve neglected. Like many people, I have a feeling that there is a Next Step about to happen, in my work and beyond. I don\u2019t know what it is, but I do know its revelation will come through transforming experiences that reveal and heal things I was blind to. My work, my play, my family, my deep soul connections, my wholeness, my wounds\u2026 all of these are bound up together, evolving as one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am now remarried as of 2011 and have a three-year-old, my fourth son, Cary, with my wife Stella. Besides mothering, Stella practices Chinese Medicine and other healing modalities. The two teenagers, Jimi and Matthew live with us too; the 11-year-old Philip only sometimes. My favorite moments are watching Jimi and Matthew play \u201cpass the baby\u201d with Cary, who thinks it is the funnest game in the world. Of course we have our challenges and I have occasional moments of seeing my whole life as a father as a litany of errors, but overall I feel extremely lucky to have such amazing, sensitive, talented, kind children.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://charleseisenstein.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Charles-Eisenstein.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e",
