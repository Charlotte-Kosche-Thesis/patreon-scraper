There are going to be specifics of what you like reading, but mainly, I\u0027m hoping you\u0027re here because you love reading, and more specifically, you love reading the stories I write. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing fanfiction on and off for around 15 years now. I work in whatever series strikes my fancy for the moment, and I use the work to help sharpen my skills for future projects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e a place where I\u0027m going to go \"pay me or you\u0027ll never see the chapters I\u0027m writing!\" This is a help me out so I can get some of the financial monkeys off my back so my stress level drops and my muse becomes more active.\u00a0 Anything I produce, will be eventually made public. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons just get it first ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way I plan to do it, is Patrons will get the first glimpse of new chapters and if there\u0027s interest, original work (yes, I have several novels I\u0027ve started but have been put on hold due to my feelings of needing to sharpen my skills more).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter once a month, the chapters from the previous month will be released on the fanfiction federation forum I\u0027ve been posting my works in progress to for the last few years. After the work is completed, it will then be revised and edited before being published. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, Patrons will be able to get their hands on, and comment on everything first.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also release the chapters in 3 different formats. .docx, .pdf,\u00a0 and .epub with more potential formats likely to be added. In addition, once the final work has been fully edited and revised, I will post files for the full fics in those formats as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re worried about too many works coming out too quickly, you can put a cap on the max amount you\u0027ll pledge per month. Patreon is good like that. Though, if enough money comes in, I\u0027m hoping to get at least 3 chapters out a month, though I can\u0027t guarantee the specific series. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also run a monthly poll where patrons are able to vote on and decide what at least 1 of the fics I work on will be. So long as they\u0027re not a part of the goals. \u003cbr\u003e"
