    "summary": "Hi! Possibly you\u0027re here because you enjoy my books. Yay! Let\u0027s bring wonderful things to the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWait, hold on, let me explain what \u0027here\u0027 is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an alternative crowdfunding method, sort of like Kickstarter but functioning as an ongoing way to support creators you consistently enjoy. If I was making music, you could pledge per song. If I was writing webcomics, you could pledge per month. What I do is closer to webcomics than songs, so I\u0027m going to try out the \u0027per month\u0027 setup. \u00a0Starting later this year I\u0027m hoping to provide tastes or even serial chapters of one or more projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOK, and now you\u0027re wondering... why? Well, so far I\u0027ve been using Kickstarter to crowdfund books. My publisher used it to gauge interest and handle preorders, and I\u0027ve used it to do those things as well as actually fund book production. But for various reasons, I\u0027d love to be able to use Patreon to do all that instead of Kickstarter. \u00a0Even a small steady income would allow me to manage production values reliably, and it\u0027d be fun to have a way to interact with readers that would provide motivation come up with more ways to entertain.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(I\u0027m really strongly deadline-driven, have I mentioned that? Self-publishing can take away a lot of that pressure, alas.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut perhaps you\u0027re new. Perhaps you\u0027d like to know what this is all about, more than just \"she writes books.\" Well. Basically, I write technical fantasy about strong characters grappling with a rapidly changing world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Yeah, thinking about it... that pretty much covers almost everything I do, from the \u003cem\u003eSenyaza \u003c/em\u003ebooks to the \u003cem\u003eFirstborn \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eNightlights \u003c/em\u003estories.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like fallen angels, you\u0027ve come to the right place. If you\u0027ve always wanted to see more women as epic heroes, welcome. Curious about presenting neurodiverse or non-stereotyped mostly-competent mentally ill characters in a fantasy setting?
