    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a filmmaker, I receive as part of my work many compliments from yourselves and Youtube viewers on the quality and dedication of my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy style\u00a0in summary:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eAn English gentleman who crosses invisible boundaries separating the past and present to share historical detail and ghostly tales for discerning viewers. \u003cbr\u003ePresented by a very popular raconteur with empathetic ability, who skilfully reconnects history and events with paranormality during the course of these presentations or on subsequent investigations.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of you appreciate the uniqueness of my shows, and have commented on my artistic abilities in film, music, story writing and photography. I am also a historian and a student of architecture which I share in my work.\u003cbr\u003eApart from my writing abilities, all of these skills are entirely self-taught, and in some cases have taken years to improve to the present standard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy presentations are appreciated by many viewers across the world as I share places and history that ordinarily they would not be privy to see, and often from little known locations which not only have a fascinating story to tell, but are also haunted and these I share as night investigations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch of my reputation in the film and paranormal world is based upon my honesty and integrity. I do not share fake or questionable material to improve ratings and adsense earnings. I believe in creating quality productions that are educational, entertaining, and enlightening. I also dress period appropriate in a manner that evokes the past and within I \u00a0weave a magic to take viewers from the modern world into another world full of intrigue and mystery. My work and style is very professional with a commitment for excellence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut, in order for me to reach the next level of development I desperately need your help to support my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe areas where crowd funding would significantly improve my productions will be:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) Better equipment.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I own one HD day camcorder for filming presentations, which is a basic model used by home hobbyists. To share the quality that you enjoy requires re-grading to improve it`s visual appearance. The current standard is now at least 4k which I cannot afford, but I desperately need to upgrade to keep ahead of others in the field.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy editing PC also needs upgrading to a more powerful machine as even editing at an HD standard creates audio lagging issues which are difficult to keep on top of. Neither of these items are cheap for my needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) Improved locations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch of what I have shared has come from freely accessible locations rather than prime locations both here and abroad which I cannot afford to access. Patreon funding will allow me the opportunity to travel more and hopefully meet more of you on my travels. I have made many friends through my work both here in the UK and abroad, and it would be great to meet and work with some of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany locations are often run by trusts or are privately owned, and many require upfront fees. These start at a minimum of \u00a3200 and upwards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I shot at Warden Abbey House last December, the fee for a few days stay was around \u00a3500. I simply couldn\u0027t afford to do this again from my current limited resources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother huge disadvantage is the fact that travelling abroad requires air tickets. Even at the low end, a flight to and from the USA is a minimum of \u00a3500, and travelling to say Australia and New Zealand where I would also love to shoot is completely out of the question at present. Also add (where relevant) accommodation and travelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) Background people and actors.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome productions that I shoot would be greatly improved by actors to dress according to the periods that I cover, and in some cases to artistically recreate some drama from history.\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I rely solely on stills and photographs which although appealing, do not entirely do justice to what I am filming. Many of these people I envisage are re-enactors, or actors willing to shoot for expenses to upgrade their CV. But also there is a cost in the hire of suitable costumes. None of this I can afford at present.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what can I offer you by return?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy funding my work you will allow me to continue my unfinished journey to explore, film and share some amazing and beautiful places. And additionally, you will be also safe in the knowledge that my expertise as a historian and explorer of the paranormal will be real and without the drama and hysteria that seemingly is the benchmark of modern reality television which many of my viewers are patently tired of\u003cbr\u003eAll my work is painstakingly filmed, presented and edited by me to provide quality shows. There are no short cuts to quality, and certainly no excuses for over dramatisation. What you see is what you get. The truth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I am one of the very few totally independent film producers in the UK, and my commitment to creating fascinating and compelling documentaries has taken me to some incredible historical locations which are often `undiscovered` from the attentions of the mainstream media.\u003cbr\u003eThis raises viewer enjoyment, and particularly so as I try to show each venue as it would have looked from a past perspective. Devoid of modernity and people, and sometimes opening in period sepia, I present each show dressed in clothing contemporary to the past, to try to and give the viewer an informative feel of life in a period setting while presenting the history and legends of the shoot location.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAudience reaction to my work has been positive and extremely encouraging. I have an easy going and informative style, which people find relaxing to listen to, and as an added seperate bonus show from the end of the main show presentation, I also touch base on the paranormal history as well. Both interconnect in a complimentary way, which is testament to the fact that some viewers who do not believe in the paranormal, still enjoy watching my accounts of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring my professional life I have appeared as a guest on BBC Tv and BBC radio. Additionally I have appeared on CNN in Atlanta, and on TV7 in Bulgaria. I have also published articles in UK and USA journals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
