    "summary": "I make videos about math, animated programmatically. I also have an affection for anthropomorphic pi creatures. This channel runs on the voluntary payments of the patrons, and for that, I cannot thank you enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMain things to know:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePledges are per video; I shoot to produce 2-3 per month, but won\u2019t charge for any more than that.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou get early access to videos in future \"Essence of\" series.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn the hopes of offering a better viewing experience, I turn off YouTube ads on new videos for their first month.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here, you probably have some idea of what I\u0027m trying to do with the channel, but it never hurts to say things explicitly: The goal is present math as visually as possible, focusing on topics and intuitions that aren\u0027t commonly presented elsewhere, and showing by example how math is a creative pursuit.\u00a0 Community contributions make this possible.\u00a0 Also, they\u0027re important for feeding my surprisingly ravenous pi creatures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019ll indulge me in some musing here, I find Patreon, and more generally the notion of voluntary direct payments for content, a \u003cem\u003esuper\u003c/em\u003e interesting thing to be happening to the internet. Typically content is either provided for a fee (e.g. movies, college lectures), where incentives are aligned to give people highly valued experiences but there is a barrier to those experiences, or it supported through ads, which lowers the barrier to consumption but misdirects incentives towards reaching larger numbers of eyeballs, which is only indirectly associated with giving people valued experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs someone who makes videos about math, neither of those seems optimal. It\u2019s very good for things to be free since there should be as low a barrier as possible to people having their enthusiasm for math ignited. But on the other hand, I want everything to be aligned towards crafting deeper experiences that enable people to legitimately engage with math beyond a surface level. Luckily, we somehow live in a world where the content can be free, but it still runs on a direct relationship between creator and consumer, because some people simply choose to pay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo for that, thank you.\u00a0 In return, I will do everything I can to produce content worthy of your generosity, which hopefully causes a meaningful shift in people\u0027s perception of math.\u00a0 Also, I\u0027m in pretty desperate need of hiring a full-time caretaker for the pi creatures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the best, and keep loving math,\u003cbr\u003e-Grant"
