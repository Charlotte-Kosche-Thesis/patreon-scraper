From anything like\u00a0the fanciest damn tungsten jigs one can buy, or the newest fandangled frog, to the sexiest spinnerbait you\u0027ve ever seen, if it\u0027s something I think will actually catch fish, then I\u0027ll buy it and review it! This won\u0027t just be a \"well I bought it and looked at it for 5 minutes so here\u0027s my review\" kind of review. I will absolutely put whatever I purchase through hell and back over several weeks to ensure I have a thorough understanding of the quality of the product before I give feedback on it.

There are dozens of options every $30-$40 jump, starting with the really cheap $30 rods \u0026amp; reels, up to the $600+ rods \u0026amp; reels. I would love to be able to run through the whole spectrum of options here and test as many as I can, with the same level of dedicated testing as the tackle reviews, to really give a solid \u0026amp; thorough review of whatever it is I buy and test.

Some restrictions MAY apply here depending on drive distances (I am a father of two very young children after all!).

When I reach this goal, I will join a fishing club that is part of Bass Nation, and fish every tournament needed to qualify for the state level championship, then the regionals, and so on. No amount of money will pay my way beyond the State level, that will be 100% on me and my abilities as an angler, but this money will allow me to take extended time off from work to dedicate to pre-fishing and preparing for each tournament. Doing so will help put myself in the best position to win each event, moving upward \u0026amp; onward through the levels of the Bass Nation, which ultimately ends in winning a spot to the Bassmaster Classic. Doing so will require a whole lot of travel and time on the water though to have a solid chance at making it happen! (Earnings amount will need to be reached \u0026amp; sustained for a minimum of 2 consecutive months before I will pursue this goal)",

Yes, this is an insane goal at a high price. However, I am the primary source of income for my family. Reaching this goal would put me in a position that I could leave my full time job, be able to continue to provide health insurance for my family, and still keep paying the bills on the house, all while taking on the additional cost of towing a boat 4-5 days a week to put out even more new content. All of that adds up to a high cost very quickly. To reach this point though would be a dream come true, and I sincerely hope to hit this goal at some point in my life.",
