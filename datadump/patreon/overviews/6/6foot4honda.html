Probably around 5-6 months a year because of our Canadian winter..(SUCKS)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVlogging can get expensive..depending on your plans.\u003cbr\u003eJust as an example..for this channel, the Camera Equipment I currently have = over 2,500$...Trip to Texas was over 1,000$.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon system allows me to keep pushing my channel to the next level and doing newer and cooler things each time.\u003cbr\u003eThis does NOT mean I am selling my videos, or any of that BS. This is just basically a \"tip jar\" for anyone who feels they want to support my channel in other ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had a hard time coming up with rewards, but I felt like there had to be at least some perks per tier..it\u0027s only fair.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will the \"tips\" be used for? Right now I\u0027m currently saving for my girlfriends Action Camera..so any extra pledges we receive will go directly into buying her that. Once that is finished, who knows!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will always message all the Paetron supporters before I do any type of purchase, and get your guys\u0027 opinion on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyways, thank you for all the support and may #team6 be with you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**If you having any questions regarding your rewards, or if there was an error, email me at sixfootfourhonda@gmail.com**\u003cbr\u003e"
