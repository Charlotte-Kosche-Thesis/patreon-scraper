Back in December 2012, Nintendo Power Magazine shipped its final issue. That got a lot of long-time Nintendo fans upset, as NP had been the one consistent and reliable print magazine covering Nintendo video games ever since the \u002780s. Some of us had been subscribers for over two decades, and there were still tens of thousands of active subscribers getting new issues delivered in the mail up until that final issue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, we didn\u0027t want to see that legacy die. So we assembled a dream team of the most well-known Nintendo journalists from around the world and launched a new magazine four years ago! The first issue went on sale on January 11, 2013, exactly one month after Nintendo Power ended.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNF Magazine is not Nintendo Power, but we\u0027re carrying its torch forward into the future by paying homage to the best parts of NP\u0027s past while forging a new identity with an all-new team. So join the Force! Subscribe to NF Magazine by becoming a patron here on Patreon, and \u003cstrong\u003eget all-new Nintendo magazines coming to your mailbox\u003c/strong\u003e, your email inbox or directly to your digital reading device of choice!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Note for adults: Being an adult stinks when it comes to checking your mail.

You\u0027ve got to build them yourself! We\u0027ll springboard off that \"some assembly required\" aspect of Labo too, taking a look at other areas where the physical, tangible, hold-it-in-your-hands-ness of real-world things is being championed in the gaming fandom. Like with Limited Run Games, the company that\u0027s built a business by taking previously digital-only games and giving them physical releases for the first time! We\u0027ve got you an exclusive interview with the founders, as well as the exclusive reveal of Night Trap: 25th Anniversary Edition for the Switch!

It\u0027s entitled Issue #32: The Port Report \u2013 March/April 2018. The cover art is shown below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the factors fueling the incredible success of Nintendo\u0027s Switch is that the system has become a magnet for ports from past platforms. There\u0027s just something about the combo console \u0026amp; handheld hardware that makes everyone want to play every game ever made on it, and developers are only too happy to keep pulling great games out of the shadows of yesteryear and re-releasing them in Switch form! We\u0027ve seen tons of these releases already, and even more are heading our way in 2018 \u2013 like the epic Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection, which gathers *12* different iterations of the famous fighting franchise together into a single package!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe take an in-depth look at it, evaluate more modern ports to the Switch like DOOM and Bayonetta 2, and then report on even more ports, like Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition and Dark Souls: Remastered!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cut-off date to get on the first mailing list for this issue has already come and gone, as you needed to be signed up as a patron here by Sunday, February 18.

The Big N is welcoming the bold \"M\" with open arms as well, which is a wild shift in strategy for a company consistently decried as too kiddie for the last two and a half decades. Will the incoming carnage clash with or perfectly complement Nintendo\u0027s signature cuteness (which isn\u0027t going away as the adult-oriented fare rolls in)?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNF Magazine\u0027s Issue #31: Carnage vs. Cuteness \u2013 January/February 2018 is our newest creation. And it\u0027s a unique one! As we did with Issue #24, #31 is a flippable, double-covered NF edition \u2013 you rotate it in your hands to see one cover art image on one side and the second on the reverse, and the pages inside are split into two halves to align with either Kirby Battle Royale\u0027s \"Side E\" or Wolfenstein II\u0027s \"Side M\". Those letters, of course, reference the ESRB ratings that are both battling for the spotlight on Switch right now: Nintendo\u0027s safe, family-friendly E for Everyone titles and the freshly arrived M for Mature games. Our central feature in this issue looks back on how this battle has played out on Nintendo\u0027s side of the industry over the past 25 years!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cut-off date to get on the first mailing list for this issue has already come and gone, as you needed to be signed up as a patron here by Sunday, December 17.
