     "about": "Understanding Theology is an educational resource dedicated to promoting theological understanding and challenging theological ignorance. We believe that bringing different people, ideas and beliefs together and encouraging respectful discussion with the aim of learning about ourselves and others benefits all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is frustrating that Theology, rather than theological ignorance, often takes the blame for so much conflict in the world. Theology is widely debated, but often poorly understood. People tend to show a huge amount of reluctance to learn when confronted with something different, especially when it comes to Theology. This is why we wish to engage theological ignorance in a positive and enjoyable way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTheology is not a subject that we can ever step outside of. It directly effects every aspect of all of our lives. The questions that theology is concerned with will never go away; we would do well to simply understand all the answers that have been given, and understanding how these answers relate to us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor these reasons, Understanding Theology does not seek to be objective as a goal, this is impossible, instead we aim to be fair and respectful at all times. Where relevant we will make it clear the perspectives that we are speaking from. It is important to note that there is no single perspective shared by all contributors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRelated to this is the fact that Understanding Theology does not belong to any particular tradition. We will avoid dogmatism in our subjectivity by having the humility to put education, especially our own, first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why we welcome challenges, criticisms and corrections.
