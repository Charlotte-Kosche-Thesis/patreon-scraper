Welcome to the Patreon page for the MSA at UC Davis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO ARE Y\u0027ALL?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe MSA is the Muslim Student Association! The MSA at UC Davis has been blessed to be serving one of the most vibrant and powerful college Muslim student populations in the nation for more than 30 years. We\u0027re constantly striving to live up to that standard by providing high-quality, constantly innovative programs to better serve our community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a secure, online platform that allows people to contribute amounts to projects or orgs they support monthly! This type of financial contribution is immensely helpful for us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY ARE YOU USING PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOne of our goals is to become a financially robust and self-sustainable organization. Perhaps among the best way to do this is through securing a reliable monetary stream. This form of donation is unfortunately still relatively unique and rare among the Muslim community, but it has a lot of benefits for both supporters and their orgs! By having a constant pre-set amount of money flowing in, we\u0027re able to better plan for events, we don\u0027t have to constantly spam you for donations (no agonizing, post-salah fundraisers...), and we\u0027re able to move forward on the path for healthy financially sustainability!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYep! Financial sustainability (shoutout to all the Econ majors) is absolutely key to an organization\u0027s long-term survival. We firmly believe that Muslim organizations should aim to be financially stable and pay for themselves.\u00a0Becoming financially self-sufficient will allow the MSA to not only continue providing its traditional annual programs, but be able to constantly innovate and be on the cutting-edge of providing new services. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis could range from communal training or sessions on critical topics, buying high-quality copies of the Quran and tafasir, investing in local businesses, co-hosting with other organizations, offering communal calligraphy classes taught by professionals,\u00a0expanding the reach of our Feed the Homeless and community service programs, bringing in new speakers or setting up bigger events to address much-needed issues: the possibilities are truly endless!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSOUNDS PRETTY GOOD. BUT HOW IN THE WORLD DO YOU PRONOUNCE \u0027PATREON\u0027?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSubhanaAllah, we honestly don\u0027t know. Don\u0027t show this site to your English professor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCLOSING WORDS\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst and foremost, we put our hope in Allah. We put our utmost belief that our community\u0027s\u00a0\u003cem\u003erizq\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is already written. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, we hope that you\u0027re able to be part of this beautiful\u00a0\u003cem\u003erizq\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you\u0027re able to join our vision in helping us build among the most robust, creative, and influential MSAs in the country.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you\u0027re able to help contribute whatever you can \u2014 and that Allah puts\u00a0\u003cem\u003ebarakah\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0in it all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope your support is a means of ease in this life and the next, and that any\u00a0contribution comes straight back to serve you, the community, and Muslim students for generations to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMay Allah bless you and your loved ones \u2014 and in these times of darkness, continue making this community and MSA a beaming, brilliant source of strength, light, and hope.\u003cbr\u003e"
