I had written well over 100 songs before that point, and I was used to producing things all the time. Cover songs are really fun and have always been opportunities for me to stretch my production and performance skills, so this was a great choice to keep me making things and sharing them with supportive fans. And now that I\u0027m writing originals again, about every other month there\u0027s one or more of those. Producing and being funded for three songs a month (especially if I get a few more backers) also ensures that I don\u2019t have to work a full-time day job, and can instead use my time to make MORE music for everyone! (The third monthly song was added recently to help pay rent... it\u0027s often a more quickly produced number and folks are welcome to not pay for it by limiting their monthly $ to me, and still get to listen to it.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon backers (and bandcamp subscribers, a yearly subscription with similar overall costs and rewards) received free downloads of every official release that comes out, before the public, in addition to the monthly tracks!\u003ca href=\"https://unwoman.bandcamp.com/album/uncovered-volume-3\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCover songs IN ADDITION TO UNCOVERED 3\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003eLightbringer (Covenant), Everybody Knows (Leonard Cohen), Dream On (Aerosmith), Help I\u0027m Alive (Metric), Goody Two Shoes (Adam Ant), Mr Blue Sky (Electric Light Orchestra), Psycho Killer (Talking Heads), Blasphemous Rumours (Depeche Mode), Cities in Dust (Siouxsie and the Banshees), I Fought in a War (Belle \u0026amp; Sebastian), Teardrop (Massive Attack), What the Water Gave Me (Florence + the Machine), Everybody Wants to Rule the World (Tears for Fears), Ballad of Serenity (Sonny Rhodes/Joss Whedon), Take a Chance With Me (Roxy Music), The Chaconne (Dessa), Heroes (David Bowie, the first voting request!), Bella Ciao (traditional), The Torture Detachment (Rome), Famous Blue Raincoat (Leonard Cohen), Last Christmas (Wham), The Humbling River (Pucifer); Tainted Love (Soft Cell), Everyday Is Halloween (Ministry), Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper), Hounds of Love (Kate Bush), Just Like Heaven (The Cure), Send in the Clowns (Stephen Sondheim), Cry Me a River (standard/Julie London), Come Take a Trip In My Airship \u003ca href=\"https://unwoman.bandcamp.com/merch/wax-cylinder-come-take-a-trip-in-my-airship\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e(also available on the absurdly obsolete first commercially available recording medium, the wax cylinder!)\u003c/a\u003e, Things We Lost in the Fire, duet with Aaron J Shay (Bastille), Music to Watch Boys To \u0026amp; Young and Beautiful (Lana Del Rey), Sweet Unknown (Cranes), Santa Baby (Eartha Kitt)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginal works:\u003cbr\u003eAtypical Girl\u003cbr\u003eHome\u003cbr\u003eAs You Wish\u003cbr\u003eFlies\u003cbr\u003eWar Stories\u003cbr\u003eThe Surrender\u003cbr\u003eWaxing Gibbous\u003cbr\u003eIs This Song About Vampires?\u003cbr\u003eBad Man (on Mr Rochester, from Jane Eyre)\u003cbr\u003eBreathe Out\u003cbr\u003eAlmost\u003cbr\u003eWe Love Longest (on Jane Austen\u2019s Persuasion)\u003cbr\u003eMy Kingdom as Great (Labyrinth song)\u003cbr\u003eSaviors\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI\u0027m really proud of everything I\u0027ve done!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n--\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd here is the original pitch I posted when I first started this\nPatreon:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello dear music lovers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of you have supported me through my kickstarter campaigns and other album releases. Thank you so much for that! Since I started crowdfunding in 2009 I\u0027ve funded \u0026amp; completed three full-length original albums, two covers albums \u0026amp; an EP, and various other projects, many of which can be seen at \u003ca href=\"https://unwoman.bandcamp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy bandcamp page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m trying something a bit different as I experiment with a song-based approach. There are several reasons for that: one, it would represent a steadier monthly income rather than waiting for large projects, and I\u0027m not traveling as much as previous years, for personal reasons; two, I\u0027ve often felt that individual songs get lost in the middle of an album, and this will give each one its own little fanfare.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, my first plan is to make cover songs, focusing on cheesy songs (both cheesy-good and cheesy-bad) -- 1 or 2 a month -- and release them (exclusively) to supporters for $1 apiece. Do you remember\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://unwoman.bandcamp.com/track/careless-whisper-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy cover of Careless Whisper\u003c/a\u003e?\u00a0It\u0027ll be like that. Some will be all just cello \u0026amp; voice, some will be fully produced. At the end of a year or so of this I\u0027ll collect the best into a CD -- but until that point, my patrons and bandcamp subscribers (\u003ca href=\"https://unwoman.bandcamp.com/subscribe\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eif you prefer an annual subscription to Patreon\u0027s model, please subscribe on Bandcamp instead\u003c/a\u003e -- you\u0027ll get the same stuff, possibly more, for $25 a year) will be the only ones with access to them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first song, just released exclusively for patrons and bandcamp subscribers, January 12 2015, is Peter Gabriel\u0027s \"In Your Eyes\" -- a song that people have *loved* my live versions of. The beginning is cut off, but\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqaZUEubXqA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere is a rough idea\u003c/a\u003e -- you\u0027ll see the studio version under \"Creations\" once you\u0027ve become a patron.
