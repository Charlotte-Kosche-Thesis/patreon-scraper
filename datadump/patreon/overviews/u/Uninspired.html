    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHey guys!! Thanks so much for your incredible support of Uninspired.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn the past few months, my email list and social media have grown exponentially, and engagement is at an all-time high! I\u0027m so excited to see where this #adulting journey takes us all, and I\u0027m so glad you\u0027ve decided to take me along with you.\u003cbr\u003eUninspired is a blog for twenty-somethings that helps you become a successful, mature adult. We talk about tons of different aspects of adulting, like how to cook, make and save more money, get through dating fails, and more! My favorite segment is Mental Health Monday, where we talk about common mental health struggles people in their twenties deal with. It\u0027s truly a thriving community of twenty-somethings, growing bigger every day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, why do I need Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOf all the many things I do, blogging is my favorite because I get to exercise all the parts of myself that I love. I get to crush some goals, learn new things and of course, help people. Unfortunately, helping people via blogging can come across a little insincere. I don\u0027t want to push products that I don\u0027t fully endorse. And in my effort to help you save and make more money, it seems wrong to push you to buy things. I do some affiliate marketing, but not enough to cover Uninspired\u0027s monthly expenses.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGreat, so what will I use your money for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeb Hosting-\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0the companies that have the technology to put a website on the internet unfortunately cost a significant chunk of change.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSocial Media Help\u003c/strong\u003e- making sure that my posts and updates go out to my readers when they\u0027ll see them is an important part of running Uninspired. Those schedulers cost money!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePhoto Editors-\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Things like Canva for Work and Photoshop cost money, but they\u0027re the things that make Uninspired\u0027s posts look professional, so people notice them and click them.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSEO Help\u003c/strong\u003e- getting things seen on the web is a delicate process which involves a lot of praying to the Google Gods, and also paying for a plugin that knows the inner workings of the system.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThank you so much again for your support. If there\u0027s anything you need from me to help your adulting process go more smoothly, please feel free to let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLots of love,\u003cbr\u003eNicole \u0026lt;3"
