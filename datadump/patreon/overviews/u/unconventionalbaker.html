    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to the Unconventional Baker Patreon page! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHi, I\u0027m Audrey. I started \u003ca href=\"https://www.unconventionalbaker.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUnconventional Baker\u003c/a\u003e with the aim of sharing desserts and treats that \nanyone can enjoy and that are free from many health-sensitive \ningredients such as gluten, dairy, eggs, and refined sugars, etc. I aim \nto keep all my recipes as simple and wholesome as possible,\n and of course absolutely delicious and fun too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the reasons I share free recipes on my site is for the people out there who struggle with food allergies, intolerances, or have a specific diet they follow for health or personal reasons. It\u2019s hard to explain to a small child why they can\u2019t have a birthday cake like everyone else because of their autoimmune condition! Or attend a social gathering where you turn down the killer dessert someone has made because they don\u2019t align with your personal health goals or because you\u0027re a vegan, or on a gluten-free / grain-free / dairy-free diet, etc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy offering alternative recipes, it allows people to take part in the social aspect of sharing food with those they love. When I get messages like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"I\u2019m so grateful to have stumbled upon your website! I also have a food website... but have become sort of frustrated because due to health issues I\u2019ve been forced into a refined sugar free, grain free, gluten free, no highly processed foods diet and it\u2019s been a struggle. In many senses I\u2019ve lost my ways in the kitchen. I want to indulge on occasion and feel defeated because I just don\u2019t know how to cook for myself anymore. It\u2019s been a learning process, but your recipes are giving me something to look forward to! Thank you!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"My aunt in Germany used to mail us a Christmas package every year filled with cookies and treats that she had made. We lost her just a few years ago, but thinking of those packages and cookies always makes me smile! My favorite cookies were the ones that were these almond crescents. They would just melt in your mouth, with nutty goodness. My sister has since found a recipe that \u201creplicates\u201d here cookies, only I\u2019m gluten free now and cannot partake. So grateful for those memories from childhood!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I can\u2019t believe your blog! What a find for me! Feeding my children is a chore. I have a son that just finished chemo, a daughter with candida and another son with Crohn\u2019s. I thought delicious treats were lost to us forever! Last year was tough and homemade goodies did go a long way for morale, but we are OVER the few treats I could whip up. You have helped bring hope for yummy treats back into our home! Thank you!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I am excited to find your blog and website. I am gluten intolerant and am in the process of healing so your site is a goldmine. I am also a coordinator for a community cooking club that celebrates more fruits, veggies and whole grains in our meals. I look forward to receiving your newsletter!\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat makes it all worth it, because from messages and feedback like this I know it\u2019s enhanced people\u2019s quality of life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to reach more people so that there can be more happy moments like those above. With a little bit of help these recipes can get out to people who may not have heard about them before, and offer options to those who feel like they\u0027re stuck just doing without.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow You Can Help:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning a blog of this magnitude means there are a lot of costs and a lot of work involved. My blog currently brings in a small amount of income which supports me and my small team financially very minimally. It mostly goes to cover the many expenses involved, such as hiring technical assistance, paying for monthly software and web hosting expenses, ongoing technical maintenance, etc. Oddly enough, the more people that visit your blog the more expensive things get (i.e. web hosting costs rise to support more people using the website, email costs rise to support having a growing list of subscribers to send recipe updates to, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoreover, the internet landscape is always changing and evolving, and currently the way to reach people most effectively is through videos -- which is something that social media networks and Google are prioritizing. And so videos (like the one at the top of this page) have been the latest new venture on the blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe videos so far have had an amazing reception and the feedback has been that they\u0027ve been helping people feel more comfortable with the recipes, essentially making the recipes more approachable. Here are a few of the types of notes I\u0027ve been receiving about them so far:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Your pics are amazing but I love your videos: they make me think I can do it! Or at least try it!\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Thank you so much for doing these videos! Really helpful!! Another yummy recipe \ud83d\udc97\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"I love this new format!!!! Your photos and videos are amazing!\" \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to these short 60 second snapshot recipe videos, I would also LOVE to be able to release longer and more in-depth videos that show the nuances of recipes, share tips, and so on in the future. But I don\u0027t quite have the funding for something like that at the moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the moment in order to support the current videos I\u0027ve reluctantly (and hopefully very temporarily) turned on more ads on the site to cover this current video project initially until it gets off the ground. However, I feel like this isn\u0027t a long-term solution, as I\u0027d really like to maintain a quality user experience for anyone who visits the site. This is where you can help!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWith even the most minimal contribution from the community currently using and enjoying the website, so much more can happen and fast! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are my current goals and aspirations for the blog for the near future:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Cover current video expenses \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich will enable Unconventional Baker to continue producing at least 1 new recipe per week, thereby encouraging and inspiring more people to give these recipes a try and to feel more comfortable and confident in the kitchen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Make more videos\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now there is only one new short video per week, but I\u0027d love to increase that to two or three and down the road even have the option to do longer and more thorough / instructive videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Share more recipes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to highlight and feature some of the outstanding recipe creators in the alternative baking community to accommodate all of the needs and preferences that exist, as well as share a larger variety of recipes. The more options there are to choose from, the more everyone wins ;) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. Expand teaching resources\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have plans to create more high quality, explicit instructional content for those who want to learn even more about alternative baking and recipe creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5. Remove all ads from the site and make the website even more easy and fast to navigate. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDreaming big here, but wouldn\u0027t that be amazing! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny and all support, no matter how small each month, is greatly appreciated and will help towards achieving the goals outlined above. If you\u0027re in, click the \"become a patron\" button to see the different ways you can get involved. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for reading and for all your support, and of course: happy baking!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ex Audrey \u003cbr\u003e"
