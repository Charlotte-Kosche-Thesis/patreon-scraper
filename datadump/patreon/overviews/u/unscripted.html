So, just go ahead and imagine that warm embrace now along with all the good photography vibes we\u0027re sending you. Ok? Feeling good? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, let\u0027s break down what we are doing here.... \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT WE ARE ABOUT\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnscripted is a judgement-free community where we\u2019re going to spill everything we know about photography and running a photography business and bring you along for the ride. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis is more than just tutorials that we\u0027re going to post and then send you on your way. No! We want to get to know you. We\u0027re here to work \u003cem\u003ewith\u003c/em\u003e you to help you inch along towards your photography goals. Think of us as your cheering squad that\u0027s always in your corner and that friend of yours who\u0027s willing to be honest with you, even if it\u0027s sometimes hard to hear.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe have a love for unscripted (see what we did there?), natural, cheese-free photos that are chock full of emotion and real-life moments. We\u0027re obsessed with capturing our own kids as they grow (for the record: they are growing too fast!) and we also both provide casual, in-home and on-location photo sessions for other families through our businesses.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is\u00a0a community where we are going to get to know each other. We\u0027re going to be here with you every step of the way and we\u0027ll be checking in on the page daily so that if you have a question, it\u0027ll be answered. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe content on our Patreon page is exclusive content that you won\u0027t find anywhere else. These are tutorials and posts we\u0027ve written and recorded only for you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you have at least a basic DSLR knowledge (exposure triangle, some understanding of manual mode, basic composition) and an interest in capturing families and kiddos, then we have a reward level for you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the reward levels to see the different options. You can change reward levels or cancel at any time. There are reward levels to boost your creativity, help you with shooting and editing, connect with us via Google Hangouts, have your photos critiqued by us, grow your business, and even a level that will let you work two on one with us as we design a custom mentoring plan for you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e KELLY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Kelly, also known as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.fiddle-leaf.com\"\u003e Fiddle Leaf Photography\u003c/a\u003e. While my personal work centres around my kids and the memories I can\u0027t bear to ever forget, my business focuses on in-home family and newborn photography where my clients get to be themselves and don\u0027t need to worry about posing or faking it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a ClickinMoms Click Pro and have been featured on numerous blogs and websites both with photography features and teaching tutorials. My business has been a slow and steady build that has taken years to get to the level I want but has taught me what it really takes to make it in the photography world. I am not an overnight success and have instead learned how to be scrappy and innovative in order to make my dreams a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBelieve it or not, I bought my first DSLR as I was writing a home DIY blog and needed to take better photos of my projects. I soon realized that taking interior photos was all sorts of boring and so I turned my attention to my 8 month old daughter (who was really just interested in smearing fingerprints on my lens). I caught the bug (hard) and haven\u0027t put my camera down since (2 kids, one very tolerant husband, and countless home renos later!). I\u0027ve learned photography and business through a lot of trial and error and have worked hard on finding a style that feels wholly like me. I\u0027m all about\u00a0tearing down the walls in photography and sharing what I know so that everyone can grow.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e JENNY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Jenny!

I specialise in maternity, births, newborns, and families. I love to document the everyday, real, messy, beautiful and fleeting moments that memories are made from. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a Clickin Moms ClickPro and have had images featured in the National Geographic Daily Dozen, the Huffington Post, BabyCentre, Mamamia, the Best in Category of the Voice Collection, as well as numerous photography blogs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m the mom to three amazing children, who keep me on toes, and the wife to a very supportive and loving husband. Thankfully they all tolerate my art, as they are the reason I pick up my camera everyday. The memories I don\u0027t want to slip away. The details I want to hold onto forever. The everyday moments. I love capturing it all! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI bought my first DSLR just before we were married so we could take good photos on our honeymoon, but I didn\u0027t learn how to use it properly until after my second son was born! I\u0027ve spent endless hours working, studying and shooting, and then shooting some more to get to where I am today. Photography for me is a journey, and one that I\u0027ll continue to grow, learn and improve on. I\u0027m excited to share what I\u0027ve learned along the way and to help others with their journeys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQuestions?\u003c/strong\u003e Shoot us an email at kelly@fiddle-leaf.com and we\u0027ll get back to you with an answer.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe can\u0027t wait to see you on the page and to get to know you better!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for your support!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
