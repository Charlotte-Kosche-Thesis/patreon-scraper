A world where they take their place as the next set of global leaders and embrace their global identities. It is this dream that brought about my mission statement: \u201cUse Your Difference To Make A Difference\u201d. For as long as I can remember I have been between cultures. I was born in Nigeria but shortly after that I moved to Sweden then back to Nigeria before moving on to Burkina Faso, Vietnam, Nigeria, and then the United States.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always been on the move\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up everywhere as a teenager could have easily giving me a crisis of identity and it did initially but what I quickly came to realize is that there is true beauty in our world. When I say beauty, I don\u2019t mean it in the physical sense. More like the beauty that comes about when we put aside our differences and embrace collaboration. The type of beauty that can come about when a 16 year old in Australia can collaborate with a 14 year old in Kenya and come up with a new type of language learning platform or a new type of affordable prosthetic for wounded veterans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy travels gave me perspective. I noticed that the reason for a lot of the world\u2019s problems today is because of people\u2019s unwillingness to accept change whether it\u2019s race, religion or ethnic background. Millennials and the youth today are starting to realize this but they need their voices to be heard. That\u2019s why I launched\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.uydmedia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.uydmedia.com\u003c/a\u003e, \u00a0It\u2019s all about thinking differently; it\u2019s all about understanding what makes us different and applying that for good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMillennials care about making a difference and they want to be accurately represented in the media but there are very few verticals which encapsulate the service orientation of millennials as well the true diversity in mindset and worldview they have\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy solution is to build a network of digital podcasts  that features highly produced, journalistic storytelling focused on millennials, diversity, entrepreneurship and migrants.\u00a0It\u2019s time for the youth to take their place as the next diplomats, educators and leaders. It\u2019s time for the youth to use their DIFFERENCE to make a DIFFERENCE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIF YOU\u0027RE UNFAMILIAR WITH MY WORK, HERE\u0027S WHAT I DO:\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/as-told-by-nomads-podcast/id910739730?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAs Told By Nomads Podcast\u003c/a\u003e:\u00a0As Told By Nomads is a weekly show I host that features interviews with global nomads, Third Culture Kids, and entrepreneurs discussing what it takes to be global leaders.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/hustle-culture-podcast/id1048498952?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHustle Culture Podcast:\u003c/a\u003e Hustle Culture is a weekly show I co-host with Carlos Gil that features interviews with entrepreneurs and hustlers from all walks of life going through the climb and trying to make a difference simultaneously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.uydmedia.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUYD Media\u003c/a\u003e: A\u00a0multi media platform that features all sorts of content every day showing the youth all over the world using their difference to make a difference or a unique perspective about what culture is like in different parts of the world."
