It has taken 18 years to be attempting to share it with you, starting this moment. Emerging from the depths of each of these mystical experiences, in my head I\u2019d draft this introduction being written to you now. I never knew it would be on a Patreon page nor even necessarily bear my name. The introduction is to footage collected over a 10 year period that ended 8 about years ago. There was such a long time, (starting when I was 20) that I\u2019d truly dissolve. The ego would dissolve and I would not exist. Wholly merged with the infinite. \u003cbr\u003eNothing else matters to me. \u003cbr\u003eJust This. \u003cbr\u003eFinding that there was no way to share it- words (obviously) fail, \u003cbr\u003ewishing to share the vastness and inextricable unification of what we are, when it would be about to happen (and after a period of 4 years of its happening) I started to push record on any device available (This being 10 years ago, usually iSight camera on my laptop.) I call it \u2018porn\u2019 based on a definition that Sting told to me. Porn as something like propaganda- something without metaphor, without art. Something with no clothes on. I wished to get G-d on \u201ctape\u201d like this. Raw. Undefined or described. Too much to call it even the name \u201cG-d.\u201d Yet far far Too Much to not try calling it, at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/209967171\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince that seminal day, the curiosity has always been how to share this palpable state of oneness with others.

Without the imposition of description. (Even the word \"G-d,\" an imposition!) My role is simply is as field reporter.

If we can be gentle with it, we can be gentle with the world. It is an internal boot camp and play practice. When we relate to the mind, resting awareness on it just as it is, and surrendering resistance, we begin to embody the fullness of ourselves. Heart expands. Boundaries soften, infinity aligns. \u003cbr\u003e\nWe embody the maximum potential.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is why it is that I feel the mind is each of our \u201cPartner\u201d at this moment in evolution.\u003cbr\u003e\nA partner is something that helps us to come into practice of returning to a neutral ground, achieved by cultivating unconditional love. When we love the mind unconditionally, in turn we become the greatest embodiment we can be. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThese are shared whimsically. When we grok enough ways to relate to the mind- as employee, as teenager, as computer, etc. we see it, its edges appear, and it becomes relatable. It is now something operating within us, not as us. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e(I will be teaming up with a visual artist and this will become a book.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e*T.A.G. stands for Though Art G-d.
