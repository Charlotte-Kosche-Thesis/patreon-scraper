    "summary": "\"Who are you?\", is a tough question. I asked some friends for input. The quotes are from them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\"A curious explorer of words and worlds, who deeply drinks in ideas, and freely shares the associations she has made.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Writing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFiction\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI\u0027m actively writing two novels, at the moment. One is an intimate look at a family, the inter-generational trauma that tore them apart, and how a deep connection between two of them is a catalyst for rebuilding, if they can open to it. Its somewhat melodramatic, but I hope not too unrealistic. It is steeped in a longing I have known and have sensed in so many others. The overall arc of the story and who the characters are and how they will move forward is already in my mind. The work is getting it out of my head and conveying what these characters want to convey to us. I struggle, because I don\u0027t want to do them a disservice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other is a future-vision dream scape. It is literally pouring out of my dreams. I wake up some mornings with new content. I have no idea where the plot is taking us or who these characters are. It is exploring human potential, as far as I can tell. This one\u0027s a journey that readers can take with me. Since its emerging from my dreams, conversations with people, things that I read and current affairs can definitely impact what comes out. That is, I see it as semi-collaborative. I\u0027m operating on the faith that it will all be an interesting story when its done. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEssays\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI\u0027ve been writing social/political commentary for over a decade, now. I am decidedly leftist. That is, not liberal, but leftist. I\u0027m an unabashed feminist who supports absolute bodily autonomy for everyone. I\u0027m excited to be living in a time when we\u0027re finally discussing gender and sexuality beyond the dualism of heterosexuality. Some things which are foundations of my socio-political perspectives are: power should be used to serve the most vulnerable not the most affluent; the US would not exist as it is today except for racism, genocide, sexism and an utter decimation of compassion and empathy; if we learn to think mutually rather than competitively, we could live in a just, compassionate, sustainable world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving survived 55 years, thus far, as a female, I have lots to say about the experience. So, a lot of my socio-political writings are centered around that. As someone who was left disabled after a faulty medical system failed to respond to a serious disease(s) I was fighting for years, I have quite a bit to say about a for-profit health care system, as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLyrics/Poems\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThese just pop out, once in a while. I\u0027ve learned that I can write lyrics ad lib while jamming with people. Sometimes, they are related to conversations I\u0027ve had or overheard with the people in the room. Sometimes, they are surprisingly romantic. I never know what will inspire them. One song came from something my daughter said when she was a toddler. You just never know what you\u0027ll get here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Life\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\"She is...\u003cbr\u003e- most pleasant jail cell mate I\u0027ve ever had.\u003cbr\u003e- invested in rock\u0027n\u0027roll as a tool for teen feminism.\u003cbr\u003e- far more observant than most (ask her about Korean TV!)\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a late-bloomer; finally bursting out of boxes I was locked into in my youth. In my mid-50s, I\u0027ve become a writer and musician. I am motivated by motherhood. I want my daughter to know that this is possible; that having faith in yourself and offering your creativity to the world is vital. That even her disabled mother can dream and actuate those dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not that I\u0027ve lived an uninteresting life.\u00a0I grew up all over The States, as an Air Force Brat, in the \u002760s and \u002770s, exploring mountains and caves and deserts and riding horses and becoming a competitive athlete by the time I was in high school. I was a computer/math major in the early \u002780s. One of the few women in the field, at the time. I earned an MBA in the early \u002790s. I was able to forge a lot of independence, live and travel around the world and always pursue the work I felt called to do. That work ranged from writing business plans and financial projections for exciting new business ideas to running the first urban composting company in the U.S. to owning a yarn store with a mission of connecting knitters to each other and to the sources of the materials they were using.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStill busting it out in my 50s. I\u0027ve lived \noutside the US, with friends all over the globe. I\u0027ve gotten lost on a mountain in Brazil, been diving in The Maldives, and dance roller-skated just about anywhere I\u0027ve ever been. Committed to ending the\n domination of the patriarchal capitalist Doctrine of Discovery scourge \nthat has destroyed the planet and oppressed billions. I\u0027ve been in the streets or organizing behind the scenes since the mid-\u002780s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut, Who Am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\"Brazen, empathetic, brilliant communicator. One thing to know: she \nsometimes externally processes things and not necessarily to find \nresolution, but for the intellectual exercise\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery personality assessment I\u0027ve ever had has declared that I\u0027m a \"visionary philosopher.\" For all the things that I\u0027ve done and been through, what makes me me is this quality. I\u0027m fascinated with ideas and seeing where they might take us. I\u0027m a believer in a better human potential. I get excited at the prospect of challenging whatever we have told ourselves is \"just the way it is\" or \"the best we can do\" or \"hard wired.\" I have more faith in us \nand more vision than that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\"Being super-radical and having intellectual integrity.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t regret any of what I have done. I have some rich life \nexperiences and my own perspective on the world. I do know that the callings I heard were filtered by fears and self-deprecation. That there were things calling me that I couldn\u0027t hear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI regret what I haven\u0027t done; those callings that I suppressed. So, now, I\u0027m doing those things, including writing. I\u0027m embracing that visionary philosopher in me. I\u0027m here to offer \npossibilities, particularly in the form of engrossing stories. I hope that somewhere along the way, you might find even one thing which sparks a profound question, a clarity or a new creation in you, or you are simply entertained by my storytelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf so, I would greatly appreciate your patronage. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
