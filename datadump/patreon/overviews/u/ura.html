    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eWhen we founded Ura in 2016, we wanted to make design principles and best practices easily accessible for open source projects of all kinds. It was clear to us that \u201cdesign as an afterthought\u201d (if at all) in open source leads almost certainly to lack of usability and ultimately fails to empathize with its userbase it aims to reach. Open Source Software is wonderful and often superior technically to its proprietary counterparts, however these are features which don\u2019t come to light easily if the target audience is unable to use that software, especially when the proprietary alternative offers a well rounded user experience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we at Ura Design have made it our mission to help open source projects, we lack the manpower to cater to the many design needs the open source ecosystem requires nowadays. However, with Open Source Design as the umbrella community and other groups doing great design work with and for Free Open Source Software, we have a solid foundation to change the notion of open source design by creating tools empowering open source design instead of pushing out designs ourselves for the upcoming years. We like to think that we need to make ourselves replaceable. Quoting our good friend \u003ca href=\"http://tind.bigcartel.com/\"\u003eTIND\u003c/a\u003e here: \u003cblockquote\u003e\u201c\u003cem\u003eArt will survive. Artists won\u2019t.\u003c/em\u003e\u201d\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://identihub.co/\"\u003eIdentihub\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, open source and self-hosted software to manage and share your brand and visual assets in a single place, fully under your control. No need to build your style guide from scratch manually. Just feed Identihub the specs and it does the rest for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch4\u003eFor Designers\u003c/h4\u003eAs designers, we often struggle to effectively share assets and logos with fellow non-designers. We often end up having a bunch of files in a zip on some email or file-sharing service in different formats and resolution. While giving some extra headache to the receiver, we also end up losing time exporting and readjusting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xdm79L0.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Identihub you can just upload your SVG\u2019s and corresponding PNG\u2019s and embed links are automatically generated for you. With embed links you can update your assets centrally on Identihub once, and it gets updated everywhere you used it. More features like replacing color swatches, exporting projects and linking to your personal cloud will be added soon thanks to your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eFor Everyone else\u003c/h4\u003eHaving to rely on a designer to do small adjustments for you is annoying, so Identihub will automate all these tasks for you, actually quicker than manually updating an asset with graphics software. With clear divided sections and categories you will instantly know what asset to use where without much confusion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gqDL7iz.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003ePatreon\u003c/h3\u003eWhile we have been running this Patreon in the past months to help fund our time help open source projects, we think that we reached a point where it would be even more worthwhile to build software which helps open source projects. While this is a rather significant change regarding the focus of this Patreon, we put in extra hours for pro-bono work and some financial investment in the past anyway, and will continue to do so since it\u2019s in now part of the DNA of what we are doing. As part of this, we also have updated rewards to reflect these changes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFAQ\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eI haven\u2019t received my reward(s).

We are continuing \nhelping projects with pro-bono design work on a case-by-case basis and \nthink that Identihub needs more love now. We had a good run for 1.5 \nyears, it\u0027s time to go on a new adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat happens to my pledges for Identihub?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e\n Patreon funds pay for development costs for Identihub, mostly the time \nof developers actively working on it. The more funds we receive, the \nmore time we can dedicate to work on Identihub while reducing paying out\n of our own pockets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAny alternatives I can donate apart Patreon?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003eSure, we have a PayPal.me address and accept also Bitcoin and Ethereum.\u003cbr\u003eBTC: 3ASpHrpnrgmhK2qrDJzryPuDuKp3iaEX6k\u003cbr\u003eETH: 0x08c7eC3Ad8A58287c45cc776A72AA1401123710c\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAre you affiliated with the \u003ca href=\"http://opensourcedesign.net/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOpen Source Design\u003c/a\u003e community?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003eYes! We are proud to be part of the broader Open Source Design community! We collaborate with various designers and developers advancing design in open source in various ways. We are present at conferences such as Open Source Design Summit, FOSDEM and Chaos Communication Congress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou are not a non-profit but a for-profit company! Why should I pledge to you?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e That\u2019s a valid concern. Unlike other similar software solutions out there, Identihub is completely Free and Open Source Software licensed under the AGPLv3. So your funds are used to fund publicly available software. On top of that, we don\u2019t plan to give out equity to potential investors at this point, so turning to the community is one way we could bootstrap our development process. Right now, development funds are coming from our own pockets."
