While she was in town we decided to take a whale watching tour with P.S. Express around the San Juan Islands up to Friday Harbor. It was there we met a young female marine biologist who was guiding the whale watching tour. During the trip, she was telling Lisa and me about how she and her husband were sailing around the world on their 40\u2019 wooden sailboat. They were in port for the winter to refit and take a few jobs to save money for the next leg of their trip. She kept me enthralled with her stories of sailing around the world and traveling when and where they wanted.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThat was all it took. From then on I\u2019ve been planning how to let loose the dock lines and start our own journey. Hopefully, Patreon will help me take you along with us on the journey.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a website built to support artists: musicians, poets, cartoonists, bloggers (like us) and all kinds of creators. Patrons (you) pledge a sum of money per month (from as little as $2), and Patreon collects the fee each month. You set a monthly maximum and you can cancel anytime, so you remain in control. The bean counters at Patreon do all the back-room stuff to ensure that your pledge is processed properly. Everything is in dollars since Patreon is a US site, but international currencies are gladly accepted. Patreon allows us to not have paid advertisements on our blog. Nobody likes a pop up riddled website so we want to make sure our supporters get the best online experience they can. There isn\u2019t much money in talking about sailing around the world so we\u2019re not in it to make a living. Anything we are given we will give back in better content and even free trips along our journey on Unwritten Timeline.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the benefits?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become our patron, we give you freebies like postcards, photos, books, posts on social media, and super cool T-shirts. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t use your pledges to fund our lifestyle. \u00a0We\u0027re going to sail around the world even if we don\u0027t have any supporters on Patreon. \u00a0But, patrons help us bring our experiences to you, and bring you along our journey. \u00a0We\u0027ll show our boundless gratitude for your support with rewards. \u00a0We will use your pledges to improve our output with better equipment and more challenging content. Some lucky patrons can even get free trips on Unwritten Timeline wherever we are in the world when we reach our goals.\u00a0 We are also going to donate 25% of our proceeds split evenly between the Wounded Warrior Project and Disabled American Veterans.\u00a0 We have enjoyed our time with the military and want to give back if possible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe have \u0027milestone goals\u0027 listed along the right-hand side of this website so you can see how we can help you help us. We\u2019re not big on asking for handouts so we want to make sure you get something for your patronage. We appreciate your support and we want you to know it. We love working on new ways to say a BIG THANK YOU!\u003cbr\u003e"
