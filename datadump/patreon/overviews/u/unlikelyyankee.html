Conceived as a live play, it is being \u0027demo-ed\u0027 as an animated feature film.\u003c/strong\u003e I have made a rough version of Episode one, (about 25 minutes, in five short videos). Episode 2 will be more refined, musically and visually. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 I wrote Top of the Tree in September 2016, and have worked away at it non-stop since. I am extremely detail oriented and enjoy sharing the creative process, so Patreon seems like a great way to go for this big \u0027work in progress\u0027. I have begun replacing my early demos with proper multi-tracks, and turning my many illustrations into simple animation. \u003cstrong\u003eThe new scenes and songs, upon completion, will be made available exclusively to Patreon Patrons. \u003c/strong\u003eRewards include the obvious (episodes, downloads, posters), the obscure (Comix, Endless Ephemera) and the \u0027out there\u0027: serious Patrons may commission a character or creature or item to be in a scene, or as a portrait, sculpture, etc.\u00a0 This sort of Reward is laborious, but I don\u0027t consider it a distraction. Drawing is its own reward for all this computer work, I want to connect with the people who like Top of the Tree, I have a very high tolerance for obsessive detail, and a vivid imagination. \u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s fun to be animated!\u003c/strong\u003e You may want me to depict you as a 19th century Firefighter or as a framed portrait of a Family of Corgis with plaid collars. As long as it looks 19th century!\u00a0 My storyline is pretty straightforward, and Top of the Tree could be a very streamlined and minimalist show, but I seem to create a sort of aesthetic clutter no matter what I am doing, including learning to animate, so I am making the most of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 The libretto is based on Real Historical People and Events, scripted in nineteenth century vernacular, and set musically in the style of classic British Rock and Folk Rock. It is inspired Comically by the likes of Monty Python, Matt and Trey, Tina Fey, and the \u0027Comic\u0027 part of the Comic Operas.\u00a0 The story follows the adventures of William and Kitty Gilbert, Arthur Sullivan, D\u0027Oyly Carte, Grossmith and the rest, through the fresh and often irreverent point of view of Miss Pauline, the Unlikely Yankee, who has escaped from her cruel \u0027Underworld\u0027 New York relatives and is now working for Gilbert. \u003cstrong\u003eCharacter driven, rich in song, rife with quips and quirks, awkward, poignant, silly and sublime, the story explores the personalities and relationships of the men and women who helped create the things we take for granted today: high production standards, directorial authority, quality control, and above all access to absurd, satirical, uplifting, hilarious, emotionally and musically fulfilling memorable entertainment.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.topofthetreemovie.com\"\u003ehttps://www.topofthetreemovie.com\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e All original content \u00a9 Maria Anthony - Portable Populist Productions\u003cbr\u003e"
