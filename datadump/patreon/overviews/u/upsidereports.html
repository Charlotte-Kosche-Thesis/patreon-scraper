With the current explosion of shared information and technology worldwide, our problem solving potential is infinite. But we have to reframe our mental models to implement practical, collaborative solutions. The Upside is a thought leader in socio-political cohesion, environmental regeneration and technological advancement, beyond our currently divisive political and economic institutions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause we can\u0027t solve these issues unless we can envision the possibilities. Upside Reports is raising the conversation and the level of consciousness on\u00a0global issues, so we can address them effectively.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we can\u0027t do this alone. Until now, Upside Reports has been entirely self-produced by ME, Justin Bench, with a lotta help from my friends like my co-producer Jeremy Snowden. We\u2019ll be creating video reports, inspirational photos, behind the scenes videos, photos and stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBut we need your help to make it happen. Check out our REWARDS and our GOALS, and if you\u2019d like to contribute, or share with someone who\u2019d be interested in our work, we\u2019d be incredibly grateful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003eAND BY SUPPORTING UPSIDE, YOU BECOME PART OF THE SOLUTION\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003eJOIN US!\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eABOUT US: Justin Bench is the founder of the Upside and an activist for social justice and environmental sustainability. He began his career in inclusive business for economic inclusion, sharing case studies and best practices between social sector organizations. Building on the win-win approach, inspired him to become a social \u0026amp; environmental activist, utilizing video and photo mediums to raise the level of consciousness on global issues. He has lived in such places as Ecuador, Brazil, France, Costa Rica and Thailand, and speaks fluent English, Spanish, French, \u0026amp; Portuguese.
