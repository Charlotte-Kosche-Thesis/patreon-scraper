    "summary": "\u201cInfrastructure\u201d is the term we use to refer to all the systems that provide us with the things we need to live- food, water, shelter, energy, information, healthcare, etc. \u201cInfra\u201d means below, and infra-structure is often literally below our feet and figuratively below our everyday awareness- the roads, the water mains, the sewers, the power lines, the gas pipes, the fiber optic cables. Infrastructure is absolutely essential to all of our lives, and yet most people don\u2019t think much about it until it stops working- and most of our infrastructure is dangerously centralized, built on outdated and ecologically destructive principles, and often operated for-profit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cUltrastructure\" is a term used in cellular biology to refer to the intricate and interdependent structures within living cells that enable them to do things like turn air and sunshine into food, to break foods apart into energy and resources, and to use genetic information stored DNA to assemble energy and material into the tissues and proteins they needs to sustain life. It also the opposite of Infra-structure,\u00a0and so I use the term to refer to human-designed systems that meet the same needs as our infrastructure- food, water, shelter, energy, infromation, care- but in a way that is open-source, easily replicable, community-scale, ecologically regenerative, and free for anyone to use.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is what I am doing- I am attempting to develop disruptively useful ultrastructure. If you would be so kind as to become a Patron and kick me some money every time I build and document a project, then I will be able to build more and more disruptively useful things, that will hopefully help you and everyone else in the world meet your needs for food, water, shelter, waste, energy, information, and care as directly from sunlight as possible, without having to rely on corrupt or destructive institutions to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, learning how to do anything new requires repeated failure- that\u0027s what learning is. So before you go thinking that I\u0027m claiming that I think I can do everything better than everyone, let me be clear that that\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to do. If I fail, (and I will, I promise you, again and again) I will document how and why in detail, so that then the results will be at least be interesting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if I succeed, I will create open-source ultrastructure that you can build yourself, where you are, with what you have, that can help lower your bills, increase your emergency resilience, and help you take care of the people around you. If everyone had easy access to tools like that, I think the world could be a lot better. If you don\u0027t think so....how much you wanna bet?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck it out- here\u0027s how this works: I bet you that I can create disruptive ultrastructure. I\u0027m going to try over and over again until I do. If I\u0027m right, you get information that will help you meet your basic human needs as directly from sunshine as possible, and if I\u0027m wrong, you get to see me fail spectacularly and publicly in great detail, and hopefully we\u0027ll all learn something along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon works on a \"per-thing\" basis, not on a monthly basis. That means if you sign up to become a patron, you only pay when I produce something that is useful at best and interesting at worst. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe stuff I am able to produce depends on what my budget is- some projects are cheap and fairly quick to build, others are quite expensive and time consuming. In my Goals section, you can see all the projects I would like to do, and how much I will need to do them. They are all experimental, they push the limits of what is currently possible, and that\u0027s what makes them interesting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can only do projects that are at or below the amount that I get paid per project, so the more people who support me, the more epic stuff I can do. Right now, I\u0027m making about $50 per thing, so the things I can create are small- wind turbines, solar concentrators, vertical hydroponic tower gardens... I\u0027ll keep doing these small projects, and hopefully gain more supporters, which will allow me to do more complicated projects, like building self-replicating trash-eating, energy-producing, plastic-recycling robots, or entire closed-loop biosphere houses.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuckminster Fuller once proposed a \"World Game\"- the object of which was to \"make the world work for 100% of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or disadvantage to anyone.\" That is what this Pateron is- a game- a friendly wager between you and me to keep things interesting. If I win, you win, if you win, we both learn something. Every game needs some rules, so here are....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE RULES:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-As a creator, I get to come up with the projects and inventions that I think will help people meet their needs for food, water, shelter, waste, energy, information and/or care. As a Patron, you get to vote on the most interesting project and help decide which projects I focus my energy on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Since all of my work is open-source and freely available to everyone, this is the only perk I offer my Patrons- you don\u0027t get special privileges if you pay more, but you do get to help guide process, and I can do cooler stuff with more money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-In my \"Goals\" section, I\u0027ll set out a bunch of projects with different budgets, and you can vote on the ones you like the best. I will pick projects that my patrons want to see competed, that ALSO fit my current budget, which is currently $54.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-When I\u0027m ready to commit to a project, I\u0027ll make a paid post that lays out a detailed plan, a budget, how I\u0027ll measure success, and a timeline for the project. Then I\u0027ll post periodic updates of my progress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I have started a project, I cannot start a new one until the previous one has been completed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo complete a project, I have to post a reflection video discussing how the project went, what I learned, what I would do differently next time, along with any and all designs, documents, codes, and media I have about it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProjects may fail or succeed- I make no promises that I can pull of what I think that I can. But I do promise to try my damnedest, and post all of my results for all to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf that sounds like a fair wager to you, then consider becoming a patron, and help me do what I\u0027m here to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGame on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
