    "summary": "Here at the United Nations of Horror (UNH), we\u2019re passionate about horror film. The podcast started when several members of the horror podcast community came together, from all over the world, to talk horror. Over the past couple of years, the podcast has considerably grown, defining its current format, and staking its place as an in-depth exploration of all things horror. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we would love to produce content on a weekly basis, as we did at the start, this can be difficult around other commitments. We are deeply grateful for all support, from downloads, to feedback and interaction in the Facebook group, to simply sharing the podcast with others and leaving positive reviews. Our Patreon campaign is in place to allow those who wish to support the podcast via donations to do so, without restricting content for anyone. It means that we will pledge to deliver one episode per month that is researched and recorded to the high standard we set ourselves, and listeners deserve. The more support we receive, the more content we deliver on top of the core monthly show. It\u2019s that simple. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon support would therefore allow us to dedicate more time and resources to our core monthly shows, as well as any additional content. Listeners will be encouraged to choose the content that they wish to see, and we have additional ideas for specific series.\u00a0UNH is my heart and my home, and I know Lucard and Mark feel exactly the same. We\u0027re working on some exciting projects, and our aim is to integrate this work with UNH as much as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank you to all who support us by listening, engaging with, and sharing the podcast. We encourage you to still do so, and hope that we can offer more in the future; we have such sights to show you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecky, Lucard and Mark"
