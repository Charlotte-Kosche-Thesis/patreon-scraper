    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eGoals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal in creating this podcast is to bring forward stories of unsolved crimes that may have been long forgotten. I believe that there is always someone out there who knows something that could help solve these cases. For now, I\u0027m able to release about 1-2 episodes per month. Ultimately, I\u0027d like to increase that to once a week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInspiration\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy inspiration comes from the many years I spent as a youth watching true crime and mystery shows, like Unsolved Mysteries and the many Lifetime made-for-TV movies of the 1980s and 1990s. As an 11-year-old, I would ride my bike home, in the dark, after my Girl Scout meetings at the youth center. I\u0027d ride as fast as my feet could pedal. I could feel my hands and fingers tingling with a mixture of fear and excitement. Unsolved Mysteries came on those nights after my Girl Scout meetings. I would think to myself as I rode that I couldn\u0027t wait to see the show, and I\u0027d also play in my mind the what-if scenarios of what could happen if I fell victim to the many killers I\u0027d seen on TV. This was all before TV channels dedicated solely to true crime stories, of course.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Background\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI worked as a police officer in Northern Virginia from 2000-2005, spending my last year there as a crime scene investigator. In September 2001, I volunteered to be a part of the team of officers sifting through and sorting evidence in the many piles of rubble brought to the perimeter parking lot of the Pentagon. Since then I\u0027ve been working as a crime analyst specifically searching for missing children and/or the people who\u0027ve taken them. I\u0027ve also been storytelling on stage for quite some time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spend an enormous amount of time researching all aspects of each case for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.unsolvedpodcast.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eUnsolved Podcast\u003c/a\u003e. To conduct the kind of more in-depth research that I need to do to improve each episode, I need to pay for the access to those research tools. I use some of them every day in my current job but cannot use them for this endeavor unless I buy separate subscriptions. They are fairly costly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTraveling to the sites of these cases and searching for people to interview also costs time and money. I\u0027d like to be able to offset that. I\u0027m limited to weekend day trips , which limits the depth I can achieve for each story. I have plenty of vacation time to use, just not the funds to utilize those days the way I\u0027d like.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I\u0027d like to make a few upgrades to the Unsolved Podcast website as the show grows. I created the site and wrote all the code for it. So I\u0027d like to continue working on it and upgrading its capabilities."
