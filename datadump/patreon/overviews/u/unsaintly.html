Some of that family is blood, some of that family is heart.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since I could remember my passion has been to create, and to inspire others to create. I\u0027ve done everything so far, with my own means, and the help of close friends/family. I hope this shows you how committed I am to what-I hope-will become a full time career for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love the community of Indie Authors. If I can stay among them I know I will be in good company. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work with them, I create book covers for them, and I have even pushed a few hard enough \u00a0they\u0027ve taken a dip in the writing ink well, themselves!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s only problem, of course ... being Indie means you pay out of pocket.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can make my own book covers, I can do all my own marketing, but it is time consuming. And as the old cliche goes, \"time is money\". The less time I write, the less I can produce. I\u0027d love to spend more time writing and be able to delegate other things to someone else. If I can do this, it will enable me to spend time less time looking like my teenage sons with their face in a computer or phone, and disconnected from the world or my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust a small donation every month toward each new chapter helps me to keep producing my stories. They have been described as thrilling, and scary as hell. So if those are the kinds of stories up your alley, please consider offering your generous support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile offer my time freely to mentor and support new writers, you\u0027ll be helping to keep me motivated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach donor will receive my gratitude, a personal thank you in every new book, an early release copy of each book and the opportunity to beta read if they so choose.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for interest!"
