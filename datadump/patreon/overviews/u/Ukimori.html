I had considered for a few years to make them semi open, but how would I approach that? How could I open them to others and still have designs be a respectful part of the canon in the world they inhabit? Can I balance my need to protect my creation with the creativity of others? Application forms seemed too boring and formal. And then it struck me, a visual character creator!\n\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIt could be a big challenge to take on, I\u0027ve never done something like this and have no coding experience. I thought I\u0027d have to learn some programming from the ground up. However, a ukimori character creator would be a lot more fun for people to play around with than some boring forms!\nSeveral years later of loosely throwing ideas around and trying to tackle how I would build such an app, the lovely \n\t\t\t\u003cstrong\u003eArimah\u003c/strong\u003e offered to help in building the app for me! It could finally become a reality!\n\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\tThe Goal!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\tMy aim is to have a fully functioning visual character creator for my Ukimori species, an application form with a difference, more fun and hopefully more personal than filling out a bunch words and descriptions. Something flexible enough for people to have creativity in making a Ukimori character, but still having it adhere to the canon of the world. I\u0027d like for people to be able to make a Ukimori to their specifications, send it as a request and for me to provide them with a\u00a0 clean, simple reference sheet. All Simplified by the app.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\tWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003c/strong\u003eThere are only two of us working on this; Arimah is handling the programming side of the app, while I\u0027m working on all the art and design of the character assets. While it\u0027s certainly a passion project for me, it\u0027s pretty time intensive and cuts into our jobs and other projects. Any Patreon funds will be used to compensate time on the project for both of us. Some of the funds will also be used to set up a domain for the app!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eDesigning Your Ukimori!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBase Forms:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUkimori Majora and Ukimori Minora sub-species.\u003cbr\u003eMale, Female, Null and any\u00a0 gender in between!\u003cbr\u003eSlender, Average, Full-Figured, and Muscular body types.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWide Variety of Changeable Assets:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHorns, Ears, Hair, Muzzles\u003cbr\u003ewith adjustable claws and fluff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eAnd Many More to be Added\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eas the project progresses and as people add their own requested assets!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e"
