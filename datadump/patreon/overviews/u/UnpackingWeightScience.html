We now know that many of these assumptions about human body weight and health are flawed. I\u0027ll help you learn how to interpret weight-centric research for yourself,\u00a0bust myths about body weight and health, and I\u0027ll present to you weight neutral research and discuss relevant content (including Health at Every Size, Intuitive Eating, and The Non-Diet Approach). Yes, you can claim it as professional development!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a dietitian and academic from Australia, currently undertaking PhD research in weight-neutral approaches to health enhancement and their integration into healthcare practice. My business, Health Not Diets, provides workshops, online courses and resources for health professionals who want to practice from a weight-neutral framework. While I LOVE presenting, lecturing and facilitating, I also LOVE spreading the word on social media. The nature of these formats means you either get A LOT of content, or A LITTLE content - this podcast is designed as a middle ground (the \u0027JUST RIGHT\u0027 if you will).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you\u0027re a health professional, researcher, health science student, getting hassled about your own weight, or just plain interested, this resource will help you to break down what you think you know about weight, and be up-to-date with what we DO know - and it might not be what you think!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSubscribers get a new, 20-30 minute Unpacking Weight Science explainer podcast twice a month, along with full show notes, references, test-yourself quiz and access to the full back catalogue of podcasts and the current and previous month\u0027s supporting materials. \u00a0After 6 months the podcasts (but not the resources - they\u0027re for you only but expire at the end of the following month) will be available to the rest of the world. \u00a0If you want to access supporting materials that have expired - you can get them in a bundle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePodcasts will be published on the first and third Mondays of each month - starting March 5th!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAVAILABLE NOW TO SUBSCRIBERS:\u003cbr\u003eEpisode 1 \u0027Stuck in a Weight Centric Operating System\u0027 and supporting materials (expires 30 April)\u003cbr\u003eBONUS PODCAST for International Women\u0027s Day, \u0027Size Acceptance and the Women\u0027s Liberation Movement in Australia\u0027\u003cbr\u003eEpisode 2, 19th March: \u0027Demystifying Definitions, De-Myth-Defying Assumptions\u0027\u003cbr\u003eEpisode 3, 2nd April: \u0027How We Got Here: BMI Meets Death\u0027\u003cbr\u003eEpisode 4, 16th April: \u0027Weight bias, stigma \u0026amp; discrimination\u0027\u003cbr\u003eEpisode 5, 7th May: \u0027The anatomy of a weight loss paper\u0027\u003cbr\u003eBONUS PODCAST Weight loss paper critique (available to public too)\u003cbr\u003eEpisode 6, 21st May: \u0027The science of self compassion\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCOMING UP:\u003cbr\u003eEpisode 7, 4th June: \u0027Weight neutral health enhancing habits\u0027\u003cbr\u003eEpisode 8, 18th June: \u0027Theoretical vs actual weight change: industrialised wishful thinking\u0027\u003cbr\u003eEpisode 9, 2nd July: \u0027Ethics vs Morality: Why Fat is Fraught\u0027\u003c/div\u003e"
