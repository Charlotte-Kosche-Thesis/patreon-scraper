    "summary": "Hello! I am Aaron \"Static\" Render, host of the\nUncontained podcast. I worked in corporate radio as a DJ for 7 years. Although\nI really enjoyed my time there and met many famous musicians, I wished I had\nmore freedom to create what I wanted. Uncontained is that. I wanted to create a\nplace where I could talk to all kinds of entertainers from comedians,\nmusicians, actors, and even producers. Why do I want to talk to them? In part\nto help my listeners discover new talented artists, and more importantly to get\nadvice from entertainers at all levels of \"making it.\" The goal of\nthe show is to entertain and inspire others to go out and create something. To\nlive Uncontained is stepping out of the social norm of the safe and mundane 9-5\njob that suffocates your creativity, to take the risk and go after what you\nwant to do despite people telling you will not make it; it\u0027s impossible. Living\nUncontained is following that voice inside you that tells you there has to be\nmore; it calls you to create! Living Uncontained is different for everybody. Be\nUncontained!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nUncontained launched on February, 29th 2016. What better day\nto jump all in than Leap day!? Since then I\u0027ve had some great conversations\nwith some awesome guests including actor, John Lehr--best known as the GEICO\nCaveman, Justin Beahm--writer for Fangoria, Delirium, Scream, and Famous\nMonsters of Filmland, Jarrell Hall--Mo-Cap artist and founder of Executive Geek\nProductions, Dearest Scooter--fellow podcaster from the popular \u0027Sleep With Me\u0027\nPodcast, and most recently, Horror movie scream queen and icon, Linnea Quigley.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eNow I need to ask for your help.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRight now I am able to release Uncontained episodes once a\nweek on Tuesdays. I would love to increase that to twice a week. The only\nproblem is I have a full time job that gets in the way of providing you with\nmore awesome content. If you can\u0027t help financially,\u003cstrong\u003e I appreciate your loyal\nlistenership,\u003c/strong\u003e and I totally understand. Please tell a friend about the show!\nAnd\u003cstrong\u003e if you feel generous and you can afford to, please don\u0027t wait. I\u0027m asking\nfor your help keeping the show sustainable.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI love being able to sit down with these gifted entertainers\nand share their unique stories with you. I hope to inspire the next wave of\nentertainers to \"Live Uncontained\" no matter who may tell them\notherwise. \u003cstrong\u003eHow do you Live Uncontained?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
