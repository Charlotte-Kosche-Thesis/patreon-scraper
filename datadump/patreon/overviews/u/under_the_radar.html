And when the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.undertheradarmag.com/issues/summer_2001_-_grandaddy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efirst issue\u003c/a\u003e of that\nmagazine,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.undertheradarmag.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUnder the Radar\u003c/a\u003e, was born in December 2001, we had no idea that 15\nyears later it would still be going as a legitimate business. If we had known,\nwe would have planned things very differently. But when we started Under the\nRadar neither of us had any experience in magazine publishing. We were simply\nboth music lovers looking for a creative outlet\u2014Mark, a writer eager to\ninterview his favorite bands and Wendy, a photographer longing to do photo\nshoots with her favorite musicians. Our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.undertheradarmag.com/issues/summer_2001_-_grandaddy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efirst issue\u003c/a\u003e was all black \u0026amp; white\non bad quality paper and we only printed 1000 copies to give out at shows and\nrecord stores across Los Angeles, where we were based at the time.

Around\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.undertheradarmag.com/issues/fall_2003_-_black_rebel_motorcycle_club/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eissue 5\u003c/a\u003e we were both laid off from our day jobs\nand decided to take a chance and make Under the Radar our full time careers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.undertheradarmag.com/uploads/article_images/Death_Cab_For_Cutie_2002_by_Wendy_Lynch_Redfern_Under_the_Radar.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOver the years the quality\nof our writing, photography, layout, and paper got better as the distribution\ngot bigger. For the last 15 years we\u2019ve gotten up close and personal with big\nmusicians and helped to break exciting new bands who then went on to bigger and\nbetter careers. We were the last ever magazine to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.undertheradarmag.com/interviews/elliott_smith/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einterview Elliott Smith\u003c/a\u003e before his passing, but the first ever national print magazine to interview\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.undertheradarmag.com/interviews/throwback_thursday_vampire_weekend_interview_from_2007/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVampire Weekend\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.undertheradarmag.com/interviews/throwback_thursday_fleet_foxes_interview_from_2008/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFleet Foxes\u003c/a\u003e before each artist became hugely popular. We\u2019ve\nreviewed tens of thousands of albums (and films, books, comic books, TV shows,\nDVDs, festivals, and concerts). We\u2019ve put out cool special issues dedicated to\nthe intersection of music and politics and pairing musicians and comedians\ntogether for joint interviews. And somehow we\u2019ve been able to just about pay\nthe bills and stay afloat while doing the thing we love.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut keeping a truly\nindependent print music magazine and website going in 2016 isn\u2019t easy and now\nwe also have our three and half year old daughter, Rose, to take care of. When\nwe started in 2001 there were many other American print music magazines we were\ncompeting with and we\u2019ve outlasted most of them in print (including Paste,\nFilter, Spin, Devil in the Woods, Death In Taxes, Resonance, Rockpile, The\nSentimentalist, and others), but it\u2019s gotten increasingly challenging. When the\nBorders bookstore chain closed all their stores and went out of business in\n2011, for example, it dealt a blow to the distribution of most independent\nprint magazines. The majority of our advertisers are independent record labels\nand the music industry has been in decline for years, meaning they have less\nmoney to spend on ads. That\u2019s also coupled with the trend for advertisers to\nmove away from print to web ads. So that must mean we are selling a bunch of\nweb ads to make up for less print ads, right? Well not exactly. These days\nadvertisers often prefer to place their ads on Facebook or via Google Ads,\nrather than directly on websites. We make some money from the Google Ads on our\nwebsite, but it\u2019s a fraction of what we would make from directly placed ads and\nprint magazine ads. And sadly, now many block these ads too, so that is on the\ndecline as well. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.undertheradarmag.com/uploads/article_images/St_Vincent_Interview_2007_Under_the_Radar_by_Wendy_Redfern.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUnder the Radar has always\nremained a company 100% independently run by us (Mark and Wendy, and now Rose),\nunlike many other music websites and magazines that are owned by bigger\ncorporations. This allows us the freedom to interview the artists we are\npassionate about and to keep advertising and editorial completely separate. We\ndon\u2019t interview bands or write favorable reviews because some corporate entity\nor advertiser is telling us to. We don\u2019t run editorial that\u2019s secretly (or not\nso secretly) an advertisement. But on the flipside, we are all too often barely\ngetting by, only just raising enough money to print each issue and with no\nfunds to truly grow and improve the business. We want to continue writing about\nand photographing the artists we love, as well as doing much more with Under\nthe Radar and getting the business side back into a more viable state. That\u2019s\nwhy we\u2019ve decided to turn to Patreon for support. For those unfamiliar with\nPatreon, it is a crowd funding platform that allows people to support creators\nin a more sustained way with a regular monthly donation, rather than just\nsupporting one project at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.undertheradarmag.com/uploads/article_images/Tame_Impala_DSC_5848_by_Shervin_Lainez_patreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what would we do with the money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirstly, we\u2019d use to it to\nsimply keep the lights on. If we had a more steady monthly amount we could\ndepend on then it would help us continue to print at least four print magazine\nissues a year and to more timely pay all the writers, photographers, editors,\nand copy-editors who contribute to Under the Radar, as well as literally\nhelping us keep the lights on by helping us pay our regular monthly bills\ninvolved in running any business.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut then there are many ways\nwe\u2019d love to grow Under the Radar. We\u2019d like to do podcasts and more video\ncontent. We\u2019d like to reprogram and redesign aspects of our website, both to\nmake it more mobile responsive and also to improve user engagement in other\nways. We\u2019d love to get back to printing five issues a year and/or having more\npages per issue. We want to have more events, such as the well-regarded ones we\ndo at SXSW every year (in fact funding SXSW events has become increasingly harder\ntoo, so the money could also help with that). We\u2019d like to review even more\nalbums and interview even more bands. We want to expand our non-music coverage\n(cinema, TV, comic books, etc.). There\u2019s so much we want to do, but alas\ncurrently the day-to-day operations of Under the Radar are mainly handled by\njust us (Mark and Wendy), along with our ad sales person Mark Nockles. The rest\nof Under the Radar\u2019s many editors, writers, photographers, and other\ncontributors work on a freelance basis. If we are to not just maintain Under\nthe Radar, but also grow it, we need more help and that takes more money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are more specifics on\nour hopes and dreams for Under the Radar and what we would do with the money to\nhelp achieve those goals:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\n1. Podcasts:\u003c/strong\u003e We would be\nable to invest in the recording equipment and software to begin producing\nweekly or monthly podcasts where we\u2019d interview musicians and filmmakers, among\nother things. Our writers often conduct lengthy interviews, but only a few\nquotes get used in the magazine article and we could present some of the full\ninterviews in podcast form, as well as doing new interviews specifically for\npodcasts. Mark used to interview several bands per issue, but doesn\u2019t have the\ntime anymore due to the time it takes to transcribe an interview and write an\narticle. Mark would love to get back to interviewing more musicians and actors\nhimself and it would easier for him to conduct interviews for podcasts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\n2. Video content: \u003c/strong\u003eWe would\nlike to finally be able to not just dream of the interesting and cool video\nsessions we have tons of ideas for, but actually be able to produce them for\nyou to see and enjoy. We have lots of fun ideas for filming sessions with bands\nin unique locations and situations, but don\u2019t have the funds to launch them.\nMark went to film school and Wendy went to photography school, and we also have\nlots of filmmaker friends, so we have the talent to pull off cool video\nsessions, we just need the money.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\n3. Website upgrades:\u003c/strong\u003e Our\nsite is not mobile responsive! This is unacceptable! This needs to change as\nsoon as possible. We understand we are living in a mobile world, but when we\nfirst created the website, that was not the case. We have designs in place and\na plan. We simply need to be able to find the funds to make it happen. Sadly,\nthis has been on our back burner as our day-to-day financial needs have always\nhad to come first. We\u2019d also like to make other much needed improvements to the\ncoding and design of our website. For example, for some reason we can\u2019t embed\nFacebook videos on our website and only certain Instagram videos can be\nembedded.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\n4. Events:\u003c/strong\u003e With resources in\nLos Angeles, New York, Austin, Virginia, London, and elsewhere, we\u2019d love to\ncurate more live events where our readers can enjoy the music together. Also,\nthere is a great opportunity here to continue on our hopes of raising awareness\nand benefiting charitable causes. More funding would allow us to increase our\nbandwidth to achieve some of these goals. We\u2019ve long dreamed of some sort of\nUnder the Radar Music Festival and maybe we could build up to that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\n5. Do more for our\ncontributors:\u003c/strong\u003e Over the years we have had so many of our contributors work with\nus mainly out of the kindness of their hearts, with little financial benefit,\nand frankly, they are worth so much more. More funding would allow us to pay\nour writers, photographers, and editors more and in a more timely manor. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\n6. Filling in the\nadvertising gaps:\u003c/strong\u003e The honest truth is that, sometimes, we simply can\u2019t raise\nenough ad money to print an issue, but we print it anyway and deal with the\nconsequences later. Over the years we\u2019ve cut back on the number of pages per\nissue and the quality of the paper stock, but there are really no more such\ncutbacks we can make beyond abandoning the print aspect of our company\naltogether. The cost of a print magazine is one of the main reasons why we find\nit so hard to save up for these bigger projects. So, some funding might go\ntoward filling in the gaps when raising money for our print issues. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe vow to use any and all\nmoney brought in through Patreon to benefit these areas of the business. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.undertheradarmag.com/uploads/article_images/Alt-J-0038814_photo_by_Pal_Hansen_interview_Under_the_Radar_patreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore info on Under the Radar: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUnder the Radar has been\nprinting since 2001 and was an early supporter of such artists as Fleet Foxes,\nVampire Weekend, Rilo Kiley, Death Cab for Cutie, Tegan and Sara, Bright Eyes,\nThe Postal Service, The Shins, Interpol, TV on the Radio, Deerhunter, Grizzly Bear, CHVRCHES,\nM83, Courtney Barnett, Savages, Mumford \u0026amp; Sons, alt-J, Tame Impala, and\nFlorence and the Machine, among many others, and still continues to break new\nartists with each issue.
