    "summary": "Hello! My name is Ariele, but you might know me as Usako.\u003cbr\u003eI am 23 years old, a cosplay and a youtube rookie.\u003cbr\u003eI was born and raised in Austria, surrounded by huge mountains, and I\u0027m talking really huge.\u003cbr\u003eAnyways - I am here to ask for your help. And hopefully you are here to help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is cosplay?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCosplaying means dressing up and acting like a fictional character - may it be from an Anime, Manga, Game, Movie. Cosplayer, as we like to call ourselves, also tend to go to conventions, may it be just as a visitor or even as a guest, which enables them to do workshops, give advices, have signing sessions, and much much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do I need help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of that sounds like a lot of fun, and it is, but it\u0027s a very, very expensive creative hobby. In order to create a costume one needs contact lenses, a wig (or even more if necessary), tons of fabric, threads, a sewing machine, a mannequin, patterns, tons of different materials, a hot gun, a hot glue - the list is endless. Which is why I need your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo how can you help?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a website which allows you to donate money to your favorite artists for their projects. You may donate money per month or per project - and it\u0027s absolutely up to your how much you want to donate! You can, for example, donate 1$, 5$, 30$ per project, so that you make sure you don\u0027t go over your financial limits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s in for me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on the amount of money you donate, you can get different \"rewards\" for it. I will explain the rewards in detail here. I hope you will find something that seems fitting for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBaby Bunny - $5\u003cbr\u003e-You will get full access to the Patreon activity feed.\u003cbr\u003e-You will get full access to my Discord server.\u003cbr\u003e-You will receive patreon-exclusive Vlogs.\u003cbr\u003e-You will receive a fansign. A fansign is a selfie in a cosplay with your name on a piece of paper.\u003cbr\u003e-You will get to see Work in Progress pictures of the cosplays and wigs I am working on currently.\u003cbr\u003e-You will get to see behind the scenes photos of photoshootings, conventions, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFluffy Bunny - $10\u003cbr\u003e-You will get the rewards above.\u003cbr\u003e-You will get access to the HQ photo set of each cosplay of the month.*\u003cbr\u003e-You can vote on which cosplay I\u0027ll do next!*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoft Bunny - $30\u003cbr\u003e-You will get the rewards above.\u003cbr\u003e-You will receive a signed print of each cosplay of the Month.*\u003cbr\u003e(Address is neccessary for this reward!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAngora Bunny - $45\u003cbr\u003e-You will get the rewards above.\u003cbr\u003e-You will receive a one-of-a-kind signed lingerie cosplay polaroid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*= Every month, I will decide on which cosplay to make.
