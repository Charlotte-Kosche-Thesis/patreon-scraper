     "about": "Axsal Johnson is\nan emerging Author, Activist, Consultant, Events Co-Ordinator, Historian,\nPublisher, Tour Guide \u0026amp; Social Media Influencer. His main focus is on\neducating, empowering and unifying the people of the world to improve the\ncondition of the many. With contributions to 3 globally published books, 4\ntrips to Africa and over 200 hours on-site research Axsal finds himself invited\nat speak in schools, colleges, universities \u0026amp; private events on a number of\ntopics from; motivation, self-confidence and meditation to Ancient World \u0026amp;\nNile Valley African History. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJust like\nany person aspiring to make positive changes to the world, those positive\nchanges had to come internally first, and Axsal\nJohnson was not always the man he is today! Since 2009 Axsal Johnson\u2019s life has taken\na radical change in direction after a series of revealing events that required\nhim to question what\u2019s going on in the world? And whether image, status and\nmoney were more important than life itself. Global issues combined with\npersonal circumstances drive him in the pursuit of answers which came in the\nform of Self-Knowledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAfter 5\nyears studying the concepts of well-being,\nhealing, spirituality and the odd conspiracy for personal interest Axsal joined forces with Shaun Lee to form\nYUSALIFE creators of the Amazon bestselling title: \u003cem\u003eThe YUSA Guide to Balance: Mind Body Spirit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn 2011, Axsal\u2019s interest in African history had been\nactivated on a trip to Egypt creating an interest in finding out more about a\ncontinent pretty much unspoken about during his high school years. Like many\nBlack African/Caribbean children growing up in the westernised world as an\nethnic minority, Axsal noticed that he was treated differently and began to\nquestion his place in a society\nsurrounded by people who didn\u2019t have the answers to the questions. It was after\nthis first trip to African that Axsal began on the road to understanding his ancestral\nhistory and the cultural legacy attached to it.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe more\nAxsal came in to information about the great kingdoms of Kush, Abyssinia,\nKemet, Wagadu (Ghana) Songhay and peoples like the Moors, Axsal felt the need\nto share the information with his brothers and sisters who were now in a\nsimilar position to him growing up, treated differently and questioning their\nplace in society. Axsal decided that he could no longer be idle and began\ncreating presentations and approaching schools after his Goddaughter told him\nwith tears in her eyes that she hated her kinky hair and wanted straight hair\nlike the girls in her class. From that day, Axsal has gone hard for the\ncommunity in attempts to ensure every black baby, child, teenager and adult\nknows they\u2019re born from and destined for excellence. Axsal has successfully\nguided over 500 people around the British Museum\nsince November 2011 with students travelling to attend from all across the\nworld.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAxsal\npublished his first totally solo book \u003cem\u003e100\nAmazing Facts About the Negro: With Complete Proof, the 2017 Edition\nCelebrating Black Excellence, A Tribute to J. A. Rogers \u003c/em\u003ewas officially\npublished globally online on 31\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;st\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt; December 2017. Axsal will be\ndelivering workshops for the foreseeable future based on the book and contributing a percentage of the profits to the\ncontinuous and ongoing works of the #WeWillRizeTogether Project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.Instagram.com/UneeferAxsal\"\u003ewww.Instagram.com/UneeferAxsal\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKMB6FeFPuhc0J7O85jDchw\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/channel/UCKMB6FeFPuhc0J7O85jDchw\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.Twitter.com/OmegaAxsal\"\u003ewww.Twitter.com/OmegaAxsal\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
