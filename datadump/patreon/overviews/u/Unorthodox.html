I am a writer, gamer, and one day I hope to be able to call myself an author. I prize what I call \u201clong-form\u201d media. Be it written, audio, or video, this is any work that I would time as taking ten minutes to completely take in. I learn the most from the world when I take the time to listen thoughtfully. In being mindful of who is telling the story and why the person feels \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0story to be the one worth sharing I learn more about the world outside myself. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t\u003cstrong\u003ezerohourseraphim\u003c/strong\u003e is my pen name online. There have been a few variations over the years. Under this moniker, I\u0027ve written about my daily life in cryptic and poetic ways. As ZSeraphim I\u0027ve ventured into a few MMO realms. Most recently, I curate my blog via\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://zerohourseraphim.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWordPress\u003c/a\u003e. There you can find not only my original works in fiction and poetry but also social commentary and derived works. These are productions like video game reviews and fan fiction. I would like to expand my scope to not only standard digital mainstays such as video and streaming, but I am also working to coalesce my first novel. \t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t\u003cstrong\u003eUnorthodox\u003c/strong\u003e is my dream. In about 30 years, when I\u0027m around traditional retirement age, I would like to spend my time helping other artists find methods to finance their work. Recently I heard the saying \u201cBe the adult that you needed as a child.\u201d I always had to leave my neighborhood to find what interested me. The arts and technology were big for me, but my enthusiasm was lost on my neighbors because they never interacted with it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\t\u003cstrong\u003eIf I don\u0027t work, I don\u0027t eat.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I am using Patreon to gain the support of people who can share in my hopes. By pledging to me you will help me accrue a monthly income from any and everyone who wants to see me succeed in my endeavors.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It is common for creators here to use automatic monthly pledges. I do not admonish that. These are more established individuals with a large following and social capital. In order for you to be confident that I will stay on task, I use the \"Per Creation\" option. Each month I will validate at least one of my works as a \"Paid Post\".\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For you, this holds a few advantages. First, if the beginning of a month rolls around, and I did not share any work here you will not be charged. I have to put my nose to the grindstone to ensure that I have something for you all month to month. Second, you can put a cap on your pledges to ensure you always stay within your budget. Thirdly, you can incentivize my writing by spacing out pledges. This is a very active way to show that you want to see more in regards to the quantity of my work. It will be my job to ensure that the quality remains consistent.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Whether I have one or one thousand Patrons, I will produce works that I can be proud of. In my wake, I hope they serve minds well and inspire others to do and share whatever they can. I feel as though what I am asking is profound. I will go to great lengths to prove your trust worthwhile.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u201c\u003cem\u003eWhere would my money go?\u003c/em\u003e\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \tA wholly valid question, all things considered. On this page, you will find my Goals. For computer users, this should be to the left. For all of you on mobile devices, you can find this just above my post feed by scrolling down. Hitting each of those price points will let me save up for, if not the outright purchase of, the item in question. The upper tiers are years down the line at best but would be life-changing. Truly, if I could make my living by writing I would be ecstatic. I am rarely brought to emotion so that is a feat in and of itself.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \tAfter meeting each Goal, the money of the following months will support my daily life in all the un-sexy facets. Part of this will always be food. While I am bound to needing conventional work some will go toward insurance, fuel, and vehicular maintenance, and anything appearance oriented to my work. At sufficient thresholds, I\u0027ll cover rent and other bills. Admittedly I will probably indulge my gaming hobby too. But as even now I convert my experiences into reviews that indulgence becomes equal parts work. \t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \tWhile I am not religious, I do aim to tithe, in a fashion. This is due to something my mother shared with me: \t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\t\u201c\u003cem\u003eMoney makes the world go round. If there is something that feeds into you, you should put some money in their hands. Not because they ask, but because it helps give back to what gives to you. It doesn\u0027t have to be a church or whatnot. Know what gives to you, and give back what you can. \t\u003c/em\u003e\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \tPatreon not only allows people to support me but makes it easy and viable to support many artists in one place. Going forward, I aim to donate 10% of my pledges to other creators or entrepreneurs in some way. As I prosper, I want to continue to give others the same feeling of hope and support that my patrons give to me. \t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \tThis spirit is embodied in my very first goal. I am a Wordsmith. I sacrificed my ability to draw for my talent. As such, I want to commission at least one visual artist for the digital identifiers I think I will need. \t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhat your help means to me\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \tBeing wherever you are and reading my words is meaningful in and of itself. If you are a longtime watcher of mine, you have been doing immeasurable good for me. Knowing my messages are seen is encouraging. Reading and watching, liking, sharing, commenting... all of these things are boons upon me. If you are here, I am going to assume you want to help me ascend to my next plateaus more rapidly. \t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \tPatreon has the potential to be of limitless value. Your support comes directly to me. My blog is open to the public and will continue to be. I write because I enjoy it. I learn from my research and share the fruits of my education with you. As you find yourself coming to my sites, again and again, I ask you to help me make my efforts self-sustaining. \t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t\u201cEven one dollar helps\u201d is not some inflated plea. Relying on ad revenue can be a daunting task. ALWAYS producing content in line with current trends, ensuring your efforts are not \u201ctoo poisonous\u201d for advertisers to sponsor you, all this for $1 per 1,000 views. That\u0027s right. Donating even a dollar to your favorite creators is equivalent to 1,000 content viewings. I do not want to be tethered to this treadmill. I want to be as trustworthy as possible. My personal next step is likely going to be advertisement or affiliate based. I relish the day when I can do away with all that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \tMost people that use Patreon build up a following and then turn to their fan base for support. I am moving in the opposite direction. I want to avoid the above mentioned \u201cproduction treadmill\u201d. I want to have the freedom to experiment with new content and, perhaps, even say something offensive or unpopular if it is truthful. I cannot do that if I am beholden to most companies. But with you, and individuals like you, as my supporters I will always be free to grow, express myself, and talk about what needs to be said. \t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u201c\u003cem\u003eWhat do I get out of it?\u003c/em\u003e\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Either to the right or just below this statement, for personal computers and mobile devices respectively, you can see a Reward breakdown. I base tiers on the initial pledge but will be considerate to sustained giving. For instance, say you pledge $25 for each article I validate without an upper limit. I would be willing to offer the rewards at higher tiers you clear now and again if my writing quantity was constant and would make you eligible at those tiers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I will check for newly met reward tiers monthly, and send out those rewards individually. This will come after payment is received and confirmed by me from month to month. My reason for this procedure is due to an experience an acquaintance of mine had. She is a model, cosplayer, and fellow Patreon user. For about a year solid she had people sign up to pledge at tiers with rewards they coveted. They would redeem their reward, go into her feed, save all the pictures available at and below that tier, and then cancel their pledge. To add insult to injury they would then post and otherwise freely spread the pictures online. These were inside and candid looks into her works in progress. Not only did this ruin their incentive value, but also the\u00a0appeal of being the heartfelt gifts to her patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \tAdditionally, I am adjusting my rewards constantly as I learn what people want, as my skills broaden, and as I come up with new ideas. This upheaval could work in your favor. As long as it is easy for me to manage you may be eligible for a mixture of reward tiers as they change, as I develop skills for new rewards, and adjust them according to the communal value. Please note that some of the rewards may involve \"friends\u0027 lists\" on a variety of services. In no way am I trying to have you pay for my good favor. Simply, I am one person. I want to recognize your contributions, and as my success grows I can do so more acutely. Until then, I have to manage the one resource I have in abundance: Time. Anything that shifts focuses away from my work schedule, tangled as it becomes sometimes, needs to be carefully considered. This includes the endless spiral that is Social Media. My work will always be available to everyone. The aim of the rewards is to give you ever deepening behind the scenes access. When I am at a point in which I can adhere to a production schedule this will be easier.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\t\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027ve made it this far...\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t...I hope that what I have provided and promise to offer has earned your pledge of support. You can either Become a Patron right above here or continue to enjoy my works as you have. Either way, I am grateful to you. I am writing for myself, yes. Much artistic creation starts that way. But as I grow, I want to be Your Writer too. Your Author, in fact. I want to hear about your life, take it in, and let it influence my work. I write so that my story, one I did not see in the world as I grew up, does not remain untold. I want to provide everyone a platform to stand proudly in this world.
