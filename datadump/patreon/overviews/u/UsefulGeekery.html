    "summary": "Your support helps us continue to create new useful geeky items for you and friends, it also allows us to keep our equipment and software at its \u00a0most current incarnation. Our goal is to branch across as many fandoms as we can providing you with just the right amount of adult to your geeky pride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell guys it\u0027s come to the point where I didn\u0027t want it to be but after a year of working and trying to have a stable job my Ehler\u0027s Danlos is finally kicking my butt again. And that leaves me sadly with a final warning that any more absenses and I lose my job. The problem is I can\u0027t predict when that is going to happen, I tore my rotator cuff raising my hand at work and my back is so bad that my period aggrivates it for days on end. The problem is that Ehlers Danlos is not something that people know a lot about and therefor the ignorance of getting help for it is very real. I don\u0027t sleep comfortably, normal tasks take a lot out of me because I snap and pop doing most things and on top of that I have to worry about every step I take because one thing that puts me off balance and my knee, hip, or ankle pops out and down I go. I\u0027m scared of rainy days because if I have to go to the store I may fall on the wet lenolium...it\u0027s not easy or safe because it means my son and wife have to be with me in case I fall. THe biggest issue is how long this is going to take with SSI because I can\u0027t work while applying and at this point the amount of time I\u0027m taking off of work isn\u0027t fair to them either. SO I need you help. I don\u0027t know if an when I can pay anyone back until this process is over but it is going to require a ton of doctor visits to manage while not being able to work anymore. It\u0027s also going to take getting a lawyer because I\u0027ve been denied once based off of my age and education, the brain is willing but the body can\u0027t keep up. The only thing I can do right now is take the time to let my body heal again and get back to my sewing projectws to keep sanity and try and make money while waiting for SSI to make a decision again. If you do anything with this monetarily or not please look up Ehlers Danlos Syndrome I\u0027ve been told I\u0027m type three which means my joints just call it a day and pop out of place sometimes tearing soft tissue like my rotator cuff. And this happens daily. Thank you for your support and time out reading this. I\u0027m also starting a patreon so I can continue my geeky sanity saving business so I feel like I\u0027m still being an asset to society. My depression is being aggrivated by even admitting that this is such a big issue now so I apologize for what seems like a lot of emotion in this post, I hate admitting that I\u0027m broken when I know that the brain is ready and willing but the body no longer keeps up. And folks I\u0027m 32."

     "about": "I run a small business that makes \u0027Useful and Not-so Useful Geekery\u0027 from sleep masks and towels to pillows and rice packs to give me something to focus on while coming to terms with my Ehler\u0027s Danlos syndrome limiting me from everything I did before and negating part of my military training because it\u0027s all too hard on my body. Example I had a job for 5 months and woke up to not being able to bear weight on my ankle, so the company dropped me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I started my little store to occupy time while being jerked around as they decided what to do with me after a work injury set me back further. Two degrees and two years later they dumped me into unemployment, deeming me medical unfit to return to work. VA helped out some and continues to be my sole reliable income. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFastfoward until now and my business is picking up and yet I\u0027m struggling to replenish supplies and suppprt my household. I had a sponsor in my mother in law who said she\u0027d help out and keep us afloat until either someone hired me or SSI could help. I\u0027ve applied three times and being unable to lift, crawl, stand/sit for long periods is not enought to help out even though it\u0027s the reason I haven\u0027t been hired, the things that fit those requirements want more experience than I have and never follow up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere do you come in? This year has been rough, since my mother in law spent the money we were all supposed to be living on to go on vacations that she claimed she couldn\u0027t afford, we need help. My business can support itself but not itself and a household. This is my last resort as all of my planned selling events are on the line and without those to restock supplies in bulk we\u0027re going to sink. I\u0027ve offered rewards before but can\u0027t afford anything at this time but a thank you amd a sample product of your choosing. Without this my store sinks and I don\u0027t know if my family will survive that at this point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was recently diagnosed with PTSD and the only thing that keeps that at bay is by having something productive to occupy my time, it\u0027s therapy and without it I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d be doing as well as I am to help my family who need someone stable to help them through their issues too, (Wife is OCD with social anxiety to boot and my son is a recently diagnosed ADHD case who\u0027s unmedicated until the state gets him into a psychiatrist.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know it\u0027s a lot to take in but I have to try, otherwise what kind of mother and wife am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis money would be going to material, table fees, and other costs to keep the business afloat until SSI make a decision so I can go back to trying to figure out making my body work for me and my family the best it can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/3841370_1427096051.8522_funddescription.jpg\" style=\"margin: 20px 0px; width: 595px;\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.gofundme.com/\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
