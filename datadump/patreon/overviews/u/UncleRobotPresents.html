     "about": "I was thinking about doing a web-comic when I left Los Angeles. I was \ntelling people then that a web-comic was my next project. In Los \nAngeles, when people ask, you have to tell them you\u0027re working on \nsomething. So I told them that.\n\nIt wasn\u0027t entirely a lie.\n\nI\u0027d struggled with a theatre over ownership of some of my plays, and I \nhad written for television briefly. I had failed to make any headway as \nan actor, as a theatrical director or as a stand-up comic. I\u0027d begun to \nfeel that even if I were successful, that my work would always be \ncontrolled by someone else and in the end it would never matter that I \nwas the one doing it. I was a cog.\n\nSo I decided to leave.\n\nProbably a year or so before that, someone had introduced me to \nAchewood. (If you haven\u0027t read it, do yourself the favor.) I was \nimpressed by the content of course, but also by the business model. I am\n not very good at making myself jump through hoops, so making a living \nat my craft has never been easy for me. Here looked like a way to get my\n work directly in front of an audience with no gatekeepers. I\u0027d be free \nto just dive in and go.\n\nFree to fuck up in any way I happened to. Which is the bug of it, of \ncourse. But more on that later.\n\nSo, in my last days in Los Angeles, I was telling everyone I was going \nto do a web-comic. And then I returned to my home town, expecting it to \nbe exactly as I had left it. (It wasn\u0027t, of course. Screw you Thomas \nWolfe.)\n\nAnd I did actually do some work on the comic. I was developing a \nstoryline about a space soldier and a young prince having adventures \nacross the galaxy. Vorto had not yet taken over the strip and it \nlumbered under the overly long working title,\"Dromo Antiphilus of the \nRoyal Galactic Praetorian Guard.\" I had always thought my protagonists \nwould meet up with a pirate and travel with him for a while, but in my \nmind at the time he was cut more from the Errol Flynn or Douglas \nFairbanks cloth. And he was definitely a secondary character.\n\nI struggled for some time with the project, filling notebook after \nnotebook with ideas, but never getting anywhere with it. In the meantime\n I worked at a restaurant, met a girl, had a life. I kept shelving the \nproject and coming back to it only to shelve it again when it refused to\n be what I wanted it to be.\n\nAnd I returned to my first love, which is doing nothing.\n\nThat had actually been the other idea I returned home with. Living in \nL.A., I had come to fear that I might spend my whole life struggling and\n chasing and never allow myself to experience life as it came. And I had\n this notion of belligerent laziness. That I would flatly refuse to make\n anything of myself. That I would defy the protestant work ethic and \nlive like a combination of a Buddhist monk and a recalcitrant teenager. \nTurns out even that kind of life requires a certain commitment that I \nfound difficult. Without my work, I grew depressed and discontented. \nGiving up your ambition is not as easy as it sounds.\n\nSo I kept coming back to the strip idea. I would struggle with it for a \nwhile and then give up, figuring that all the stuff I had written before\n was just a fluke.\n\nMy dad used to tell me that he wrote because he couldn\u0027t not write, \nwhich always seemed like bullshit to me, since not writing is like the \neasiest thing that I do. It turns out that I have no problem not \nwriting, but I am absolutely incapable of turning off the stream of \ndaydreams in which my characters develop. They would live in my head, \nslowly forming and reforming themselves over time. And knowing that they\n would suffocate in there, that I was condemning them to be stillborn, \nwas causing me quiet agony. They wanted to live, the contentious \nfuckers. And they wouldn\u0027t leave me alone. They kept nagging me.\n\nStill, I diligently ignored them, until I visited my brother and his \nfamily in Los Angeles one Christmas and his two year old son started \ncalling me \"Robot\" for reasons that are still unclear. The next year I \nbrought him a tee-shirt that I\u0027d made, bearing a robot head logo with \nthe words \"Uncle Robot Loves Me.\"\n\nAnd then I made an Uncle Robot shirt for my girlfriend at the time. Then\n I made one for myself. Turned out making t-shirts was fun. And it \noccurred to me that I was really enjoying working in a visual and design\n medium, and if you combine that with narrative you have a comic, and \nmaybe it was time to dust off \"Dromo Antiphilus of the Royal galactic \nPraetorian guard\" once again.\n\nAnd with the help of a friend, I got myself a copy of Adobe Illustrator \nand immediately gave up when I discovered how hard Adobe Illustrator is.\n\nAnd that was that until one day, for no reason I can name, I sat down \nand drew a sketch of the space pirate I had intended the boys to meet. \nThis time he refused to turn out dashing. I kept changing details here \nor there, trying to find the character that was in my head. Bit by bit I\n tinkered with the details until the finished drawing looked nothing \nlike I had intended. He came out looking like Jackie Gleason with a \nbeard. (You will notice, he\u0027s changed a bit since then, too.)\n\nI looked at him for a long time before I drew him a logo. \"Vorto the \npirate.\" I don\u0027t know why I did that. I thought I was just playing \naround. But the pirate bastard kept bugging me. It was as if Sir John \nFalstaff had a baby with Captain Nemo, and then Popeye raised him. I \nfound myself going back to my comic strip with the vague notion that \nmaybe this new Vorto would play a bigger role. Maybe even spin off from \nthe strip when the time came.\n\nBut he wasn\u0027t content with that. Every time I started to write, Vorto \nkept demanding a bigger part. He\u0027d show up and steal the hero\u0027s \nspaceship, or pop in in the background of scenes and steal old ladies\u0027 \njewelry while winking at the the audience. And I\u0027d go ahead and write it\n that way and then edit him back out again. Over and over again. But he \nwouldn\u0027t go away. I kept plodding away at the story idea over and over \nagain. I\u0027d configure and reconfigure it, giving Vorto ground little by \nlittle until the obstinate pirate finally took the whole strip over. I \nbarely even know where he came from.\n\nBut he\u0027s here. Emile Vorto, the insufferable prick who made me give up \nmy coveted laziness. Now I meet a strict weekly deadline and carry a \nworkload equivalent to a second full-time job so he can antagonize the \nnoble and heroic protagonists I had originally intended to write about.\n\nOh well. When life give you lemons, make lemon sandwiches, I guess.",
