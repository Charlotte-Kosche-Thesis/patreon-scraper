Did you do something with your face?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoooooo I am a chemist by trade, I studied Chemistry with Medicine for 4 years and worked for 3 years in pharmaceutical manufacture, which was not at all for me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI basically left my job and started doing this due to social anxiety, I really suffered being in a room with so many people all day. So I used all my savings to buy a gaming computer and some video editing software and I moved home!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I just create\u00a0videos in the hope of making people laugh and have a good time. I work part time as a Chemistry tutor but ideally would like to be able to give video making my full attention. I have no aspirations to be rich or anything, but with a little extra from donations I\u0027ll be able to sustain myself (chicken), and provide as much content as I can physically get out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s why I am doing this! Thank you so much for reading and check out my stuff if you are interested. I have a collection now, for more specific work check the playlists on my channel. If you like what I do and would like to support please feel free to donate whatever you can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose who do donate any amount will be entitled to extra content. \u00a0Things like left over scenes, videos I make but don\u0027t release, and live updates from me throughout the week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMUCH LOVE\u003cbr\u003eMatt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
