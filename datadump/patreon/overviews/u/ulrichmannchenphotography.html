    "summary": "Hey guys, I am a photographers living in Germany. I am specialized on analog black and white portraits and I am working with medium, but mainly large format cameras (4x5\").\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI develop my own film and print on fiber based silver gelatin paper in the dark room.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though I am working with black and white film, the current project I am working on is in color. After enlarging a b/w print in the dark room, I am hand coloring the print with oil colors. This technique was very popular before color film was invented. However still to this day, its unique in its character, colors and style.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhy all the work if you could just take pictures with a digital camera or at least color film? Well as mentioned this way offers results in brilliance and quality that are unbeatable by digital prints and has \u00a0a character that can not be found in color film photography. Its a one of a kind art and a technique used by the old masters, with all its richness and craftsmanship.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a big child at heart and I love the geek culture, fairytales and adventures. Due to that I am creating a photo series of Cosplayers, Steampunks and Lolita fashion styles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore infos and pictures on my website:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ulrichmannchen.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUlrich Mannchen Photography\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI experienced growth in my photography by simply doing it, continuously pursuing it and trying to solve challenge after challenge and I could not have done it without people on my side, who gave me feedback, encouragement and especially insight, know how and experience. I am a firm believer that iron sharpens iron and that I would not be where I am right now with my photography, if I would\u00b4t have had those fellow photographers, collectors and artists that I met along my way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have this patreon, in order to share my experience and work process and establish a community that is passionate about photography. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second reason, why I have this patreon is the \"House of Photography\". I am working on establishing a place in N\u00fcrnberg Germany by September 2016, that serves as a home to photographers, who want to live in community and harvest all the benefits of pursuing their dreams with mind like people. Imagine the Hobbit. Frodo alone would not have cut it, he needed the fellowship. I am part of the founding team of the \"Photography School Master Class\", which will launch in September. More information are on the website:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ywamphotographyschool.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSchool of Photography Master Class\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThis requires time, finances and of course some love.

The goal is to create an exhibition with high quality silver gelatin prints in order to reflect and present this beautiful culture and craftsmanship. In order to achieve this goal, I will need the right equipment and tools and I will have to travel a lot as well. It is a ton of work, but I believe its worth it. The people I meet are inspiring, passionate people, who invest so much time, money and love into their costumes and fashion. I want to honor that passion, by giving it the platform of the art of the old masters craftsmanship - analog silver gelatin prints, developed and enlarged in the dark room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHouse of Photography\u003c/strong\u003e - Establishing a home for photographers to live in community to grow their skills and passion.",
