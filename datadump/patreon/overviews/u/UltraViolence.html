    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOn YoutTube I go by the name \u0027UltraViolence\u0027. I create and upload gameplays of Doom with a private and unreleased mod called \u0027Clusterfuck\u0027. I try to be as raw and honest as possible with you guys so if you took the time to read a bit about why I do what I do it would mean the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did I create a Patreon and my Youtube channel?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo be honest, I don\u0027t know why I created a Patreon. I suppose I put a lot of work into what I do and receiving some money pretty darn awesome and extremely encouraging. I play Doom for about 2 hours starting around 11pm, I then spend up to 5 hours editing the videos and then go to bed. A lot of people would think that it\u0027s crazy for someone to be doing all of this work at that time of the night and early morning... And if I were you I would be thinking the same thing. However, the last year and a half have not been kind to me or my family. My Dad suffered a brain injury caused by a tumor and I have put everything on hold to be there for him and take care of him. The results of the injury were severe and he needs constant supervision. I don\u0027t have the time nor the mental capacity to work or study. Last year really messed me up with severe anxiety issues which I am still recovering from, tho I am far better now than I was last year. Early last year when it all began I discovered Hexa\u0027s YouTube channel and Complex Doom/LCA simultaneously. Those videos kept me going in the early mornings before going to see my Dad in the hospital and inspired me to make my channel. I\u0027m busy all day every day being with my family and doing my best to raise everyone spirits. Finally, once everyone is in bed, I begin playing Doom and recording gameplay. My channel is keeping me occupied while the views and comments are doing wonders to lift my spirits. I feel so lucky to even be a part of the Doom community and I especially feel lucky to be involved with the development of Clusterfuck. I\u0027ve met some truly wonderful people on this journey and can\u0027t thank you enough for taking the time to comment even simple things like \"Nice video\". You guys are the True Legendaries. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDonations...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eTo be perfectly honest I have no idea what I\u0027m doing with this Patreon... I feel guilty and greedy for even making one in the first place. In a similar way to how people don\u0027t want birthday presents from their friends on their birthdays, I don\u0027t want money. I want to be happy, I want to have fun and I want you guys to have fun and be happy as well. If you want to donate (if that\u0027s even the right word) money to support me and my work then I can do nothing but thank you. I\u0027m not too sure how Patreon works so I\u0027m going to follow what another Patreon has done and setup tiers of donations. Obviously I don\u0027t have the resources to create real rewards but this is the only way I know how to do it... If anyone has any ideas on what I could do for rewards feel free to comment on my videos and let me know. Thank you for taking the time to read!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
