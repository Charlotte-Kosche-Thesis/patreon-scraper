Our roles and purpose within our songwriting have evolved over time, and now Sera writes the lyrics and comes up with the concepts for the songs, whilst Frankie creates the melodies/musical arrangements, production, and plays most of the instrumentation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe name \u2018Unsung Lilly\u2019 is based on Sera\u2019s great grandmother, who was also a creative type and absolutely in love with creating art and music. Being from the time that she was from, she sadly didn\u2019t have the opportunity to do anything with her art, but dedicated her life to being a wife and a mother. One day, she came home and found her husband cheating on her, and she sadly and unexpectedly died of an asthma attack. People say she died of a broken heart. When Sera heard this story, which probably represents the struggle that many women had to go through in past times, she decided to pay homage to Lilly by naming the band \u2018Unsung Lilly.\u2019 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u2018I am hugely passionate about putting music into the world that ignites us all - myself included! I recently heard India Arie talk about how when she writes her songs, she\u2019s really writing them as affirmations for herself, and I feel a very similar way. I write our lyrics as an affirmation of my own empowerment (as a woman - being in a same sex couple - as a citizen of this world) and the fact that others are ignited and inspired by our songs is the fuel that lights our fire! \u003cbr\u003eMy vision with our music is to build a tribe of as many people as possible who love music and who want to create social transformation, so this world can keep evolving into a better place. We\u2019re living in such a tumultuous time and I really feel like now, more than ever, its about uniting together and finding that strength that comes from forming a community and a tribe. \u003cbr\u003eI write songs about whats going on in the world, about how society can evolve by uniting together in love \u0026amp; acceptance, and about the authentic love that Frankie and I have experienced with each other - we really feel like real, true love, needs a voice!\u2019\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e- Sera\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2018I live and breathe music, and what inspires me is to create something that causes a reaction in the person listening - whether it makes you sad, happy, empowered, emotional\u2026I love playing with sounds and melodies and chords and rhythms that invoke true emotion in someone, including myself. I can literally lock myself away for hours, in a room full of instruments (in a total trance) playing with how to create sounds, just because I love doing it. \u003cbr\u003eMusic is just who I am, and what I do - I couldn\u2019t do anything else. I just have to make music!\u2019 \u003c/strong\u003e- \u003c/em\u003eFrankie\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnother few things to keep in mind about Patreon....\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- You can cancel or adjust your support at any time, should you want to stop giving, or buy in to more rewards\u003cbr\u003e- You can also cap your pledge so it only gets charged for one song/video per month\u003cbr\u003e- Our aim is to release one song and one music video per month (and perhaps a lyric video or acoustic video, depending on what else is going on that month in terms of touring commitments).\u003cbr\u003e- You\u2019ll still be able to access our monthly releases via iTunes, Spotify, Amazon etc, so you don\u2019t need Patreon to be able to access the music, but this way you\u0027ll be part of our inner circle and get access to all sorts of exclusives\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, \u003cstrong\u003ejoin the tribe\u003c/strong\u003e! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe cannot wait to see where this next 12 months takes us! Its going to be tough - there\u2019s an awful lot to think about - its not just writing, recording and releasing an awesome song a month, but creating a powerful video for each one, and all the energy that goes into the promotion around each song is huge, but we are so excited to get started! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSong 1 is our latest release \u2018Hear us Roar\u2019, released Sept 04, 2017, so our 12 months plan starts\u2026.now! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love\u003cbr\u003eSera \u0026amp; Frankie \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PvL3p3eZrEU\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
