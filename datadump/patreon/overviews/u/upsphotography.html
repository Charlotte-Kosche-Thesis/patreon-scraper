    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eUnparalleled Suffering Photography started in March 2014\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0while I was a vegan food photographer. \u00a0I had used vegan food pictures that I took for over a year to raise awareness about what happens to animals who are used for food purposes along with other purposes and then it dawned on me that I should be photographing animals to advocate for animal injustices instead of using delicious food. \u00a0I went to go document \"livestock\" displays, \"livestock\" judging shows, and a rodeo all in one day and that\u0027s when Unparalleled Suffering Photography, a tireless commitment of mine to pay my debt and my rent for living on this planet, came to be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe vast majority of my extra money and free time has gone towards this cause since the inception, but I\u0027ve never had much extra money or free time and that\u0027s where Patreon comes in. I\u0027ve been able to document so much stuff, which is hard to believe with my very limited resources and time, but it\u0027s only because I\u0027ve been almost non-stop this whole time. \u00a0I\u0027ve documented many animal atrocities that people had no idea even existed and I\u0027ve been focused on documenting all types of animals in all types of situations, ultimately showing what it\u0027s like to be a nonhuman in a world where humans think they rule the world. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m sick and tired of spending the majority of my time working regular jobs that have nothing to do with helping animals and it\u0027s been my dream since the beginning to tackle this work full-time and be able to share way more with the world than what I\u0027m currently able to. \u00a0In order for me to devote the time that\u0027s necessary for this vast workload and to expand the range of what I can do for documentation and animal rights, I will need a reliable source of income. \u00a0There\u0027s no money in doing what I do, so that\u0027s where Patreon comes in. \u00a0With Patreon you can sponsor me with any amount you choose per month and you can increase or decrease the amount at anytime or cancel either temporarily or permanently. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve gotten requests by other animal advocates on a regular basis for images for their personal outreach and protest efforts and I give all these images away at no cost. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work has also been used by animal protection organizations I greatly respect such as Fish Feel, United Poultry Concerns, and Direct Action Everywhere. \u00a0As time goes on I\u0027d like to see my images make it to places where they will be seen by thousands and thousands of people on any given day, such as on a billboard in a major city.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more I make on Patreon the more time I\u0027ll have to document, the more variety I\u0027ll be able to document, and the farther I\u0027ll be able to travel to document. \u00a0Thank you for your support."
