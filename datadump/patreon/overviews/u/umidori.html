    "summary": "Hello people! I\u0027m\u003cstrong\u003e Umidori \u003c/strong\u003eor\u003cstrong\u003e UMdR\u003c/strong\u003e,\u00a0an \u003cstrong\u003eanime/vocaloid violinist \u003c/strong\u003eand an \u003cstrong\u003eoriginal music producer\u003c/strong\u003e! Glad to meet you guys here at my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an undergraduate university student in Canada who absolutely passionate about music. I started learning and playing violin since 7 and encountered the Japanese ACG culture when I was in high school.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first violin cover, \"God Knows...\" was uploaded on YouTube in 2010. I recorded it with a cheap digital camera only, with no condenser microphones, no backing tracks, no audio post-productions...no nothing. No wonder it sounded pretty bad. But what can I do to make it sounds better?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNaturally, I began to dig into this field more and more. I bought my first recording microphone, bought my first sound card, updated my editing softwares etc. I even started producing my own music with the tools at hand - As of June 2017, I\u0027ve released 2 Vocaloid originals (\"LiBERALiZATiON\" and \"Needless\"), 6 pieces of original music/remix and still counting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever as the university goes on, I find my time gradually becoming insufficient to support my hobby. Starting from planning the fingering and bowing, to recording audio and video, mixing and mastering, and typing out the sheet music...all and all takes fairly long to reach perfection. Sometimes I even felt stressed \u00a0stressful although I really shouldn\u0027t be...Nevertheless I still feel sorry for all my audiences if I haven\u0027t uploaded for a long time :(\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTherefore a little donation really helps!\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon allows you to pledge any amount greater than $1.00 for each of the video, and I will be able to receive the pledge amount with each of my upload. Even a dollar motivates me for producing more covers and supports me pursuing my own music career! Of course, you will receive special gifts from me as a patron - you can even request for a violin cover of a song of your own choice if you love me that much \u0026lt;3.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thanks to everyone who\u0027s reading this, love ya all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
