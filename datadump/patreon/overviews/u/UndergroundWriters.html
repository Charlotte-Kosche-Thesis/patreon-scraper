We publish a quarterly zine featuring the best new short fiction, poetry, flash fiction and reviews sent to us by writers from Australia and around the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been in operation since 2009, when Underground was imagined and founded in a small university in Western Australia. Since then we have\u00a0published 21 issues, featuring over a hundred writers who have contributed hundreds of pieces of creative writing in various forms, and have been the home of 15 volunteer editors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we currently do:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003efour times a year we release a zine containing the best creative writing from our submitters, a round-up of writing opportunities and a review\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eprior to each issue our editors read, discuss and critique each submission, then we contact the authors with our feedback and work with them to improve their work for publication\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003egiving in-depth feedback is what makes us different from other creative writing zines, as we always give feedback, whether we ultimately publish the piece or not, and when we can we offer alternative publications for the author to submit to, if their piece is unsuitable for Underground\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ealso, each month one of our editors writes a review of a book, movie, album or play, released on our website and social media\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://underground-writers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Reviews-15-16.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll of the books, plays, movies and albums reviewed by Underground\u2019s editors up to 2016!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we want to do, and what the money will go towards:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter running on no budget for years we\u2019ve decided that some financial resources are required to realise our big plans. Until now we have not been able to pay our contributors as we are un-funded and do not charge a submission fee or a subscription fee for the zine. So through Patreon we hope to find supporters to allow us to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay contributors a standard rate per piece of work published\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCommission artwork for each issue, as supporting independent artists and illustrators is another of our wonderful dreams\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExtra money raised will allow us to advertise Underground Writers and reach a wider audience of creatives passionate about writing\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExtra money will also go towards maintaining our website and improving our service to emerging writers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFurther down the road we will also be printing copies of our zine\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur funding milestones\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e$120 per month will see us able to pay our contributors a reasonable fee for their writing\u003cbr\u003e$200 per month will mean we can also commission an artist to illustrate the zine\u003cbr\u003e$250 onward will give us some money to maintain our website and print copies of the zine\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease note\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project is set up as a monthly pledge, but we release issues every three months, so the money gathered over the previous three months will go towards paying writers and illustrators and, if we\u0027ve reached our goal, it will cover printing costs at the end of those three months. \u003cbr\u003eWhat you will receive every month is exclusive first access to all of our original content including blog posts, interviews, reviews, and issues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf a one-off donation is more your jam we are still incredibly grateful for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso, the dollars on Patreon are US dollars, so the monthly amount will change slightly depending on exchange rates.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
