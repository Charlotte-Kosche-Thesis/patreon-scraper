Then you are at the right place. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for joining me on my journey. I will continue to make sculptures out of gemstones, rubbish, wood ,light, shinybits, fire and\u00a0 wire and start to paint with acrylics, watercolours, wax, pixels and pencils again. You will see everything from the first sketch of the idea to the making and the final installation here on Patreon. I am creating since I was mini and it always was a huge part of my life, now its time to do this every day to make the world a better place. My name is Ulrike Liebetrau - \"Liebe\" means \"love\" in German and \"trau\" either being brave or an old expression for getting married, most people call me Uli, Rubbish Fairy or Neeeps, you can find more about me on www.uliunique.com . I am looking forward to share my magic with you and to get to know you better, lets live life on Inspiration."

     "about": "My journey began 1983 when I was born in Greiz in Germany,\nDDR. Art was always very important part of my life, I was encouraged to create when\nI was still mini. I grew up in Weissenfels and did my education as an\nOccupational Therapist in Zeitz. After that I got a scholarship to get educated\nin Sensory Integration and working with Thermoplastics to make splints. The\nbest \u201cmistake\u201d I ever made was sending an email with my CV to the \u201cwrong place\u201d\nin Cobh in Ireland. When contacted I said that I don\u2019t want to go, one thing\ndid not let me be \u2013 not going and living for the rest of my life with \u201cwhat\nif\u201d. So I decided to go and just try it for a few weeks \u2013 this was in 2007.\nWell.., as you can see I am still here and in my element. After a year I opened\nmy own occupational therapy practice in Cork. In 2011 I had the opportunity to create all summer for\nVantastival, Knockanstockan, Kinsale Art week, Body \u0026amp; Soul and Electric\nPicnic with the BYE team. This influenced my Art immense as I came in contact\nwith rubbish art which is a huge part of my creative process to date and always\nwill be: the shiny bits were born. I also found my creative playground in\nBellurgan Park and a huge dream developed: \u201cBellurgan Sculpture Park and Artist\nretreat\u201d.  In autumn of that year I\ndecided to get some \u201croutine and structure\u201d to be able to maintain my sanity\nand started working for Apple and then PayPal. During my time working full time\nthere I never stopped creating and even I did not make all the festivals, Vantastival\nand Arcadian Field are the two I still am creating for, starting each year in\nJanuary. In 2017 I suddenly \u201cwoke up\u201d and realised I am finished with working\nfor the big cooperation. Now it\u2019s time to create all the time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nExpertise/ Media: sculpting, light, rubbish art (upcycling),\nd\u00e9cor, acrylic painting, weaving baskets, woodwork, collages, encaustic, silk\ndrawing, marbling, sketching, digital art,\u003cbr\u003e",
