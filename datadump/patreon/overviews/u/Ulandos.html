    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003eHere you can directly support me and my content. The YouTube platform is falling to pieces at the moment and it WAS one of my main sources of income.\u00a0 I\u0027m hoping if you\u0027re reading this you\u0027re here to help me out and support me in my job to entertain you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon also allows me to be more flexible with my content, as currently the only videos that supply me with income are Minecraft orientated. I love to play other games on the channel, but it\u0027s tough when 90 percent of your viewers don\u0027t watch anything but Minecraft.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now some personal information on Ulandos for you curious creatures:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReal name is Uland, in my 20\u0027s, live in Sydney Australia and I suffer from \"severe\" OCD. Explaining the complexities I need to endure during life is too embarrassing/complicated so I don\u0027t want to go into detail. Let\u0027s just say I can\u0027t go in public often and have trouble looking after myself because of it.\u003cbr\u003eI see making videos as a rehabilitation and constant activity to help me get through my day to day life. Obviously it\u0027s not just that...\u003cbr\u003eThe love of my life, Amanda who I have been with for nearly 9 years (2018 now) has helped me be so much more than I was. She helps me live my life as though I\u0027m more or less \"Normal\" by caring for my in-capabilities which I get from having the disorder.\u003cbr\u003eIt has only been until recently on Youtube \u0026amp; Patreon that I have been able to do anything CLOSE to a job. My future \"super duper plan\" is to sustain myself purely off my online job as an Entertainer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so grateful for the way technology has been advancing. I would never have thought the idea of staying at home and making content would be an ideal for a full time job. It especially gives me hope for other people with disorders which completely immobilise them from the rest of society.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNOTE: If you suffer from OCD and live in Australia NSW Penrith Area, hit me up, I go to a support group where you can share your OCD problems with other sufferers. It\u0027s great therapy.\u003cbr\u003e"
