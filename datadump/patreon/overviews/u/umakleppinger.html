    "summary": "Back in the old days, (like way, way back) artists and musicians were supported by wealthy nobles who housed and fed them and provided other support. In this manner, the creator was free to work their craft without worrying about hawking their typewriter at the pawn shop to pay for Xanax. And in exchange for providing sustenance, the patrons had cool, edgy, evocative art that they could feel excited and proud about helping to bring into existence. Think: Michelangelo, DaVinci, Shakespeare.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNowadays, individual artists compete for limited stipends and artist-in-residencies which permit them the time and support they need to devote to their art. Often to qualify for such support you need A-list blue-blood connections and Ivy League advanced liberal arts degrees.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have neither, so getting good support for my writing work via such methods is out of reach. But Patreon makes it possible by putting patronage within reach of \"ordinary benefactors\" like most of us. For as little as a few dollars each month, you can make it possible for me to do what I do best, without worrying about whether I\u0027ll need to sell the typewriter\u2026and probably reduce the need for Xanax altogether.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT ME:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy love of writing and publishing began sitting at my grandmother\u0027s kitchen table. I was visiting for the summer on my way to chase my fortune in New York City. For hours, I\u0027d sit there, pounding away at the stiff and cranky keys of an old manual Smith Corona, forging painfully bad poetry and awful short stories. Until my fingertips were numb, I\u0027d set my stories with creative margins and formatting, then post them up around town with thumbtacks and scotch tape on bus stops and street lamps. I posted them anonymously or signed them using only my initials; I wanted desperately to have my stories out in the world\u2014stories of the unique hardships I\u0027d faced growing up as an army brat, stories of chaos and resilience and a relentless but cynical hope\u2014but I was simultaneously embarrassed to claim them, fearing my writing wasn\u0027t \"good enough\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to think I\u0027ve learned a few things since those early publishing ventures. I\u0027ve been a creative professional for my entire life\u2014as a visual designer and art director for nationally renowned magazines, a storyteller on the stage, and more recently as a writer and editor. It took decades to find\u2014and develop\u2014my voice and to arrive at that mythical place called \"Good Enough\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing explores contemporary social issues and provokes deeper thought about how to become the change we wish to see in our world. They are brutally honest stories, often equal parts heartbreaking and heartwarming. My purpose as a writer (and a creative human being) is to inform, inspire, help us connect more deeply with our shared humanity, and increase empathy for and understanding of others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than ever, I believe storytelling is essential to reclaim balance in a world out of whack. Current events in the United States are bleak, toxic, and horrifying. Many of us feel a collective dread and suffer a shared malaise. We are faced with fresh stressors at every turn and with every Tweet. I\u0027m not here to add to it, but rather to carry a torch for sanity, compassion, and radical love. Radical love isn\u0027t warm, fuzzy Hallmark moment love. Sometimes it is ruthless and brutally honest. Often, it\u0027s some combination of all the feels as well as difficult, complex emotions. Most importantly, radical love is more about how we act, what we do, than how we feel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT ALLIED INDEPENDENT:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond publishing my own book, I am preparing to publish other emerging writers and would-be authors through my agency, Allied Independent. \"AlliedIndie\" supports businesses and writers focused on social justice, B-corps, sustainability, and issues-oriented prose and poetry. My goal is to help clarify and amplify others\u0027 voices and stories, providing an extension of the support I receive from you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m delighted you\u0027ve found your way to my Patreon page. As my patron, you become part of the writing process. You\u0027ll receive new stories and essays as they\u0027re written. I also perform live storytelling on a regular basis, and you\u0027ll get access to video recordings of everything from enthusiastic attempts at stand-up comedy to soul-searing true storytelling that\u0027ll put a tear in your eye. And maybe, just maybe, you\u0027ll find yourself infused with inspiration and energy to get out there and create the change you wish to see.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "By many counts, I probably shouldn\u0027t be here at all, never mind writing. Between a chaotic childhood that turned abusive, to a life on the streets as a teenage runaway, to a violent assault by a stranger who nearly killed me, it\u0027s a miracle I\u0027ve survived. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fallout for a life marred by such violence is I haven\u0027t always wanted to survive. Living with PTSD means waking up at times wishing you hadn\u0027t. It means going to bed at night hoping you wouldn\u0027t. I\u0027m not exactly sure how I survived the violence of my early life, but I\u0027m very sure of why I did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI came here to tell you a story.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActually, I am here to tell you many stories\u2014both mine and others\u0027. The only thing I enjoy more than storytelling is editing\u2014helping others tell their stories by clarifying and strengthening their work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome stories aren\u0027t pretty, but I believe most have beauty in them if only for the fact that there is great beauty in life. Even \"ugly\" stories have a seed of possibility in them if they stir real human emotion in us, if they invoke an empathic response. My personal story is tragic, to be sure. But it\u0027s also a hopeful one. I know that the violence in our community all stems from a monstrous imbalance of power rooted in patriarchy. It is an inherent part of the system in which we live and it is the same system which upholds economic disparity and institutionalized racism. My story focuses on the patriarchal values that have kept equality in the shadows. My story, in essence, is a flare I\u0027m tossing into that darkness to illuminate the shadows and burn them away.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong before Gutenberg hit the scene, people had been sharing story for thousands of years, around campfires, cuddled under bear skins, sharing meals under smogless skies. I believe storytelling is a kind of humble superpower. It doesn\u0027t boast or seek fame or fortune for itself; story\u0027s only purpose is to fan an already-present spark in the hearts and minds of readers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my life I\u2019ve been telling stories in one form or another. Through visual art, song, essays, books, and performance. As a storyteller, it is my intention to inspire, amuse, inform, and provoke. It is more than my intention, I believe it is my purpose.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027m not writing or editing, I\u0027m juggling freelance design and writing projects, being a vocal and feisty social justice advocate, worrying about climate change and overshoot, talking to my cat (who always has to have the final word), and riding my bike in the exquisite but often soggy Pacific Northwest.",
