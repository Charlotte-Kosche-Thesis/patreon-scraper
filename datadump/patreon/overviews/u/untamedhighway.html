    "summary": "Ten years ago I self published a comic called Untamed Highway which was written and inked by myself and penciled by ace cartoonist Shawn Dickinson. Untamed Highway ran for 3 issues and then Shawn and I went on to different projects. But the storyline for UH was never completed and the ideas and characters are still percolating in my head. In fact, new ideas and characters are springing to life every day. So I\u0027ve been striking out on my own, forging ahead as a webcomic which will tie up the old story and carry on with a new adventure that will be accessible to those who have never read the print comic. Patreon will help me to cut back on hours spent at my day job and spend more time working on my comic."

Further graphic revelations...Los Bros Hernandez, Dan Clowes Lloyd Llewellyn and Eightball\u00a0series, EC comics, Eisner\u0027s Spirit. Llewellyn paved the way for an obsession with mid-century trash culture...b-movies (Ed Wood, Russ Myers, Arch Hall, Doris Wishman, film noir), desperate frenzied garage rock n roll, tikis, beatniks, monsters, Big Daddy Roth, freak shows. That is why I have a compulsion to create a comic that scratches the scaly underbelly of forgotten American pop culture. In keeping with my oddball throwback mentality, I work 100% with India ink, pencils, pens and brushes on Bristol board.",
