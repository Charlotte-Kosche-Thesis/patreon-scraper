    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eWhen the idea to completely overhaul Smith County Weather into what is now Upper Cumberland Weather came to me, I knew it would be a tremendous undertaking.  We\u2019re talking about going from covering one county with real-time, up-to-the-minute severe and winter weather updates to now 12 counties.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to pull off something so substantial, I knew I would have to create a means by which to receive revenue.  At the time, I had been running Smith County Weather for nearly five years without any sort of compensation.  I poured countless hours of my time and energy into keeping my community informed during virtually every severe weather event that occurred from September 2012 up until Upper Cumberland Weather launched this June.  Weather is something I\u2019m passionate about, and even though I wasn\u2019t making any money, keeping my friends and family and neighbors informed during severe weather brought me great joy, and it still does to this day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut since June, I have now been covering Smith County plus 11 other counties in the same fashion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThankfully, we haven\u2019t had a whole lot in the way of severe weather since this summer, so day-to-day operations of Upper Cumberland Weather haven\u2019t been too strenuous.  And it\u2019s for that reason that I haven\u2019t really been all that aggressive with pursuing potential sponsors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I\u2019ve decided that perhaps sponsorship isn\u2019t the best route to pursue right now.  I have really big goals for Upper Cumberland Weather, and little by little, we\u2019re beginning to achieve them.  But for those who followed Smith County Weather for any length of time, you probably know I\u2019m not a little-by-little kind of guy.  I like doing big things.  12 Days of Christmas Giveaways was a big thing last year, and it\u2019s something I hope to bring back this year!  The introduction of Drone Force One was a big thing.  Our daily live forecast video Cumberland Weather Today is a big thing.  I\u2019m always looking to do big things, and I have no plans to stop doing so.  We have over 5,100 Facebook followers.  That\u2019s a lot, but it can be bigger.  It can be a lot bigger, especially when you consider most of those followers are in Smith County from the Smith County Weather era.  I want to grow more into Cookeville and Lafayette and Smithville and Livingston, and all these other towns and communities that comprise the Upper Cumberland.  I want the proper software and technology to better deliver real-time storm coverage during severe weather.  I want to begin establishing a skycam network throughout the Upper Cumberland that will let us see a live video stream of storms as they occur, and if one of those cameras happens to capture severe weather, whether it be flooding or even a tornado, I want you all to be able to see it so you can react and take the proper precautions to protect yourselves against it.  Personally, I want more flexibility in my own schedule to where delivering real-time severe weather updates doesn\u2019t interfere so much other stuff that sometimes presents a conflict of interest. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere have been many instances over the years where I have cancelled personal engagements or opted to miss work just so I could be here, ready to go in order to bring y\u2019all uninterrupted severe storm coverage, because I know so many of you have come to rely upon it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, advertisers will be the backbone of keeping operations going here, but until some of the other pieces of the puzzle come into place, I have a different idea in mind in order to help with getting some of these other projects off the ground and allowing myself the flexibility to bring it all to you the way I want to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have created a Patreon for Upper Cumberland Weather.  For over five years, much of which was spent doing Smith County Weather, I haven\u2019t taken a dime for the service I\u2019ve provided.  I\u2019ve incurred all costs, both financially and just the personal cost and sacrifice that comes along with doing this.  As I said, I have poured no telling how much of my time into doing this over the years.  I\u2019m now pouring even more of my time into it.  Even though we haven\u2019t had much in the way of severe weather recently to cover, I\u2019m still going live each morning with Cumberland Weather Today, and those broadcasts take time to prepare \u2013 everything you see has to be put together, all the way down to keying in each and every high and low temperature individually for all 12 county seats on our forecast maps.  Financially, there are monthly costs associated with uppercumberlandweather.com.  I take out extra data each month, both with a hotspot and on my phone to be able to provide severe weather updates wherever I may be.  The live streaming software I use to bring you Cumberland Weather Today has a monthly fee attached to it.  Those costs, along with the personal time I put into this, all add up and in a pretty big way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will greatly help to offset those costs.  For those who aren\u2019t familiar with what Patreon is, it\u2019s a crowdfunding website.  If you wish, you can make a monthly contribution of whatever amount to Upper Cumberland Weather.  Even as little as $5 a month, the price of a burger and Coke at Sonic, will help tremendously in helping with the costs of Upper Cumberland Weather and allow me to invest in the new technologies and cool features that will help considerably with the product I\u2019m able to deliver. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t ask that anyone feel obligated to contribute to Upper Cumberland Weather.\u00a0 However, any contribution will go a long ways in keeping Upper Cumberland Weather going.\u00a0 Think of it like an online tip jar of sorts.\u00a0 You tip your waiter for good service.\u00a0 You might place money in a tip jar when someone is up on a stage performing music you like.\u00a0 This is sort of the same thing.\u00a0 If you benefit from Upper Cumberland Weather -- perhaps you benefited from Smith County Weather -- then this can be your way of saying thanks and helping me to continue doing this and making it even better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of whether you choose to donate or not, I want to thank each and every one of you who has supported my efforts through the years.\u00a0 Many of you know I am currently pursuing a career in broadcast meteorology.\u00a0 The way technology is changing and moving more and more online, Upper Cumberland Weather is in a position to become a major local weather enterprise, and you all are to thank for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe future looks very bright for Upper Cumberland Weather, and I\u0027m excited to bring it to you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnthony Taylor\u003cbr\u003e"
