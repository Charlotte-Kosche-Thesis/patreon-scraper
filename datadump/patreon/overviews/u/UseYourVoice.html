    "summary": "Greetings from New York City! I\u0027m Carly Ozard- a bi-coastal singer with roots in fundraising and singing for causes! From Producing and emceeing and singing, I have helped raise funds for HIV/AIDS, Homelessness, Pets Are Wonderful Support, Zani\u0027s Furry Friends, Callen-Lorde Community Health Center, LGBTQ Youth, Transgender Awareness, Habitat for Humanity, and Minority Mental Health Awareness, just to name a few.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a trained mezzo soprano and high belter, who has graced many musical theater, nightclub, and Burning Man stages. My newer abilities include songwriting and recording. I have written seven EDM tunes and am currently exploring that avenue. I have released a debut album recently of cover songs that have traveled with me through life called \"Universal Child\" available on Itunes and CD Baby. I currently sing in the Subways in New York City as a member of Music Under New York. A percentage of my weekly earnings go towards this new project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI find that marrying my recording endeavors (whether they are cover songs or original) to charitable causes is a successful way to get my music into hands of new fans, while raising proceeds and awareness for each cause. I have some really big plans to make a difference in various ways using the connection of music with already growing non-profits and charities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour money is valuable and will help pay for recording sessions, musical accompaniment, engineering, design, and projects where 100% of proceeds will go to legitimate charities nationwide. In order to start projects, recording or concert producing, a small amount of money is helpful to get started. This is where we can all put our funds in the pot to make something beautiful to reach more people and promote it to replenish the pot for the next project. I am looking forward to starting this journey with you. Help me to use my voice beyond my vocal ability, \u00a0in a powerful and more meaningful way that leaves a long lasting imprint as well as a chance for growth and change. \\\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first two projects are partnering up with the wonderful Brown Dog Foundation in Nashville TN to record a song in honor of my brother\u0027s wedding. I\u0027m recording Victoria Shaw\u0027s I Love The Way You Love Me in honor of Cory, Lindsey and Lori, and all proceeds of downloaded songs will go to this animal charity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy second project is I have written a new EDM track with the collaboration of DJ/Composer Leo Frappier. I\u0027ve written the lyrics and come up with the creative concept. It\u0027s called Let Love Rain Down, and I wish to release it for consideration of the Gay Pride Circuit for 2018 by February of next year. 30% of each download will go towards The Trevor Project, a very important thriving organization that offers crisis and help lines for LGBTQ members who are contemplating suicide.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
