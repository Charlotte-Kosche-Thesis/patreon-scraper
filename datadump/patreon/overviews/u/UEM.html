    "summary": "Hi there! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m Jeko. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m on a journey to find the most interesting ideas in anime, and it would be pretty cool if you came along with me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m an English Lang \u0026amp; Lit undergrad at Oxford University; you know the type. Long words, long titles, pretends to understand Derrida more than he ever will. But rather than giving me some kind of \u0027elite\u0027 standards, studying art so much has made me realise how many different perspectives you can have on a story, and how valuable all those angles are.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile I spend a lot of my course reading stories and poems and essays with even longer words, I also cover a lot of theory - ideas about how stories are put together, how we read and think about them, feminism, race, culture, and so on. Many of these ideas can get buried under a long academic discourse, but I want to make them more accessible by talking about them alongside cool and interesting shows, and sometimes against articles and arguments I have issues with. One of my biggest concerns is how anime fans of all kinds get represented, especially Japanese otaku from Western perspectives.\nI talk about perverts a lot; I\u0027m even doing my undergrad dissertation on the erotic and \u0027disgust\u0027 towards it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy anime?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI got into \u0027otaku\u0027 things a bit late; we never had satellite TV at home, so I had no chance to stumble upon something on Toonami and such. But around sixteen, feeling phased out of all the \u0027mainstream\u0027 stuff I was supposed to enjoy, the anime sections of DVD stores and my local library started to stand out to me. Back then I thought it would be a fun experiment, to see what a whole new world of entertainment could be like. Now anime is pretty much the only thing I watch.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI got hooked on how much some stories could move me, and how big some worlds would seem. Early on I had some prudish stances against fanservice and other such things, but learning about otaku and discussing them and with them has taught me that my concerns were often built upon misconceptions of what they\u0027re after. I\u0027ve come to appreciate both \u0027deep\u0027 narratives and ero-kawaii fluff for different things. \nNow I want to use those discoveries to make my blogging better and better.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll money from this Patreon gets pooled into a fund I can dip into for research costs, or for upgrading equipment. The bigger the pool gets gets, the more opportunities you guys give me. I plan to expand this blog into a Youtube channel (once I have a stable place to live that isn\u0027t a bedroom I share with my brother where one of us has to sleep on the floor), and the more money I can save up for that, the better I can kickstart the future of my work. Money can\u0027t buy me happiness, but it can get me some good recording equipment, which is close enough. It can also buy me books, though building a library isn;\u0027t as important as funding equipment right now.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you have a dollar spare and don\u0027t mind helping an otherwise income-less student expand his content, I can\u0027t describe how much I\u0027d appreciate it. I\u0027m a long way off from the fantasy of making a living out of anime analysis, but every Patron is another step towards making this a permanent part of my life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for checking me out!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJeko\n\u003cbr\u003e"
