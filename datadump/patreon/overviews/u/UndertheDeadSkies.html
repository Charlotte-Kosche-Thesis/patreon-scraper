    "summary": "Under the Dead Skies, which updates now on Fridays (previously Wednesdays), started on January \n4th, 2012 as a love story to the zombie genre, as well as being my first\n real step into becoming a serious comic creator. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story \ncenters around the journey of a surviving mother trying to find her \nhumanity again after losing everything and everyone she held dear, while\n trying to aid an ambitious student through harsh terrains, zombies and super zombies alike, with the constant crippling fear of failure. \u003ca href=\"http://underthedeadskies.thewebcomic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe first eight chapters are complete\u003c/a\u003e and should be enough to whet your appetite and see what we\u0027re all about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe webcomic in its entirety will \u003cstrong\u003enever be put behind a paywall\u003c/strong\u003e, so for any current readers, you can still read the comic for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003eWorking on the webcomic is pretty much a full time job on its own, and sometimes it\u0027s hard to justify cutting back hours with my day job to get the extra time to create. Having the additional income would also help fund getting books \nprinted and merchandise made, upgrading hardware, and help with any \nother emergencies that might pop up that my day job might not be able to\n cover. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong term, I would like to be able to become a full time comic \ncreator, which will hopefully mean that I can start more projects along \nside Under the Dead Skies, and I can update Under the Dead Skies more frequently than once a week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven a pledge of 1$ an update only works out to $4 a month, and hey, that\u0027s enough to get a frilly coffee when I\u0027m burning the midnight oil!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions about Patreon and how to use it, \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq?ftyp=patrons\"\u003echeck out their FAQ!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
