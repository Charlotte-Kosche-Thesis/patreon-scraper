I am a 8 year combat veteran of the United States Marine Corps with two combat tours in Afghanistan. After my second tour i was was failing to cope with some things that haunted me from my time overseas, keeping this long story short, i found the hobby of fish keeping. I now had something to block all my negative energy and also get my son and wife involved in with me. It brought us back together and created a life where i didn\u0027t need medication to numb what was going on beneath the surface. I decided to create a YouTube channel to help others in this hobby as well as help other who are thinking about getting into the hobby. I produce these videos because they help me on my long road to recovery, and so far have helped others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made this Patreon page not because i want to make an income and never work a regular job, but because i want to be able to put back into my YouTube channel and continue to make content, but also create exclusive videos and giveaways for my Patreon supporters. I greatly appreciate any support ! and your not only helping me produce great video content, your also apart of my healing journey which means more to me then any dollar amount!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnthony"

I am a 8 year Combat veteran of the United States Marine Corps, I turned to Fish keeping after my second combat tour. I was in dire need of a outlet as i was going down a very dark road struggling to overcome some things from my time overseas. Fish keeping literally saved me and gave me my family back, I put all my spare time into this hobby and brought my young son and wife into it as well, creating a wonderful family outlet that we all enjoy. I hope that my videos can help at least one person, if so then i know it was worth my time. My dream would be doing this full time but i know that is a unrealistic dream, i didn\u0027t create this page as a way to make income for my self, i simply created it so supporters of what im doing can help me put back into my channel and be able to continuously post great content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading and being a part of my journey,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 380px;\"\u003eAnthony\u003c/div\u003e",
