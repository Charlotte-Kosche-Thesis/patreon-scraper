    "summary": "Good day all,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, thank you so much for clicking the link and being here on this brand new Patreon page. Let\u0027s get started.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnreqvited is a post rock/post-black metal project from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. To date I\u0027ve released two full-length records, and I\u0027m excited to continue to create new music for you all. So, why Patreon? One thing that I\u0027d like to make clear before we get into it is I really don\u0027t want to be asking for handouts from my listeners. I will never push this page on you guys, it will simply be here for anyone who chooses to help out. Being an artist is tough without a doubt, and I\u0027m sure you\u0027re all aware of that, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s excusable to be begging for donations in order to continue your craft. However, I do work a full-time job, and it can be extremely difficult to find time to create and feel inspired when you\u0027re constantly busy and exhausted. I will continue to create no matter the outcome, but here\u0027s what I want to do with this Patreon account and how I want to attempt to live my life as an artist:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be able to fully live off this, but the goal is to get as close as possible to doing so. I essentially want to cut down on working hours as much as I can to free up more time to dedicate to creating.\u00a0If you follow any of the Unreqvited social media pages, you know that I reveal very little information about myself, and keep it very much about the music. I want to make this space more of a personal relationship between myself and you, the listener. If you do choose to pledge to this campaign, I\u0027ll be posting demos and song ideas here in my Patreon feed for you guys to listen to, I\u0027ll be asking you guys what kind of new merchandise you want to see, I\u0027ll be posting guitar tabs,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of whether this is something that interests you or not,\u00a0I appreciate you all for taking the time to read through this. I\u0027m grateful for anyone that has supported me in any way, and if you\u0027ve ever purchased my music or merchandise you\u0027ve already done more than enough to help me in this endeavour.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much,\u003cbr\u003e\u9b3c"
