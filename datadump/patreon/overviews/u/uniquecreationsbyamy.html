    "summary": "In 2000 a leap was made into the world of being a professional crafter, after accepting a severance package from a job that was, to say the least, terrible for sanity and soul.\u00a0 It takes a lot of guts to be able to walk away from the steady income that is a traditional job, but overall the experience is so much more rewarding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor 18 years now, Amy Konecny has been handcrafting fun and whimsical jewelry. Three years ago she made the transition into making her own charms in house and the business has taken off from there, adding more depth and personalization with the miniature artwork. During these 16 years, her crafting business has been the sole income for her home, supporting both her and her hunny bunny. A year ago, she added an apprentice to the mix. Overall, Amy has been successful in being able to grow and build her business, all while continuing to offer new and innovative designs and branching out into creating awesome geek products that stay true to her sense of whimsy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we want to do \u003cstrong\u003emore\u003c/strong\u003e. This is where \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, between manufacturing all the jewelry ourselves and traveling to shows (which is the main source of income for the business and those involved with it), there just isn\u0027t enough time to do everything. There isn\u0027t a spare day to sit down and do office work as doing so would put us behind in being able to create our stock. We have a website, but currently the web store is not generating enough income to be able to replace a show every month. We also don\u0027t have the time to keep our website as stocked as it could be. Depending on shows for income also means that sometimes the wild and crazy ideas that we want to do take a while to get off the ground. It also means that often we don\u0027t have the money to order the really cool beads that have become a signature item that our customers love us for. Vintage beads are epic, but they\u0027re also expensive and often we miss out on being able to order them due to finances just being too tight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what \u003cem\u003ewill\u003c/em\u003e income from Patreon be used for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving a steady income coming in that isn\u0027t dependent on a show will give us back some of the comfort that a more traditional job provides. Currently Amy puts in a 90 hour work week on average and is unable to ever take a completely full day off. It also means that we\u0027ll have the income to continue to source out the unique and interesting materials that we use in our products. It means days that can be dedicated to creating new art for charms instead of having the ideas sit on a to do list that could take a year or more before we\u0027re ever able to get around to it. Long term it means being able to take risks to go to shows that we would otherwise be unable to do for fear of failing and putting the business even further behind in production and finances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupporting us on Patreon means that you are helping us build a safety net that we\u0027ve never had.\u003c/strong\u003e"
