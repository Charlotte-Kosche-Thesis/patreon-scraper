But what happened next was extraordinary:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople from different walks of life, political opinions and sexual orientations\u2026 actually\u2026 talked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey called. They emailed. They chatted. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know, I know\u2026 it sounds impossible. But if given appropriate time, information and respect it seems we can actually have a civil conversation on the internet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we aim to do with this Patreon is take it to the next level.
