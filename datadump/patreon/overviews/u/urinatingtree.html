Have you ever laughed at the Cleveland Browns for their idiocy of the week? Did you snicker at the San Diego Chargers foolishly moving to Los Angeles for Dean Spanos\u0027 personal gain? This is the kind of stuff I go after. I also take a \"humorous\" look at big sporting events and the teams partaking in them as well. For whatever reason, people seem to like this sort of thing, which still baffles me, but I\u0027m not complaining at all. In fact, I\u0027m pretty flattered by it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY I\u0027M ON PATREON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always had issues with creating a Patreon due to the fear of me abusing it and general disapproval from people, but the more I think about it, the more it\u0027s an inevitability. Most videos that I make are immediately struck down by the leagues (ex. NFL, NHL, MLB, etc.) for copyright before I have the chance for them to be monetized. They remain online, but all potential \"profit\" goes to the league in question (or any other potential entities that \"claim\" the video rights). This unfortunately leads me to trying to pursue alternative means of revenue to pursue the art of selling out. The longer that I pursue such a passion, the more I feel to collect some sort of income on it. Sadly, passionate shitposting does not pay the water bill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m mainly using this sort of thing as a tip jar. If you feel the desire to throw me a few bucks because you somehow like my work, then feel free. I appreciate every penny that you may or may not give for the shitposting that I do. The money that you give me will lead to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Food in my stomach and a roof over my head.\u003cbr\u003e- Potential sense of entitlement.\u003cbr\u003e- Swelling of an already overinflated ego.\u003cbr\u003e- Jinxing of several teams that I want to succeed.\u003cbr\u003e- A new taxpayer-funded stadium that a city will be paying off for several decades.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future, I may put some \"exclusive\" stuff as a reward for your patronage, but I want it to be worthwhile before I pursue such an action.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI already feel dirty for creating this page and seeking a form of income, so please smack me out of it before I get second thoughts about it ;).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut in all seriousness, I appreciate every single one of you guys and I never thought this was in the realm of possibility. If you are a current or former fan, I salute you for your patronage.\u003cbr\u003e"
