We season the show with comfit of local flare however that shouldn\u0027t stop those outside the great state of Zion from listening and enjoying.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show records weekly, for about 3 hours, after which, we release the show on YouTube and via whatever podcast aggregate service you can think of. All of that work takes time and lots of show preparation. The support we get from our Patrons goes toward making sure that each episode is progressively better than the last. We\u0027re always striving to make a better product for you all to enjoy but also to further reach our audience in the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe think that being an atheist activist and political commentator are inextricably linked and this show is a good fit for those looking for a little blue in a deep red world."
