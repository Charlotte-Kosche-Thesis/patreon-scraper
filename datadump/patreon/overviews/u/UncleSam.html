They later started a meat packing company, which supplied provisions to the U.S. military during the war of 1812. According to legend, \u003cstrong\u003edock workers\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0began joking that the barrels of meat were stamped U.S. because it came from \"Uncle Sam, Uncle Sam Wilson!\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Wilson family lived and worked at the bottom of Mt. Ida, Today\u0027s Prospect Park. Samuel Wilson was briefly buried in the Mt.

We want to make sure that if we, the people, are able to buy these items, we also have the resources to restore and display them. We will keep everyone up to date on progress, and you can always change your monthly pledge if your financial situation or ongoing support for this project changes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith so many active, caring people in Troy ready to support our city\u0027s growth, we feel that crowdfunding like this empowers \u2018everyday\u2019 philanthropists by helping small donors give a lot, a little at a time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: I want to support this initiative, but don\u0027t want to pay online what can I do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA: Please call Anasha at (518) 406-8636 or email MtIdaTroy@gmail.com to talk about other ways you can help this initiative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What do our pledges support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA: Pledges on this Patreon page will be used to accumulate, restore, preserve, and display items for the exhibit. They also support the restoration of the beautiful Mt. Ida Preservation Hall, for use as an exhibit and community space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eQ: Why didn\u0027t the City of Troy buy these items when they were up for auction in 1996?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA:\u00a0In 1996, Gerald Czulewicz Sr. of Minnesota offered his collection of Uncle Sam memorabilia, believed to be the largest of its kind, to the City of Troy for $1.2 million. Among many other items, the collection contained the tintype and costumes at auction this Sunday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt that time, a small research team from Troy was dispatched to inspect the Czulewicz collection. Though they were able to give a close review of the costumes, they were only shown a photograph of the tintype. Given the city\u0027s budget woes, questions about the provenance and other issues concerning the tintype and other items, and given the relatively large asking price, the team did not recommend that Troy proceed with the purchase of the collection.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that items are for sale individually, we believe it\u0027s worth a shot trying to acquire them for a reasonable price. Forsythes\u0027 Auctions estimates the tintype will go for between $5,000 to $10,000; the James Montgomery Flagg suit and hat for $1,000 to $3,000; and the Thomas Nast costume for $500 to $1,000. These are just estimates. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What happens if we don\u0027t raise enough to win the auction this weekend?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eA: The show must go on! The Mount Ida Preservation Association has been working to restore our building and celebrate Troy\u0027s history for years. You are welcome to stay involved, but we will let you know about the status of the auction before your pledge is charged to your credit card so you can decide for yourself how and if you want to stay involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eQ: Are my donations to this project tax deductible?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Yes!
