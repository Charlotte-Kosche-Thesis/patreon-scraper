Unlike real world, actual furries, the furries in\n the comic are not anthropomorphic, or \"sparkledogs,\" or magical animal \npeople. In the world of DoU, furries are simply people who wear a fursuit as an outward sign \nof their faith. It isn\u0027t about \"fursecution,\" but how a given minority group must cope with the situations and struggles that come from trying to coexist within a larger, sometimes even hostile society. A main theme of DoU is, \n\u003cem\u003e\"What do you believe in, how important is it to you, and what are you willing to sacrifice to preserve it?\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDoU first launched in February 2013. Since then, the comic has inspired and intrigued readers and generated both interest and discussion in various quarters of the Internet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhy pledge?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nWell, I\u0027m not sure I have a perfect answer for you, one made of bacon and fried gold. Basically, if you like DoU and the sort of thing I\u0027m trying to achieve with it, if you appreciate what it tries to say, or if you just find it entertaining, then this is a perfect way to help support the project. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, I\u0027m not looking to make millions from or take advantage of anyone\u0027s generosity, nor am I looking to buy houses or sports cars. What I \u003cem\u003ewould\u003c/em\u003e like to do is cover the basic costs associated with producing the comic (hosting, software and equipment upgrades, broadband access, art supplies, etc.). Also, up to now, I\u0027ve not done much in the way of advertising or promotion for the series. Most of the readership for the comic has grown very organically, mainly by word of mouth, and while that\u0027s awesome, I\u0027d like to spread the word even further. And if I want to put anything into print (which I do), and make other DoU stuff to offer (and I\u0027d like to), or have the site upgraded (which I want to), and so on and so forth and so on down the line (which I hope to), well, honestly, those simply aren\u0027t expenses I can fully cover all on my own. So that\u0027s pretty much where any donations would go; covering basic expenses, promotion, site maintenance/upgrades, print projects,\u00a0art supplies, and other DoU-related stuffs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve tried to keep the goals \u0026amp; rewards fun, or at the very least, realistic, but of course I\u0027m open to any suggestions to make better categories or otherwise offer you better value for money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd hey, this isn\u0027t like a cell phone contract, or a car loan, or a 30 year mortgage or anything like that. If you don\u0027t feel you\u0027re getting your money\u0027s worth, or your budget changes and doesn\u0027t allow for it anymore, you can always cancel the pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt shouldn\u0027t be a surprise that I think the future for DoU is pretty bright, and I hope you do, too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I\u0027ve been drawing almost since I can remember. I started with Snoopy, because all kids love Snoopy, and he was relatively easy to draw (my family still sends me Snoopy-themed greeting cards). Before long, I moved on to my own characters. And even then, I always loved comics. Newspaper comics, comic books, what would later be called graphic novels, you name it. So I\u0027d draw comics for school newspapers, stuff for flyers, even a cover for the town report one year! Later, I minored in art in college, drew more stuff, took up watercolor and photography, and eventually one day published my first comic online. When I finished a six-year run on my main comic project, \"Autumn Lake,\" a newspaper-style comic strip, it was time for a change. I wanted to do something different, something that would both allow me more freedom and at the same time challenge me to stretch as an artist. \"Dreaming of Utopia\" does just that! DoU launched in February of 2013, and has been going strong ever since.\u003cbr\u003e",
