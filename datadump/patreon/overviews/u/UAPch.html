If you think this content should keep flowing, go next-level, or respond by request- here is the place to show support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLimited budget, unfair but... In the arena of ideas, being sided with the Truth a little bit goes a long way.\u00a0In the hypnotic, programmed world, creativity is the ultimate antidote. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, if you think I should have a better microphone, \u003cbr\u003eor a better camera, \u003cbr\u003emore time, etc, then yes, if you donate, it would help in those ways. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe content varies wildly, and in that sense you never know what\u2019s around the corner. Space is fake. Much of science is politics and religion. Evolution is a lie. Satellites don\u2019t orbit, outer space is fake, Earth\u2019s flat. But there\u2019s much, much, more mind blowing truth to be found.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e99.99% of materials published elsewhere will support the fraud of fake space, etc. It would be nice to earn 0.01% of the money they get to fight back and defeat the \u201cthey\u201d who defraud us. It won\u2019t happen overnight, but if it did then this is the place."

Who am I?\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m introducing myself this way, to get this out of the way. I\u2019m not going to tell you, as I have little to gain but much to loose. I\u2019m a rogue prodigy leaving ranks of scientific scholarship behind.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I here?\u003cbr\u003eTo share the Great Awakening with you as a pioneer and leader, to teach, to make you laugh. It has to be fun. \u00a0Mostly, I\u2019m providing a free service to vindicate shared misgivings about Science.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s rare to enjoy\u00a0ridiculing the \u201cgenius scientists\u201d out there for a change. I\u2019m uniquely qualified to reset and reverse the immense, lifelong, evil nonsensical mind programming perpetrated by the likes of NdGT, Sagan, Dawkins, and Nye. The four horsemen of all-pop-science. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy logic is kept in check\u00a0by the orthodoxy of great minds of the past, I usually side with them, and the foundational truths of Holy Scripture. Are my videos biased, because I love God/Jesus? You bet. I try to love my neighbors, all humans, maybe non-humans, only the good things of nature, so that excludes cats. Only the good science, like when you dissect cats in Biology class.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI may trigger your programming, challenge your ego, dissolve ingrained egotistical popular notions that are unhealthy. I\u00a0hate\u00a0the nonsense of Darwinism, heliocentrism, jingoism, authoritarianism, fallen nature, sin, and especially intellectual apathy. The one-sided ridicule of critical thinkers has to be answered. Yes the Earth is round, it\u2019s round like a coin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m not acting, and so far I\u2019m not getting much revenue for this. No pay? Hey, that\u2019s OK. I make a nice living but time is money. With Patreon support, the production value, quantity, and quality of content produced will increase.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho better than me to answer ridicule with ridicule back at the liars of the global deception? Some informed, well-intentioned, solid ridicule of them is overdue and hilarious. Better still, when it\u2019s novel, funny, and based on or consistent with Scripture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy background helps the material chosen by being objectively supported with evidence of the first order; \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eobservable, repeatable, and reproducible \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ecorrelative\u00a0experimentally to findings with high statistical significance.",
