So firstly, \u003cstrong\u003ethank you\u003c/strong\u003e\nfor coming by. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve just stumbled\nby my Patreon, welcome ! I\u0027m a furry artist who does a whole range of\ndifferent art-styles, subject matter and species. In particular, I\nlove anatomy and animal behaviour. So, I also specialise in\n\u0027realistic\u0027 transformation sequences, allowing the viewer to believe\nthe fantasy. Of course, I also do naughty art ;) \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI also do sculptures,\nfully custom and fully painted. More on that later ! \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://d.facdn.net/art/foxydragon/1523834185/1523833653.foxydragon_urbanschedule.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve recently returned\nto art after an extreme illness that put me in bed for years, and\nswallowed my life. I\u0027m better now, thanks to an emergency surgery\nthat paid off, and if there\u0027s one thing an experience like that is\ngood for, it\u0027s realising what it is you want to do with yourself !\nThese days, I work part-time as a Life Model, and part time as an\nartist, but my hope with Patreon is to be able to go more and more\nfull-time as an artist, producing more of the art you want. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo\nmy Patreon will feature regular polls, whenever a new project comes\nup. You guys n gals are the reason I made it back, and I can\u0027t wait\nto get started. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eREWARDS : Some\nexplanations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGeneral -\n\u003c/strong\u003eAs well as the tier-specific rewards, I\u0027ll also be posting\nHD images of the art and sequences I post elsewhere, the occasional\npiece of Patron-only NSFW art and I\u0027ll be posting my work here\nfirst.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRapidsketch \u003c/strong\u003e- Rapidsketch\nis a quick-drawing exercise I made up for myself, years ago, and\nstill do to keep my quick-sketch skills on form. I pick a subject,\nand I have to draw it within 10 minutes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBecause of Gambling Legislation, Patreon doesn\u0027t allow us to run \u0027raffles\u0027. So instead I\u0027ll be \u0027accepting suggestions from Patrons for what I should Rapidsketch each week, and picking a suggestion at random\u0027 :)\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour suggestion can be anything -\nany number of characters, weird anime, obscure fetishes - and it\u0027ll\nbe a 10 minute sketch of your idea. (If I\u0027m having a week where I\nwant to do multiple rapidsketches, I\u0027ll pick randomly select multiple suggestions) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFox\nTokens \u003c/strong\u003e- The biggest benefit of Patreon for an artist like\nme is being able to get a stable income over time. So, I thought, why\nnot pass that sort of benefit onto my Patrons ? Allowing you to save\nup for a commission whilst supporting me in my wider work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs\na supporter in most tiers, you\u0027ll earn Fox Tokens. These can be\ntraded in for custom art, but rather than saying \"You get a\nconbadge every X months\" - it\u0027s up to you how long you want to\nsave up for, and what you want to get. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3\u003c/strong\u003e Fox Tokens =\nConbadge. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4\u003c/strong\u003e Fox Tokens = Lineart. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6\u003c/strong\u003e Fox Tokens = Shaded\nlineart or graphite, or a Gourmet Conbadge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e7\u003c/strong\u003e Fox Tokens = Shaded\ncolour. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e9\u003c/strong\u003e Fox Tokens = Full Colour Image \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e16\u003c/strong\u003e Fox Tokens = Full\npaint / render with background\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://d.facdn.net/art/foxydragon/1523835823/1523835823.foxydragon_foxtokenlist.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExtras : \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eNSFW = +1 Fox Token \u003cbr\u003eExtreme\ndetails (e.g. many many tentacles) = +1 Fox Token \u003cbr\u003eExtra\ncharacters - info on its way for launch. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSculptures can only\nbe purchased with Dragon Tokens so that I\u0027m able to keep up with\norders.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you change tier level, you still keep all the\nTokens you\u0027ve earned so far.

The TF Clinic is an ongoing Art Project featuring\nrealistic transformations into animals, fantasy creatures and more.\nThe Transformees write journals and letters, describing their\nexperiences, accompanied by photos. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, the TF\nClinic had to take a hiatus whilst the owner (i.e. me) recovered from\na serious illness. But, very soon, it\u0027ll be back. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I gain\nenough support via Patreon, I will be able to set aside proper,\ndedicated time each week to the TF Clinic. First thing, this means\ngetting the website back up and the old sequences polished up.\nThanks to a brilliant amount of support at launch, I\u0027m aiming to get the website back up in May. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will have the\nopportunity to vote on which sequence comes next, and at certain\ntiers can even submit candidates for the Clinic.  TF Clinic Season\nPass holders can even send someone to fill a vacancy at the clinic,\nhaving one of their characters become a regular feature or cameo in\nthe clinic sequences. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s all for now.\nThank you for coming by, and thank you for all your support. \u003cbr\u003e"
