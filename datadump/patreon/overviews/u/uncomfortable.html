    "summary": "Hi there! I\u0027m Uncomfortable, and I run Drawabox. That includes the website (\u003ca href=\"https://drawabox.com\"\u003edrawabox.com\u003c/a\u003e), the subreddit where it all began (\u003ca href=\"https://reddit.com/r/artfundamentals\"\u003e/r/ArtFundamentals\u003c/a\u003e) and the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtube.com/uncomfortable\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e. All of the resources are \u003cstrong\u003ecompletely free\u003c/strong\u003e. You can even submit your completed work on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://reddit.com/r/ArtFundamentals\"\u003ethe subreddit\u003c/a\u003e or in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/rJz2GFG\"\u003ethe discord server\u003c/a\u003e to have other members of the community look over your work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsing these platforms, I try to help those new to drawing, those who are primarily self-taught and those who are even vaguely interested in diving in. I do so by providing structured, exercise-based lessons that start with the very basics of how to make confident, smooth marks, explore the mechanics of drawing solid forms and ultimately build up to being able to construct complex objects by first breaking them down into their simpler components.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI stress the importance of skill developed through hard work over talent, and give students the resources to get started. My lessons aren\u0027t for the faint of heart - I\u0027ll admit right now, especially at the beginning there\u0027s a lot of tedious work, and you are made to walk a road paved with mistakes and failures. Failure is important - no, it\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003enecessary\u003c/strong\u003e. While our successes show us how far we\u0027ve come, it is through our failures that we continue to move forwards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eSo if the resources are completely free, what\u0027s the patreon for?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDonations to support the community\u003c/strong\u003e. I keep refining the lessons and creating new content to help explain the material. The income from the patreon campaign helps make up for the time I invest into the project.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThose who prefer to \u003cstrong\u003eh\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eave me review their work directly\u003c/strong\u003e can do so by pledging to the various tiers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe Origins of Drawabox\u003c/h4\u003eWhen I started this community in 2014, there was no patreon. I\u0027d recently learned a whole lot of stuff that blowed my mind while studying at the Concept Design Academy in Pasadena, California under fantastic instructors like Peter Han and Kevin Chen. When I got back home to Canada, I wanted to share what I\u0027d learned with others - so I started the subreddit, and wrote some very informal explanations of some of the basics that were covered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver time, the community grew and people wanted to donate. That\u0027s when the website and this patreon campaign were first created. I formalized the lessons and used patreon as a donation drive. I reviewed students\u0027 work on the subreddit, and in doing so, I gradually started to get a better grasp of what I was teaching. The lessons evolved over time, and my own goals in terms of what I wanted to teach solidified. I moved away from just regurgitating what I\u0027d learned in class.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the time October 2016 came around, I wasn\u0027t able to keep up with the workload, alongside my full time job (I\u0027m an illustrator/concept artist at a game studio) and other projects, so the free critiques had to come to a close. At the same time, I made significant changes to the community to encourage others to start critiquing each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy using patreon as a paywall, I strive to balance a manageable workload while also keeping my services accessible to those who can\u0027t afford the more expensive mentorships and lessons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of the day, I\u0027m\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://irshadkarim.com/\"\u003estill a mediocre artist myself\u003c/a\u003e - but I\u0027ve gotten quite good at pinpointing the areas where my students struggle, and identifying a way forward. Where other online drawing courses will easily run you hundreds of dollars, drawabox fills a rather wide gap for those who can\u0027t invest quite so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I want to reiterate - drawabox is just a starting point. If you find that this kind of drawing is something you\u0027d like to turn into a career, I strongly encourage you to look into investing in more professionally-oriented instructors."
