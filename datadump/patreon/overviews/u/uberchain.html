I\u0027ve been using SFM for 5 years and got into TF2 around that time ago, and since then I\u0027ve been here and there such as live Team Fortress 2 LAN events or doing work for companies like PC Gamer and Blizzard Entertainment. So far, a lot of you have been fairly positive about my work, so I think I\u0027m doing something right. I thank you for this continued support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made this Patreon page originally to kickstart doing SFM full-time, however with tThe revenue I get from Youtube + my freelance job, it isn\u0027t enough to fully support me doing SFM work at this point. A lot of my time during the day as well as the night is working on commissions and projects. Because of how much time is spent sitting down collecting radiation from the computer trying to get all this done, I have bad habits \u0026amp; conditions like forced insomnia and chronic RSI.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor my work in competitive Team Fortress 2, my costs were covered for 90% of the time for travelling to LANs such as DreamHack Summer, i58, and ESA Rewind. To top it off, the Canadian-to-USA currency conversion is pretty bad.\u00a0There\u0027s moments where I\u0027ve had to go pro-bonofor even SFM work \u003cem\u003e-\u003c/em\u003e the ESEA S18 Intro\u0027s SFM parts, as well as the reskins, were\u00a0\u003cem\u003eall volunteered time of all-nighters to get it done.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to keep doing SFM things because I love making things with it. I also want to be able to have job security for events such as LANs if they require a photojournalist. I want to\u00a0feel like the pay-off is worth it based on my time and my effort - and I want some extra hands when mine starts complaining.\u00a0If you support my Patreon campaign, you\u0027ll be helping me support:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79,129,189);\"\u003eOther animators I can hire or outsource to\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79,129,189);\"\u003eVoice actors, storyboard artists, and modelers I can hire\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79,129,189);\"\u003eUpgrades for my workspace \u0026amp; workflow to optimize health\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79,129,189);\"\u003eMy food bills, my taxes, and my LAN projects\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79,129,189);\"\u003eAll these cool projects I wanna do\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79,129,189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003eWhat Else Should I Know About That\u0027s Important?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis campaign is set for monthly.
