I also know what it\u0027s like to leave the institutional church and feel all alone in the spiritual desert, wondering if you\u0027re really hearing from God, wondering why you\u0027re the only one who seems bothered by the disconnect between the vibrant, Christ-centered church communities you read about in the Bible versus the business-like, church-centered programs we attend on Sunday mornings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57a53a23414fb58fa3df2faf/t/5a622a04ec212d70adca0bb2/1516382735827/teaching.png?format=2500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I realized I wasn\u0027t alone, when I discovered there are actually millions of believers who think and feel just like I do about the church, it was life-changing.
