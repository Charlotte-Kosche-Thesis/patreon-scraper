Established in August 2017 in Ben \u0026amp; Charlotte\u0027s spare room, we chat about the games that we have been playing and want to play, and what it means to be a tabletop gamer. We see ourselves more as an audio magazine, and like a magazine we aim to cover a range of topics and issues within the Tabletop Gaming Community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery week we will be discussing anything remotely related to tabletop gaming culture from the games we have been playing, the convention scene, Kickstarters and Game Rage!\u00a0 We regularly play D\u0026amp;D, Pathfinder, Magic: The Gathering, Warhammer: The Age of Sigmar and a plethora of other board games, and have even tried our hand at playtesting. From time to time we may even have some special guests sharing their gaming know how!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast will always remain free, and we don\u0027t want to resort to advertisements so community based support is a great idea.\u00a0 We want to be able to continue to produce more\u00a0episodes and audio content, create a range of Unlucky Frog merchandise, and hopefully be able to tour it live around the conventions and meetups in Scotland...maybe even further afield. All of this is only possible with your support and encouragement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.unluckyfrog.com\"\u003eCheck out our website for past episodes and banter...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks, many thanks\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- Ben, Charlotte \u0026amp; Josh\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
