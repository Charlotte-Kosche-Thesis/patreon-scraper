    "summary": "First of all, \u003cstrong\u003ethank you all so much!\u003c/strong\u003e I can\u0027t even begin to explain how encouraging it is to have such wonderful people give their support (both monetary and through messages) at such an early stage in development. I\u0027m so happy (and relieved!) other people can see Undergrowth\u0027s potential and want to play this game as badly as I want to complete it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, I\u0027m Dmetri, the sole member of Hyper Salt Interactive (currently!) and I\u0027ve been programming Undergrowth for the past 8 months. I\u0027ve spent the past ~11 years teaching myself to program in my spare time. I\u0027m passionate about video games, procedural generation, and developing complete game engines. I own\u00a0exactly 1 cat. As a child and a teen I spent a lot of time sketching and I wasn\u0027t too bad at it, so I\u0027ll very likely be producing most of the final art for Undergrowth. Currently I\u0027ve already made the placeholder art which will be refined when a few more of the larger programming pieces are in place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to spend more time developing Undergrowth and have the funds to contract music for the game. With your help I won\u0027t need to pick up extra work and I\u0027ll be able to give a fair wage to anyone I hire!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePerks of being a Patron:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment all my founding patrons are guaranteed an alpha download ahead of anyone else (hoping to have that complete by the end of 2018), a free copy of the game (valued at ~$19.99) on release, and a very special reward is in the works only for founding patrons as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Undergrowth?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUndergrowth is an open-ended PC farming sim with a survival/craft heart - as such, you will find the best aspects of each genre mixed in with a few new and revitalized mechanics! The game has been developed from scratch using the D programming Language so extensive mod support could be built right into its core. (Further posts will go more in depth about the game, its mechanics, and the story it tells).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEarly Development Screenshot of Terrain Destruction:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PWShvS6.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlot:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou awaken on a tiny isle in a sea of chaos; you\u0027re tired, hungry, and demoralized.
