    "summary": "We\u2019re a Brooklyn-based incubator of new and developing interdisciplinary art. What does that mean? It means we\u2019re a community of people who help people make things! All kinds of things! We started in the fall of 2012 as a monthly new theater and performance festival, started by a group of theater makers  discouraged by the expense of mounting work in New York City. From there we grew into a sprawling community of people centered around the Infinite Festival.  Every other month, we all gather at underground performance venue Bizarre Bushwick: artists bring pieces of new projects to show each other and supportive audiences that show up for them. People do all kinds of things on stage at Undiscovered Countries - drag, solo performance, video, dance, music, plays, stand up comedy, and some things that defy description. We also showcase new collaborative pieces between writers and visual artists in our program inserts, so there\u2019s truly a platform for every art form.  Our community is diverse, smart, and funny: we present subversive and accessible work by artists lacking conventional support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re so proud of what artists have been able to accomplish with the help of Undiscovered Countries - pieces begun with have gone on to full productions at places such as Ars Nova, Dixon Place, Tom Noonan\u2019s Paradise Factory, Theater for the New City, the Chicago Fringe Festival, and the PIT. They\u2019ve grown into full length graphic novels, critically acclaimed web series, award winning solo shows and kick-ass rock bands. We love supporting artists making new things: our newest foray is Blast Off Development Lab, begun in early 2017.  Our board members chose six promising emerging artists, each with a captivating project proposal.  Throughout the spring of 2017, we\u2019ll be hosting bimonthly meetings for our artists to create new, uncharted works in active conversation with each other  The lab culminates in a public showing in early summer 2017 tailored to each artist\u2019s needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking work and surviving in New York City is only getting more difficult for early career artists, particularly artists who are not independently wealthy and do not receive vast institutional support.  We want to be able to continue to provide a supportive, nurturing public platform for artists to develop new work without resorting to pay to play, and to provide high quality new and in development work to audiences who want to get in on the ground floor of tomorrow\u2019s groundbreaking new artists and projects without having to charge for tickets. Additionally, we want to keep our platform as inclusive and diverse as possible by removing monetary requirements from both audience and artist.\u00a0  After running the festival our of our own pockets for the last four years we recently received fiscal sponsorship from Fractured Atlas, transforming our motley band of art geeks into a 501c3 style Real Nonprofit. With this, we\u0027ve been able to start soliciting donations to help us do the things we do.\u00a0 By working with Patreon, we\u0027re hoping to be able to cover the operating costs we\n need, as well as grow our organization to be able to more fully \nsupport our community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe really appreciate you taking the time to check out our Patreon page. We\u0027re so excited about the new work our creators are making, and we\u0027re so massively thankful for the opportunity to help them do it.\u00a0 If you want to help young artists go where no one has gone before, and get some cool insider perks along the way, come get involved! \u003cbr\u003e"
