    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMOTIVATION (by Tony Israel, UFOSP Founder)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAfter the successful\nholding of the 2nd Philippine UFO conference in 2011, the UFO Society of the\nPhilippines (UFOSP) went physically inactive \u0026#8211; no regular meetings or meet-ups.\nNeither was there any annual conference nor membership dues collected since that\ntime. For five consecutive years, UFOSP has thrived without funding and\nFacebook became its only means of connecting.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlthough it was able to sustain online presence through user-generated\ncontents, much of the items found on both its Fan and Group pages were reposts\noriginating from UFO sites abroad. Over time, local content slowly became\nscarce, including those purported local sightings which, on past occasions,\nhave moved the group to conduct verification interviews. Onsite investigations\nwere a good source of original experiential documentation that the UFOSP could\nprovide with some esteem and integrity. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nApparently, the public has come to miss those UFO-related news it used to dispatch\nfrom its desks. Sadly, UFOSP can\u0026#8217;t recount stories that occurred within the last\nfive years anymore, unless those who got involved would come forward and offer\nus their narratives. Regrettably, as its founder, I had my share of the\nguilt for relaxing too much. The main reason for my shortcomings though, was purely\neconomic. My former co-officers and closest friends can attest to that fact.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGladly, there are two\nnewly developed platforms that could be employed to correct former outcomes and\nreconnect with the people. These are: FB Live (for promoting community\nengagement by doing live interactive talk shows) and Patreon (for raising funds\ntowards organizational sustainability and continued programming). With these, I\ncould see some hope in resolving the economic side of things that will\nconsequently lead to the creation of a meaningful and sustainable (inter)activity via\nFB Live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eHELP\u003cbr\u003e(Hardware/Software)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe requirement for this weekday show isn\u0027t just about talking while holding a smartphone at arm\u0026#8217;s length.\nAcquiring the right equipment, software and others tools is needed. The show format itself requires good quality programming in terms of\nsound, video, lighting outputs, video-source integration and a modest studio\nsetup. Behind these needs, however, we\u0026#8217;re starting from scratch and that makes\nthis task doubly challenging because some capital investment (scalable from $1,500\nto $2,500) is somewhat involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e(Keep the flame\nalive)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGoods acquisition is\nonly the beginning. Sustainability is everything. We need a steady source of\nfuel to keep our passion burning as we strive to deliver relevant news on UFOs\nand other bizarre stuff. The one hour talk show is in Pilipino catered to Filipinos anywhere\nreachable by FB Live, Monday to Friday. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease find on the right column how you can bring this project to fruition. Incentives/perks are offered. Corporate sponsorship is welcome. Ad placements are accepted.

     "about": "The UFO Society of the Philippines (UFOSP) is a non-profit organization recently formed to become the first membership-based, formal UFO organization in the Philippines. Its founding was inspired by a clamor for an organization or local group that would represent the deepening interest in this phenomenon by a growing number of Filipinos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne objective is to encourage Filipinos to freely express and share their thoughts with other level-minded people. Thus, the UFOSP  strives to provide a common ground  where everyone could discuss the UFO enigma openly without the social stigma.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are committed to raise the awareness of Filipinos by exploring together the meaning of this phenomena to our lives. Therefore we listen to diverse thoughts and philosophies, and traverse both spiritual and scientific approaches in our quest for answers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough the above, the UFOSP aspires to establish an outlook based on our homegrown understanding and belief, not by chiefly echoing foreign perspectives, because we seriously consider UFO-related matters not merely as a theory grounded on Area 51 but more importantly, as an issue that predates way and far back the time we were recognized in the annals as Filipinos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHenceforth, we reach out farther to others who share with us this tenet to join, explore and together, we could probably discover our true beginnings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe officers and members of the UFOSP are steadfast and firm in upholding the aforesaid tenet of the organization.",
