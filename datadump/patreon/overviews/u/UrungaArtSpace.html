    "summary": "We\u0027re on Patreon because we started something small that unexpectedly grew into something amazing. We had no idea that when we started that we would touch so many people, that we would start conversations about what it meant to be a community, and that we would make a little pocket of our town feel alive again. But let\u0027s back up...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUrunga, if you don\u0027t know it, is a sleepy Australian coastal town - the type that is almost forgotten now as similar places rush to build mcMansions. Urunga feels like the place where time slows down. It\u0027s not a pretentious place - it\u0027s a good place for families, and retirees. It sits at the mouth of a gorgeous river and it feels like a place on the outskirts. The locals call it a tourist town. On a Saturday night you could throw a rock down the main street and you wouldn\u0027t hit anyone... but you might hit a bunny rabbit. (In the carpark behind the main street, which is only 4 blocks long, live several tiny wild bunny rabbits, that once upon a time used to be pets.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout a year ago, they built a bypass around Urunga and now you have have to go there on purpose.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the bypass went in, some of the businesses closed. The shops stood empty. One such shop was bang in the centre of town - council owned, they had been renting it to some local butchers. It had huge fine windows and a good aspect. One day, it occurred to a local photographer, Gethin Cole, that it would be a fabulous place to hang up some photos, as a cheeky a sort of \u0027pop up\u0027 gallery. He asked the proper people and got a set of keys... and went in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan you see him standing there, in the space, looking around and thinking?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt would need quite a bit of work. And quite a bit of paint. And a few friends to make it work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo he stood there, and he pondered. And then he made some calls...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t even remember where we got the paint from, but we painted that space, and transformed it into a huge, dazzling area full of light. We had a big, empty room ....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow we needed to learn how to be a galley.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho did we know that might be a painter, a photographer, a ceramicist or a sculptor? We slowly got together a small crew of mostly local artists working across a vastly varied mediums, and we pulled together the exhibition. And as we did so, we realised that the challenges weren\u0027t just about logistics - that was kind of easy in the end. Our challenges turned out to be a bit different.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince we had started at the very outset with the idea of a sense of \u0027\u003cstrong\u003ewe\u003c/strong\u003e\u0027, we had to ask ourselves, what kind of art did we want to show? What kind of art is right for Urunga? If art is a conversations about ourselves - what kind of conversations did we want to have with each other and the greater Australian community? How could we keep a sense of \u003cstrong\u003ediversity and quality\u003c/strong\u003e at the heart of every show? How could we encourage new artists to join us every time?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd how do you judge art? What makes it into a show? What is \"good\"? So we formed a curator team - with changing members, and we set up voting structures and governance ideas and we talked about these ideas at length, with very different people. People came into the gallery we asked them - what energises you in here? When the people from the cafes next door came in, we asked them - what has meaning for you? When people came in on their lunch break or mums came in with their kids, or the taxi driver popped in because he was pulled up and waiting for his habitual customer, we talked about art. \u003cem\u003eAnd people talked to us.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe learned two surprising things about having a gallery. One is that when you talk to people about which piece in any particular show that moves them the most, the replies are never the same. Different people love different pieces - so when people visit us, at least one thing will usually delight them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe stuck to our core values from day one - \u003cstrong\u003ediversity,\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003equality\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ejoy\u003c/strong\u003e - and people loved it.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second thing that we learned about running a gallery is how to get along. The core group of artists driving every show were by no means a homogenous groups of people. We were very different. We were forced to talk to each other, to solve problems together and figure out how to make it work. And we did. We are a lovely bunch of weirdos, and we get things done.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the first year were able to show the work of more than \u003cstrong\u003e80 artists\u003c/strong\u003e over 6 shows. As the year rolled around, it almost seemed like we could actually pull this off... that what had started as a pop up gallery could actually be an art gallery run by artists to promote gorgeous new art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then... duh duh DUH. Major problem.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe were handed a huge challenge. The gallery was never about the money... but we had actually been making a bit of money from our low commission rate - proving to ourselves first, then the community at large, that this idea could work. But the council now wants more money for the space. So now we have to come up with a reasonable strategy to meet that expectation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe can do it. But we need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we find enough monthly patrons, we can supplement the small amount of income that we make already and we can keep the gallery open. We want to run some incredible programs, programs that will reach out into our community and our region and give people a chance to make art, to talk about art and to meet each other. We would really love to build some ambitions programs such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDedicated shows that support the emergence of new artists, indigenous youth, local primary school kids and seniors.\u003cbr\u003eAn artist lecture series - free sessions where a single artist will talk about their processes and inspirations\u003cbr\u003eArtist discussion panels - evenings where artists discuss big ideas and respond to audience questions\u003cbr\u003eMore evening art classes and intensive 3 day workshops eg. Watercolour workshops, Learning Lino-printing, etc.\u003cbr\u003eTrans-regional art shows and interactions with artists beyond this region - maybe even internationally!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can help us get there\u003c/strong\u003e - be part of this journey, from a small pop-up gallery, help this place turn into a long term sustainable arts hub that inspires creativity and \u003cstrong\u003ebrings a community together\u003c/strong\u003e. We\u00a0 will email you a thank you letter and several videos during the year thanking you personally - by name - for helping keeping a gallery alive, and for\u00a0supporting the emergence of new artists. Every dollar helps and we are a grateful bunch of people who don\u0027t forget the people that help us build something beautiful! We want to make something amazing here in the heart of an old butchers shop - we\u0027d really value your participation!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEvery dollar counts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s also a great investment in art. \u003c/strong\u003eAt the affordable tier of only $12 a month, you get the opportunity to choose a free print from our range, signed by the artist, after 12 months of patronage. So for about $144 - which you can claim as a tax deduction - you support the gallery and get an artwork. You\u0027ll be able to choose something from a range of works - something that speaks to you, a piece that if you were to buy it, would cost more than $144.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if that\u0027s not the tier that rights for you, we are grateful for any patronage you can give us - be sure to expect a thank you email and regular follow-ups!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
