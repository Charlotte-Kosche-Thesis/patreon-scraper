    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eUPDATE 6/19/17:\u003c/strong\u003e Ad revenue has fully returned, for my channel at least. I\u0027ve learned my lesson about relying solely on ad revenue and will keep this patreon going. Thanks for any moolah you can throw my way. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello! My name is Swayze and I make videos about vegan ethics and nutrition. I often get accused of being bad for veganism (or even being a \"fake\" vegan) because I frequently criticize fellow vegans for promoting pseudoscience (raw till 4, anyone?), dogmatic platitudes (\"meat is murder,\" \"use is abuse\"), and the like. It\u0027s a dirty job, but somebody\u0027s gotta do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also debunk anti-vegan rhetoric and touch on vegan moral dilemmas (Is medicine vegan? Is abortion vegan? That sort of thing). And I occasionally make \"what I ate today\" and recipe videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I would love to continue making money solely from youtube ad revenue, this is no longer feasible. Thanks to big advertisers leaving en masse and various changes on youtube\u0027s part (that no one really knows much about because it\u0027s youtube and they think keeping creators in the dark is a super swell idea), I\u0027m making 1/3-2/3 per view of what I was making prior to the \"adpocalypse\". So, not super sustainable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you like what I do and have a buck or two to spare, consider sending that sweet moola my way.* My family (including my nameless, genderless baby) would really appreciate it. That\u0027s a lie, though, since baby has no concept of youtube or patreon, let alone money. But I\u0027m sure when baby grows up, baby will be like \"Damn, those people who supported Mom on patreon all those years ago are so dope.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, wouldn\u0027t that be nice?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e-UV\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Or send it to an effective animal charity, like Mercy for Animals? As you can tell, I\u0027m really conflicted about this whole thing. I think what I do on youtube is important, but how important? Important enough to ask for monetary support? I hope so, but I really don\u0027t know. So if you\u0027re at all conflicted between giving the money to me or an effective animal charity, go with the latter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is some pitch, huh? \"Give me money, but don\u0027t, but actually maybe?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
