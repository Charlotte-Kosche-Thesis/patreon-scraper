Though I love what I do and am thankful for my position, it\u0027s taking up a significant amount of resources with time and overhead and am at the point of either getting a \"real\" job or monetizing the job that I already do and love. \u00a0That\u0027s where you come in!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027re currently enjoying four podcasts each month, the URP Daily News, and other content, nothing will change. \u00a0This Patreon page will allow you to support the work put into the site and to get a little something \u003cem\u003eextra\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve enjoyed the content for the past six years and have contributed before...\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ethank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e If you\u0027ve just now decided to support what I do, I couldn\u0027t be more thankful for your support. \u00a0Through this platform, I\u0027ll be able to release special content and spend additional time with the site that will be exclusive to Patrons...I\u0027m excited for this new chapter! \u00a0These funds will also allow me to travel to races, cover the action, and do local interview with interesting people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease, also let me know what type of spifs/rewards you\u0027d like to see on this page and I\u0027ll see if it makes sense.
