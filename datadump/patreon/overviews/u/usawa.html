    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eA statue of Lady Equality, also known as Usawa (the Swahili word for \"Equality\"), is envisioned overlooking Montgomery, Alabama \u2014 the city where Rosa Parks stood her ground. The Statue of Equality will have facial features of African Humanity, will be silver in color, and will be the exact same height as the copper Statue of Liberty. The Usawa sculptor will evoke the demeanor of a young Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks. She will have two wings. Her gesture will be at the moment of taking flight, with only a toe on the ground, with her eyes on the horizon, and her hands on her heart. Though of Black appearance, the Statue of Equality will be for all Americans (and even for all of humanity) \u2014 just as the Statue of Liberty, though of Caucasian appearance, represents America\u0027s and humanity\u0027s ideal of liberty for all. Lady Usawa represents the principle that all human beings are created equal. As such, \u003cem\u003ethe Statue of Equality is envisioned as the creation of the People. Specifically, as the\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0funding of the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty came from the People, their pennies,\u00a0nickels, dimes, quarters . . . , the funds for the Statue of Equality will be \"offered up\" the same way.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery.\" \u2014 John Prine\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe expectation is that, as the world came to Montgomery in the \u201960\u2019s, rallied behind its bus boycott and Civil Rights Movement \u2014 i.e. support flowed in from near and far \u2014 this \"mighty river\" of support waits to flow again on behalf of \u003cem\u003e\u201cliberty and justice/[\u003cstrong\u003eequality\u003c/strong\u003e] for all.\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e     Envision, friends, if you will, the \u003cem\u003eStatue of Liberty\u003c/em\u003e passing on, sharing her mighty flame with\u00a0\u003cem\u003eUsawa\u003c/em\u003e, her sister \u003cem\u003eStatue of Equality\u003c/em\u003e,\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ewith a gesture that can\u00a0kindle the light at the end of the tunnel, illumine the new dawn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThere are 4 stages in every great work:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFirst, it is impossible. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThen, it is difficult.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThen, it is committed to. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThen, it is done!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe one who has born the vision of Usawa:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginally from southern West Virginia, Travis Henry is a societal artist who lives and works in upstate New York.

He is a painter, an illustrator, a portraitist, a muralist, a sculptor and a poet, who has earned numerous commendations and awards.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRonald is known for his life-like pictorials intended to master the range of human emotion and capture the essence of the human spirit.

The black youth\u00a0would be invited to offer up the first round of funding for the creation of the\u003cem\u003e actual\u003c/em\u003e sculpture of\u00a0\u003cem\u003eUsawa\u003c/em\u003e, herself, the \u003cem\u003eStatue of Equality\u003c/em\u003e: pennies, nickels, dimes . . . . dollars. So that, in the years to come, after the students have stepped on into life, they could bring their children and grandchildren to visit the statue, sharing with them how they provided the initial round of funding. Such accounts, we trust, will inspire the coming generations to thus realize their own dreams. Once the initial round of funding is secured, Montgomery school children, representing all the races, would be invited to offer the second round of funding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStep 4:  \u003c/strong\u003eOn the basis of the first two rounds of actual financial support, the school children \u2014 in the hundreds/thousands \u2014 would request a meeting, as necessary, with whoever would be involved in granting the creation of such a statue: e.g. government officials, private parties who own the land. Apart from the actual merit of the project, such a show of support by the youth, our future would, we trust, inspire the officials and parties noted to bless the creation of the \u003cem\u003eStatue of Equality. \u003c/em\u003eIt is anticipated that the statue would draw a mounting stream of visitors to Montgomery from near and far.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStep 5:  \u003c/strong\u003eOnce the approval/blessing has been granted, the next round of support would be invited from school children throughout Alabama, the US, and world-wide. New Hampshire\u2019s leading gubernatorial candidate was enthused by the idea and is prepared to invite New Hampshire school children to lend a hand. The same applies to a growing number of fellow citizens across the country and overseas. As this process unfolds (not dissimilar from crowd-funding efforts such as kickstarter, gofundme, indiegogo), it can be expected that not only will adults lend a hand, but a drug dealer, moved deeply by the project, has already expressed interest in devoting funds from his \u201chabit\" toward such a promising vision of the future \u2014 \u003cem\u003eUsawa: The\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eStatue of Equality. \u003c/em\u003eThe point being: Who can imagine the life that such a labor of love will take on?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStep 6: \u003c/strong\u003eWe the People celebrate the erection of \u003cem\u003eUsawa:\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eStatue of Equality, \u003c/em\u003eand with the permission of the donors, dedicate the excess/surplus funds toward a third statue, \u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eStatue of Sister-and-Brotherhood (\"Fraternity\"),\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eon the west coast: from sea to shining sea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe invite you to join in the realization of this project, the erection of \u003cem\u003eThe Statue of Equality\u003c/em\u003e, with a contribution of any size: pennies, nickels, dimes and dollars, friends \u2014 as your \"fortunes\" allow.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e"
