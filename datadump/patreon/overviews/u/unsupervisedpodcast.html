She\u0027s also a dedicated mother of two girls while working a full-time day job on the technical side of the finance industry. That is -- until this podcast thing takes off and she starts making that phat podcast money! Cara is the glue that holds the show together-- if that glue was sexy, funny, and opinionated. Stephen, among other ventures, is the founder and president of Firetower Media, the production company behind the UnSupervised w/ Carlos \u0026amp; Kelly Podcast. Stephen spent his twenties and thirties in (and out) of the film and music industries creating characters for such brilliant cinematic fare as Bandwagon, My Fellow Americans, Cold War, Rendezvous, American Warships, and has appeared on the small screen in Unsolved Mysteries and others. His stage and touring resume includes more than two dozen musicals, plays, and rock-n-roll tours.\u00a0Together, they\u2019re not the podcasters you deserve, but they are the podcasters you need right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eWHAT IS the UnSUPERVISED w/ CARLOS \u0026amp; KELLY PODCAST? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eStephen describes the podcast. \u003cem\u003e\u201cIt\u2019s meant to be like when I was a kid, my family-- aunts, uncles, grandparents, and all-- would gather on the porch and sip coffee or adult beverages and just talk and laugh for hours. They talked about everything from news to gossip, told stories, told jokes, whatever. No one ever censored themselves and political correctness wasn\u2019t even a thing yet, so it was real. It was real talk. I felt like that has been lost to a degree so I wanted to create something that was kind of free-form. Our producer, Eric, has this insane library of old radio shows from the 30s and 40s. We were in the studio listening and this sort of B.S. session started, and I was like, \u2018Yeah. This is it.\u2019\u201d \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCara, Stephen, and Eric, gather to make podcast gold once a week from E. A.
