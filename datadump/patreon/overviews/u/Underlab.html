Er, unless you\u0027ve never been here before... in which case, welcome, sans the back part! I never get to say that part in my videos. I create all sorts of videos; admittedly, the vast majority of my content is related to Undertale, so if you\u0027re a fan of that, it\u0027s a huge plus! I like to create theories that speculate about insane possibilities and hidden stories in videogames, and recently I\u0027ve been branching into all sorts of exciting new stuff\u2014I\u0027d like to think there\u0027s something for everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NsQsHn2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI think the thumbnails I make for my videos are pretty cool!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never intended to set up a Patreon as I thought it would be greedy of me. I was earning less than your average supermarket cashier, though it was for doing something I rather enjoyed, could do from home and within my own time.\u00a0 However, post \"PewDiePieGate\", just about every creator on YouTube has found \ntheir revenue dropping significantly for basically no reason (advertisers are dropping out due to controversial content on YouTube, meaning those of us who create harmless entertainment are being harshly punished for no fault of our own), and I\u0027ve \nbeen hit too despite uploading probably some of the least offensive content \non the internet (surely that\u0027s award worthy?).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ES46N1V.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is one of my favourites... but not my favourite favourite!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI admit, I still feel greedy asking even now I don\u0027t have a choice. I don\u0027t live a luxurious lifestyle\u2014the exact opposite, actually. I\u0027m in a tiny apartment and I can\u0027t pretend every day is exactly sunshine and joy for me. Creating a modestly sized YouTube channel is one of my greatest achievements, as lame as that sounds, and I was pretty excited about the fact that I had a job that paid enough and allowed me enough time to practice important skills that could improve my life beyond measure. Now I\u0027m about to lose that because of something I was never a part of and never involved in; I merely had the misfortune of starting a channel in its relatively early days at the worst possible time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/h1YnMS0.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis one is my favourite favourite!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can donate to my Patreon, I\u0027ll be eternally grateful, and there\u0027s some fun little rewards available as you can see! It ensures I can continue to make videos\u2014without being able to recoup the money I\u0027m unfairly losing out on, I physically won\u0027t have the time to keep uploading new content as I\u0027ll have to make it by some other means.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/UfqjOSw.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis video was a lot of fun to make... a shame it didn\u0027t get as many views as some of my other uploads, lol. Oh, and I realise that\u0027s a human arm she\u0027s biting into, which wouldn\u0027t make her a cannibal. You\u0027ll just need to watch the video to understand why it says \u0027Cannibal Spider\u0027!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTL;DR: YouTube is being paid less by ad groups due to \u0027controversial content\u0027 on certain videos. This has had a chain effect on every other creator, even those of harmless entertainment including me, cutting our pay severely (the \u0027controversial\u0027 videos in question have \u003cstrong\u003eliterally\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003enothing to do with my content\u003c/strong\u003e). For a relatively small channel like mine, it means I can\u0027t continue to make videos\u2014I put 20+ hours into each and I just can\u0027t spare that time when I\u0027m not earning nearly as much as I used to. I\u0027m not a lazy person, so if I have no choice, I\u0027ll seek employment elsewhere. That will sadly be the end of my channel as maintaining a job while making the videos which require the effort I put in (well, most of them... I admit some are a little silly!) is physically impossible. Donating to this Patreon ensures my channel can keep going; it was flourishing before, but now I\u0027m being ruined thanks to something I was never involved in and never even scraped the surface of. You\u0027ll also win my undying gratitude and a few cool perks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
