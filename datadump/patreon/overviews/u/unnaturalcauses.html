I created my own illustrated stories starring myself and my classmates as super heroes and transforming robots and brilliant child detectives/mad scientists. I read voraciously from a young age and a great deal of what I read made its way into my early writing efforts, as did the antics that I and my cousins and our friends engaged in during the long summers and even longer school years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I got older, I branched out into new and different writing approaches. I discovered science fiction and fantasy and, for most of my high school career, I produced reams of original space opera, filling dozens of binders with loose leaf and hundreds of college ruled notebooks with my works. My \u003cem\u003ehandwritten\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0works, because I\u0027m assured that I\u0027m some sort of masochist and also because I didn\u0027t have access at home to a computer. I graduated college with degrees in English and Communications; from there, I progressed almost naturally into the realm of freelance writing -- more specifically, freelance writing for tabletop roleplaying games, producing both original game fiction in short story and novel lengths as well as sourcebooks. This was a particularly artistically nourishing time for me, as I developed a number of enduring relationships with my fellow writers, many of whom transitioned from game freelancing to the production and publishing of their own original works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m making that transition. I\u0027m still freelancing -- because food, clothing, shelter, and research materials are all important -- but I am also writing what I hope will be my first original work(s) for publication. My work, in general, leans in the direction of dark fantasy and horror with a generous sprinkling of Lovecraftiana and nice thick coating of Steampunk or Urban Fantasy depending on which version of the Unnatural Causes universe we\u0027re talking about. Any amount that you can donate will be greatly appreciated, especially since my writing is now basically my sole source of income, as I am caring for my disabled senior in-laws on a day-to-day basis, as well as my children and husband.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
