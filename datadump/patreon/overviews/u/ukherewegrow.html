Don\u0027t let the name fool you though, This is a community that is worldwide and we love it when people from all over the world join us and our community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past 24 months we have worked tirelessly to build our network and have had to take on 10 other like minded people to help admin everything.

We are thinking of new social competitions and contacting companies on your behalf in order to run them. Last year alone we gave away just under \u00a38,000 of products. While we do receive some adsense for making YouTube videos, this money doesnt come close to covering the website let alone everything else, all money we earn goes directly back into running our social network\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though I become very good at making videos on a low budget,\" having little to no money for replacing equipment and running the network ultimately creates significant creative limitations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy giving your support through Patreon, we can deliver on hundreds of creative ideas we\u0027ve been forced to forego due to high costs associated with things like locations, cinema-quality equipment. So, providing your support means you get to see more content of the highest quality, while we get the creative satisfaction of creating bigger and better videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen.\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re working on a TONNE of amazing projects for you guys and have over 150 different videos in mind that we want to film this year alone. We release at least one video a week and as many as three video\u0027s a week. By supporting us and becoming a patreon your ensuring that we can continue to get better, grow our network further putting more gardeners in touch with each other via our social network. Getting the advice out there for new growers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the tiers that you can support us on are on a monthly basis, not a per video. This way you pick an amount your happy to donate each month and get the benefits for that tier and know exactly that not a penny or cent more will be given.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really appreciate all the support you have shown me over the years and love interacting with your comments. As I start to gain Patreons I will eventually evolve the tiers to suit what you guys tell me you would like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support, and above all, thanks for watching!"
