Creating quality content for this game is not something I have to force myself to, I do enjoy the process. But even though its fun, it takes \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ea lot\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e of time. Time that I\u0027d otherwise spend on playing the game itself or working on other projects that pay the bills. By supporting me here on Patreon, you help me to free up more time to develop new features or write new guides for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://unknown.gg\"\u003eunknown.gg\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThe fact that I don\u0027t have access to the custom game feature makes researching ingame mechanics even more time consuming - getting my hands on a new, rare weapon for testing means countless suicide jumps into the military base, hoping for loot luck and a few minutes of undisturbed testing. Not the easiest thing with 99 people trying to kill you ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0027t you already have a lot of money from the ads?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately webads nowadays generate very little income - we\u0027re taking about 2$ per 1000 visitors, max. Take into account the high percentage of adblock users among gamers and the result is barely enough to pay for the hosting alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the benefits for Patreons?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs soon as the signup feature on the site is completed, every Patreon will get an ad free experience, of course. Higher tiers include supported shoutouts, custom research requests, cool badges, and maybe someday custom match invitations (if PU ever grants me access to the custom game feature).\u003cbr\u003eBut most importantly every single Patreon ensures that the site will grow in size and features, keeps the high quality standard and gets quickly updated after each patch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy PUBG?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve always been a fan of the battle royale genre, ever since the early Arma 3 days - but all games up until this point had mayor flaws: Either a little mod with no budget, a horrible engine or just publishers that don\u0027t care about the game (H1Z1/Sony, I\u0027m looking at you).\u003cbr\u003ePlayer Unknown\u0027s Battleground seems to be the first really promising game in this genre: Developed from the ground up, by gamers for gamers, fast content evolution, great communication from the developers and the mighty unreal engine to back it all up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
