    "summary": "Hi to all you wonderful, game developers.\u00a0 I am Frederik Koetje a game dev who has been creating interactive experiences since 2010 at the company I founded, \u003ca href=\"http://www.koloza.com\"\u003eKoloza LLC\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 I have recently switched my focus from releasing games to developing high-quality, in-depth Unity based 2D and 3D tutorials plus building a thriving community around this content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor my Patreons\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI aim to create awesome Unity Game \nDeveloping Tutorials (2D and 3D) and further enhance the content with my \npersonal experience related to hardware and platform choices, marketing,\n audio, outsourcing graphics, when to quit your job and go all in, \ncreating unique games vs copying, freemium VS paid and many other topics.  These tutorials\n are meant for absolute beginners as well as more advanced programmers. \n I plan to release at least one post per week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy format will follow a text-based post associated with a video post.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI generally will start a game project and make the code publicly available via my \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/unitygamedev2\"\u003eGitHub repository.\u003c/a\u003e  You can use the code as you wish and even deploy to iOS, Android, or PC as is.\u00a0 I don\u0027t place any copyright on my code, but please watch out for any assets I might have purchased from the \u003ca href=\"https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/\"\u003eUnity Asset Store\u003c/a\u003e as my rights on those don\u0027t transfer to other parties.\u00a0 Tutorials will be released alongside the code and will be atomic in nature so you should be able for instance to jump into a Menu UI tutorial and get value without needing to go through a \"setting up Unity\" tutorial.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to save you time and present content in a unique way so you can focus on the most important part, developing polished, fun, creative, engaging games that you hopefully can also make a living from so you can be a very happy person:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe live in exciting times where you and your laptop can take on the world and influence people\u0027s lives with a unique experience.\u00a0 How amazing is that?\u00a0 All those ideas in your head just waiting to come out...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Credentials\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have had some decent success with my Unity 3D game \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/animal-rampage-3d-simulator-crazy-frenzy-insane-ridiculous/id864212349?mt=8\"\u003eAnimal Rampage\u003c/a\u003e bringing in a healthy $1000 per month at times and have had over 250,000 downloads across all my games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also hold a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Road to Unity\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started out the hard way, developing natively for iOS in \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C\"\u003eObjective-C\u003c/a\u003e using \u003ca href=\"http://cocos2d.org/\"\u003eCocos2d\u003c/a\u003e and other frameworks.\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smart-kid-abc-lite-abcs-and-spelling-for-preschoolers/id440740323?mt=8\"\u003eSmart Kid ABC\u003c/a\u003e was my very first game / app and I originally created it so my daughter could teach herself the ABC\u0027s without me needing to sound them out.\u00a0 I actually received the coveted \u003cem\u003eNew and Noteworthy\u003c/em\u003e mention from Apple for my very first game and that gave me some confidence that I was doing something right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love anything related to flying so the next project was a flying 2D game for me. \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/minesweep-jet-hero/id599003458?mt=8\"\u003eMinesweep Jet Hero\u003c/a\u003e took a year to develop with the Cocos2d platform.\u00a0 I created my own game engine alongside many levels and got a free resource for an awesome sound track.\u00a0 I am still the most proud of that game, but I made no money from it.\u00a0 That happens a lot in the gaming world so I advise setting up a mental framework of why you are entering this practice and being realistic so your heart does not get broken if things don\u0027t go your way.\u00a0 That being said, I have a dream that one of my Patreons would create an awesome game that makes millions of dollars alongside movies and merchandise like what happened with \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LxGtUWxv0o\"\u003eMortal Kombat\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSu2PaPfX6U\"\u003eAngry Birds\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 Nothing will make me more proud:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to port Minesweep Jet Hero to Android, but it looked like it would take me another 6 months to a year to do that since I would have to rewrite everything from scratch on the Android platform.\u00a0 I did some research and discovered how you could create a game once in Unity and port it to 17 different platforms like iOS, Android, Arcade, Xbox, Playstation, etc.\u00a0 That sounded super awesome so I decided to give Unity a try on a new game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI developed a brand new 3D game (\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/animal-rampage-3d-simulator-crazy-frenzy-insane-ridiculous/id864212349?mt=8\"\u003eAnimal Rampage\u003c/a\u003e) while learning Unity in 4 months!\u00a0 I could not believe how easy it was to develop games in Unity VS native iOS / Android coding.\u00a0 I became a Unity believer and evangelist of that platform.\u00a0 When I first released Animal Rampage I was getting around 2000 downloads a day.\u00a0 It was crazy exciting.\u00a0 Things have settled down a bit now, but I am still generating revenue 2 years later while not working much on the game! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also released a 2D Unity game called \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/endless-ninja-drop/id1062900394?mt=8\"\u003eEndless Ninja Drop\u003c/a\u003e to try my hand at 2D in Unity.\u00a0 I actually find that 3D is easier than 2D in Unity, but both perspectives can be achieved with relative ease on the Unity platform. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan

href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64\"\u003eCommodore 64\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDW613LrDWU\"\u003e25 Cent Arcades\u003c/a\u003e and IBM computers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy initial memory of a game was \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXqzap1BzTA\"\u003eFrogger\u003c/a\u003e on Commodore 64 when I was 6 years old.\u00a0 You had to load those games from a magnetic tape drive and that could take hours.\u00a0 Sometimes something went wrong and you had to start all over...the anticipation was a killer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first game that blew my socks off was the arcade version of \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW7r2w8SsN0\"\u003eMortal Kombat I\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 I love good graphics and this was the new kid on the block with realistic looking characters and insane action.\u00a0 I spent all my pocket money for months on that game.\u00a0 I could not get enough.\u00a0 It sucked me into a new world where reality faded away and you could be a martial arts God.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis was the first time I dreamed of becoming a game developer...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy first programming experience\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAround the age of 11 I discovered you could program the Commodore 64\u00a0 in \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_BASIC\"\u003eBASIC\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 I coded basic sounds and text graphics.\u00a0 I think I felt a little bit like an artist, being able to produce those tiny experiences. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe teenage years\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGirls!!!\u00a0 Pretty much no coding here. Sorry brain:(\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecoming a game developer at an older age\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am an entrepreneur at heart and have tried many ventures from buying and selling used cars (ugly business), building and selling PC\u0027s, developing custom web sites, blogging, composing and selling my songs on iTunes and developing custom web apps.\u00a0 I remember always getting bored with all those ventures. It was hard to stick with anything...that was until I finally took that step to develop my first game.\u00a0 I was hooked.\u00a0 I could use my programming, graphics, audio, marketing and business experience all towards one gaming project.\u00a0 If I got bored working on graphics, I could turn to audio and so on.\u00a0 I can keep going from one aspect of game development to the next while working on a project.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo at the ripe age of 32 years old I officially became a professional indie game developer.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am 39 years old now and still loving it:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon, Now?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI often felt rushed to quickly finish a game and make it a commercial success.\u00a0 This mindset made me skip important steps like making for instance the AI for a bunny the best it possibly could be.\u00a0 I want to get back to the creative process and focus on learning and doing things the right way.\u00a0 I can then share this experience back to the community to hopefully enhance the game creation process and help you be successful, however you define your success.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Since I got my first Comodore 64 in another time galaxy, I\u2019ve wanted to be a game developer. \u00a0Twenty Nine years later I finally did it, woohoo! \u00a0I started my game company Koloza and coded in my spare time at home and when taking the train to work. I did all this while also being a husband and taking care of two wonderful kids. I mainly build for iOS iPhones and iPads \u00a0 I started out the hard way developing 2D games using native Objective C and Cocos2D and has since moved on to the much easier to use Unity 3D. I have over 200000 downloads of my apps and games so far, most of them coming from my game Animal Rampage. I have tried to walk away from game dev due to the many hours you have to put in but I keep coming back for more pain...I meant pleasure.\u00a0",
