I have enjoyed and received such great feedback from classes I teach, I decided to create dance workout videos anyone can join online! These videos are a great way to make exercise fun and take you out of your comfort zone. I am putting up 1 video a week, so 4 videos a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach video takes a couple hours to create with filming, editing, uploading, etc. \u00a0I absolutely love making them and would love help to be able to take more time out of my schedule and post videos on a consistent basis."

My goal is to use my continual growth of understanding of  how the human body  works and how to utilize motion and nutrition to allow people reach their fitness goals and get the most out of their body as possible. As a motivator and role model, I have a unique connection with my audience that comes from my own personal journey towards wellness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have struggled with weight loss and athletic injuries in the past, which led me down a road of education and hard work to change his life. Having the drive to always be the best at what I do, physical and mental optimization is the path I have taken and want to share with the world.\u003cbr\u003eI have been involved in fitness the past 15 years. My journey has been unorthodox to say the least. My athletic journey began as a baseball player in Fresno, CA and made a transition to professional dancer in Los Angeles, CA in my early 20\u2019s.  From there, I danced in Los Angeles for six years making appearances on TV shows, commercials, music videos, and live performances. Due to a fractured vertebra my dance career was cut short which further motivated me to share his knowledge in the fitness world.\u003cbr\u003e",
