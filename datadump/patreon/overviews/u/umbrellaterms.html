Now!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAlright! I\u0027m a trans Xicana (She/Her), and I like video games! My favorite genres are point and click adventure games, first person shooters, platformers, and RPGS! I have played video games from a young age and have always tried to play as many as I could get my grubby hands on. I also develop games as a hobby, but outside of a game jam game, they\u0027ve never been released. Maybe I\u0027ll make more? Who knows? You\u0027ll hear about it if I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I even pay you for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGood question! *Ruffles through index cards* I... make videos! What I receive from this Patreon helps me continue to create videos. Right now they are focused on video games, whether that is a review, analysis, Story Deep Dives, or discussing the video game industry! I look at each game through the lens I believe best represents it! Here are a few examples:\u003cbr\u003eStory Deep Dive:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I-w4OOH_AnY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReview:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1bQUP8CBkU\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideo Game Industry:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ZstIJhKXd0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs that all you do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor right now. I plan on branching out and making content in various other forms, but as of right now, I want to make my video game content the best it can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf I do not subscribe to your Patreon, will I miss out on content?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou will not miss out on any content if you do not become a patron. This is only for those that have the financial means and want to support me. I used to have a tier, but decided to remove it as I realized it would fracture my viewership between payers and non-payers. I want everyone to be able to enjoy my content equally! (If you want more of my thoughts on this watch the video below, around 8:15 is when I specifically talk about Patreon)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ti6LMu-h-s\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I can\u0027t keep typing forever, so I must be going! Thanks for visiting this page and thanks again if you decide to pledge, it really helps me out.\u003cbr\u003e"
