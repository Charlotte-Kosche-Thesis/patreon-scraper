    "summary": "Hello and Woof! \u003cbr\u003eMy, do you look stunning today. (I\u0027m not just saying that to suck up. Your skin looks amazing\u2014have you been eating avocado?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Amy and I\u0027m a crazy dog lady. Wait! Don\u0027t go. I want to tell you about what I do. I publish \u003cem\u003eUnleash Jacksonville\u003c/em\u003e, a free, full color, beautiful indie magazine distributed all over Jacksonville, Fla. We also have a digital issue, Facebook page, Instagram, Woof\u0027s Happening (mostly weekly) loveletter, and a \u003ca href=\"http://www.unleashjax.com\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e anyone in the world can enjoy. Unleash promotes animal welfare (primarily dogs), a positive attitude, humor, community, small business, and shopping local\u2014did I mention all for FREE? Unleash gives the Jacksonville dog community a voice\u2014and it\u0027s pretty pretty to look at! I get to use my photography, writing, and being-funny skillzies\u2014all in one place\u2014for good. (I\u0027m so sick of using my photography for evil\u2014very clich\u00e9.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt often surprises people to learn I\u0027ve been growing this magazine for over three years by myself (for the most part\u2014I\u0027ve had a few awesome people sell some ads). But from concept to design to marketing to distribution, it\u0027s been me\u2014all while working another job and being a single mama to the greatest kid on planet Earth, and \u003cem\u003epossibly\u003c/em\u003e Mars (competition is pretty stiff there, though). Believe it or not, editor George doesn\u0027t even write his own column! Shesh! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m proud of what I\u0027ve built so far and am beyond ready to go all in and focus on expanding this goodness ... but I won\u0027t sell out. I refuse to take \"bad-mojo\" money. The environment, health, and karma are top priorities. I won\u0027t accept advertisers that aren\u0027t in line with what \u003cem\u003eUnleash\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://unleashjax.com/purpose\"\u003estands for; what I stand for\u003c/a\u003e\u2014integrity can be hard to come by these days. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, the actual printing of the magazine eats up most of the \nadvertising revenue. I\u0027m going to be totally honest ... I don\u0027t enjoy selling \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e it takes a lot of time, which I always seem to run out of doing all the other stuff. I feel like people are being sold to \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e day long, and I prefer when people see the value in what I do and want to be a part of something good that can benefit them and our community. I\u0027d like to be able to keep connecting our \ncommunity, but I can\u0027t do that if I have to sell my computer and camera \nto pay for crack. That was a joke. I meant groceries. GROCERIES. Drugs \nare very bad, kids.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you love Unleash?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, you have the opportunity to be part of \u003cem\u003eUnleash\u003c/em\u003e and the forward momentum I\u0027m growing! As a patron, you can receive rewards from good karma, to a sexy \u003cem\u003eUnleash\u003c/em\u003e car sticker for your sexy car, to having each issue hand delivered to you by your cute mailman. We look forward to expanding our rewards as we grow. I \u003cem\u003ecould\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003epossibly\u003c/em\u003e do it without you, but I don\u0027t want to! I happen to love you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGetting Unleash mailed directly to you is very exclusive! We don\u0027t offer a subscription, so currently, this is the only way to get it! Oooo lala!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin in the production of \u003cem\u003eUnleash Jacksonville\u003c/em\u003e (the magazine \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e the exciting new website!) and all the GOOD we can do together educating people who don\u0027t yet know how awesome it is to adopt a pet; that fostering has AMAZING rewards; that adopting a senior dog who was dumped at the shelter fills your heart like nothing else. And, that a dog is truly family and you shouldn\u0027t dump her in the \u003cem\u003efirst\u003c/em\u003e place. It starts with educating people. You can help! For reals. I\u0027ll let you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for being here. Thank you for reading, and oh! Keep eating those avocados. You\u0027re absolutely glowing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS - Our digital, clickable issue can always be found \u003ca href=\"https://issuu.com/unleashjax\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.
