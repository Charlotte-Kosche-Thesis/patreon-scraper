    "summary": "Patreon is an amazing site that allows you to donate on an ongoing basis rather than one lump sum, like a subscription. These contributions keep us running and allow us to continue Uncommon Futures. As a thank you for your subscriptions and donations, we have a list of rewards on the side of the page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUncommon Futures is a publication made up of real-life stories, profiles, sketches, and poems. We enjoy covering the everyday, the fantastic, and the just plain interesting, and we would love nothing more than you submitting your own story, poem, or anything in-between!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy?\u003cbr\u003e\u201cEach random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own\u2014populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness\u2014an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you\u2019ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.\" \u003cbr\u003e(\"Sonder.\" The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow do I submit my story?\u003cbr\u003eWe have few guidelines and are open to ideas!\u003cbr\u003eSend everything to UncommonFutures@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Uncommon Futures?\u003cbr\u003ePhilosophically, while we may have similar ideas, comparable hometowns, and common traits, we all have unique pasts, individual presents, and ultimately, Uncommon Futures. Objectively, Chris had a dream and woke up with the words spinning in his head. He has liked the name \u201cUncommon Futures\u201d ever since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreator/Editor: Christopher Leiden\u003cbr\u003eAssistant Editor: Sean Morrison\u003cbr\u003eLayout Designer: Hannah Leiden\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA note on rewards:\u003cbr\u003eIf you are interested in buying multiple copies of a specific issue or a specific back issue only, that is also an option. You simply have to email us at UncommonFutures@gmail.com and we will make it happen. While our issues are often available at cost at the time of their publication, we are relying on your generosity here to keep us moving financially and fund our ideas, art, and 3D glasses!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we highly recommend using Patreon, if you are uncomfortable paying in an on-going fashion, you can donate a singular sum via Paypal.
