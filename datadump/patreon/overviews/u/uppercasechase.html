Even if you aren\u0027t/don\u0027t become a patron, I just want to say thank you and also that you matter (and don\u0027t forget to stay hydrated) hehe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHey! My name is Chase Ross, I\u2019m 27, and I\u2019m a YouTuber. I\u2019ve been making videos since I was 15 and I haven\u2019t stopped since. YouTube provided a great platform to express myself and talk about my life. Other than YouTube, I am associated with many different projects (which I talk about further down), I\u2019m a recent graduate (Masters in Sociology), cat lover, and a runner (when my knee isn\u0027t in pain). The biggest reason why this page is important to me is because many (over 150) of my videos have been age-restricted and/or demonetized. This means that making a living off of YouTube is no longer feasible. With your help, I am able to keep doing what I love to do best! Help people!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I Do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name channel,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/uppercasechase1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003euppercaseCHASE1\u003c/a\u003e is all about expressing myself, giving advice, and making people feel included within the community. This all started with me documenting my transition from female to male by discussing testosterone changes and surgeries. Now my channel is more about helping people and discussing topics that affect the community directly and indirectly. I talk a lot about society (as I am doing my masters in sociology.. I need to use it somehow! haha!), I have a new series on Sexual Health where I discuss STIs, Genital Health, and Review toys and prosthetics all focused on and for other trans men. These videos are very scarce in this community and I am so happy to be able to spread the knowledge I have. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do MONTHLY binder giveaways with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.gc2b.co\"\u003eGC2B\u003c/a\u003e. Every month I give away 30 binders to those in need. 20 of those are donated from the company, 10 I pay for myself. I have a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youcaring.com/chasegiveaways-818022\"\u003edonation page\u003c/a\u003e set up for anyone who\u0027d like to sponsor a binder! Look out for the video on the first of each month for more information!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLike I said above, I am also a recently graduated student\u00a0at Concordia University in Montreal, QC. My thesis was on: trans men, identity, and tattoos.

We talk about trans related things, but also don\u2019t take it too seriously. We like having conversations about different topics and bringing it to our viewers every week. This is also a video podcast as well, which contain captions in order to make it accessible to as many people as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/ftmtranstastic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFTMtranstastic\u003c/a\u003e - The most popular FTM collab channel on YouTube. As the only remaining founder of this channel, I have posted more than 300 videos on this channel in the last 6.5 years. I\u2019ve never missed a week (even when I was in Poland with no internet!) and I actively engage with members and the community. FTMtranstastic goes to the Philly Trans Health Conference every year in order to spread awareness, sell T-Shirts, and meet our fans!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp5jt9w7K3Q\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTrans Enough\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e- This project started in 2012 when I made a video about how no matter what anyone tells you, if you know you\u2019re trans, then you\u2019re trans. I then got 20+ submissions from people explaining why they have felt not trans enough in the past and put it all together. This project was such a success that I have decided to reboot it. In one month I got over 200+ submission. Therefore, this project will be ongoing and it will become a series with different parts. This will be out in July 2016!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/ftmrunners/?ref=group_browse_new\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFTM Runners\u003c/a\u003e - This group was started by myself and the person who inspired me to start running. We realized that a lot of trans men wanted to start running after seeing my progress so we decided to make a group. This group, now with other 500 members, attends races together, have meetups, and supports each other online every day!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://ftmsextalk.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFTM Sex Talk\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e- This blog was started by me and a really good friend of mine. We help give advice on sex related questions, topics, toys, and anything really. We have gotten so many questions over the last 2 years that It\u2019s hard to keep up! We\u2019ve even had to add extra admins! This just shows how much this community wants and needs this information, and we are glad we can help in any way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nFuture of My Channel\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs you can see, there are a lot of projects here. The goal of my channel is to grow it even more. I don\u2019t want to be \u201cfamous\u201d, I just want people to have access to the information I never had when I was younger and starting to transition. I\u2019d like to hold more live streams and build on these projects. I love that this consumes my life because It\u2019s the thing that makes me happiest. I love helping people online and I would love to help them more offline as well. I\u2019ve travelled to schools in the United States and Europe to talk to them about my life and experiences and this is something I would love to continue doing. I would also love to continue doing research outside of academia in order for everyone in the community to have access to it and be able to understand it!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nHow You Can Help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs you can see, my life is very busy, juggling work, making and posting at least 4 videos a week,\u00a0travelling to schools, and all these projects. I am asking you to support me in helping me continue to make these educational videos! Note: I will always be on YouTube and give advice for free, I am simply doing this because I need help financially in order to reduce the amount of stress, and increase the amount of sleep I get!
