    "summary": "In 2014 a confrontation occurred between a police officer and a civilian that resulted in the death of a young black man and the birth of a new era in the American civil rights movement. Ferguson, Missouri became a household name across the globe, forcing America to face her bitter factions. Today many \u00a0are wrestling with complex questions, intense frustrations, and deep woundings. As race related conflicts have intensified across the nation, the best and the worst of Ferguson is a reflection of almost every American community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile various narratives are only serving to deepen the divide, Meet Me in Ferguson is a web based video series aiming to help elevate the national conversation on race and injustice within faith communities that consider themselves members of the body of Christ. Through candid interviews with the people of Ferguson and the St.Louis area; we\u0027ll discover some of the historical, spiritual, cultural, political, and sociological realities that have prevented America from moving into a place of true racial reconciliation. Furthermore, through a biblical worldview, our show will lend spiritual perspective, understanding,and application to help people of every hue and persuasion find God and each other in the midst of the crises.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cb style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eVIEW THE TRAILER\u003c/b\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/144433268\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e Our journey into Ferguson began with a local, regional, and national christian response to Ferguson in September 2014 through an extensive ministry expression called The Ferguson Response (\u003cem\u003ethefergusonresponse.com\u003c/em\u003e). For the past year, we\u0027ve been significantly engaging cities such as Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, and St.Louis with the ministry of reconciliation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of our ultimate goals would be to continue the conversations with a studio audience on a regular basis in a Ferguson based studio office that also serves as a community healing/reconciliation center.\u003cbr\u003eThrough your patronage, we\u0027ll be able to devote 100% of our time to developing original content and building towards releasing new video episodes on a weekly basis."
