    "summary": "I\u0027m really pleased with the way that Utopian Horizons has steadily been growing and reaching new people, but that audience is still relatively small. Because of that, I\u0027m relying on the support of those of you who think what I\u0027m doing is worthwhile to help me to keep doing this and continue to make it grow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as the hosting costs for the podcast, I have to invest a lot of time into making each episode: reading books, researching and taking notes, finding guests and arranging interviews, doing the interviews, editing the show, and so on. Because I work as a freelancer, this often means spending time that could be spent earning money on the podcast. I plan to keep doing that for now, because I enjoy it, but it is tough, so if you could sling a bit of cash my way for the work I put in, that would make a massive difference in terms of making this sustainable and allowing me to keep doing it. Long term, I\u0027d like to be able to spend more time on the podcast and release episodes more regularly and I\u0027m hoping this Patreon will allow me to do that (have a look at the Goals section for more detail).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTell Me What You Want\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not planning on locking anything off at the moment. Every episode will still be free for anyone who wants to listen to it. However, I\u0027d like to be able to offer you something in return for supporting me. In order to do that, I need to know what you want. Please, if you have any ideas for stuff you\u0027d like in return for your Patreon contribution -- being able\u00a0choose a subject for a future episode, exclusive access to extra episodes (I should have done that with my PKD ones), or a certain number of episodes per year, for example -- get in touch and let me know. I\u0027m open to this changing and evolving based on what you want, so tell me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
