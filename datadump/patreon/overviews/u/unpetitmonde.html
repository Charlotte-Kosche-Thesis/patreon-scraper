    "summary": "Hi folks!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMost of you probably know about us and our Un Petit Monde photo project. But for those of you who are new to our art, here is the short story: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne early summer evening in 2010 Edwige was gardening and I was shooting macro photographs of insects and flowers. Edwige dug up a Junebug and asked if I\u2019d like to photograph it. She also suggested that I place a miniature figure next to it, so I did. The rest is history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI left out a lot of the details but the most important thing that happened that summer evening is that my creativity got a boost of adrenaline and Edwige got behind me 100% to pursue our new endeavor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the first couple of years I mostly shot the miniatures around the Twin Cities metro area and we would travel to far away lands (other U.S. states) maybe once or twice a year, whatever our budget would allow. During this time we self-published a book of fine art photography, contributed my work to a children\u2019s book, published post cards and sold limited edition prints on the art fair circuit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013 we decided to leave our apartment and hit the road full-time. The idea was to focus our energy on documenting beautiful and historic locations across the United States using my unique style of photography. Since then, we have been commissioned to do works for commercial and private interests, partnered with a developer to produce an application for smart watches (Android Wear) and have sold prints to people in more than 10 different countries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the benefit of our project and because of our love for the environment, Edwige and I have become full-time volunteers for State and National Parks across the country. This has allowed Un Petit Monde to grow in ways we never imagined! Although we have the dream of eventually slowing down and opening a small gallery, we\u2019re still focused on traveling the globe, volunteering our time and continuing our mission of documenting the world in our own unique way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron you will help us achieve our goals for Un Petit Monde. Of course, becoming a patron is totally optional, some of you have already supported us in ways that money never could! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you and best wishes,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKurt \u0026amp; Edwige\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWebsite - \u003ca href=\"http://www.unpetitmonde.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUn Petit Monde (A Small World)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eARE CURRENCIES OTHER THAN U.S. DOLLARS ACCEPTED?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes.
