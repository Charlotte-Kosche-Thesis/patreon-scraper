The main purpose of this Patreon is to support all things Blackjack, an ongoing novel series about a villain with a heart of coal. It will be updated twice a month. I also write other stories in the same style and with similar inspiration. We plan to bring these stories to you on an ongoing basis. In addition to all the fun rewards, we also intend to run a lecture series show called How to write Unreliably, which will have its online video debut very soon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePersonal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMarried, with a kid and a dog (the fish all died). I spent half my life on a different career path and never expected any of Blackjack\u2019s success. I now spend my days thinking of new ways to torture and maim him. 2018 marks a new step in my writing career, as I move the Blackjack series from a hobby to a full-time, professional endeavor.\u003cbr\u003eMy wife is an attorney and the inspiration for Apogee \u2013 I can show you the scars. My kiddo is an amazing 13 year-old that\u2019s already better at this than I am. At least I\u2019m leaving the world a better place.\u003cbr\u003eThe dog is a Maltese, and before you start criticizing the co-creator of a badass villain like Blackjack for having a \u201cwimpy\u201d dog, I\u2019ll tell you that this little white ball of fur is mean like nobody\u2019s business. His name is Dexter, after the main character in the TV series \u2013 and it couldn\u2019t be more apropos. Don\u2019t mess with Dexter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJosh\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProfessional\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a writer with a day job. I work in a hospital as a respiratory therapist to earn money. I give people aerosol treatments. I also manage endotracheal tubes, for those times when a machine has to do the breathing for the patient, as well as tracheostomies, where an incision is made along your trachea, and a tube is inserted that replaces your mouth and nose as the breathing apparatus. I suction lots and lots of boogers out of different orifices in the upper airway. What it boils down to is that I help people breathe, and as rewarding as that job can be, my real passion is writing. I\u2019ve worked a lot of jobs at a lot of places, I\u2019ve been a classroom teacher (8th grade Language Arts) and seen enough of the retail wars to be scarred in places you can\u2019t see. Writing stories, creating cool characters that you love, that\u2019s where it\u2019s at for me. My goal is to make enough money to support my family, while producing awesome content for you.\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePersonal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a girlfriend and two daughters. And a mom. And a sister. I am the only male human in my immediate familial orbit. My turtle is a dude, but he is salty as all hell. The daughters are both teenagers. Every day is an adventure. I love gaming. Tabletop, minis, cards, console, PC, it doesn\u2019t matter. Unreliable Narrators will eventually be a platform where I explore the things I am passionate about. Family, writing, gaming are the tops on my list. I\u2019ve been told I use more foul language than the next three people I know. Entire podcast projects have been abandoned on the strength of my ability to weave curse words into otherwise perfectly respectable sentences.",
