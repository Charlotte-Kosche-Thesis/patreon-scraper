    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003ePlease note: I only ask for small pledges.\u003c/strong\u003e I simply want to give my fans and friends a means towards supporting me while being rewarded with exclusive content.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/ssi/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI am disabled and living off of SSI\u003c/a\u003e, which has kept me from continuing my art education and pursuing any professional or personal projects or supporting myself financially. Because I am on SSI, I cannot make more than $65/month without it becoming a detriment to my disability income even though I only get $700 a month to live off of, so that is why I am asking for such low pledges. I do offer a small handful of larger pledges, but they are limited and available first come first serve. Thanks for your understanding!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHi, I\u0027m known as Uglylilmonster! \u003c/strong\u003eMy given name is \u003cstrong\u003eVictoria\u003c/strong\u003e, but you can call me \u003cstrong\u003eVirgo.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027m an artist with a love of beauty, nature, femininity, and horror. Previously I was attending the Rocky Mountain College of art and design, but I developed severe fibromyalgia that has left me (literally) crippled and has kept me living a rather simple life. While I can no longer afford to support myself as an artist, I know I have fans who would love seeing my work AND support me too. That\u0027s where Patreon comes in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting my Patreon you are financially supporting a disabled artist and survivor of trauma who lives in poverty. Any money made from Patreon will go towards things that will make my life a little nicer (video games, books, items that make my life a little easier disability-wise, etc). Any contribution is an appreciated kindness that definitely impacts my life in a meaningful way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return for your support, patrons will have access to a high-quality .PNG gallery of all of my work, un-watermarked and (usually) at its full size. Some art (such as art created for personal use) will only be posted here in its entirety! I also post art here before anywhere else, so you\u0027ll see it here first! From time to time I will also sell character designs and YCHs here in a first-come first-serve manner.\u003cbr\u003eHigher patron rewards come with access to private streams, private recordings of my art process, redlining help with your own artwork, and free sketches. I also tend to post tons of WIP, abandoned art, and throwback art from my teen years.\u003cbr\u003e"
