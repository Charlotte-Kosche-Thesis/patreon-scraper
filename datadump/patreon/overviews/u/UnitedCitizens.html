As a result, Mark Zuckerberg has agreed to testify before US Congress, and\u00a0to investigate and list publicly any other violations of our data by other third parties. We won!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut there is still a lot of work to do: We have now been told that 30 million more Facebook users\u0027 data was misused in the Cambridge Analytica case, in addition to the 50 million originally thought to be affected. Mark Zuckerberg is yet to personally respond to our petition and has refused to appear in front of UK Parliament.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what, though, I have been inspired by the decision made by over 175,000 people to take a stand against one of the most powerful companies in the world. Energised by their actions, I want to continue this campaign of holding technology companies to account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoing forward, it has become clear to me that there is a gap that needs be filled: An organisation that represents our interests and holds powerful technology companies accountable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat is why I\u0027m raising money to fund the development of a union of citizens that holds technology companies to account.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we are able to raise the necessary funds, this union of citizens would aim to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnderstand what citizens around the world believe are the major issues we need to collectively respond to in the digital age;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDevelop citizens\u0027 knowledge and skills to empower them to take impactful action for real world change;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWork with governments, businesses, and civil society to bring about the change we want to see in the world, and;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBuild a world where technology leads to progress for us all, leaving nobody behind.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eWill you donate to this cause and be a founding patron of a union of citizens that holds technology companies to account?
