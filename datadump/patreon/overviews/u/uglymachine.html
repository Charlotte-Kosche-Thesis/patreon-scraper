    "summary": "Hi! My name is EMiSpicer and I\u0027m trying to make it as a full-time photographer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/eIbTmb6.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve spent the past five and a half years active in both music and video game communities in New York City, which has led to me traveling all over the world. While my original focus was in music, I stumbled into some Babycastles events back in 2010 which in turn brought me to the games community. At first I didn\u0027t have a clear plan for existing in that space, I just brought my camera with me to practice and hopefully become a better photographer. But as time went on I fell in love with the community and began calling myself a video game culture photographer. I still do music photography too, especially for the chiptune community, but I think I\u0027m best known for my work in games. Since that time I\u0027ve done a ton of work that I\u0027m really proud of, taking a lot of very recognizable photos at events all over the world. My goal is to beautifully prove that these strange and amazing events happened as well as try to show others what it felt like to be there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/MOO51iy.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the most part, everything I\u0027ve accomplished has been at my own personal expense. Most of the money for travel, attendance, and sometimes lodging has come out of my own pocket at a loss for me. In recent years I\u0027ve been able to have some of those expenses covered by either client money or the blog I work for but that usually happens at little to no personal profit. As a result I\u0027ve had to balance my photography work with a day job to make sure I can pay my bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter spending two years struggling to balance photography and shitty part-time jobs, I hit my limited. I\u0027m at a point in my photography career where I can no longer afford to lose my time to something that isn\u0027t my work. Traditional employment has stopped being a realistic option for me and I\u0027m ready to do whatever it takes to make it on my art alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/IDUIahc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in! After relaunching my Patreon last year, I\u0027ve been able to accomplish so much thanks to your help. The money I\u0027ve gained here has made it possible to travel to events I never would have been able to make it to before, and I don\u0027t want that to stop. Your support is crucial to the work I do, and I only want to do more. I want my Patreon to continue to be a place that facilitates me doing \"more better,\" a goofy phrase I use to talk about how I want to keep pushing my own limits of quality and simultaneously increasing my output. I\u0027ve experimented with ways to make that worth your effort, and I\u0027m excited to finally have the time to share all those projects with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you believe in me, my work, or if you\u0027ve ever asked me \"Hey, when are those photos going to be published?\" please consider supporting me. I want to be able to share the beautiful things I\u0027ve experienced with you. I\u0027d really love it if you can help make that possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/AiUUKQl.jpg\"\u003e"
