    "summary": "For those of you who don\u0027t know me, my name is Isaac. I go by the handle of UnderMybrella in most communities, and I\u0027m responsible for a few big projects, such as \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/UnderMybrella/Spiral\"\u003eSPIRAL\u003c/a\u003e (A modding framework for the \u003cem\u003eDanganronpa\u003c/em\u003e series), the \u003ca href=\"https://eternal.abimon.org/\"\u003eEternal Jukebox\u003c/a\u003e (A rehosting of the Infinite Jukebox to work with Spotify), and a few smaller projects and libraries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, these projects require both a considerable amount of time to work on, as well as a fair bit of money to host, collectively. The total collective cost for projects comes down to around $70 per month, which in the interest of transparency can be broken down as follows:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEternal Jukebox VM - $17\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJenkins VM (To build projects, saves CPU and memory usage on other VMs) - $17\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCloud Storage Download - $16.1\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCloud Storage - $8.71\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCloud SQL (To offload SQL storage to another server, in the event of another VM failing or relocation) - $8.68\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u00a0Bandwidth - $3.86\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAdditionally, an analytics VM is set up for another $17, however that is funded personally and is an optional cost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, I am funding all of these personally, which I was prepared to do. However, due to personal situations that possibility is running slim. I fully intend to keep these services alive for as long as possible, and the best way to do that is with community help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will note - at no point, short of catastrophic circumstances which I will attempt to note prior, will standard features ever be locked behind a paywall. These projects started out free and I intend to keep them that way for as long as feasibly possible. If worst comes to worst, bandwidth or resource intensive activities may be limited, but as long as possible they will remain as they are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll patrons will get a special role on the SPIRAL server and the Eternal Jukebox server, which is a separated orange role that grants access to a private channel category. In addition, if you connect your Patreon account, you\u0027ll get a badge on your profile in the Eternal Jukebox.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that\u0027s a lot to read, but thank you for reading, and an extra thank you if you pledge. Every little bit counts, and it\u0027s greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e"
