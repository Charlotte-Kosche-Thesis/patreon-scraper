    "summary": "First off let me say a massive thank you to all of our supporters over the last year or more. The server wouldn\u0027t be the great place that it is today without your support. Not just those that have donated in the past, but also those that have helped others and regularly get involved in activities and events. You are all RaMarcable to me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s get down to it...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve had an Xbox One Ark: Survival Evolved server running since February 2016. Initially it was ran on a second hand launch Xbox One console, then we got a few donations and upgraded to a brand new console. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring this time using of a console as a host machine we\u0027ve had a load of file corruptions and problems with game saves, which has been frustrating to everyone involved. There was no way to back up a save to roll back if there were any issues... until now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn October 2017 Wildcard (the developers of Ark) are released the ability to rent PC servers from hosting providers, Nitrado. So finally we gott the back up system we\u0027ve longed for all this time, it opened up so many options for the server and the events we can run.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously this isn\u0027t free and the bigger the server gets the more it\u0027ll cost. So we\u0027ve set this up for those that want to regularly donate towards the running costs. As an example a single server for 50 people costs \u00a350 per month (including fees), and can run to \u00a390 for a 100 person server. Hosting on PC also allow us to host cross-server, multiple maps that are linked and you can transfer between them as much as you like, but this obviously doubles the cost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a popular server and active community with many long term users, and I know many want to help towards the cost of running the server. We\u0027ve set up this Patreon to enable those that want to, to be able to directly support what we\u0027re doing. In return we\u0027ve set up some in-game rewards as a thank you for supporting.\u00a0In-game items will be provided as soon as possible after the 1st of every month, after your donation has been received. If you would like items sooner you can check out the website for details of how you can make an instant,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ukarkserver.com/viewtopic.php?f=2\u0026amp;t=3\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eone time donation via PayPal\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again, and for all your help.
