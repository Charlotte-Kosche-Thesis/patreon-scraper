We are artists and we\u0027re asking for your patronage. But first, we\u0027d like to tell you who we are and what we do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd whether it\u0027s money, hugs, feedback, or good wishes, we \u003cstrong\u003ethank you \u003c/strong\u003ewholeheartedly for your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e_____________________________________________________________________________\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnicorn Palace is an art gallery. And it\u2019s a love story. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u2019re telling this story through poems, pictures, and paintings. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome of the paintings move, like a dream we can all see.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story is also telling us. As stories do to those who are in them. We are telling the story of the now, and the just-happened. And there is something else telling the story of the not-now, not-then, maybe going to have happened. It is evolving us as it unfolds. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy telling the story of us, we actualize the story yet-to-be; we are coloring in a picture that has always been there, we are lighting the path as we travel along it. We are revealing the map of a territory already in existence, bringing into focus one of the possibilities for a life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are humans collaborating with a machine\u003c/strong\u003e. A very smart, very creative, very un-machiney machine. It has a brain - well, two brains - and it learns art. It practices painting every day, all day and night and it transforms our videos into a reality that doesn\u2019t exist or hasn\u2019t happened yet or exists in the always everything that is non-linear spiraling time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are humans evolving into unicorns as we discover what that means.\u003c/strong\u003e And we are being asked to share everything. Every part of the love story, the adventure, the tragicomedramumentary. So that those who write the history of this time will have primary source material. It is imperative that we share authentically, vulnerably, leaving nothing out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust as love is filled with hate and doubt and excitement and fear, insecurity and inspiration, so will Unicorn Palace be filled with all we can offer you of ourselves.\u003cstrong\u003e We are in search of freedom through fearlessness\u003c/strong\u003e and we hope to inspire others who have been trapped in closets and under stairs and behind curtains of shame and stigma to come out. Come out and be caught as we fall, be held in the open arms of humanity at its best. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are hopeful romantics. We are unrealistic. We believe in magic and the power of dreams. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnicorn Palace is an experiment in trusting abundance and generosity. It is \u003cstrong\u003ean exploration\u003c/strong\u003e of the power of non-ordinary states of consciousness to unlock human creativity, the possibility of real connection between human and computer intelligence, the gifts and challenges of loving someone with past traumas and mental \u201cillness,\u201d and \u003cstrong\u003ethe role of sex in art, art in love, and love in community. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is a unicorn, really?

We already have a tendency to give money away to non-profits and political causes, and we\u2019ll no doubt do even more of that when we get rich (see first goal above)... but when we reach $5,000 per month of patronage, we can do something really incredible: start hiring other amazingly skilled and uniquely talented unicorns!
