    "summary": "Hi. I make compilations of game soundtracks, that were not released officially. By saying that I mean, that I\u0027m not just post pure music files from the game archives, but I try to do the music to sound as it would if it would have been released. Mostly the released soundtrack albums do not contain all the music that was written for the game, so people who want to listen to it all have to extract the rest of the music from the game files, but in most cases these files are not complete music pieces, but short samples, separate short loops, and even separate layers of instruments, that even can\u0027t be called a proper music. So I try to connect all these parts of music into complete finished tracks in a way, these tracks sound in the game during the gameplay. Often this requires a full playthrough of the game just to listen to all the music and how it plays in the game, all the samples from the game files then should be sorted for the planned tracks, then the tracks become full compositions. Also often the game audio files have a lot of trash sounds, like clicks, noises and hisses, that you won\u0027t hear during the gameplay, but will deffinitely hear when you just listen to the music, so I get rid of all this as well, so the tracks would sound as nice as I\u0027m able to do. All this work requires a lot of effort and time, sometimes I spend weeks and months to finish some of the compilations. That is why you won\u0027t find too many compilations on my channel, unfortunately I have not enough time even to make soundtracks, I wan\u0027t to do for a long time already. But if you\u0027re interested in and like the work, I managed to do till this moment (and will do further) and would like to support me, then you\u0027re welcome, it will be a pleasure for me and I will appreciate it a lot! And maybe I will have an opportunity to buy the games, I want to make a complete soundtrack for, much earlier with your help, who knows!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really gratefull to all of you for being subsribers on this channel, it really shows me, that this whole thing I do is in demand. Each and every one of you helped me get all these soundtracks known to more and more people and because of your help more people can listen to the music I post here, or find the music they may be searching. Your support with views and subscriptions is really important and much appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the Youtube channel people have to find the download links to the compilations they\u0027re interested in, so the vids would have more views and get more popular to appear in Youtube\u0027s offering lists. I know it is very annoying, but I had to make this decision (youtubers, who don\u0027t provide any download links, don\u0027t have such problems at all on their channels, right?). But surely the patrons here will have the access to links they need, without all the \"search for the link in the playlist\" bullshit.\u003cbr\u003e"
