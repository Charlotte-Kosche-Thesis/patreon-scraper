UltraChenTV is comprised of\nseveral different live and uploaded shows, all intended to help\nspread the love of fighting games. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEach Tuesday night\nis the Tuesday Show, the FGC\u0027s biggest, most popular week-in-review\nlive stream. We cover tournament results, game news and updates,\nupcoming events, issues in the FGC and the larger video game\nindustry, and more. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe also spend some\nMonday nights, and occasionally other nights, helping players improve\ntheir gameplay. First Attack is geared toward helping fighting game\nnewcomers learn the ropes. Lv3 Focus is more for teaching\nintermediate and advanced level players through analysis of high\nlevel match play. In addition, both shows help introduce newly\nreleased fighting games with detailed game engine guides and\ncharacter information.\u00a0On top of that, we\nturn those live streams into YouTube videos and Soundcloud/iTunes\npodcasts.\u00a0And on top of even\nthat, we occasionally stream or upload videos of ourselves playing\ngames, testing things in training mode, doing combo videos, and so\non. There\u0027s so much to do!\u003cbr\u003eKnow that your\ncontributions will go first and foremost to making our shows better.\nAll the money we\u0027ve ever earned has gone into either reinvesting or\npaying taxes. We intend to continue improving things as much as we\ncan!\u003cbr\u003e"
