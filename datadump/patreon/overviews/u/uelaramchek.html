I\u0027m at the mercy of the post office, and while most undelivered mail eventually finds its way back to me, given the sheer volume of envelopes I\u0027m sending each month, one or two are bound to end up lost in the Super-Sargasso Sea. If that looks like it\u0027s happened to or is currently happening to you, let me know, and I\u0027ll help in any way I can. I want to make sure that the Cryptofiction program is an excellent experience for everyone who chooses to participate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce per month, I write one short work of fiction \u003cem\u003ein secret\u003c/em\u003e. Those who have subscribed by midnight (PST) on the first of that month receive a physical copy of that piece mailed to their address, personally signed by me, and marked with the number of official copies submitted into circulation. This is the one and only time that this story will ever be available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not on the list when the time comes, you\u0027ll miss the opportunity to receive that month\u0027s cryptofiction \u003cstrong\u003eforever\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorks of fiction produced in this manner will \u003cstrong\u003enever\u003c/strong\u003e again be printed by me, or legally published in any capacity \u003cstrong\u003euntil after my death\u003c/strong\u003e. While I cannot prevent the possibility of posthumous publication of these tales, I condemn it, and anyone who does so risks the curse of my phantom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe following restrictions apply:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e1. No more than one-thousand people will be allowed to subscribe at any given time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Official copies destroyed or lost by their recipients will not be replaced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Official copies lost in transit will be replaced, and marked as reprints.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. I reserve the right to terminate the subscription of anyone who plagiarizes my work or produces facsimiles without my authorization. If you feel that you have a legitimate reason to generate a copy, please contact me first to avoid the possibility of termination.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI do not foresee the last of these restrictions needing to be enforced any time soon, as I trust that anyone willing to invest in cryptofiction is interested in their copies being personal. Regardless, there will be occasional steganographic measures employed as a precaution.\u00a0Those who have received the official copies are welcome to do whatever they wish with them, whether that be to hide them in a vault, to share them with their family, or even to burn them after reading.\u003cbr\u003e"
