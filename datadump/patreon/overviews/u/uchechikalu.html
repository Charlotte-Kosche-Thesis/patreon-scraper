Thank you for being interested enough to show up and land on my Patreon page. I\u0027m really glad you\u0027re here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePLEASE CHECK OUT THE VIDEO\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a poet and entrepreneur and I love language. I love its power to heal, to consume our hearts, to \nengage the questions that keep us awake at night and to give us a sense \nof belonging. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here. I want us all to feel like we belong.\n And the best way I can do that is via the written and spoken word.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m\n an award-nominated poet and I\u0027m lucky to have been published, and read my work on stages across the US (and a few global stages). I\u0027m obsessed with the power of language, and I \nexplore that via poetry and non fiction writing (blogging, stories, \netc).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few important things you should know:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e-I will be creating (and sharing) work with you once a month.\u00a0 If I do not create, you do not get charged.\u003cbr\u003e-You can cancel your subscription at anytime.\u003cbr\u003e-This is subscription, and not a donation. Patreon allows you to sign up for a paid subscription, which goes towards supporting the creativity of artists you want to support. This is an exchange. You pay a subscription, and I give you access to a stream of poetry content that I am creating on a monthly basis.\u003cbr\u003e-You can subscribe for as little as $1, and each subscription tier comes with special perks. Check them out before subscribing.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Backstory: How I Got Here\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt 13, I got up and read my first poem at summer camp.  To be honest, I \ndid it because I had to come up with something for talent night and I \ndid not sing, could not play an instrument in a band or bend my body in \nunique and interesting ways. After reading my poem, the audience of \nteenagers stood up for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Do you realize how difficult it is to get the\n attention of hormonal young folks enough for them to even clap? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI knew I\n was onto something. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u003c/strong\u003e had never felt like this before. Performing made \nme feel like I was part of something bigger. I felt like maybe I had \nfound my purpose at a young age. I was one of the lucky ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Want To Write Poetry For You\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create powerful experiences with an audience both on and offline. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best way for me to do this is to have a Patreon profile. Over the last few years, I\u0027ve had to turn the dial down on poetry and turn it way up with tech entrepreneurship. Tech has been more sustainable lately, and I\u0027ve put my attention there.  I\u0027ve also had friends and strangers come up to me after a reading and say \"you must keep doing this\" and \"how can I help you do this?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to use poetry to sustain us during difficult times\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Everybody\u2019s hurt.

I\u0027ve watched the global devastation happening, and I want to add my voice to creating a new narrative. There\u0027s a lot of hate going around, and language has always been my strongest weapon. I want to help us all feel less alone on this journey. And I hope we can get there together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to do this, I need to make sure this work is sustainable. I want to write full time. I want to bring my work to the digital stage and help us all find a way to move forward during divisive times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you know my work, subscribing might be an easy decision for you. If you don\u0027t know me, I understand if you feel hesitant.\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eI can\u0027t guarantee you will like everything I create, but I can tell you that I am writing from the heart.
