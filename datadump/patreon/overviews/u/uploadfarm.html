It\u0027s great to see our work is so useful to such a fantastic community!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUntil now we have had to cover all the server costs/domain registration ourselves, so we\u0027ve decided to see if users are interested in helping us with this on Patreon. We also have some ideas for developing the site further which become more viable if the site is able to sustain itself financially!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy don\u0027t you use advertising?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly? We tried. However, because there isn\u0027t a lot of written content on the site, big ad networks rejected our applications. We toyed with using less reputable advertisers, but ended up only with intrusive clickbait adverts, which we \u003cem\u003eimmediately \u003c/em\u003edecided against (ugh). In the end, the only advertising we managed was a link-swap with \u003cstrong\u003eChucklefish\u003c/strong\u003e, the publisher of \u003cstrong\u003eStardew Valley\u003c/strong\u003e, which appears on the front page of our site, and for which we\u0027re not paid.\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe want to keep the site free for everyone to use, but decided it was only fair to offer our patrons something extra. By supporting us, you\u0027ll get access to the\u00a0(currently Windows-only)\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0auto-uploader tool\u003c/strong\u003e.
