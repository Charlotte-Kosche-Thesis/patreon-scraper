    "summary": "Ugly Door Music Studio has one goal: better the local music community. We\u0027re using this podcast to showcase the great things our local artists are doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery Monday at 10am a new episode gets released. Each episode covers the artists\u0027 background, recent works, influences, and goals. We always play a round of \"Top 5\" covering all sorts of topics, and there are live performances!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerformances are filmed using a few GoPro cameras which are then edited and added to the Ugly Door YouTube channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking the show doesn\u0027t cost me much now that the initial investment is already made. I\u0027m using thousands of dollars in microphones, mixers, software, etc to make everything sound as good as possible. But it is time consuming. It takes me a few hours to edit, bounce, and upload the audio followed by a few more hours to load, edit, export, and upload the video. Not to mention the monthly fees for hosting the files though Podbean and the cost of upgrading the audio and video gear in the future as the show grows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I\u0027ll be able to better set aside time at the studio to dedicate to this show. As the support grows, so will the gear I use to make it. This includes upgrades in the microphones, preamps, lighting (my lighting is so bad right now!), and even cameras. I\u0027ll also be able to advertise better and get the listenership up which in turn will create better exposure for the bands who appear on the show and make it all possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your consideration, and go support your local scene!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...or at least go listen to the show: podcast.uglydoor.com\u003cbr\u003e...or watch the videos: video.uglydoor.com"
