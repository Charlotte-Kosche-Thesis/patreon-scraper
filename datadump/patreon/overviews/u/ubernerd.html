    "summary": "I\u0027m a single parent, an IT systems professional and a gamer who wants to be a stay at home father and teacher to his daughter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my early years, it became apparent that I was a very nerdy child. I would take a jar of red ants and jar of black ants and tape them together to see how they would react to each other... instead of just reveling in the carnage, I would take notes and study their interactions. Later on.. as personal computers became a thing, my father bought a Commodore Vic 20 for the family which I quickly ended up re-programming the games and other software that came with it to suit my own needs. Needless to say, I got in trouble and was grounded for a week. When none of my family could figure out how to re-program the Vic 20 to work again the way it did before I messed with it... my dad made me fix it. After that, I was allowed once again to play with the Vic 20 having promised to NOT rewrite the programs... then... we got a Commodore 64 and it started all over.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward around 7 years. I was living in Colorado and had just purchased my first ever real IBM PC Clone... a 386 dx with 4MB of RAM, a 3.5\" floppy disk drive and a 30MB HDD. My first ever game was Wing Commander and my second ever game was Alone in the Dark. At first, I only played a couple times a month. But once I moved to Taiwan in early 1996, everything changed. I purchased my first ever high end computer... a Pentium with 256MB of RAM, a 1GB HDD and a\u00a03dfx Voodoo1 graphics card... top of the line back in 1996. Then I got some games. First, I got Duke Nuke \u0027em, then Quake, then Diablo (curse the man who made this dreaded time sink) and then some older games like WIng Commander Privateer and Myst and I was hooked on gaming for ever. In 1997, Carmageddon came out and I had a blast running down cows and innocent old ladies while my guy made funny faces in the camera. I was hooked. The games kept coming with Baldur\u0027s Gate, Halflife, Warcraft, StarCraft, Fallout and Fallout 2, Falcon 4.0 and Decent: Freespace. In 1999, I discovered the MMORPG. I had heard about Meridian59, but never played it... I looked around and found a new name. EverQuest! Well at that point, I was hooked. I started playing EQ1 and no less than a year later, got deeply involved in the Star Wars Galaxies forums and even was invited to the early Beta testing of SWG with 100 other lucky testers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout the years, I\u0027ve grown in my gaming love... but to me... the MMO has been the most fun followed by the space sim. With Star Citizen, I am getting both and with the fidelity the developers are giving us, I am certain I will be playing this game for years to come.\u003cbr\u003e"
