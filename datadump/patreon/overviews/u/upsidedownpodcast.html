Each month, we pay fees for hosting the podcast, website, and domain, and we invest money into producing the podcast, developing our online platforms, and planning potential future listener gatherings. \u003cem\u003eNone of us have ever been paid for the work we do for the podcast, and paying for everything necessary to keep it going is beginning to take its toll on our families.\u003c/em\u003e #keepingitreal\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe could choose to run ads on the podcast to pay the bills but have decided against it.
