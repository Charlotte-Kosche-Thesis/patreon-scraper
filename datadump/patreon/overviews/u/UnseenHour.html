The podcast is released every fortnight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Unseen Hour is a absurd horror-comedy fiction in which three actors perform nine roles, with live sound effects. PLUS guest performers contributing five minute monologues and live music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCosts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur basic costs for each episodes are props. As we\u0027ve set up the show we have started to acquire various things that make different noises. Some of them are single use, like cabbages. Some of them are trusty friends, like the bell. Some of them are hand made by James Carney, like the door box, and hopefully soon a wind-box. Those latter ones are largely made from scrap wood, but with a few extra bit bought for them. These costs are almost covered by box office sales already.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter props are taken care of, we\u0027d like to pay our performers and contributors. Everyone involved in the show is a professional working in this difficult industry and trying to make ends meet. Currently, we buy everyone a drink after the show to say thank you, but we would like to pay them properly for their contributions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we can give each of the performers a little something for their time and effort, we plan to go on and cover the cost of our website. We consider that a set-up cost, and therefore less important than paying the performers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter that, we\u0027d like to put some money into marketing and we\u0027d love to have our own audio equipment to record the show. That may be a while off, but it\u0027s what we dream of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePerks\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe don\u0027t have much to offer by way of perks yet. We hope to start doing some merchandise before long, and when we do, there will be a discount. We\u0027ll be putting up the scripts soon, if that\u0027s of interest, and maybe we\u0027ll think of something else as well, but currently all our effort is going into making the show. We have nothing more. If you have ideas, let us know! Get us on twitter, facebook, or email us.\u003cbr\u003e"
