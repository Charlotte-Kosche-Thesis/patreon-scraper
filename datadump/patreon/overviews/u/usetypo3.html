    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eHi. My name is Daniel Goerz. I am a web-developer from Berlin, Germany and most of the time I\u00a0am working with the open source CMS \u003ca href=\"http://typo3.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTYPO3\u003c/a\u003e. I like learning things as well as sharing my knowledge and so from time to time I write a blog post and publish it at \u003ca href=\"https://usetypo3.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eusetypo3.com\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho is usetypo3.com for?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://usetypo3.com\"\u003eusetypo3.com\u003c/a\u003e is a Blog for everyone working with TYPO3 CMS. It may target developers more than others but I think (and got the feedback) that it is helpful for a wide variety of people. If you work with TYPO3 on a daily basis and use this powerful CMS in a professional environment you are most likely to find at least one helpful information on my blog. And that is what the blog is for. It is a part of the TYPO3 community and as such it is dedicated to the claim \"TYPO3 - Inspiring people to share\".\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I need support?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI do not \u003cem\u003eneed\u003c/em\u003e financial support in a sense that I cannot continue blogging without it. The blog posts will keep coming whether I find some Patreons or not. However, the server and domain(s) are costing money each month (resp. year) and of course writing takes time. And that is what I would use any donated money for. Paying for the infrastructure and compensating a little bit for the time effort. Maybe it could even lead to more frequent posts in the future. Who knows?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDisclaimer: Because I do not have a \"publishing schedule\", there could be months \nwithout a post and then there can be two posts published close to each \nother. That being said, I try to keep existing articles up to date and \nadd new sources if they fit and edit the posts as things change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is in it for you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOn patreon most of the time some kind of \"reward\" is granted for any supporter level. I thought about offering \"rewards\" as well but as of now, I do not offer anything but the good feeling to\u00a0 support a blog that is part of the TYPO3 Community. If any patreon has a suggestion for a \"reward\", please let me know. I thought about the placement of logos and names like Marcus does over at \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/typo3worx\"\u003ehis patreon\u003c/a\u003e but I am not really a fan of that at the moment (this does not mean I dont recommend his work - go there and check it out. It\u0027s great!). While this might change in the future, I want to start this with not making any promises, keep everything as is and just offer the opportunity to support the blog. And then we see how that goes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, whoever decides to support \u003ca href=\"https://usetypo3.com\"\u003eusetypo3.com\u003c/a\u003e: Thank you very much. I hope the blog posts are of some help to you. Please contact me if you find any mistakes or if you have a suggestion for a topic.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
