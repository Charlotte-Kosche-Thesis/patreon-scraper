How? Glad you asked. To start, we\u0027re dedicated to sharing knowledge and key insights from the best and brightest minds in the fields of strength training, functional fitness, wellness and nutrition. They are breaking the rules and forging paths that we could follow. We like to call them the pioneers and renegades of the fitness, strength, wellness and entrepreneurial worlds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the over-abundance of success stories in these fields, the focus, and subject of many other interviews/podcasts is on those who have figuratively \"made it\". But how about catching people as they grow, learning from the mistakes they are making now, and the successes that move them to new heights! We strongly believe that is much more relatable to others who want to step out on their own and improve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur home base is our website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.unchartedperformance.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.unchartedperformance.com\u003c/a\u003e, but you can subscribe and listen to our podcast on both iTunes at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/uncharteditunes\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebit.ly/uncharteditunes\u003c/a\u003e and Stitcher at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/unchartedstitcher\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebit.ly/unchartedstitcher\u003c/a\u003e or you can even watch the guests on our YouTube channel,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/subscribeuncharted\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebit.ly/subscribeuncharted\u003c/a\u003e. Oh, the possibilities!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started out having no idea where this would take us or how it would turn out, but the journey has been priceless thus far and we will continue without hesitation. We\u0027re still growing, changing, and figuring out what it\u0027s going to be in the end, and we invite you to get on this wild ride with us.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy the show, we hope you\u0027ll join our Patreon community.\u00a0Our intention is to be a first class education resource, grow with our guests and our community, and consequently give back. We are making a commitment to donate 10% of all pledges to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.abetterchance.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eA Better Chance\u003c/a\u003e.
