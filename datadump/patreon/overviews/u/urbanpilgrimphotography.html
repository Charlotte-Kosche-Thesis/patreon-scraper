Through photography, I want to capture an instant in time that reveals the enormously rich experience of the human heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am based in Santa Rosa, CA. I shoot primarily live music photography, but for the past year I have been exploring the Catholic liturgy as a subject matter. Like live music, the liturgy has a certain form and\u00a0mise en sc\u00e8ne. Similarly, concert-goers, including myself, have likened their concert experience to a religious experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve shown my work in several galleries and exhibit in the North Bay and most recently at the international art show\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.pancakesandbooze.com/\"\u003ePancakes \u0026amp; Booze\u003c/a\u003e in Oakland. I\u0027ve won blue ribbon at the Sonoma County Fair and am an honorable mention at the Third Annual Pro-Life Women\u0027s Conference, which will be held in Missouri next month. Publications featuring my work range from web to print.\u00a0To see where my photography has been published, please visit \u003ca href=\"http://urbanpilgrimphotography.com/cv\"\u003eurbanpilgrimphotography.com/\u003c/a\u003ecv.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I continue to develop my music photography, I hope to develop my own style of liturgical photography and bring this subject matter into the art realm.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
