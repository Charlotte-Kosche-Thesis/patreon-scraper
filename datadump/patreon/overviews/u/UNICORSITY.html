    "summary": "Hello there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Namio, or Ghost of Crux, so far the only person who makes up UNICORSITY. I make visual novels, typically alone, and have been doing so steadily earlier in 2017. Currently, I\u0027m aiming for the release of my main project\u0027s, To Weave a Thread, polished demo to be released by August this year. With your support, I can focus on working to make it something not only I am passionate about, but something \u003cstrong\u003eyou \u003c/strong\u003ecan love as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig15.deviantart.net/7d1a/f/2017/065/3/8/banner2_by_namikazeh4-db1e58q.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do I Get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eStarting from the lowest tier, you\u0027ll get early access to all updates and reports on my projects! This will most probably also include concept arts and maybe even snippets of the script. \u00a0I will also be doing livestreams of art assets, hopefully at least once every two months, and will open alpha access to patrons at times I most likely will not publicly open them. And this will be no strings attached-- you don\u0027t need to give feedback! The rewards will be adjusted as time goes on, due to real life constrictions, but if you have any perk you think I should add, let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a full time college student with a condensed program, I can\u0027t truly reduce my real life workload to do more on the project. However, having support means that I can stress less about certain things and perhaps even delegate some of the assets that take me a very long time to make, such as backgrounds. Hopefully, this will also mean more visual novels in less time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your consideration and I hope that these visual novels will be as enjoyable to you as it was for me to create!\u003cbr\u003e"
