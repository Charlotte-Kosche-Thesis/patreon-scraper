    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy creating fetish comics and pin-up scenes. Common themes are large breasts, breast expansion, bimbofication, and other general transformations. Occasionally I create scenes involving gigantism, bellies, or muscles. They\u0027re all usually involving the female form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese themes are heavily integrated in various pin ups and sequences (which make up a majority of my patreon).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah but why a Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI enjoy creating comics, but it takes awhile for me to finish one and put it up for you to purchase and read. This patreon will allow you to see comics as they\u0027re created and give you an opportunity to influence the flow (if you want). For this, you can expect atleast one page per month. Not all comics I create will end up for sale and not all will end up publicly released.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor erotic pin-ups and sequences, you can expect these at a faster pace than comics and being the bulk of my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many comics are you currently working on?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of August 2017, I\u0027m working on a total of 7. Most are in the writing/layout process, but right now there are 3 that are in the rendering process and are actively posted here monthly! Here\u0027s some small synapsis that go into themes/fetishes without giving to much story away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(151, 72, 6);\"\u003eCurrently being rendered comics as of Feb. 2018\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://patreon.unnamedart.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/5th-year-sign-copy.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5th year\u003c/u\u003e features a long storyline set in a sci-fi universe with breast expansion leading to immobility. 20-30 Pages\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://patreon.unnamedart.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wrong-medicine.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWrong Medicine\u003c/u\u003e features a medium length story with slow bimbofication. 10-20 pages\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://patreon.unnamedart.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-cow-sign.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe Cow\u003c/u\u003e features a short length story of a woman rapidly becoming a human cow. 5 -10 pages\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Posting frequency can I expect from you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAtleast One page for each comic currently being made. Pin-ups are done at a higher frequency at about 2-3 per week and can either be a standalone image (usually with patreon only variant), a set of images, or a sequential transformation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHowever\u003c/em\u003e, as monthly pledges grow, so to will my posting. My ideal goal is to do 1-2 pages \u003cem\u003ea week\u003c/em\u003e. I would like to eventually get to doing 6-8 pages a month.\u00a0 For pin-ups, I\u0027d like to eventually transition to releasing them at one a day. This isn\u0027t an overnight goal, but something I intend to keep working towards. I can only achieve this with your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the difference with the work you display already?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell for one, the works posted here will be more adult orientated than elsewhere. I want to reward those who are actively supporting and encouraging the work that I do. After 30 days, the base image of a pin-up is posted elsewhere. The nude variant and any extras will remain patreon only. When you join, you will also receive a link to a website containing an archive of all my pin-ups to this point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Pages that are 3+ months old will be pulled. Upgrade to the Comic Catch-up to get any missing pages from current comics in-production. Pin-ups will always remain on this patreon.\u003cbr\u003e"
