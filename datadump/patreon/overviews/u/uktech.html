I\u0027m taking you up on the offer as part of the show\u0027s 2017 development plan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you\u0027re able to help, you\u0027ll get a whole new way to enjoy TECH\u0027S MESSAGE in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to keep offering a \u003cstrong\u003efree podcast \u003c/strong\u003eeach week, but also start offering \u003cstrong\u003eextended\u003c/strong\u003e, more personal version of those episodes as well as \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive written columns\u003c/strong\u003e that I\u0027d write directly to your inboxes each week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePLEASE NOTE: Your pledges are per weekly episode, not a one-off single payment or donation. You\u0027ll be billed at the start of each month for the four (or five, depending on the month) main episodes but NOT for any additional Patreon-exclusive episodes. For example, if you pledge $2, that\u0027s about $8 in total per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLonger-term, I\u0027d like to produce more frequent releases, special one-off programmes, live broadcasts, community-only discussion shows, and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I physically can\u0027t do this without the show generating some income. In its current form,\u00a0TECH\u0027S MESSAGE already takes anywhere between \u003cstrong\u003e10 and 20 hours per week\u003c/strong\u003e to produce (which includes everything I handle myself, from story research and pre-writes, to recording and hosting, to post-production, editing and re-edits, and finally to publication and promotion). That\u0027s on top of my full-time job as a journalist and editor.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCollectively, you could help make the difference to how the show is shaped, developed and expanded.\u00a0I made a promise that even supporting show at the very lowest level available here will get you something -- the exclusive extended cut of every episode, plus emailed columns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0from the very deepest part of my aortic pump in advance for any help you can extend to me, the show and your fellow listeners. I look forward to making even more podcasts for you in future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Nate Lanxon (and Robin the cat, if you watched the video).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTECH\u0027S MESSAGE\u003c/strong\u003e is a weekly technology news and discussion show from London-based technology journalists Nate Lanxon -- that\u0027s me! -- and Ian Morris.\u003c/em\u003e"
