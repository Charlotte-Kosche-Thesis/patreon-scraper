When Arahli The Geek and I teamed up to start an Ark server and a Discord we hoped people would come and they have. Our community has grown beyond our wildest dreams, and to better reflect the value of becoming a patron, slow the rapid growth, and provide more honest rewards for our supporters we are making the first major changes to the support tiers since our launch!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou do not have to become a patron you gain access to our community of passionate, geeky builders, you can jump into the public\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/HbrRS2C\"\u003eDiscord\u003c/a\u003e immediately! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo not become a Patron for access to me or the opportunity to play Ark with us, become a Patron to join a community of like minded fans and supporters and gain access to our network of stable PvE Ark servers with their friendly, welcoming, building focused vibe.

Help me take the next one!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron you can gain access to \u003cem\u003emore content, cool benefits, and more ways to interact with the community\u003c/em\u003e. Arahli and I treat each other\u0027s patrons as our own, our communities of supporters are completely integrated--with that in mind we have made it easy to support both of us with several Dual Citizen tiers. If you are considering signing up for one, be sure to sign up for the same tier or higher on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://patreon.com/ArahliTheGeek\"\u003eArahli\u0027s Creator Page\u003c/a\u003e in order to claim the unique rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this.
