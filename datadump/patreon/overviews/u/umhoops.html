    "summary": "The end of the college basketball season is sudden. In the blink of an eye, the crescendo of tournament play is over and the last five months are a blur.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s an oddly numbing feeling after spending the last few weeks covering seven basketball games in three cities in 14 days. There\u0027s no game to recap and there\u0027s no next opponent to preview after a few weeks where it felt like there was nothing else to do. The season is over and we settle in for another offseason of speculation, recruiting and roster movement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s also another opportunity to look back at how long I\u0027ve been doing this and start to think seriously about what\u0027s next. We\u0027re coming to the end of the month number 113 of UM Hoops and it\u0027s edging toward the time to think about how long this keeps going and how it works out in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to shut the site down and truly value the Michigan basketball community that has developed, but there are also realities at play. It still takes a lot of work, time and money and it hasn\u0027t been the best two years for the site in terms of traffic growth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere aren\u0027t many independent basketball sites out there like this one that provide in-person coverage of almost every game -- home or away -- and provide the sort of exhaustive content that we strive to create. We\u0027re proud of it, but are also starting to recognize why there aren\u0027t more. It\u0027s hard to pull off. Especially at a school where it feels like the football coach could garner more attention for a Tweet than the basketball team could by winning a game (or five).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis site has always been funded by a mix of donations from people like you and advertising money. The hope was always to move from the former to a completely advertising-driven product, but staying in this niche I\u0027m not sure that we\u0027ll ever be able to reach the  level we hoped.\u003cbr\u003eThere are bigger players out there in that space and there\u0027s far better \u0027viral\u0027 content to drive pageviews than in-depth analysis of Michigan basketball.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFaced with the proposition of shutting the site down, cutting resources, or limiting what we do, the better option might be to flip the script in the opposite direction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to get rid of ads, focus on quality content and leverage a subscription-donation model. The idea is that this will allow us to focus more on what\u0027s most important -- creating quality Michigan basketball content -- and less about generating traffic or maximizing revenue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo ads means a cleaner design and easier-to-access content -- a better user experience for everyone involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re not going to a completely premium or subscription-based model, but we\u0027re offering the option to pledge support on a monthly basis and receive access to some exclusives. Those who pledge $4 (or more) per month -- the cost of a nice latte at Starbucks -- will receive:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWeekly Recruiting Roundup\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBiweekly (weekly in-season) column on Michigan hoops\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMonthly \u0027ask me anything\u0027 conversation\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eWe\u0027re also offering a reward tier for $8/month that will enter you in a drawing to receive either a UM Hoops mug, T-shirt or framed photo print each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest, I have no idea if this will work. But continuing on the current path without a change isn\u0027t going to work out either. The idea is that we\u0027ll build up a solid base that can support running the site. That means paying to keep the servers running, supporting the staff, traveling to games and keeping this thing in motion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we reach a goal of $2,500 per month in pledges, we\u0027ll remove ads and focus on re-designing the site to make it easier to navigate and consume. If we can make it to that point, then I think the subscription model -- proven out by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/derekbodner\"\u003eindividuals like Derek Bodner\u003c/a\u003e or sites like The Athletic -- might just work moving forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis site wouldn\u0027t still exist without all of your support over the years and it\u0027s pretty amazing that we\u0027ve made it this far. I have no idea what the future holds, but also am excited to cover a Michigan team next season that might feature the most unique roster under John Beilein. Hopefully this is a pivot that continues to make this site viable for the foreseeable future.\u003cbr\u003e"
