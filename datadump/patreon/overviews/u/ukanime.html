We\u0027ve hosted panels and interviews as recently as the Hyper Japan \u003cstrong\u003ePeach Pit live stage interviews\u003c/strong\u003e, we interview more Japanese creatives than any other site, and we often break news in the West before any other site, such as the retirement of \u003cstrong\u003eHayao Miyazaki\u003c/strong\u003e and the recent interview with\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eTakeshi\nHonda\u003c/strong\u003e which confirmed that the final Evangelion film was in production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe site has always benefited from the hard work of our writers, our awesome sponsors and the pockets of me, the site creator Ross Liversidge. But now we want to give the old girl a real overhaul, and thanks to Patreon we can really get the community involved!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSite Improvements\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to take UKA to the next level - while we\u0027re already running a .NET, SQL-based site, we want to improve our mobile interface, upgrade the forums and add cool new features such as predictive content searches and better filters to find the news and reviews you want faster than ever before!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBacker Input\u003cbr\u003eWe want to work closely with our backers to provide the content YOU want to see! We cover as much as we can but we\u0027re always happy to be pointed at the things you love so that we can cover them. Got a favourite artist, creator or director? Let us know and we\u0027ll use our contacts to secure the articles and interviews you want to see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew media\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur podcast has been running for a few years now, and with the retirement of Andy Hanley (who has now moved to the anime industry proper!) Ross and Seb have taken over and the pair want to make some big changes! We\u0027ve already improved the equipment, but your funding could help us book guests, travel to broadcast live from the events you love and who knows, maybe even host a few panels at the cons you love!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCovering even more shows\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUKA staffers are almost always at the big events around the UK (and sometimes Europe and Japan!) to bring you the latest news and inside industry gossip. We want to improve our coverage of these events with video, live podcasts and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore Mizuki\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe think we have the coolest site-owned mascot out there, and we\u0027d love to bring her to you in even more glory - your contributions will help fund even more Mizuki artwork from talented comic artists, which we can use on our site and merchandise - again, top level supporters can expect exclusive UKA merchandise you can\u0027t find in our store as a huge \"Thank You!\" for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you love all things Japanese, and want to help UKA become even better, then we\u0027d absolutely appreciate any and all support you can give - even if it\u0027s just a visit to the site to say hi! ^_-"
