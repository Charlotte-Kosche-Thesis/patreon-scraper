That said,\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eI would be honored if you would consider supporting my channel (even with $1 or more per month) to\u00a0improve my videos. However, you are under no obligation to pledge. My content will ALWAYS remain free. You guys have already supported me just by coming to my channel, liking my videos and commenting on it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will also get certain rewards with each tier for becoming a patron\u00a0like getting patron only feeds, name in the credits, early access to videos, Patron only polls and much more.

It will also reduce some financial stress and will help me focus on taking this channel to new heights. My short-term goals to improve this channel include getting a better keyboard and mouse(or even a computer based on the goals we reach here), some sound blocking equipment (to avoid the sounds of horns in the background), buying a better video editing software than Windows Movie Maker etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am really lucky to find a group of people who came to my channel and loved and supported me and gave such a positive response to my videos.
