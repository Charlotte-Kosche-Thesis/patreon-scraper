Fast forward 2+ years and the UFD Tech channel has grown to be the largest tech YT channel in South Africa and one of the top 100 channels in South Africa all together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a wild ride that I couldn\u0027t have predicted when we started out, but I\u0027m truly thankful for everyone who\u0027s chosen to support us over the past couple of years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always dreamt that UFD Tech would be about something bigger than myself, a goal to achieve outside of making tech videos in my house.\u00a0 I want UFD Tech to be about empowering people to create to their fullest potential.\u00a0 Whether that\u0027s through inspiring them through the journey I took to get to where we are now, or it\u0027s working directly with them as part of the team at UFD tech, I want to provide a platform for people to realize their creativity in making content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently we\u0027re a strong team of 3 content creators, but in reality, we\u0027re more than that.\u00a0 We\u0027re as big as the amount of people that we can reach with our quirky, goofy, fun, and informative tech videos.\u00a0 We\u0027re as big as the amount of people that will tune into a livestream to chat and watch me drift cars terribly in Forza. We want to grow our core team at UFD Tech, but also deepen the impact we have with every person who comes across our channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMeet the Creative Team\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipNnEc2z74mniGaqA6kC0BeSg-TwS5X4mbhVZCh-\" style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.facebook.com/UFDTech/photos/a.512662028894575.1073741825.512607822233329/854704024690372\" style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipNnEc2z74mniGaqA6kC0BeSg-TwS5X4mbhVZCh-\" style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/936164795597950976/GVaRvU2E_400x400.jpg\" style=\"background-color: initial; width: 647px;\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrett (UFDisciple)\u003c/strong\u003e - The founder of UFD Tech.\u00a0 The one with the illustrious personality to pull off stunts such as hitting GPU boxes with a pickaxe or building a PC wearing a blindfold.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DP8zTy6X4AAo7e2.jpg\" style=\"width: 648px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTancrid (Tank) \u003c/strong\u003e- The first team member to join UFD Tech.
