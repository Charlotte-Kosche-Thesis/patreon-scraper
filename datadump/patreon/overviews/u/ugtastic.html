    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSupporting UGtastic will bring you more interviews with fascinating people with higher production quality. I\u0027ll be able to spread the interviews across a larger swathe of communities and bring you a better understanding and awareness of the cool people in tech.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in the life changing value of tech community and know how much work goes into even small user-groups and conferences as well as OSS projects. Most of the people creating and coordinating these works are working behind the scenes and often go unrecognized. I seek these people out and put them in front of a camera to learn more about what they are doing and why they are doing it. My goal is to help with humanizing and increasing awareness of the cool people who make tech community possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2011 I\u0027ve conducted over 200 interviews with tech leaders both famous and not so famous. I\u0027ve learned a lot about the equipment and interviewing techniques and the interviews have slowly been improving both technically and content-wise. I need help though to grow past the current state. Going to conferences and collecting the equipment has been quite expensive and I want to avoid advertising entanglements. I want UGtastic to be 100% focused on people doing cool stuff without worrying about which tool or vendor I need to please.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support UGtastic then you will help me to purchase better equipment that will lead to higher production values for interviews. I will be able to spend more time on developing the UGtastic.com website to build better profiles and interesting ways to promote individuals in tech community. And most importantly I\u0027ll be able to dedicate more time to seeking out and interviewing fascinating people in tech. This will help you to learn about the people who are in your community that you might not even be aware of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eSupport my GoFundMe campaign to \u003ca href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/ugtastic-fcp\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efund upgrading my production process to use Final Cut Pro X.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch1\u003eAre you looking to promote your company or project? \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGet embedded in up to ten interview for $500.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e"
