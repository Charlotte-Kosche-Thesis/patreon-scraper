    "summary": "I am a woman living on the other side of emotional and sexual abuse. For many years, I stayed silent and told my truth to the page alone. I reached the end of where silence could lead me alive. Today I help others reach the end of their silence, too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince March 2017 I have used my writing as a tool for personal and collective transformation. On my blog, Unsilenced Woman, I write personal essays to challenge oppressive cultural standards of womanhood, sexuality, motherhood, race, and other simple answers of identity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithin six months of launching my blog, my words traveled to over 90 countries with my piece \u201cA Letter To My White Son\u201d, inspiring dialogue and challenging perspectives through caring confrontation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in the interdependence of personal and social transformation. In sharing my story of inner work, I create space for others to become participants in creating a more compassionate, equitable world. From my home base in the heart of Mississippi, I\u2019ve heard from readers who have found the courage to begin counseling, to acknowledge and examine their deep-seated beliefs, to speak out about their own painful experiences, and to reclaim agency and personal power.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting my work, you help me produce more writing and reach a broader audience.\u00a0Right now I have several dozen pieces in progress in my files that the world needs to hear but that I am unable to cultivate due to limits in time and financial resources as a single-income household and a full-time mom. That\u2019s where you come in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePartnering with Patreon is an exciting development because I am able to focus my energy on the core of my work rather than dividing my resources over divergent, small money-making efforts. Patreon allows me to remain true to my mission of keeping my work accessible for free to all my readers in an ad-free experience, in addition to creating access to my workshops for women who would not otherwise be able to afford it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt every level of Unsilenced Woman, I use my own privilege to challenge existing structures that keep the powerful in the power and the voiceless people silenced, practicing compassionate activism and transformative justice. Through the voluntary support of my readers who have felt firsthand the power of my work, I can live securely and empowered financially as a writer, building my capacity to help empower others. Patreon allows people like you who have been impacted by my work to pay it forward so that I can continue to impact others and fulfill my core mission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve seen that when we share our stories and listen to others, we change lives, and our lives are changed, too. Unsilenced Woman is helping transform lives one person at a time, clarifying what we are able to offer to our entire community. I hope you will not only feel called to support the work of Unsilenced Woman financially but that you will feel called to a deeper engagement with yourself and your world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me in this movement of unsilencing truth, building confidence and courage, and standing strong together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI stand in deep gratitude of your support and your participation in my journey.

And then sharing it with all of us.\u201d -Anna\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure I have ever read anything that more beautifully reveals both profound vulnerability and profound strength.  You have given voice to something I have not yet been able to speak with much clarity or confidence.\" -Jennifer\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYour loving words are the most intelligent, accurate, and honest I\u0027ve ever heard about racism and gender inequality. I can also apply your wisdom to environmental issues, to our current state of corporate greed raping our world, and on. What I love most about your message is that it comes from the depth of your heart and love for your child, which I believe is the only real solution to the world we face today--love...I find it hard to face the world some days. The abuses so common place--to people, to animals, to the environment--that I feel paralyzed. Your words of simple grace fueled by love have inspired me.\u201d -Kim\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThe writing in this blog is beautiful, searingly honest, and brimming with provocative insights on motherhood, marriage, and life after emotional and sexual abuse....What I love most about this blog is how it remains faithful to the specific events of the author\u2019s life while simultaneously bringing into sharp focus the archetypal themes of empowering oneself, transforming wounds into sources of insight, and remaining faithful to the emergent mystery of the human journey.\u201d -Christopher\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI\u2019ve been studying, reading, teaching, learning, and mobilizing in the anti-racism movement for over 30 years, and I can honestly say that this is one of the best personal pieces written by a white person about white privilege and systemic racism/white supremacy that I have read. Thoughtful, powerful, clear, full of historical detail and current examples, and at the same time using a technique I call \u2018caring confrontation\u2019 that demonstrates deep love while educating us, calling us to action, and holding us accountable. I will share it widely with friends, colleagues, activitists, and students.\u201d -a reader\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI feel some healing from your words because they feel like mine in a way that I was never able to express. I can finally show my closest friends, who saw our relationship, your blogs and say, \u0027Please read this, that\u0027s what happened. I couldn\u0027t bring myself to explain everything then, but now you can hopefully understand me and what I went through, and why it was so hard to walk away immediately\u0027\u2026.I feel comforted in knowing that there is someone who completely understands me.\" -a reader\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"When I read Catherine\u0027s words I see something rare: the power to effect real change, to actually make the most stubborn of people pause to reflect and consider a different perspective, or really inhabit someone else\u0027s experience. Writers like this don\u0027t come around often, especially in the age of clickbait-y articles designed to provoke reactions and social media shares, but not even necessarily actual reads...Introspection and her ability to \u0027read\u0027 a room or a person with razor-sharp awareness and careful, considered empathy are fundamental parts of her character, and it\u0027s no surprise that these are cornerstones of her writing as well.\" -Mary\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I have never read or shared a writer\u0027s work that was more universally applicable than Catherine Gray\u0027s. Her \u0027Unsilenced Woman\u0027 resonates with young and old, and yes, female and male. She is able to shout through the fog of fear and resentment and say, \u0027Listen--I am telling the truth--you know it and I know it!\u0027 She does not shrink from revelations of personal failure--she is as candid about her flaws as she is about her soaring successes...Thank you, Catherine, for having the courage to speak. Thank you for showing that we are all broken, and that it is in our brokenness that empathy and selfless love live.\" -Bridget\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
