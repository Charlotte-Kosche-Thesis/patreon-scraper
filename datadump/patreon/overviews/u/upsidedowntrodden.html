We\u2019ll record at your college, local library, town hall, community center, public park, coffee shop, or home to collaborate on the issues that are important to all of us. We will finally be able to purchase our camera, lavalier mics, digital production console, multi-track field recorder, and a multi-studio talkshow system to catapult our company to the next level. This means we\u2019ll now be able to release live shows much more frequently and efficiently, be they in studio or on the road, which will enhance guest and listener participation. We might even be lucky enough to take on a part-time producer to help us run all this amazing new equipment, grow the show, and move our mission forward. Huzzah!",

At this level, we\u2019ll be able to complete this first feature and produce even more original, compelling, and thought-provoking films. Your funding gives us the ability to hire a talented production team, shoot on location, and acquire new equipment to get the job done. We\u2019re talking field production mixer, lighting package, lens kit, jib crane, hard drives, extra batteries, mount rigs and more. Your additional funds, our sharp production team, and shiny new equipment allow us to expand into investigative journalism. By reporting important stories, researching new subjects, and covering major events, we evolve our efforts to raise awareness of our treacherous state of existence and tremendous potential to change it for the better.

We have many projects in various stages of development that will provide people with the opportunity to engage in collective action.

We are planning grassroots organizing across the US and abroad to protect and ensure the health and wellness of ALL life on earth.
