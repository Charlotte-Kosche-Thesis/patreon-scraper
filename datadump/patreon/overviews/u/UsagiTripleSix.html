Just don\u0027t say I didn\u0027t warn you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs with any artist with a weird creative hobby, doing what I do takes up\n a lot of my time and energy. I only have so much of either to give, and\n writing, coding and Photoshop are always competing with video games, \nYouTube and binge Netflix viewing for what I have available. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCommunity support (both financially, and in the form of audience \nengagement) can act as motivators to get me to choose to spend my time \non my more work-like hobbies, rather than the ones that exist purely for\n relaxation\u0027s sake.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAgain, like any other creator, I would greatly prefer that my demanding \nhobby take time away from the parts of my days relegated to Work rather \nthan Play, but there\u0027s that whole pesky thing about needing money to \nlive, and needing to work to earn money. Being able to make their odd \ncreative outlet a part-time job thanks to the generous financial support\n of crazy millionaires on the Internet is the dream of any artist, and \nI\u0027m no exception. It is a dream, though, much like winning the lottery. \nBut I suppose it doesn\u0027t hurt to buy a lottery ticket every once in a \nwhile.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnyway, like I said earlier, you shouldn\u0027t give me money. However, if \nyou like what I\u0027m doing, and want to toss a buck or two into my tip jar \nto keep me motivated, I will happily accept it. I mean, I did set up the\n account on Patreon, after all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eREWARDS FOR MY PATRONS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nI\u0027m working on fun art projects for my personal amusement, rather than \ncreating products for sale, so it makes it a little difficult to find \nrewards to offer those who chose to be patrons of my art. I do have a \ncouple of ideas, though. Since I\u0027ll want enough people interested to \nmake it worth my time, I\u0027ll tie these into my goals.

When this goal is\n reached, I can put together special updates to provide Patrons with \nscreenshots and samples of scenes I\u0027m working on, and give you more \ndetails about my future plans.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eEarlier Access!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen unlocked, I can make a point of providing you fine people with \nupdates to my projects in advance of the public releases. Just think of \nit! You can laugh at my bugs, typos and grammatical errors long before \nanyone else (and might even be the only ones to ever see them, since \nI\u0027ll correct the ones you point out). Plenty of amusement to be had!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eInput!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNo need for a special goal for this one.
