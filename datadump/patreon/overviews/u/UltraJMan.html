If you find yourself here, chances are you\u0027ve been following my videos as UltraJMan or MegaUltraJMan over the years, or have been following my streams over on Twitch. Whether you know me from speedrunning games such as La-Mulana, Bubsy 3D, Metroid, or for some ungodly reason Castle of Dragon, or if you know me through my Let\u0027s Plays such as I Wanna Be the Guy, Cave Story minimal%, Metroid Fusion 1%, or any other number of games I\u0027ve played over the last ten or so years, I want you to know that I appreciate everyone\u0027s support in any way, shape, or form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have opened this Patreon as a way to do more work on streams and interact with my fanbase again on a more personal level. Due to large workloads toward making actual video games and attempting to turn that into a career I have a tougher time churning out the fun videos and streams that may have brought people here in the first place, with this Patreon in place I can 100% guarantee streaming output at least 3 days a week, if not more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI promise to give 100% of my dedication and devotion to meeting your expectations and goals with this Patreon, and should any dissatisfaction occur, let me know and we\u0027ll work together to make things right!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, higher tiers of this patreon include art and commission work, if you have any questions about these, feel free to PM me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much everyone for your support!"
