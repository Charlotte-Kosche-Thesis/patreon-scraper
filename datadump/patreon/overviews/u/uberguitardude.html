Music is my passion and \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is the key to pursuing it as a career\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027m here to make music, whether it\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003eoriginal songs, covers from my favorite bands, video game soundtrack stuff, songs you choose, or whatever\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m in the mood to make. I\u0027m making this Patreon page in hopes of pursuing music more passionately than I have before and really shifting my focus and attention fully on music. If you\u0027ve found your way here, it means you (maybe, hopefully, a little bit?) like me and what I do and I can\u0027t thank you enough for that. Becoming a patron and even\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003epitching in $1 a song helps\u003c/strong\u003e far more than you can imagine. I spend a lot of time working on music, whether it\u0027s writing, re-arranging a cover, or mixing, and I want to \u003cstrong\u003ekeep making more and giving all of you awesome folks some awesome tunes\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0Without \u003cstrong\u003epeople like you\u003c/strong\u003e supporting myself or any artist out there, we\u0027d be sinking ships slamming straight into icebergs. There\u0027s some alliteration for you, BAM! Let\u0027s get this party started. \u003cstrong\u003eJoin Patreon today for some awesome perks/rewards\u003c/strong\u003e and to help support some punk kid makin\u0027 music.\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, \u003cstrong\u003eTLDR\u003c/strong\u003e: If you want to \u003cstrong\u003ehelp support me\u003c/strong\u003e and help me put out \u003cstrong\u003emore awesome music\u003c/strong\u003e, this is the \u003cstrong\u003ebest way to do it\u003c/strong\u003e. This is my official push back into making more music and I have no intention of going back. \u003cstrong\u003eThanks\u003c/strong\u003e in advance for all your support. BIG FAN! -Miles"
