We take audience-submitted questions and dive deep into them, week after week, and have had the privilege to build a really tight community over the past three years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reality is, producing a high quality show every week costs a lot of money. Between rent, utilities, semi-regular equipment maintenance/upgrading, web-hosting fees, and actually wanting to pay our team, we\u0027re looking at expenses of about $500/month. That\u0027s the sweet spot. That\u0027s how much we need in order to make this show at zero cost to us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy our show, please consider pledging to support us! Every dollar counts and gets you a shoutout on the show. Patrons who give $5 or more get to directly influence the content we talk about- that\u0027s just $5/month to basically co-produce the show with us. There\u0027s also higher level perks that get you things like hand-drawn art, product ads, and more. And, every Patron gets early access to bonus content (usually every 4-6 weeks) and behind-the-scenes updates from our producer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what are you waiting for? You read all the way down to the bottom of this page, the only thing left is to pledge to support us and join our growing community!\u003cbr\u003e"
