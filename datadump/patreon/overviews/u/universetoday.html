And honestly, we would love to transition away from an ad supported model to a direct member model. Not only will the site be ad-free for you, but it\u0027ll be clean of ads for EVERYONE.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this level of support, we could shoot videos, write articles, record podcasts, using only the contributions from our members.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe site would load faster, children researching their school projects wouldn\u0027t have to see any ads, and people could win their bar-bets, ad free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt would be a beautiful thing, and you\u0027d be happy in the knowledge that you made it happen.",
