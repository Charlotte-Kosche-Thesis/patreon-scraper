    "summary": "Christianity is a difficult thing: both welcoming and alienating, comforting and disturbing. Frequently, it is found at the mercy of ideology\u2014hijacked by all kinds of cultural baggage, liberal/conservative political posturing, linguistic banality (\"Christianese\"), money-mongering, unconscious in-group biases, irritating worldview wars, artistic bankruptcy, philosophical illiteracy, and a number of other (rather distasteful) things. In short, it\u0027s difficult to approach and/or embrace Christianity without a significant dose of doubt. It can be beautiful, but also ugly. It can be clever, but also not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Unorthodoxy Podcast is a theological-philosophical endeavour started in February of 2016 by Duncan Reyburn (because some friends suggested it) to revive an impulse that seems to be embedded in the writings of even the earliest adherents to the message of Christ, and which is found in every age since: an impulse to find and enact a deeper kind of love through the thoughtful and creative critique of dominant ideologies and an even more creative desire to build community. This thing not just about being clever (though being intellectually engaged is part of it), but is about seeking to offer an authentic expression of one of the most subversive movements in human history.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Unorthodoxy Podcast does not exist in any way for profit. So if you want to listen in for free, you are welcome to do that; it\u0027ll be great to have you join in the conversation. Share it with friends, send ideas for the podcast or voice-memo questions (or written email questions) to unorthodoxy@zoho.com If you can help with a donation, it\u0027ll be much appreciated. Every bit of financial help will go into making the podcast as good as it can be."
