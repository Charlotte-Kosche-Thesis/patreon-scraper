    "summary": "We are asking for monthly pledges to support our FREE youth programming and our LEGAL Graffiti wall! \u00a0No donation is too small!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe UASC (Urban Art for Social Change) Graffiti School is a collective of volunteer educators, artists, youth workers and art therapists who run various workshops directed towards youth in the Durham Region. \u00a0Our mandate is to provide a safe space to create various forms of urban art and engaging programming to connect with youth in our community. \u00a0We have partnered with the Living Room Community Art Studio in Oshawa, Ontario where we deliver our workshops and participate in community events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently we run a series of FREE drop-in programs and a wide variety of workshops on Wednesday nights. \u00a0Examples of our workshops included painting your own skateboard, making t-shirts, learning graffiti fundamentals, creating street art for social change and more. \u00a0In the past we have received generous funding from the City of Oshawa and the Ministry of Education, however, our funds have run out and we are now asking our supporters and friends to help us to continue to offer our free programs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have participated in many community events to date, including the \"88 Keys Project\", Cultured Squared, the Ontario Culture Days Pop-Up Studio Tour through the City of Oshawa and the Oshawa Art Association\u0027s Juried Art Exhibition at the Robert McLaughlin Gallery. \u00a0Additionally our students and mentors are painting murals for various elementary schools in the Durham District School Board. \u00a0Your sponsorship will not only support our weekly programs but will also allow us to continue to be involved in community events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to supporting our free programs and community engagement projects, we are very excited to build Oshawa\u0027s first legal graffiti wall at the Living Room Community Art Studio. \u00a0The wall will support our weekly programs and workshops as well as provide a safe, legal place for our artists to refine their skills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf we provide our youth with a safe space to create quality forms of street art and graffiti will our program reduce or minimize the amount of graffiti vandalism in our community?  If our youth feel supported will they feel invested in their surroundings and help conserve the community in which they live? By connecting youth with adult mentors in the artistic community will they become more aware of the wide variety of opportunities in the arts? Will youth be deterred to commit acts of vandalism if they were made aware of the consequences of such criminal acts to both themselves and the community at large?   It is my experience that by offering urban art programming in high schools over the past five years that the answer to these questions is an outstanding yes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ability to offer urban art programming within the community relies heavily on the advocacy as graffiti as art and not vandalism.  It is imperative that in every step of the way we stress to our participants that we do not condone or promote any illegal acts associated with graffiti.  I am very proud that there are now hundreds of students that have graduated from the Urban Arts for Social Change program and are all now advocates promoting legal forms of graffiti and not graffiti as vandalism.  By providing a safe space to create graffiti, with community support and educational resources, I truly believe that we will be successful in our goal to promote graffiti as art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTheresa Wyatt\u003cbr\u003eUASC Graffiti School Founder\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more information about our programs and projects please visit \u003ca href=\"http://www.uascgraffitischool.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.uascgraffitischool.com\u003c/a\u003e or contact us at info@uascgraffitischool.com .\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
