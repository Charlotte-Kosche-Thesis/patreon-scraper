The show typically features guests rarely given platforms on talk radio or news networks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach episode cuts through the lies and distortions that most dominate our understanding of issues and current events. The hosts typically rant about rather enraging topics, but never do they take the state of the world so seriously that they cannot laugh a little during the show. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show is in its fifth season. Typically, 40 or more episodes are produced each year. (Nearly every past episode, including transcripts of several of the interviews, can be found \u003ca href=\"https://shadowproof.com/category/dissenter/unauthorized-disclosure/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe look forward to another season of pushing boundaries in 2018 and thank everyone who supports our show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCREDIT\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIntro/Outro Theme Music\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eShaving Mirror Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\u003cbr\u003e\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\"\u003ehttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
