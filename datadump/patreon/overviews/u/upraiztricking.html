This place is for those of you who want to help support what I\u2019m doing in ways that allow me to help and support you in your Tricking journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not familiar with Patreon, the concept is that you support a creator financially for the content they create for you. For me, it\u0027s Tricking Tutorials that help guide you to become the best Tricker you can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI definitely believe in this concept with all my heart. It\u0027s helping creators bring more value to the world by making it financially sustainable long-term. Please consider supporting my work with however you much you like. I\u0027m not trying to be stingy but honestly these videos take a good amount of time to make and anything helps! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere does my money go?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support makes it possible for me to invest into producing free Tricking Tutorials and videos for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you may know, it takes time and resources to create content, both which require money. Your support lets me focus on making the best content for you that I possibly can instead of spending a bunch of time focusing on the financial side of how to deliver it to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also helps me replace broken equipment, produce higher-quality videos(actually getting a real camera lol), and free up some of my time to do more important things, like investing time into future projects that I have for Upraiz! ;D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eBruh, I don\u0027t have money to support this.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s all gucci! Please don\u0027t become a patron if you\u0027re low on the funds. I know what that feels like(trust me lol) and want you to take care of more important priorities first. I will continue to make videos that I hope will help you not only excel at Tricking, but even learn how to teach it to others! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWho are you?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Anthony Medina and I\u0027ve been Tricking since 2009/2010. During those 7+ years of training I learned a lot about the dos and don\u0027ts of this sport. At the time of me starting this Tricking journey there was no real source to learn how to Trick or what steps I needed to take to get where I wanted to be!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2952738?hl=en\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eToday I\u0027ve completed a full 10 level curriculum for Tricking, to teach people how to do all those crazy Tricks, safely-ish haha. I\u0027ve also worked as a Tumbling and Tricking coach for the past 4 years, where I learned a lot about how to properly teach someone the skills and techniques it takes to do certain movements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeeing the potential of this sport and where it can go, I decided to move away from my coaching position and focus on helping new Trickers learn how to Trick in their own backyard(or wherever). In 2017 I re-launched my YouTube channel to do just that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support! It really does mean a lot to me! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
