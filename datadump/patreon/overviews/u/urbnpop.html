I\u0027m an Illustrator, Painter, Assembler and Decycler of all kinds of art mediums. I\u0027ve spent the last 10 years Criss-crossing the world attending Comic-book, Horror and Outdoor art conventions and festivals. I\u0027ve been fortunate enough to have done work for Mellow Mushroom Pizza Co. Gentleman Jack Distillery\u0027s Art Beats and Lyrics event, Spotify, Topps, Upperdeck and Crytozoic working on some of my favorite topics, like Star Wars, Marvel Comics, Dc Comics Mars Attacks and Adventure Time. I have two self published art books and four Comic books, with more in the works.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have done this all by trial and error, and all the ups and downs that come with that.. But Thru it all I am still in love with creating art and making comics..\u003cbr\u003eMost recently, I have created my best piece of work with the birth of my Daughter. If you can imagine being a self employed artist and raising a child, can be tricky with projects that wake me up in the middle of the night, that need to come to life.. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewhen I\u0027m not elbow deep in diapers, I am in paint, and projects like creating new comics, but most of the time, No one ever sees the creation process or any of the behind the scene\u0027s stuff that goes into them. I want a platform that helps the people who care about what i do and who want to see me succeed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith every project, comes time and money, so to help with these crazy harebrained ideas of mine, I decided to start this Patreon page. By supporting me thru Patreon, I will share my ideas, creating process and even some insider tips on conventions and being an artist, Of course I will reward you with valuable info, prints and art, maybe even some comics and exclusive stuff just for you guys.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking a look, and from the bottom of my heart, I love each and everyone of you for what you do and helping me keep steaming ahead.\u003cbr\u003eYou are my friends and my family and simply the best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChris"
