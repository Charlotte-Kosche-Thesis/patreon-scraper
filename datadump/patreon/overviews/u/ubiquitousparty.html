With existing\ntechnology and the right ideas, together we will accomplish this, and create\nsuccess levels our nation, and subsequently our planet, have never seen before.\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur deep research has found that 80% of Americans\nagree on key issues.  We have figured out the way to implement change,\nwithout tearing down the system, without ugly conflict, and without having to\nchange or break any existing laws.  Our innovations will create a domino\neffect that will help both the public, and the government, work toward the\ngreater good for all humankind.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs you learn more about us you will see how our\nsolutions will actually work, and why others have tried and failed.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur/your movement will succeed because we will be\nflexible in ways no other organization has been before.  Tools like\nPatreon, linked with our enlightening research and powerful concepts, will help\nus find our way back.  Our way back to where government works for us.\n Tax payers pay the cost, therefore tax payers are the boss, not the\nindentured servant to a bureaucracy.  You Party will also create the way\nforward, to sustainable, peaceful, abundant freedom, using modern technology\nand organization that removes the need for wealthy donors.  Instead of\nfighting a never end battle for justice or equality, or trying to somehow get\nthose in power to usurp their own monopoly so that we can have a fair shot,\njoin us and learn about how we can start creating the future we all want, right\nnow, no more excuses.    \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. unlike a \"non\"-profit or an\n\"official\" political party, we don\u0027t just promise, we guarantee\nresults.  Therefore we are not tax exempt and neither are your purchases\nwith us. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nP.P.S. Here is a super rough, stream of consciousness,\nunedited preview of what patrons get, patrons will exclusively get polished\ncomplete work, that they can read, and at certain levels distribute exclusively\nand build their brands and followings with:  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnother political party? Come on that\u0027s not going\nto work. Jill Stein and Gary Johnson aren\u0027t even going to get to debate this\nyear...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nListen, if you read for another minute you will\nsee that this will work like nothing has before:\u003cbr\u003e\nUbiquitous Party is not a traditional party. We\nreserve the right to endorse any candidate from any party at any time. See the\ndifference?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBetween now and 2020 we will amass 100,000,000\nfollowers. That\u0027s 100 million followers/members. Membership is free,\nparticipation is open to anyone.\u003cbr\u003e\n100 million people is what we call critical mass.\n100 million will be AT LEAST 2/3rds of the (voting) electorate in 2020. This\nmeans who we endorse will win... This is how the people take the power back\nthat we have always had lying dormant... make sense?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUbiquitous Party utilizes proprietary algorithms,\nbots, and good old conversations to come at an astounding realization.\nApproximately 80% of people living in the United States agree on key issues. In\nfact nearly 80% of people whose data we have aggregated all over the PLANET\nagree on common issues in relation to the government. Underneath all the\nrhetoric and partisanship there are clear routes we can take to prosperity and\npeace. The difference is now, for the first time ever, we have the technology\nto see and act on this information in a digital form.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlthough Ubiquitous Party values sovereignty as\nimperative to world peace and diversity, we also invite people from all parts\nof the world to participate in this paradigm shift. We will NOT be changing the\ncurrent political system. This would be too painful and unnecessary and despite\nthe people who set the system up not being perfect, we think they had the best\nideas of any founding fathers and mothers of any nation to date worldwide.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe will never advocate for a global government.\nThe reason is \"horrifyingly simple\" to quote Holocaust. Power\ncorrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. This is a universal law of\nhumanity. Even if your favorite candidate had absolute power, and they were\nmarvelous and did everything completely perfect, the precedent is still to\ndangerous to allow. The next leader can use these powers to the societies detriment\nand this is not a gamble our members will allow at any cost.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBesides. Look around the world today. Technology\nis great. There is a lot to be thankful for. But for most of us, again roughly\n80%, people are very unhappy with their leaders, and the bigger the leader is\nand the more power they have, the worse they seem to be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe AIM to not point fingers or prosecute. It is\neasy to criticize but the fact is things are the way they are because somebody\nis doing something. And so far the common people have not been active enough to\nmake things better so we must bare the responsibility. Instead of having a\nrevolution or toppling a corrupted system, we will change the way we interact\nwith the system.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEsteemed professors lecture about passing laws to\nlimit money in politics. It is noble but a little bit naive that this would\never happen isn\u0027t it? It\u0027s kind of like thinking your dog will serve himself\nthe correct amount when its chow time... not gonna happen. Ubiquitous Party\nbelieves the most complicated challenges often have the simplest solutions.\nImagine having a 100 million person voting block that moved in relative\nharmony... Imagine this voting block started small and organically and never\ntook any money from any companies ever... Imagine the voters in this voting\nblock agreed to never vote for any candidate that took money from a certain\ncompany, or perhaps all companies... Do you think this would change the\ncandidates that we have to choose from? Do you think we would have more people\nlike Bernie Sanders that would get a chance? You bet we would.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA lot of us would have been complacent to let the\npowers that be stay in power and do their thing. We don\u0027t even mind paying some\ntaxes and making them insanely wealthy. But somewhere these people were given\ntoo much power. They became corrupt. We can sit around and blame them all day,\nor we can do something about it. If we are organized as a people we can create\na government that works for us. The best part is we do not need to burn down\nthe system and remake it or any of that non-sense. There are much better ways\nthat are actually plausible and won\u0027t hurt a bunch of people unnecessarily.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the days to come, Ubiquitous Party will be\nformulating and releasing policy positions, as well as information concerning\nwho we are and what we are about. But you must remember: whether you are a\nProgressive, Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, Green, Leftist, Fascist,\nAnarchist etc., or whoever your candidate is, or if you are a little all of the\nabove, there is a core belief structure that almost all American\u0027s share. There\nis an intersection where all of these parties meet.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have allowed ourselves to be sectioned off in\ngroups and pitted against one another. Meanwhile, the things we really care\nabout are being stolen from us while we are distracted...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe point is we as a people need to organize\nourselves. Although there are good people in all the parties, we think it is\nsafe to say the this government no longer serves us, and instead we are made to\nserve it. Think that is extreme? Did you know that every person in the United\nStates, even unborn kids, will probably have to repay money they didn\u0027t borrow?\nDo you know that amount is about 58,000 dollars right now? Things can change,\nand it sure looks like a lot of people approve of our current President. He\nchallenged us all to enter the conversation, and to let our voices be heard to\nshape the nation the way we would like it molded. Ubiquitous Party is here to\naccept that challenge, and to let people know, just because you are frustrated\nnow, doesn\u0027t mean you weren\u0027t frustrated 8 years ago, or 16 years ago etc., and\nit doesn\u0027t mean we have to go on blaming two men from two opposing parties and\nnot do anything ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe will take the opportunity to segue: Someone somewhere\nreading this is thinking two men? Yes it was two men. But this is a critical\ncomponent to the Ubiquitous Party. Our party does things that no party has done\nbefore. First of all we do not wish to run our own candidates. We expect that\nthe establishment political system will react to our efforts and produce\ncandidates that fit our parameters. IF we have fair elections, and 2/3rds of\nthe electorate has agreed on the agenda and policies they want set forth for\nthe country ahead of time, then the candidate who is the best at promising to\nfulfill those goals is who will win!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSimple right? Currently we are doing it backwards.\nWe are not setting the agenda. We are picking the person that each one of us\nthinks individually is the least \"bad\" to satisfy our goals. This is\nwhy 20% or less are happy with Congress. This is why people are so divided when\nit comes to politics. This is why people do not trust the \"mainstream\nmedia\" (which not really the mainstream anymore but we haven\u0027t adjusted as\na society enough to recognize that yet). We hope to change the way candidates\nare created by organizing our needs and desires, changing how the politicians\nget paid, and thus get a new batch of people that 80% of us can live with. If\nthat sounds too crazy to you, it isn\u0027t. And we have the data to back it up!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat being said, here is some of the consensus we\nhave arrived at. Please tell us if we are right or wrong in your opinion: When\nMLK Jr. used the world men, he meant mankind. Ubiquitous Party does not stand\nfor any type of ism. None of them. Any person who deals in these isms doesn\u0027t\nrepresent us. You are all familiar with them and I am sure you can name them\nyourself. If you can\u0027t, go watch a \"liberal\" describe Donald Trump.\nThis is where our party and the majority of the country stand: We don\u0027t support\nany isms, but we also don\u0027t support people being LIMITED IN THEIR SPEECH OR\nCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS FOR ANY REASON. If you cannot grasp both these concepts\nat the same time you may not be capable of critical thought or discrimination.\nDiscrimination isn\u0027t always bad, it can be used to differentiate between things\nand understand that there are different groups of people, from different\nbackgrounds, and where we all intersect is a common core (no not the education\nprogram). People can say whatever they want, its when you actually go and try\nto pass a low against certain groups, that\u0027s where the problems arise. People\nof all colors and lifestyles understand that having a border isn\u0027t racist, and\nhaving smart policies doesn\u0027t make you a bigot. We understand that those saying\notherwise have a faulty agenda.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe majority of knowledgeable people realize that\nphrase \"founding fathers\" includes the founding mothers. It includes\nthe founding ladies who didn\u0027t have kids too! It includes people of all varying\namounts of melanin in their skin (color) that participated in erecting this\ngreat nation. We will not be crippled by cumbersome language dictated to us\nfrom the government we elect that is supposed to work for us. If our leaders\nwish to encourage and create social agreements that some types of behavior are\nnot kosher (that isn\u0027t said anti-semitically, we just got done explaining we\ndon\u0027t do any of that stuff, and anyone who does isn\u0027t part of our party) that\nis fine. But to pass laws that infringe on our constitution will not be\npermitted. IF THERE ARE ANY CHANGES TO OUR CONSTITUTION THEY WILL BE TO EXPAND\nFREEDOMS NOT CONSTRICT THEM. This axiom is something that nearly NINETY% of our\ndata shows Americans agree with.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPeople come here from around the world. Even\nundocumented immigrants who don\u0027t speak English agree that they want more\nfreedom, they do not want this country to become like the places they came\nfrom, that is why they are here... hello! In areas of clear consensus like\nthis, we as a people have the obligation for our kids, (even if you don\u0027t have\nkids the future generation is important for humanity so you are included in\nthis, it takes a village, but that doesn\u0027t mean the government is supposed to\nraise our kids!) to get organized and that is what Ubiquitous Party is doing\nnow.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have spent years gathering data, thousands of\nhours, and significant financial resources to (in the spirit of Steven Covey)\nunderstand what people really want, before we have attempted to tell anyone\nabout us or to make what we do be understood.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2016 has been a wild election year. For the first\ntime in modern history 2 candidates made it to the final stages of the election\nwithout large corporate donors and influence. We also have 2 relatively strong\n3rd party alternatives this year. In a way these are the best choices we have\never had. Why does it seem like everyone thinks these are the worst choices we\nhave ever had?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNo matter what you want out of this election, we\nat Ubiquitous Party have created a composite of all the popular candidates. And\nbeing ubiquitous, without representing or pushing for one candidate or another\nin interactions and data mining, we found underneath all the yelling and\narguing and mudslinging was the heart of America, and beyond the platitudes\nthere were ideas! Good ideas! Ideas that will actually work that are agreeable\nto nearly all.\u003cbr\u003e\n*******\u003cbr\u003e\nHere is the visual: Imagine the brightest people\nin our country, separate from corporate control or influence, taking the time\nand energy to create policy. These people are out there. We know because they\nare joining us and contributing. Along with our giant data effort that has\nsurveyed millions of Americans, we envision the same system, but this same\nsystem working for the people.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course this is done by the people taking action\nand putting some work in ourselves. But this work is not to get someone elected\nand then hope they follow through. This is different. Again we know what\nAmerican\u0027s can agree to. We will be a bottom up supplement to the system, we\nthe American people will put our agenda out. Ubiquitous Party will then\nevaluate all candidates, from the local city council, all the way up to the\nPresident, or el jefe (no that\u0027s not racist it just sounds cool and no we\naren\u0027t saying we are going to merge with Mexico relax, you will get to know us\nand we will all get along).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMacro data becomes well written and presented\npolicy by the people. Once this process is complete the federal government\nshould work in a much more efficient way. Don\u0027t freak out, but we are going to\npay our politicians much more money. Like ten times as much as they make now.\nWhy? Because that way we can get them to do their job! Right now they are up\nthere making fund raising calls all day. This is no good. How can we pay the\nPresident of the free world 400k when we pay an professional athlete 40 times\nthat? This part of our politics needs to be modernized. Hang on this is going\nto make sense:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPoliticians should spend 100% of their time\nworking on getting the agenda we the people set forth into whatever legal\nbeagle writing they need to to make it an official law. Put yourself in ANY\npresident\u0027s shoes. You get elected. You probably weren\u0027t rich before because if\nyou were you wouldn\u0027t be trying to be the president. Or if you were rich than\nyou still got a bunch of upgrades as president. If Trump gets elected he will\nprobably be the first person to ever downgrade. The point is for a\n\"normal\" person being elected, they get treated like royalty for 4\nyears, they like it, the spend the first 4 years trying to get 4 more years,\nand then they spend those years doing a bunch of side deals to be rich after\nthey are not president any more get it? It would be hard for any human not to\nfall into this trap. There is a better way.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInstead of doing what everyone has been trying to\ndo forever and will never work, let\u0027s reverse engineer. Let\u0027s get the best\ntalent (no offense to those currently there, some of you are great but we need\nto do better and almost all of US agree with that). You get the best talent by\npaying more and this isn\u0027t something that is going to be hard to get these\npeople to pass!!! Getting them to pass a law to take money out of politics is a\nwaste of time. They will just find ways around it. When it comes to doing what\nthey want they are very smart and creative. Paying more will end up saving us\ntrillions of dollars. You would be astounded how many tax dollars it takes it\nequal one bribe dollar. And by the way, the people in power can stay there if\nthey want, they just need to do their job, and modern technology and We the\nPeople\u0027s input will make this possible in ways not previously available.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith these updates, salaries and asset backed\ncompensation packages, we can get term limits if necessary going forward on\ncongress and senators. Hopefully this won\u0027t be necessary. Because remember,\ninstead of them raising money all day and arguing about what pork each side\ngets to add to the bills, we are going to be giving them our agenda, their job\nis to make it legal, and do nothing else. All the little side deals and\nnonsense can end. We will demand full transparency, reality TV government? Why\nnot? Would you pay an employee and have no idea what they are doing? No way, so\nwhy do we do that with our government. They act like its their money guess\nwhat, its not their money, ITS YOURS!!! Right now these guys (yeah we said\nguys, guys can mean guys and girls and anything and everything in between, if\nyou are a human you are a human, all humans have equal rights and opportunities\nto Ubiquitous Party, it saves time and paper, don\u0027t get offended, we don\u0027t\nreward that, WE ARE ALL INCLUSIVE) are getting paid 150k or something. And we\nare surprised they are doing side deals? It\u0027s not that 150k isn\u0027t a lot of\nmoney, its that they are getting into a club. The people that put them there\nfinancially are rich, they are going to rich events, they have a lot of their\ncosts covered, they can afford to appear rich now, and the cycle begins. Again,\nadr (all due respect) but most of these people could not make it in the\nbusiness world, so they went into politics so they could sell influence for\nmoney. Also congress and the senate is the NBA of politics and they are making\nmiddle management banker money... If this is not true it at least appears true.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe point is, the more we pay these people, the\nmore we can restrict their other activities, and the more we pay them like\nCEO\u0027S the more CEO level talent we can get. Most of the people we have talked\nto do no understand why Trump is taking such a pay cut, and he likely to be\nunder more scrutiny than any president in US history, especially with the fact\nthat the \"msm\" hates him, and the technology around these days makes\nhiding things impossible, so he\u0027s not going to get to cut a bunch of secret\ndeals like some people would say certain people have cut recently... Whether\nyou like Trump or not, or think he is a successful business man or not, the\npoint remains, he has a better plane than the President, a better lifestyle,\nand he probably has it made for 40 more years not four. The reason he is giving\nthis all away to take what our research has determined is the worst job in the\nworld? Perhaps we will find out. What we are getting at is when is the next\ntime we will have someone like this running for office paying their own way?\nLove Trump or hate him, we can all agree that having more talent running,\npaying their own way or at least not being owned my corporations is the way we\nmust move in the future. The only way to do that is create a better\ncompensation structure and create a consensus that none of us will vote for\ncorporation create candidates that do not represent our values!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom the top down politicians can have the same\nbase pay, but perhaps a production based bonus based on the peoples\u0027 agenda, or\nsome sort of arrangement but they need to be making at least 10 times as much\nas they are now, or they are just going to be spending all their time on side\ndeals. This is a fact most Americans agree on but is rarely discussed through\ncommon outlets.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAsset backed compensation, which needs to be\nimplemented throughout our society eventually, is another way we can address\nthese issues. Let\u0027s use the pro sports analogy. A ridiculous number of athletes\nend up bankrupt. It\u0027s kind of like our country. We put people in charge who\nhave never run a company, have no experience with debt, how to get in and out\nof problems or anything of that nature, and give them the opportunity to\n\"save the world\". And what do we end up with? A bunch of upset people\nthat don\u0027t feel saved and a bunch of debt. Most pro athletes face this same\nissue. Everyone thinks the government is rich and they want some of the money.\nThis is common for people who are earning little or nothing to think. Imagine if\nathletes were paid half their money in salary and half was used to buy assets.\nAssets that paid them money every month forever. When they pass away this money\nwould go to their loved ones. This should be done for politicians. This should\nbe done for everyone. As we see more and more come out about all the\ncrookedness (and its DEFINITELY not confined to just one person or one party)\nin politics, we as a society learn more about the pressures these people go\nthrough. It sounds silly but say you are living in the beltway and you are\ntrying to keep up with the neighbors. You are 5k late on a bill and you spent\nall your money last weekend at the Hamptons. You can do some corrupt move that\nwill get you a quick payoff. Are you going to do it? The answer is you probably\nwould if you were in that position. And it is really easy for those of us who\naren\u0027t in those positions to say we wouldn\u0027t but you never know. Remember the\ntop of the government is less than 1000 people. That kind of power is almost\nalways corrupting. It is amazing how much can be added to our debt, for such a\nrelatively small amount of lobbying money. Most people think they are rich they\ndon\u0027t need money, but they are not understanding how addictive the\n\"elites\" lifestyles can be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is the reason we at Ubiquitous Party are\nagainst a global or regional government that controls more than one country.\nIt\u0027s not because we are racist, in fact to be a part of our party you must\ndenounce all the isms, but it is because we KNOW that concentration of power\nleads to corruption. Most religious people believe their prophet(s) was the\nonly one capable of accepting such power. Only Frodo could carry the ring\nright? The point is we as a people cannot allow a concentration of power like\nthis. It will always end the same, in debt, in corruption, in famine and in\npoverty. Empires throughout time have shown this cycle over and over again.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe will not excuse the actors from their\nresponsibility, but we realize most of us would act the same given the same\nscenarios. Not to offend the donors, but on a pure hypothetical basis, who\nknows what kind of threats people in power get after accepting contributions?\nHave you ever giving somebody money before? Did you expect something in return\nfor that money?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUbiquitous Party is here to improve the People\u0027s\ninput to the government. We will provide clear concise policy and goals.\nGovernment will make these laws like executives on an assembly line stamping\npackages before they are sent out. Once you get this visualization you can see\nthe future. Clearly these people need our help. With all the technology\nadvances, and power at our fingertips, there are still many problems that could\neasily be fixed that are not being attended to because the\n\"executives\" in power are not putting their full attention to getting\nthings done, and they do not have a clear signal from us as to what we want\ndone. This will change in the next couple years. We as Americans will organize\nand Ubiquitous Party is the tool we will use to organize. We will set the\npolicy, we will access all candidates for all positions, we will register\npeople who want to register with us to avoid any chance of voting fraud, we\nwill help people who are working two jobs and don\u0027t have time to go through and\nthe candidates and learn the truth of who REALLY stands closer to their values.\nAlso instead of the tail wagging the dog, we will become the dog wagging the\ntale, candidates will quickly learn, if they want to win, polling research\nisn\u0027t going to be the best trick, aligning with our policies is what is going\nto win elections. Politicians won\u0027t be hated any more, they will be permitted\nto tell the truth! They will still get rich, all the donors can keep their\nmoney, but right now, if we do our part, the current so called elites need to\njust go somewhere and enjoy their money or help us in our agenda, because they\naren\u0027t cutting it. If they were doing even a decent job our Party wouldn\u0027t\nexist.\u003cbr\u003e\n_____________________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCheck the options to get involved if you are part\nof the 80% of people who have common sense and realize that solutions are there\nfor us, they just need to be acted on, and time is running out for the future\nof humanity. As \"bad\" as it is this is still the place most people\nwant to be who are trying to raise their standard of living. Now it is time for\nWe the People to step up and not just pay our taxes and be subjugated to laws,\nbut drive the conversation as to what we want done with our money and what\nfreedoms we demand for the privilege of being governed.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nReports like these will be coming out every week\nor two covering policies and issues. If you haven\u0027t participated or made your\nopinions know their are plenty of ways to do so below. We can make change, but\nif we are unwilling to spend 30 minutes reading something and tell a couple of\nour friends about it do we really deserve it? We are four years away from\ncontrolling the direction of our country for good. This will be done through or\npolitical and education reforms. Help spread the word if this resonates with\nyou. The chances are good that if you use social media often, your opinions\nhave made their way into our matrix :)\u003cbr\u003e\n_____________________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUbiquitous Party, also known as You Party, Your\nParty, Common Sense Party and many other titles, reflects a metric that has\nnever been used in politics before. You will hear the 80% number consistently\nthroughout our literature. This is the case on almost all issues. However,\nthere is a caveat. This caveat is perhaps the most important component of You\nParty aka Your Party: Modern life and technology was supposed to give us more\nand more time right? In the words of Tony Robbins \"how is that working out\nfor ya?\" Productivity has definitely increased in many ways, and there are\nmany conveniences that have sprung up. But how many of us legitimately\nunderstand what we are voting for in terms of legislation measures and\nespecially smaller government appointments? We think it is safe to say that\nmost of the \"MSM\" or main stream media as it were has advocated their\njobs to the \"independent\" media which is in fact now the mainstream\nand thus is being threatened with censorship. The current Party structure is\nset up to serve the donors, not the people. In the past they did just a good\nenough job to keep people from rioting. From our research we have determined\nthat they have probably overstepped these bounds, and because the vast majority\nof us want peace we have to do something about it now. \"MSM\" has\nbecome an arm of the government instead of a check and balance for the\ngovernment. Government officials route tax money to these outlets and corrupt\ntheir messages. Is it true that the US government has the second largest\nadvertising budget in the world of 2 billion dollars?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"MSM\" has created a void. The good news\nis there are enough citizens who have a reasonably secure financial structure,\nor are willing to work without such a structure, to put their time into working\non these issues. Citizen journalist and activist can turn this around. All we\nneed from the current establishment is for them to really step aside and let us\ndo the work. It will be a better scenario for everyone. The goal of a socialist\ngovernment is to make the citizens so dependent on them that the people cannot\ndo what I am describing. You may hear people denounce so-called capitalism but\nthe simple fact is that without the use of this tool none of us would have\ncomputers, none of us would be online right now, and none of us would be able\nto specialize in doing the things that we do. Corrupt crony capitalism is the\nissue we must correct.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSeptember 10th 2016 the Female Prime Minister of\nthe UK announced their health care system is on the brink of collapse. It is\nbeyond us why anyone who has seen what the US Government has done the the\nVeterans healthcare could possibly think the US Government is capable of\nhanding or policing health care for its citizenship. Here is a great example to\nexplain the difference with You Party:If you go around asking people if they prefer healthcare be\nprovided for all, about 80% of people will say yes. But if you talk to them for\na minute that number goes down to 50% as they start to feel it is okay for them\nto tell the truth. The reason is they don\u0027t want to appear \"racist\".\nWhile racism has nothing to do with this issue, this fear is a sickness that\nhas found its way into the American psyche. This is why Ubiquitous Party\nprovides an alternative. From the get go our party denounces such isms, and\nprovides a way for people to support a party and not have to fear that they\nwill be attacked or scorned by their fellow citizens for simply having a\nparticular view on life. This is new. You won\u0027t get this from another major\nparty. Their past are too sordid, and/or their reputation has been assassinated\nby the \"MSM.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFive minutes into the healthcare conversation the\nnumber drops to 20%! You know why? It\u0027s not because people dislike other\npeople, its because when people consider the facts of economics and the\nhistorical failure of Governments to handle such projects of scale, they\nrealize it is not racist, it is rational. Scandinavian countries are a prime\nexample. You can stick your head in the ground if you want but they are being\ninvaded. They gave up the control of their healthcare to their government. Once\nyou do that what power do you have? They do not have the second amendment, they\nbarely have Freedom of Speech! So what are they to do? Police report directly\nthat there are now large neighborhoods they cannot go into without being\nattacked. This is the result of government taking control from the people. This\nwill always be the result of government taking control from the people. It\nhappens every time like clock work. POWER CORRUPTS, ABSOLUTE POWER CORRUPTS\nABSOLUTELY.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe share a lot of values with the Bernie Sanders\nmovement. Berners like to say what about the Postal Service, we wouldn\u0027t have\nthat and what about Fire Trucks. One thing we have noticed about the Berners is\nthey are willing to have a conversation almost always. The far left people just\nstart yelling on the other hand. When we talked to Berners and showed them how\nthe US Postal service has been sued my companies like UPS for unfair business\npractices, and has run billions of dollars of debt, they start to see that even\nthese examples of supposed \"socialism\" are straw arguments. As\nCharles Krauthammer correctly noted, Medicaid/Medicare and Social Security are\ngreat achievements of liberals (democrats) and we agree. However, these\nprograms have become bloated and can be improved. When you explain to Bernie\nenthusiasts that until there is a Senate and Congress full of people like\nBernie the tax money might come in, but its going to be misused, they\nunderstand.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course the next thing they say is that is why\nwe need to stack the Government with \"progressives.\" This would be a\nneat idea. There is a problem. This will take too long. Progressives get run\nover by the other parties, they lose their authenticity by endorsing people who\nstand for everything the complain about, and the remaining issue. ONCE YOU GIVE\nCONTROL TO THE GOVERNMENT IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET IT BACK. We have seen\nthe disaster in France with their high tax rates. They have had to declare\nmartial law because their immigration has gotten so out of control. Is that\nwhat we want for the US?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou Party wants to avoid a bloody revolution. And\na \"political revolution\" that chooses the corporate elitist donor\ncandidate versus the self funding candidate just sounds stupid. Let\u0027s face it,\nhere comes that number again, 80% of Berners we talked to and 80% of our scan\ndata shows Berners are going to vote for Jill Stein. 20% the self funding guy...\u003cbr\u003e\nPart of the reason You Party has achieved such\nuniversal appeal is this: WE EMBRACE MANY \"PROGRESSIVE\" GOALS. We\njust completely disagree with how to achieve them. Once we sat down with\nBerners and showed them how much the Federal Government is wasting, it became\napparent to them that ANYONE advocating for higher taxes is your enemy. Again\nif you have 100 Bernie\u0027s dolling out the money it might work, but we don\u0027t. All\nthe money that is wasted can only lead rational people to one conclusion. The\ngovernment does not need more money, in fact that is the last thing they need\nwith the current leadership. How do we know? Look at our debt. Not deficit\nspending, DEBT. IT has almost tripled in the last 8 years. This is a larger\nincrease in a smaller time period THAN ANYWHERE EVER IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND\nand this is indisputable even by the \"MSM\". Tell us, what did we get\nin exchange for this debt? We bailed out the banks that got the same\npoliticians elected? We bailed out two auto makers who flew on jets to ask for\na handout while one company (Ford) was fine because they were prudent fiscally,\nso we rewarded the stupid companies and thus punishing the responsible company?\nThat\u0027s where all the money went and we \"saved\" the world economy?\nThis might be somewhat believable if they same companies weren\u0027t back to doing\nthe same activities already...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is one of the fundamental differences between\nUbiquitous Party and others: Our analytics have deep follow up. First 80% say\nwe should provide healthcare for all. Of those 80%, 80% of them agree after a\nlogical explanation of why that wont work that it isn\u0027t a smart route to go.\nHowever, almost all of them ask afterwards, \"But what are we going to do\nabout poor people? We are in the biggest debt the world has every seen but we\nare still the \"richest\" country in the world we still need to take\ncare of people right? I would pay extra to take care of people if I had a job\nand paid taxes.\" You think this is funny but this is extremely common to\nhear and read in our data scans.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce again the solution is simple. It will be\nridiculed because it will work and it will make power obsessed people feel\nreplaced. Almost everyone has seen or heard of a \"go fund me\" page\nright? Some of them even magically appear before tragic events even occur. Some\npoliticians want to stand up and say American is racist, and Christians are\nbad. Well the truth is, once again, from every source out there, is that\nChristian Americans are the most charitable group in the world bar none. We\nwill be citing everything we say, but an axiom of You Party is this: Don\u0027t\nbelieve us? All you need to do is 1. highlight 2. copy 3. paste into google 4.\ndo your own research on all our claims. It only takes a few seconds. It is\ntrue, google is so efficient it will find results to back almost anything up,\nbut those of us who can think critically, 80% once again agree with the message\nwe are putting out here in these writings.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHindsight is 20/20. You Party doesn\u0027t judge. We\ndon\u0027t seek revenge. But you know what would have worked really well for our\nhealthcare system? The entire goal was go get the 20 million uninsured insured\nright? Well the simple solution would have been to add those people to medicaid\nor medicare, and added the bill to our debt. Wham bam simple done. A lot of\nyoung people don\u0027t know what has happened to healthcare because they either got\nit for free, or they don\u0027t use it or have it BECAUSE THEY ARE YOUNG. So they\nare the easiest to manipulate with these faulty nearly bankrupt plans. Why\ndidn\u0027t the Government do what we listed above? Why did they have to mess up the\nrest of Americans healthcare to insure 20 million people? If ISIS isn\u0027t Islamic\nor a State, then the Affordable Care act should be called the un-affordable\ncoverage act. Because it is not affordable, and you do not get care, you get\ncoverage.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe reason they did it this way, as admitted by a\npromoter of the bill who had to scam america into it and has said so on record,\nis because they couldn\u0027t be straight up with the american people. As Nancy\nPelosi said we had to pass the bill so we could see what is in it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe so called ACA is literally treason. And\nmillions of Americans are afraid to say so or just don\u0027t even understand what\nhappened. BUT guess what: 80% of them when shown indisputable facts, agree we\nhave been bamboozled. However, You Party can spin this into a win. The legacy\nof ACA can be salvaged. This illegal legislation has pushed the minds of many\nso far left, that now, even Republican front runners are talking about health\ncare where everyone is covered. And this can be a good thing if done right!\nThis never would have happened this way without the ACA. You Party always seeks\nto find silver linings, and another axiom is don\u0027t throw the baby out with the\nbath water.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou know what would work though?  What if 100\nmillion people VOLUNTARILY put 100 bucks a month in a pool to cover everyone\u0027s\nhealthcare and used their bargaining power to get the best care instead of just\ncoverage?  Now THAT would work.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile Sanders primary argument of \"lets be\nlike these other countries\" falls flat on its face, it is particularly\nironic that these same countries are in decline because of immigration. These\ntypes of socialist utopias only somewhat work when you have a non-porous\nborders, and strict immigration control. NO NOT BECAUSE OF RACISM, because of\neconomics. This is the only way these countries were able to have a welfare\nstate without collapsing. But because the people lose control of government\nwhen they depend on government for everything, immigration was rammed down\ntheir throats and now their welfare systems and states are collapsing before\nour eyes. If you are paying huge amounts of tax to the government for services,\nyou might as well just buy the services for yourself, because when a company\ncollapses another takes its place right away, when a government collapses there\nwill be years heartache before services are restored.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSadly, you can not have half of Sander\u0027s policy\nand still have the other half. If you are to have a society where you take care\nof everyone, you can\u0027t just invite anyone, and this type of simple math and\nphysics should be apparent to anyone who has studied the dynamics of human\npopulation and civilization. The goals are great, but the methods to achieve\nthem are not correct in terms of the left.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile talking to the Berners was fun, and it was\nrefreshing to converse with people who care about issues instead of personal attacks,\nwe realized that it would take us years to talk to millions of them, and short\nof video taping the conversations and putting them on YouTube, there was no way\nto scale these efforts. But we found 80% of them saw what we offered was a\nbetter way. And it cannot go without saying, as far as a person goes, who was\nnot beholden to companies, Bernie seems like a true gem.  However, don\u0027t\nyou think your 22 dollars a month would have been better spent with us?  A\nmovement that has no way to sell out and will never end just because a rigged\nelection is over?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou party, realizing time constraints, has been\nusing one on one, in person talks, to get metrics. We found that scanning\nthrough social media there was a macro element with 80% or so conformity on\nmacro issues. And if we talked to 10 Berners about certain issues, 8 would\nwholeheartedly agree.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThen the unthinkable happened. Not because we\nvilify any of the candidates (in fact Ted Cruz has done a lot of good things\nand he is fighting to not give the internet away to powers outside the USA!),\nwe just thought, who is the most opposite of Bernie? Ted Cruz? We then started\ntalking to Ted Cruz supporters. Guess what? Same thing... Of course we didn\u0027t\nhave to convince them about the Un-affordable Coverage act, instead we looked\nat issues like gay marriage.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAgain, hindsight is 20/20. History will look back\nat \"gay\" marriage like this: There was a big fight that created a\nrift between Democrats and Republicans, the Democrats used it to make\n\"mainstream\" pop culture side with Democrats. In the end all that\nhappened was the world marriage was re-defined. The word marriage used to mean\nman and woman, and now simply means two human beings. THAT\u0027S IT! No offense to\nthe people who struggled for this equality but that is the nuts and bolts of\nit. Democrats used this as a wedge along with their media and popular music and\nTV assets to demonize the Republicans. This was a political error and\nespecially Christians, some of whom believe homosexuality is a sin, also believe\nand know that Jesus message would does not advise to judge anyone in this way.\nIn retrospect Republicans could have just said you know what, its a human\nright, we just want you to use a different word instead of re-write the\ndictionary. But that isn\u0027t what they did and the lost HUGE political ground\nover this \"wedge\" issue. This is just like the trans bathrooms by the\nway. It will end up not being that big of a deal, but it will be another weapon\nfor democrats and pop culture to demonize Republicans. Cruz people we surveyed\nget this. Whether they agreed with the gay lifestyle or not they weren\u0027t\ndiscriminatory. Most people in politics are smart enough to think. And besides\nsome paid pundits on TV, most Americans realize that this \"sticking to\nprinciples\" and losing ground all the time is phony resistance, and aids\nthe side they claim they oppose.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is why Ubiquitous Party will never support\nany legislation that limits citizens freedoms. IF THERE IS SUCH THING AS WHITE\nPRIVILEGE IT SHOULD NOT BE ENDED, IT SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO ALL PEOPLE OF ALL\nCOLORS AND PERSUASIONS. This is an axiom of You Party.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUbiquitous Party will support people\u0027s rights to\nsay WHATEVER THEY WANT. Free speech is what lead to gay rights, so to use gay\nrights or any other movement to restrict free speech is perverted and wrong. We\ncompletely oppose those who use free speech to defame others, and then create\nlegislation to restrict the free speech of others. As soon as you restrict one\ngroup\u0027s free speech you can restrict others. This is the slippery slope and we\nwill fight against this eternally. Outlawing words is illegal and always should\nbe. If someone is spewing hate speech you can simply ignore them or block them.\nWe will never accept any authority infringing on our God given rights.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSome people don\u0027t believe in God. That is fine.\nScience is showing us that there is a fabric that makes up everything around\nus. That there are dimensions and levels of life we do not yet understand. To\nquote Joe Dispenza \"Science is the contemporary language of\nmysticism.\" At You party we accept all religions. Where we draw the line\nis if you are trying to force people into your theocracy or to live a certain\nway that is outside the US CONSTITUTION. No law will supersede that of the US\nCONSTITUTION on US soil EVER. Not the law of a global government, and not the\nlaw of a religion like Sharia law. This is a primary component of You Party.\nFor members in other countries you must adhere to or change your countries\nconstitution or live within it. We do not advocate overthrow or regime change\nin any manner. What we advocate is a bottom up approach to government where the\npeople create a consensus and this consensus permeates the language and culture\nand makes it way into the current government offices. Whether people believe in\nGod or not, all people have rights innate to them being born as a human.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou Party has no interest in a planet that is all\nthe same. If there are millions of people who want to live in a Theocracy they\ncan do that in their lands. You Party does not aim to interfere an any other\ncountries affairs. We have enough issues of our own. Before the \"what\nabout Germany, isolationist\" bantering begins: our only foreign military\nobjectives will be to prevent any country from acquiring or expanding nuclear\nweapons. Our other priority will be with working with governments to preserve\nand maintain the most valuable resources in the world like the Amazon Rain\nforest. In instances of genocide we will take a 100% PAID VOLUNTEER military\nforce into battle with congressional approval. We will restrict drone and\nunmanned strikes. Almost 8 out of 10 people we talked to, in addition to our\ndata scans agree, drone strikes are not accurate enough, we do not know enough\nabout who is getting killed and why, and the precedence these strikes create,\nincluding the president of killing the supposed Dallas police sniper with a\nrobot bomb is not worth the results we are getting. Almost everyone we talked\nto dislikes this draconian judge dread like military force we have been using.\nIt doesn\u0027t take a scientist to see that we are moving more and more toward\nmilitaries that do not involve humans. While that is nice to avoid casualties,\nit also puts too much power in the hands of politicians, and just a reminder\ntoo much power corrupts, every single time. It is also imperative that we limit\nrobotic military development. As soon as the remaining human element is removed\nfrom the military we will have more callous killing. This is a dangerous area\nwe must put attention to and use our diplomacy to discourage.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe must rebuild our military. 80% of the Trump\npeople agree with this of course right off the bat. Again with the Berners they\ndon\u0027t get it at first but they listen. The issue is this. Apple has more money\nin the bank than the US government... Think about that for a second. Anyone who\ndoesn\u0027t think there is not ALWAYS a group of people that want to take over the\nworld is delusional and has never read a history book. Of course we don\u0027t think\napple would do this, but one has to realize, as countries fall into more and\nmore debt, and corporations secure their monopolies tighter and tighter, the\nmovie Elysium seems more and more plausible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen considering \"reality, one has to\nconsider simple physics. The peace lovers want to get rid of all the military.\nThis would be nice, but the reality is the military is what stops war.\nMisguided leaders who have been puppet-ed start the wars, but having the\nhardware to put people in check maintains peace. If governments slowly disarm there\nis no doubt private corporations will fill this vacuum. The amount of private\ncontractors already in the world is astounding. Berners and Greens want to\nprotect the environment and this is good. If it weren\u0027t for the military there\nis truly no reason companies would respect the law. This sounds funny but think\nabout it. It is true. This is the fail stop the government has. The pieces of\nthis puzzle are interdependent and if operated without corruption we can have\nworld peace and use our military to educate and employ millions, and conduct\npeace missions throughout the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf we let our guard down, chances are we will not\nbe attacked directly, as we have 300 million guns in the hands of citizens. But\nbeware, some politicians think this is a bad idea. While governments have\nkilled more humans than all the other causes of premature death on earth\nCOMBINED, we are supposed to think that its safe to disarm to save 11,000\npeople a year because we can trust these people. AGAIN 80% of scanned data\nshows consensus on this, and of the remaining 20% who were sampled to have this\ndiscussion, 80% of them agreed after a simple adjustment on perspective.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe racism weapon gets thrown around a lot. But\npeople need to be realistic. Not only did China kill 80 million of its own\npeople, not only did they kill millions of girls and unbalance their mail\nfemale population, they also persecute Buddhist. Now you have to ask yourself,\nhow evil do you have to be to persecute Buddhist? This is not an indictment of\nChina and we know we aren\u0027t perfect, but to think that we are safe in this\nworld and there is no other power that wants to rule the world is again, naive\nand suicidal.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnother axiom of Your Party: if you are prepared\nfor something you probably will not need it. Being over-prepared can act as an\ninsurance policy against things you fear happening.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nModern technology makes transparency much easier\nfor the government. You Party believes that military to maintain sovereignty\nand enforce laws on mega corporations, as well as the maintenance of roads and\ngovernment employees are the top three items that need to be accounted for in\nthe budget.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUbiquitous Party believes in offsets. For example,\nour tax policy will change the way taxes work, but we will not destroy an\nindustry and leave thousands of people out of jobs. Someone said slavery is\nlike having the wolf by the ears, you can\u0027t stand there and hold it forever but\nyou are afraid to let it go. We need to let go of some of the foolish practices\nof our past. Federal income tax is one of these foolish policies. But how are\nwe going to pay for stuff?\u003cbr\u003e\nPhysical paper cash plays a pivotal roll in our\neconomy. ANYONE WHO ADVOCATES REMOVING CASH FROM SOCIETY IS AN ENEMY. There was\nan article of a supposed Scandinavian saying how nice it would be if they had a\ncashless society because someone stole his sons stuff and they wouldn\u0027t be able\nto sell it if it weren\u0027t for cash... If this is a real story, this is the type\nof thinking that lets your country get overrun by people who overwhelm all your\nsystems. This is the kind of thinking that throws thousands of years of work\nand sacrifice down the drain. Perhaps these people are so spoiled and have had\nit so good they have no idea how to actually think or survive. These types of\nconcepts are suicidal.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou may want a chip inside you, you might think it\nis trendy and cool, but like always 80% of the world disagrees when they think\nabout it for 30 seconds. What if the power goes out? What if the internet goes\ndown? What is the satellites get fried from a meteor? Don\u0027t you think it would\nbe nice to have another way to buy things? The retartedness (that means\nbackwards, remember you party does not agree with any isms, so do not take that\noffensively) of this type of thought is it doesn\u0027t even solve the problem. As\nif the thief could not barter the goods he sold for something else or receive\nan electronic payment...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce has to wonder if articles like this are even\nreal stories. Or if they are just part of the brainwash press that is trying to\npush us into a Brave New World every second of every day.\u003cbr\u003e\nOur Party tax structure will look something like\nthis: Let\u0027s use 3 percent for the example. Right now the tax structure is\ndesigned to destroy the middle class, the middle class is paying almost all the\ntaxes for the lower class while the upper class pays very little in terms of\npercentage. Overall the upper class in terms of dollars is paying a huge\namount. Again 1. copy 2. paste into google 3. read if you doubt our assessment.\nThe tax the rich Burner types have the right idea in terms of wanting to share\nother peoples wealth to help the poor, it\u0027s a nice idea, but it just doesn\u0027t\nwork. The best thing for an economy is a thriving middle class. Small\nbusinesses are the lifeblood of a healthy economy with some semblance of income\nequality. Look at Argentina. They used to be the richest country in the world\nin many measures per capita, and then they did the whole \"tax the\nrich\" lets be socialist thing and now they are on the brink of collapse...\nwho knew... The way these plans are sold is that one side favors the people,\nand they say the other side doesn\u0027t want to do it because they are greedy. Both\nsides are at fault, it benefits the people at the top not the bottom, and this\nhappens all over the world. There is not one success story of these policies in\nworld history.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur solution is much different. We incentivize the\nuse of cash. People say \"I don\u0027t like cash it is dirty and i don\u0027t like\nchange etc,\" that is fine, buy a gift card if you want but it is a matter\nof national security that more people have actual physical cash. We aren\u0027t\nadvocating a run on the banks we are simply saying lets prepare for things, an\nthen they are less likely to happen. We need to take similar precautions with\nour electrical grid, our food supply etc.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo avoid a run on the bank cash withdrawals will\nbe charged 3%. Always, every time, everyone. Our tax plan is across the board\nonce again, \"horrifyingly simple.\" Bare in mind the percentage can be\nchanged, it can be 3.001 percent this gives us ability to fine tune the economy\nand the budget.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery time you use a credit or debit card the\nprocessing company is taking a percentage of the transaction as a fee. This\ninfrastructure is already built in and will require limited tweaking for our\nsystem. When a person purchases with cash there is no fee. This will remain the\nnorm which encourages the use of cash. However, when a person uses a card they\n3% or whatever it is will be charged. This fee will first go to the\nmunicipality it was charged in, then to the state, and then to the federal\ngovernment to pay for the military, roads, and essential things such as\nemployees. Pretty simple right? This makes it so the federal government has to\nget these funds from the state government, who gets it from the local\ngovernment and therefore the federal government must be accountable for how\nthese funds are used and disclosed all the way down to We the People. And lest\nwe forget about our debt, 1/3 of all these funds will go toward the national\ndebt, and we will pay it off and then balance our federal budget every 4 years\nfrom now on barring unforeseen circumstances or legislation for investment\nprojects which will most likely be unnecessary due to our other policies.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nINCOME TAX FOR COMPANIES AND PEOPLE WILL BE\nABOLISHED. These taxes never made sense. We simply didn\u0027t have the technology\nto do any other method before. Now we do. Every transaction done via check, or\ncredit will be charged the fee. A company buys supplies from another company\nthey pay the fee. Get it? THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO TAX COMPANIES THAT CURRENTLY\nOWN THE GOVERNMENT. They will tell us this will drive them out of business this\nis not true. They will simply pass the cost onto the consumer. And because of\ncompetition this addition will be easy to assess as we know the tax rate. The\nconsumer is no longer paying income tax and will be able to afford this\nincrease in the cost of goods. WE COULD ALL AFFORD TO PAY A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR\nSTUFF IF EVERYONE HAD JOBS. This is similar to a consumption tax, but it is\ntruly a transaction tax. It is a tax we all pay everyday right now that is\nreflected in our consumer pricing, and unless you run a business or know about\ncredit card processing you didn\u0027t even know you were paying it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo get to 80% on this issue one of the most common\nquestion was will this hurt the poor? The Cruz people loved it right away as he\nis an advocate for flat tax and reducing the IRS. This will not hit the poor as\nthey do not consume as much as the rich or middle class. Therefore their tax\nburden should be less than it currently is with all the income tax and other\nfees they pay before they even get their paycheck.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFurthermore, most states already have a sales tax,\nin ADDITION to a state income tax. Tax has been a complicated and tense issue\nin the past. In the future the state and fed gov will have assigned percentage\ntransaction tax, and we will remove income tax as we have the technical ability\nto do so with banking partners, and the idea that we are punishing people for\nmaking and saving money is not helping our economy grow.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou Party is amazed at the amount of people who\ndon\u0027t pay taxes at all, that vote for other people to pay for their stuff! They\nsay the \"rich\" people should pay for the poor peoples stuff. Again\n80% of Christians agree. But what they don\u0027t agree with is the money going\nthrough the filter of an extremely inefficient government before it gets to the\npeople they want to help. During conversations with the elderly in socialist\nnations they recall a time where taxes were low, and it was expected people\nhelp each other out, this was what they called the Christian way. Now the\ngovernments have taken over using Christian talking points and\n\"ethics\" meanwhile all but discouraging Christianity in their\nsocieties. Now the governments have led their people deep into debt. During our\nresearch we even came across an article that claimed refugees who were not\nworking actually were growing the economy from all the jobs they created for\npeople who needed to take care of the refugees and who derived their salaries\nfrom the welfare program... Only the guys at Enron could categorize things like\nthat as economic growth. To quote Robbins again, you are either growing or\ndying. People who don\u0027t understand economy just say this is the way it is, we\ncan\u0027t change it. That is not true, and accepting the things to be the way they\nare means accepting our nation and many others are dying. We aren\u0027t growing\neconomically, population growth does not mean true economic growth just based\non the fact that there are more people, that is only true in voodoo economics.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere is a solution to helping those in need. In a\nfamous debate at a college, a well intentioned kid was trying to tell Dinesh\nDisouza because of white privilege, that everyone needs to do things for others\nto help them. Dinesh said ok, you leave your spot at the school and give it to\nsomeone else. This is the problem with the moral imperative. Just to think it\nis nice, to impose it on others is criminal. Taxation is theft. That is why we\npropose your income is never taxes, your consumption has a fee, that fee pays\nfor stuff you can clearly see and benefit from.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy do people that do not believe abortion should\nbe legal have to pay for it? If you believe in abortion so much, why don\u0027t you\nstart a group of people, and since abortion is such an important thing, why\ndon\u0027t all of you band together and create a company or group that pays for\nthese abortions? This is a controversial subject. But the reality of the\nsituation is nearly 8 out of 10 Americans believe in this exact proposal. For\nnon-essential items that our society needs to literally function at the bare\nminimum, the web, social media, and quick and easy money transfer methods make\nit easy to people to organize and fund. Not everything needs to be a divisive\nopportunity for us to lose money and friends.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are not saying everything needs to be privatized.\nWe are simply saying do you think there is any way in hell SNAP is the most\nefficient way to help people get good nutrition? Does ANYONE let alone less\nthan 80% of people think it is a good idea to let people drink soda and eat\njunk food all day, and THEN PAY FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE ON TOP OF IT? We would\nnever vote to restrict anyone\u0027s rights or pursuit of happiness. But again You\nParty does not think Americans should be legislated into economic suicide, and\nbe berated by politicians who say we aren\u0027t Christian enough in our actions but\nwe can\u0027t espouse Christianity in public and we can\u0027t save Christians who are\nbeing genocided in the middle east.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou Party has members of all religions from all\nover the word, but this one issue of hypocrisy is something we all see and\ndisagree with. The vast majority of us cannot believe, that if the government\nstatistics are true, the 20% of kids don\u0027t get enough food IN OUR COUNTRY that\nwe are letting more people in so what, they can starve here too? We cannot except\nthat we spend money on technology to change weather patterns or study senior\ncitizens sex habits when children are hungry. And we cannot imagine electing\nthe same people who have let this be the norm and stand up and shame us like\nits all our fault.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe simple fact is the government has TOO MUCH\nMONEY not too little. They aren\u0027t responsible with it, they aren\u0027t accountable\nfor it, and they darn sure are not transparent about the use of OUR MONEY. Once\nagain we need to find our way back and realize we pay for EVERYTHING and\ntherefore we are the boss. They are elected by us to do a job for us, not tell\nus what to do when they aren\u0027t doing their job.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou Party will be releasing mobile apps and\ninformation about the main priorities of Americans. Our work groups will be\norganizing and creating solutions and avenues to solve these problems. During\nmany tragedies we have seen the generosity of the American people. If Americans\nare empowered t"
