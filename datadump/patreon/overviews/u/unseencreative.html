    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eAs any artist will tell you, there is a constant battle between what you want to create and what you need to create. The whole idea of Patreon is to build community around artists so they can focus more on what they feel drawn to create and less on what will pay the bills. Like any artist, I have paid work, but my true passions lay in concepts and ideas that may not inherently make me money, or at the very least may be very risky financially speaking. I have started this Patreon as a way to hopefully offset some costs associated with those ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo specific ideas I am working on developing, and aim to start producing early 2018 revolve around music and conversation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first idea will be an extension of the sessions I previously made under the name Wildwood (www.youtube.com/welcometowildwood).\u00a0These sessions will be more in depth, four to six songs per artists, will include interview material digging into their roots of why they do what they do, what inspires them, and how they got to where they are, and will be regionally based, meaning all artists will be from one city or region, and will be released as a single season.\u00a0I\u0027ll also be hiring a professional audio engineer to record and mix the sessions so I can focus solely on the visual aspect of the project. These sessions may range all the way from folk to rock, but the main goal that will underline each episode will be raw, honest, truth. Giving viewers an inside look at who the musicians are and how they relate to their local scene.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second idea is a series called The Art of Conversation. I love talking to people as I travel, I find if I allow the time and space for conversation to happen I always walk away with something new. I would like to capture those conversations to challenge people to step out of their comfort zone, take the ear buds out, and engage with the world around them.\u00a0Everyone has a story, you just have to be open to see and hear it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point I cannot offer any specific rewards, but my goal is to make an audio download of the \u00a0music sessions available exclusively to those who subscribe. If either of these ideas resinate with you I would love to chat. Feel free to email or call me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebeseen@unseencreative.com\u003cbr\u003e250.896.6161\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny and all contributions towards this artistic endeavour are much appreciated, but not expected.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all kindly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003eZoltan.\u003c/div\u003e"

What unique experiences and points of view they might have to share with this world? I do. I love talking with people and just listening.

Everyone has a story, you just have to be open to see and hear it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnseen Creative exists to tell those stories. Whether it be through branded content, music, documentary work, or commercial content, at the end of the day an honest true message is what matters above all else. I want to work with you to capture that truth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore I even pick up the camera though, I want to spend time with you. I want to get to know you, to hear about your passions, and experience your perspective of what it is you contribute to your community. In order to fully understand and communicate your story I find it helps to live it along side you, to put myself in your shoes for a period of time. In this way I can work to deliver creatively engaging content that will draw your audience in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work is meant to be invisible.

     "description": "My music session project will be the more financially demanding of the two projects I will be starting early 2018. My hard expenses for the project will include travel to the region I will be filming in (we\u0027ll keep that secret for now), hiring an audio engineer, food, and a inevitable miscellaneous expenses. $3000 is a very rough guess as to what the hard costs to produce the first season will be. LIkely it will cost more, plus all the time I will be putting into the production of it, but it\u0027s a starting point. My goal is to recoup costs by offering the audio from the sessions exclusively to those who subscribe, while the full video episodes would be publicly available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I can reach a monthly goal of $1000 I can comfortable budget, and schedule time to produce two seasons per year, one in the spring and one in the fall. I will be doing these sessions regardless of subscribers and support, but of course support will help make it easier to manage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not wish to make any major content subscriber only.
