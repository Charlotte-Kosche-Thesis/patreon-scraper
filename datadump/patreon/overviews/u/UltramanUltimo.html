Let\u0027s just say I\u0027m currently collabrating with another artist for a kaiju fan film that I\u0027m very sure will knock your socks off once it\u0027s finished. I will however, make an effort to fufill any requests or commissions that I receive from you all. Should it become late for any reason, I will let you all know, life can be like that sometimes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbit further into me, I\u0027m a source filmmaker animator that\u0027s dedicated to capturing the magic of tokusatsu (japanese practical effect films) in my art and videos. \u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s one example, and one of my finest works:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/106228118613530096/6FFD35C3E7405DF571D4D4B147B8AC08C6C62B6B/\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNice huh?\u003cbr\u003eIn my spare time, when I\u0027m not working on animations, I\u0027m also working on importing or locating models for further use in my works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I would like to say I\u0027m not just limited to giant monster content, I\u0027m also fairly interested in TF2 content and the other assets for Blizzard Entertainment\u0027s work, such as Starcraft, Warcraft and Overwatch. So you may see some content of that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a few examples:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/260469602565179478/7AAF80F8A0F7F028D6883BAEAE68C63F48FF4D75/\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/266090679677518315/80B1CB88C3361C7274234D5A80C943DC39693640/\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere on patreon, I\u0027m hoping to raise money and gain income doing what I love, and that is 3d animating and to raise enough money to potentially get a stronger motherboard for my computer to make much better looking content and perhaps make a living doing this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother potential use is to make enough money to commission custom made kaiju models for my fellow tokusatsu fans. The models\n that I commission or haven\u0027t released yet, will become patron-exclusive content available for donators once the initial rigging for them is set up. Once they are, they\u0027ll be usable for renders and \nanimations before release. Which types of models will also be listed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I would also like to point out I\u0027m perfectly capable of doing additional services which will be listed in the rewards portion of this patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, whether you support me or not, I would like to humbly thank you for taking the time to read this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
