From local rappers, artists, performers and civil servants. This is the podcast Hartford deserves, And the one it NEEDS right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be creating a piece of art after each episode with the guest as my inspiration. The process will be documented and posted in featured clips.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m hoping that with your support, this podcast will grow enough to allow me to reach out to more people with greater skills and stories to share. I\u2019m in this for as long as you are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0747/9099/files/how_can_you_help.png?128474233106582968\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe best way to build a space that allows local individuals to showcase their true selves is to be beholden to no one else but the fans. I\u0027m hoping you can help this show grow and be shared around the world and not just in our small state. This is a chance to assist in producing a show that will help shape minds and be a source of creative inspiration instead of \"zone out\" entertainment. Without a doubt, this show should be something people are proud of, and a place for new ideas to be shared. This is just the beginning.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a Patron means you\u0027ll be making a monthly contribution towards the show. Think of it like your Netflix subscription, only the content is free and you get rewarded for your level of contribution. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you care about building a platform for local artists, performers, and interesting people with stories to tell and no outside restrictions at all, then sign up on Patreon right now.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0747/9099/files/where_does_the_money_go.png?128474233106582968\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eEverything so far has been self funded and I already know it will be worth it in the long run. I will have ability to immediately begin creating more content including interviews, live events, new segments and live streaming.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a Patron of Urban Art Flow, you\u0027re allowing us to answer to no one but ourselves and never need to rely on funding from the city, government or any other capricious sources.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m sure some of you will be able to give a lot, some of you just a little, and others will be right in between. But foreal foreal , every dollar counts for us to not just grow, but to keep Urban Art Flow on the air. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve only just begun, think of what we can do and how much further we could go.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e-Issac\u003cbr\u003e"
