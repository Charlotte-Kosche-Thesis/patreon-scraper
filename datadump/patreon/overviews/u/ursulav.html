    "summary": "Hi! My name is Ursula Vernon, and I\u0027m a Hugo-Award winning creator of \nodd little thingies. I did a webcomic called \"Digger\" and I write \nchildren\u0027s books for a living. I also paint odd little pictures, make \nodd little games, build occasional odd little dolls, do a couple odd \nlittle podcasts, and spend a lot of time moving mulch around my garden \nand ranting about weeds. You can see my work, with links to my various books and blogs, at \u003ca href=\"http://www.redwombatstudio.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRed Wombat Studio\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\n enjoy the oddities in general and want to kick in a buck or two as a kind of Keep \nUrsula Weird donation, because you want it to keep going on, I am \ndelighted to put that money toward Weird Food for the podcasts, antacids\n for my co-host, and art supplies for all the rest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have three tiers available. Consider...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \"Buy Ursula Coffee\" fund! For the low, low price of $1 a month, you can buy Ursula a cup of coffee!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Not fancy coffee. Basic drip. Okay, realistically it\u0027s \"buy Ursula half a cup of coffee\" but that doesn\u0027t roll off the tongue as nicely.) Caffeine is vital to the writing process, and allows me to write weird posts and our odd little podcast \"The Hidden Almanac.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr, if you\u0027re feeling wild and crazy, consider supporting at the $2 \"Buy Ursula Antacids!\" level! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn episode of KUEC costs us between $25 and $75 in food and booze. $2 a month equals $24 a year, which means you\u0027ll pay for a whole episode worth of food! Alternately, the fancy prescription antacids I\u0027m on have a $25 co-pay, so you can contribute to keeping my esophagus from being eaten away by my body\u0027s response to the terrible terrible food. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(...and this is why I\u0027m not in marketing, gang.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then there\u0027s the $5 level. Originally it was for my \u003ca href=\"http://www.redwombatstudio.com/portfolio/summer-in-orcus/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003enifty new web-serial.\u003c/a\u003e And then the serial got made! And...err...I don\u0027t have another one lined up immediately. (They take awhile.) So if you support at the $5 level, you contribute to me looking vaguely like a deer in the headlights as I think \"What is happening? Should I do more? Aaaaghhh!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you enjoy what I do, and want it to keep going, and already have too much Stuff and do not want to buy more Stuff because \u003cem\u003esweet mother of goldfish, where are we going to put all this Stuff!?\u003c/em\u003e but you do want me to keep screaming about Lawn Crayfish and traveling to exotic locales where I will be menaced by local wildlife and doodling honey badgers and whatnot, then becoming a patron may be a great option for you. And I\u0027ll certainly be grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your time!\u003cbr\u003e"
