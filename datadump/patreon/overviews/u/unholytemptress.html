    "summary": "Hello there, friends! Welcome to my completely overhauled Patreon page. I recently went back to being a full time influencer and the month I make through Twitch is my only source of income. I am incredibly humbled for the things that your support allows me to do \u0026lt;3 Consider throwing some of your pocket change my way and I\u0027ll do a little jig for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon is a way for you to \"name your price\" on a monthly subscription. It can be canceled at any time. I recommend you read the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFAQ\u003c/a\u003e page if you are unfamiliar with this website. This is a method for people wanting to support the stream monthly with more than a Twitch subscription.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChanges made in June 2017:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eJune 2017 was my last month doing monthly cosplays for Patreon (and in general). Here is an exert from the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://unholytemptress.tv/when-i-lose-my-heart-bring-it-back-to-me/\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e post I wrote explaining why I made this decision.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eYou would think that I would\u2019ve learned by now the dangers of turning something you love in to an additional avenue for income\u2026 it slowly becomes\u2026 something you no longer love. Maybe not the case for everyone, but definitely the case for me. You know this. I know this. Assigning a number to my self worth and confidence as a broadcaster and cosplayer has been incredibly detrimental to my psyche. If the total for my Patreon raised, I felt on top of the world. If the total for my Patreon pledges dropped, I felt lower than low. Suddenly I was questioning ridiculous things like\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u201cAm I pretty enough to be doing this?\u201d\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u201cMaybe if I lost more weight more people would pledge.\u201d\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u201cDid I not spend enough on the custom outfit?\u201d\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u201cWas my quality not good enough?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThose are things I don\u2019t like to question. I don\u2019t like to question myself in general and insecure is really not a good color on me. I\u2019m a perfectionist when I set my mind to something and I wanted to provide the best quality images, the highest quality prints and largest size of prints that made the Patreon worth it for you AND I. As the months passed my insecurities grew into an ugly beast constantly looming over my head to the point where I was checking my Patreon page several times a day to see if anyone pledged or removed their pledge. The dark entity consumed my thoughts and changed how I felt about myself inside and out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003ePatreon \u201ccosplaying\u201d is the wild, wild west of income. The more popular it becomes, the lower the prices people are asking for prints and the more clothes are coming off to build appeal. That\u2019s just not me. I\u2019m not going to provide you with a picture I took with my iPhone 7 Plus, charge you ten dollars for it, and go get it printed out at Walgreens. I\u2019m not going to strip down to my bra, panties, or just go full nude for your money. It\u2019s. Just. Not. Me. I, in no way, have anything against females who do that (make your money, girls!). It\u2019s just not something I\u2019m comfortable with and I always knew my Patreon would never go there. In my mind if I was willing to strip down in front of a camera for money, I would\u2019ve gone in to the cam girl business and be making a whole hell of a lot more money than I am now on Twitch. Obviously that\u2019s a huge leap from still photos to live cam, but that was always my philosophy in terms of if I were to do that myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eLastly, and most importantly, my Patreon is not something I want looming over my career in any industry. This is also a reason I never went full lewd for photoshoots. Years ago I told everyone that Twitch wasn\u2019t the last stop for my career. To be really blunt, it shouldn\u2019t be ANYONE\u2019S last stop (seriously, Twitch won\u2019t be forever, so don\u2019t be naive\u2026 plan ahead, broadcasters). The older I get and the more I plan for my future, the more careful I become with what I set out as my public image. Cosplaying is not a bad thing, cosplaying is beautiful and should be rejoiced and appreciated. Cosplaying, to me, is a form of art\u2026 a skill that is crafted and honed and constantly being tinkered with and worked on. The closer I get to edging myself into a full blown career, the further I want to distance myself from anything that could be considered a point of contention in the hiring process. I already have to battle with the username \u201cUnholytemptress\u201d on a frequent basis, constantly defending the actions of a 13-year-old me with her first XBOX Live account. I don\u2019t like things looming over me or hindering me in any way and when I start to feel like they\u2019re getting in the way, that\u2019s when I have to make the choice of, \u201cis this worth it?\u201d or not. Do we live in a world where you looking \u201ctoo sexy\u201d in a picture can stop you from having a job? Yes. If you answered anything but yes, you\u2019re lying to yourself or naive about how the professional world works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWhile society has come leaps and bounds about women in the working class, your public image, no matter your gender, still has a great impact on what doors will open for you. This is me simply planning ahead, always looking forward, and trying to lay the foundation for a beautiful career in my future. I greatly appreciate everyone who enjoyed and supported me through the Patreon by pledging for digital and physical prints. I had such a blast becoming some of my all time favorite video game and cartoon characters and I hope that you had a blast seeing me go through the process or even enjoying the final products.\u003c/div\u003e"
