    "summary": "Hello there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m crowdfunding on Patreon because the podcast (which I started on a whim) was something that I always wanted to do. I\u0027ve loved listening to podcasts for as long as they\u0027ve been around, and I love unsolved mysteries, so it seemed like a match made in heaven. Utilizing some cheap recording equipment I had available, I got started on the podcast, but quickly realized the extent of the quality I could reach with the equipment on-hand.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast is something that I truly enjoy doing, and something that I\u0027ll keep creating for as long as I can. Not only is it a creative venture for me, it is a labor of love that takes time and effort to keep going.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny funds that I get through Patreon will only go straight into the podcast, helping ensure that I can keep it going by improving my equipment and helping me dedicate more time to the podcast itself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve already put together a handful of episodes, so I think you can all get a good taste of what I\u0027m aspiring to do and create. I don\u0027t want this to ever feel like a burden to any of you... I\u0027m not going to bug you to donate to the podcast to \"keep the lights on.\" This is free entertainment, I totally understand (as the listener of dozens of different podcasts, I know how annoying it can be when creators plead for funding and use guilt like a weapon). I can only hope that if you\u0027re donating to the podcast Patreon page, it\u0027s because you believe in the podcast, you enjoy it, and you would like to see it keep improving in every possible way (and to keep shortening the turnaround on each episode). That\u0027s exactly what I want, too, but unfortunately the day job does make that a hassle at times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, in short, if you feel like you can donate to the podcast, then that is amazing. Thank you. If not, then no harm and no foul. I still thank you for listening to the podcast and (hopefully) enjoying it. That\u0027s all I can ask for.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for checking out this page, and I hope that I\u0027ll be able to keep making these podcasts for as long as possible! =D"
