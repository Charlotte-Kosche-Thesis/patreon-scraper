    "summary": "My name is Mike Frenier, and I have been drawing and painting since I was a little kid. My dad used to bring me to work with him and I would sit around waiting for him to finish, doodling away the hours, filling page after page with all kinds of images that haunted my imagination. At first my main interest was in demons, monsters, and the grotesque, but as I grew older I became obsessed with the surreal and questionable side of the imagination. My beginning two sources of inspiration were Esao Andrews and James Jean, two artists who worked quite differently but both of which filled their horizons with dark and strange images. It wasn\u0027t until around college when I started looking at art more academically and adjusting my focus towards learning foundation. I spent 2 long and hard years studying art while taking classes at a community college. I was able to accomplish things I never thought I would be able to do and for that I am proud, but that journey doesn\u0027t stop there. I am gathering inspiration, formulating an artistic taste, and searching for my true form of expression artistically. I want to take what I\u0027ve learned in this time and push the boundaries of my imagination. I feel as if I am still just an egg that has yet to hatch. So, if you will join me in this journey, any support financially and morally is going to go a long way towards helping me progress and get to the goals which I would like to reach. There are classes I want to take but can\u0027t even begin to afford, any funds that don\u0027t go towards helping me survive and pay for art supplies will be going into savings to help me move forward and expand my education.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis experience with Patreon is new for me and it is likely that how I approach this will undergo changes as I go along. If you have any suggestions as to what you would like to see on here let me know!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by and being a potential supporter of my work!"
