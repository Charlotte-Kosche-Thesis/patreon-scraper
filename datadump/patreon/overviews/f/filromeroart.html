Welcome to my Patreon!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is \u003cstrong\u003eFil Romero, a freelance artist from Michigan.\u003c/strong\u003e Thank you so much for taking the time to check out my page and my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe purpose of this Patreon is to help support me and the work I do\u003c/strong\u003e. Hopefully, through the help of Patreon and my lovely Patrons, I\u0027ll be able to support myself more thoroughly with my art, maybe well enough to make a living through it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i68.tinypic.com/jj791c.png\" style=\"width: 214px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease allow me to tell you a bit more about myself!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs mentioned above, \u003cstrong\u003eI am a freelance artist from Michigan\u003c/strong\u003e. I have been out of college for about three years now and have a \u003cstrong\u003eBachelor of Fine Arts degree in Character Animation\u003c/strong\u003e from the \u003cstrong\u003eCollege for Creative Studies in Detroit\u003c/strong\u003e. I love drawing and animating and have wanted to be an artist ever since watching my first Disney and Studio Ghilbi films as a kid. I love animation of all sorts, and though I\u0027m trained mainly in \u003cstrong\u003e2D traditional animation\u003c/strong\u003e, I do know how to animate digitally, as well as in 3D, and have played in a variety of experimental methods.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I love to draw in general, so besides animation, I also dabble in a handful of other artistic endeavors. These include \u003cstrong\u003echaracter design, comic illustration, 3D modeling, life and anatomy drawing, and video editing.\u003c/strong\u003e One of my joys in life is working on creative projects and making new pieces to show to other people. I love being able to express myself through my art and make static images come to life through the power of animation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently work freelance out of my home, \u003cstrong\u003etaking on commissions from clients online\u003c/strong\u003e. These commissions range from simple character interactions to comic pages to short animations for YouTube videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough I will be posting my art and other projects on here, below are links to \u003cstrong\u003emy art blog\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/strong\u003e, where I have some older work posted:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://filromeroart.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eArt Blog\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/FilipinaR\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube Channel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/FilipinaR\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAlso, please check out the following links, which lead to the webpages where I post my webcomic, \u003cstrong\u003eChameleon Charm\u003c/strong\u003e, as well as updates for the comic.
