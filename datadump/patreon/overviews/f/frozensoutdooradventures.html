    "summary": "Thanks for visiting my Patreon page! It really means a lot that you took the time to find out how you can support Outdoor Adventures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst up a little about me. My real name is Jason but I go by Frozen in the hiking community. A few years ago I felt like I was missing something; I refused to believe that my whole life was going to be centered around waking up, going to work, coming home and repeating it all over again the next day. My friend got me into backpacking and I fell in love with it. Beginning 2014 I started filming my adventures and sharing them on YouTube. As I grew as a hiker and became more experienced, my channel gained popularity. Over the years I\u0027ve met some awesome people whether it was directly from the channel or meeting people while on a trip. It\u0027s the most amazing feeling when someone comments or messages me saying they\u0027ve watched my videos how I\u0027ve helped them break free from the everyday routine to find time and go on their own adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017 I began to seriously start thinking about a dream I had to hike the entire Appalachian Trail, which starts in Georgia and runs about 2200 miles north ending on the summit of Mount Katahdin in Maine. It\u0027s definitely a little scary to quit my job and make the lifestyle change to attempt something this big, but the trail is calling me and it would be a great opportunity for me to take my family, friends, and subscribers along for the ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support I can make this dream a reality."
