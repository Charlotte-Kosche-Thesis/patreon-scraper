    "summary": "Thank you for coming to this magical place where I ask people for money. Please see the two trailers above and below for a crash introduction to my ongoing projects. Both are created from hundreds of thousands of photographs, paint, fire, and a healthy sense of adventure. They were conceived as a contradicting pair four years ago. California on Fire explores current effects of poor stewardship of Earth, while Circuit Board Species celebrates technology; the manufacture of which is the primary source of pollution.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy primary challenge is time. All funding for my work is self-generated from freelance gigs, licensing, and the sale of various art objects, but I have more creative ideas than a single person can possibly realize on their own. Reliable funding will enable me to spend less time doing commercial gigs, more time making art, and hire help. Also, it might allow me to fix a cavity or two if I get really lucky. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange you can go along for the ride without having to risk encounters with meth heads, raging wildfires, and the crippling self doubt every artist is plagued by. Get early access to completed film projects, unreleased versions, early experiments never to be released, tales of madness, behind the scenes access, social media shoutous, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/151154724\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI would like to humbly thank all who support artists! It\u0027s a tough world for a person doing creative things. I don\u0027t mean only me, but I do have a bias for myself, so if you\u0027re here you\u0027re clearly one of the chosen ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Jeff Frost\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Jeff Frost is an artist of many mediums. His best known work combines installation, optical illusion painting, photography, music, and sound design in short films created from hundreds of thousands of photographs. Wildfires, riots, stars at night, and his own optical illusion paintings in abandoned structures are recorded with stop motion and time lapse before being utilized in short films.\u003cbr\u003eFor example, a new work, Circuit Board Species, examines the push-pull of societal decay as a negative consequence of manufacturing technology, while simultaneously employing and celebrating the advancements that made it possible. To create this work Frost traveled to cities around the world including Paris, Dublin and Los Angeles and even created artwork out of CERN\u0027s facilities at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland and France in early 2015. In October of the same year Frost was invited back to give a TED talk about the process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother work in progress, \u003ca href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/frostjeff/firechasers\"\u003eCalifornia on Fire\u003c/a\u003e, examines increasing wildfire activity as a result of human actions by drawing the viewer in with aesthetically pleasing night time lapses of large scale destruction. Frost trained as a firefighter and has traveled to roughly 30 fires between 2014-2016 for this project. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrost has been featured in numerous online publications and interviewed for TV shows such as National Geographic, VICE, Gizmodo and many more as well as occasionally blogging for Huffington Post. U2 commissioned him to video direct and supply visual content for their Innocence + Experience tour (2015). He has received four Vimeo Staff Pick awards and The American Society of Media Photographers (ASMP) named him one of the best photographers of 2014. Frost\u2019s films have been featured at the Palm Springs Museum of Art for the Palm Springs Photo Festival every year since 2012 and in a traveling exhibition in Bangkok for the US Embassy, Nature Nurture 20/20 curated by \u003ca href=\"http://www.farmani.com/\"\u003eHossein Framani\u003c/a\u003e. He has spoken about his work in venues such as TEDxCERN, University of Southern California (USC), Orlando Museum of Art, Snap! Orlando Photo Festival and photoLA.\u003cbr\u003e",
