As the Internet has brought fan cultures closer to both media producers and fan scholars alike - through what \u0027acafan\u0027 Henry Jenkins calls \"convergence culture\" - I believe it\u0027s all the more critical that fan studies be as transparent and open to fans as possible. This course is intended to help that transparency along by walking you through \u003cstrong\u003ewhat fan studies is and how we do it\u003c/strong\u003e. Academic writing is famously hard to read, sometimes in ways that shut others out of the conversation; as such, one goal of this course is to equip you with the tools - history, vocabulary, concepts - needed to make sense of scholarship.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is \u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e the kind of fan studies course you might find offered at a university, insofar as it begins in the assumption that \u003cstrong\u003eyou are already a fan\u003c/strong\u003e (or, at least, are familiar with media fandom). I won\u0027t be explaining fan fiction, vids, cons, and so on; rather, I\u0027ll be talking about \u003cstrong\u003ewhat fan studies scholars talk about when we talk about these things\u003c/strong\u003e. As meta is best understood as an ongoing conversation within a given fandom or fan culture, scholarship is best understood in the context of the academic conversations it\u0027s participating in - conversations that I\u0027ll go into over the course of these lectures.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://lorimorimoto.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/004.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRather than a monthly subscription, \u003cstrong\u003ethis Patreon bills patrons by creation\u003c/strong\u003e, typically a new lecture (blog post). \u003cstrong\u003eYou will only be charged for lecture (creation/content) blog posts\u003c/strong\u003e; all other blog posts intended for communication only will not be charged. I currently anticipate \u003cstrong\u003e10 lectures\u003c/strong\u003e in this first offering (\u003cstrong\u003ebeginning September 1, 2017\u003c/strong\u003e), and the response to this series will help me decide whether or not to continue it with more specialized topics. \u003cstrong\u003eYou may change OR withdraw your patronage at any time\u003c/strong\u003e, and always with my thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://lorimorimoto.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/004.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll patrons will have access to both a \u003cstrong\u003ewritten\u003c/strong\u003e (blog post) lecture and an\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eaudio \u003c/strong\u003eversion of it. The audio will be downloadable for ease in taking it with you, while the blog post version will allow you to spend some time with the details of the discussion. Higher reward tiers include \u003cstrong\u003eaccess to extra resources\u003c/strong\u003e and more direct access to me through\u003cstrong\u003e scheduled Q\u0026amp;A sessions. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://lorimorimoto.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/004.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eMost importantly (to me), your patronage will contribute to my continued participation in media fan studies as an independent scholar by helping to \u003cstrong\u003efund library access\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003econference participation\u003c/strong\u003e. For this, above all, I\u0027m truly grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://lorimorimoto.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/004.gif\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lorimorimoto.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/004.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbout me\u003c/strong\u003e: I completed a PhD in Communication and Culture at Indiana University Bloomington in April 2011. My thesis was a study of Japanese women fans of Hong Kong films and stars in the 1980s and 1990s, a product of my own Japan-based (if not actually Japanese) fandom of them during the same period. I\u0027m currently in the early stages of preparing a book manuscript based on my thesis; in the meantime, I publish on transcultural fan cultures, \u0027transfandom\u0027 intersections, fan studies, and \u003cem\u003eHannibal\u003c/em\u003e.
