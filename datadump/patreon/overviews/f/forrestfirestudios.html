My name is Forrest Heck. If you\u2019re familiar with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dreamscarred.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDreamscarred Press\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, you might recognize me as one of their creative directors, the design lead for \u003cem\u003ePsionics Augmented: Occult\u003c/em\u003e, and a writer/public face/playtest runner (including \u003cem\u003ePath of War: Expanded\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and \u003cem\u003eDivergent Paths: Fool\u0027s Errand\u003c/em\u003e)\u00a0under the username of Forrest or Forrestfire.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my work at DSP, I\u0027ve been working on some of my own projects (sometimes in collaboration with Dreamscarred, sometimes not).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u0027s this then?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThis Patreon is about homebrew, kinda-sorta. My hope and plan is to do at least one small to medium-sized piece of Pathfinder material each month, uploading them towards the end of the month for feedback and use. Some of these things will be character options, some might be variant rulesets, some might be collections of feats or races or items, and who knows what else. There\u0027s a lot of creative freedom involved here, and if I have an interesting, oddball, or fun idea that I take a liking to, I plan on writing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe various in-progress documents I make for this Patreon will be available to anyone who wants to see or use them, not just patrons. However, once a given project is good and finished, my plan is to put the final versions on DriveThruRPG \u00a0and Paizo.com, or potentially submit them to larger 3pp publishing companies. Patrons will receive PDF copies of these final versions, as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther Companies and Publishing\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s quite possible that Dreamscarred Press (or another publisher, if applicable) will decide that they want to purchase my work and publish it under their own banner. In that case, while I will be distributing and working on these products myself, I\u0027ll be handing them over to the company in question and taking them down from public view once they\u0027re released, similarly to how our playtests work. In this case, as I\u0027m not the one doing the publishing, not all patrons will receive final copies; only the $10 tier will. Not everything I write will be suitable for DSP, but some of it definitely will be incorporated into Dreamscarred Press\u0027 larger library of third-party Pathfinder products.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBut what are you actually writing?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eRight now, my current project is the Avowed, a\u00a0reinterpretation of the D\u0026amp;D Warlock with occult/psychic fluff and an emphasis on unique pacts as the source of their power. It can be found in the Google Drive link above.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also tinkering with some other concepts that I\u0027ve got skeletons and ideas for, including the following:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBard 2: The Bardening\u003c/strong\u003e\u2014A base class inspired by the bard, with expanded thematic options built around their music and styles, along with magical combat and utility abilities (instead of spells) that are tied to that music. Not an \"unchained bard,\" per se, but more like a bard-based sequel to the class.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eUnchained Cleric\u003c/strong\u003e\u2014 A base class built around on bringing the Cleric more in line with 6-level casters and similar characters, and focusing more fully on its fluff as a divine agent than merely having spells.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUnchained Soulknife\u003c/strong\u003e\u2014Mind blades as a set of feats, with a revamped Soulknife that gains these feats and uses them in unique and powerful ways. Will be compatible with all existing Soulknife archetypes, either by rewriting them to fit, absorbing them as options in the new class, or detailing in an appendix how they\u0027re altered to work with the new class.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMounts\u003c/strong\u003e\u2014A variant system for mounted combat that models mounts as something more like character abilities instead of fully-separate creatures, allowing them to be more easily balanced and used.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTech and Mechs\u003c/strong\u003e\u2014Variant rules for guns, technological items, vehicles, and mecha. This system will expand on the mounts system I plan on writing, and so won\u0027t happen until after that\u0027s under way. Alternatively, the mounts will expand on the tech system. Either works.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eA set of multiclass-focused feats\u003c/strong\u003e like those found in \u003cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003ePsionics Augmented: Occult\u003c/em\u003e, but this time for any class pairings that I feel like writing for and fit well together. Not every pairing will get a feat (it\u0027d take forever to write them), but there\u0027ll be quite a few of them.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExpanded Favored Class Bonuses\u003c/strong\u003e\u2014a much more flexible and customizable set of FCBs for each of the Pathfinder classes, and the FFS classes, as well as potentially DSP classes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMage\u0027s Magnificent Skymarket\u003c/strong\u003e\u2014a set of magic items based on fluffy utility, including magical food/recipes, clothing options, and a whole pile of cheap items called \"trinkets\" with non-mechanical effects. Will also include variant rules, sometimes races, or even PrCs, depending on what fits thematically with a given release.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn any case, whether you\u0027re just passing through to take a look or a patron, thanks for visiting this page, and I hope you enjoy the material I\u0027ve written.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m always happy to take feedback regarding my work; a good way to give your thoughts is shooting me a PM on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.giantitp.com/forums/member.php?23877-Forrestfire\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGiant in the Playground\u003c/a\u003e or posting in my thread on \u003ca href=\"http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2twzb?Forrestfire-Studios-A-new-company-a-unique#1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePaizo\u0027s forums\u003c/a\u003e.
