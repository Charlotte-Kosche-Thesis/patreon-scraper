In September of 2015 we set out to make a vlog\u00a0with one main purpose: To show people a picture of family that provided hope and inspiration to those who did not have any.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSomething Different\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe saw a lot of vlogs out there but the family ones all felt the same. Picture perfect families showing their picture perfect moments and teaching people how to do stuff. Well, we\u0027re not picture perfect and we\u0027re not good at teaching people how to do stuff. So, we wanted to make a vlog for everyone else out there.\u00a0We want to reach people who are disgruntled with what family has become and are looking for ideas and inspiration towards change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Fight\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe call it Fight For Together because we believe intimacy and togetherness with God is the most important thing in the universe. And God gives us family to help understand relationship. So, we believe family is worth fighting for. And it IS a fight. Family relationships are the toughest relationships which is why we wanted to become missionaries instead of face toddlers or our parents. But, \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e, as it turns out, was taking the easy way out. And we believe that understanding and investing in family is better.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoin Us\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe are committed to sharing this message and have done it for the first year without funding of any type. We are looking for partners who support our vision because we want to keep our platform ad-free and do not want to be held captive to any corporation or sponsorship. We just want to share honestly, with our lives, what we have been given. NO AMOUNT IS TOO SMALL. Thank you for your consideration in the hopes that others would benefit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFighting for together,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBen (DAD)\u003cbr\u003eKami (MOM)\u003cbr\u003eDove (16)\u003cbr\u003eEden (14)\u003cbr\u003eSeven (13)\u003cbr\u003eMemory (11)\u003cbr\u003eFilia (6)\u003cbr\u003eRainier (2)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS.
