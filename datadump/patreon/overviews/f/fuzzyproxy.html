    "summary": "HI there, I\u0027m Adrian, known on the internet as Fuzzy Proxy! I\u0027m a chiptune artist, composer, audio engineer, podcaster, and general terrible joke-maker on the internet. I also run the netlabel\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://outandloudrecords.bandcamp.com/\"\u003eOut \u0026amp; Loud Records\u003c/a\u003e, a queer-centric electronic music outlet!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been at my various schticks for many years now, operating by working day jobs and engaging in what I\u0027m passionate about on the side either for freelance commission income or for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve thought long and hard about setting up a Patreon, about what it would even entail, about how to reward people who do like what I do, and figuring out incentives to keep the creative content flowing. I think I have finally figured a few things out, and hope you will all either continue to join me on this neat ride of content or hop on for the first time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusic, huh?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCorrect! I\u0027ve been actively making chiptune since 2014, but have been composing since 2003. My undergrad focuses were in composition and wind conducting, and I actually finished up my graduate degree in music technology \u0026amp; digital media at the University of Toronto back in June 2017!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find links to my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://fuzzyproxy.bandcamp.com\"\u003eBandcamp\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/fuzzy-proxy\"\u003eSoundCloud\u003c/a\u003e here to check out my stuff, and I will be sharing additional work on my portfolio, including short films I have scored or podcasts I have scored!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy music is my main form of artistic expression, and it ranges from well within established chiptune boundaries to way beyond it. I want to keep my art as raw a form of expression for myself as possible, but at the end of the day I still don\u0027t make much money on chiptune. However, with your monthly support, that will keep my creativity in check, will keep my output more consistent, and will result in a lot more intriguing works from this chiptune cat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePodcasts, too?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s right! I currently co-host the anime podcast\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.soundcloud.com/lacking-ani-respect/\"\u003eLacking Ani Respect\u003c/a\u003e (co-run by the excellent Devon Carter, who runs the fantastic JRPG podcast Dead Genre Chronicles). In addition, I edit podcasts on the side, including my work on the car racing podcast The Grid Girls!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your continued monetary support, I\u0027ll be able to focus less on where my next meal or cup of coffee will come from and more on making these podcasts sound excellent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eThat\u0027s an excellent question! I firmly believe that I spend far too much of my own time worrying about money. That affects my ability to do my work. If I get a little bit of money for actually doing my work, not only will it increase output, it\u0027ll also ensure that I have a roof over my head and food on my table. This will also be kicking me in the ass to get to doing more of the content I\u0027ve wanted to do lately, including composition/production streams and tutorials!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut most importantly: I want to be able to make more stuff for you all to see and engage with. Here\u0027s to the new content and direction, and I hope you\u0027ll join me!\u003cbr\u003e"
