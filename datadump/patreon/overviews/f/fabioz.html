    "summary": "Hi there, first let me introduce myself: I\u0027m Fabio Zadrozny, I\u0027m a senior software developer and I\u0027ve been developing open source software for a long time (12 years and counting).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis funding was created as a way for the users of PyDev, PyDev.Debugger and LiClipseText to show its appreciation and help me to keep on improving those... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, really, all funding obtained here goes directly to the development of PyDev, PyDev.Debugger \u0026amp; LiClipseText... PyDev (and its debugger) as the main actor (for Python dev) and LiClipseText as its helpful sidekick (for when you need to go into C/C++, Django Templates, HTML, JavaScript, etc).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see more information for those at:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.pydev.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.pydev.org\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/fabioz/PyDev.Debugger\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://github.com/fabioz/PyDev.Debugger\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.liclipse.com/text/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.liclipse.com/text\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eNow, why Patreon, why not another more \"regular\" crowdfunding with a goal for a set of features? Well,\u00a0this is actually the 3rd crowdfunding I\u0027m doing for working on PyDev and I think that after 12 years working on it -- I hope -- that users already recognize that I\u0027m very committed in making those always better (i.e.: just take a look at \u003ca href=\"http://www.pydev.org/history_pydev.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.pydev.org/history_pydev.html\u003c/a\u003e). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this sense, I believe that the structure that Patreon provides is better suited for the long run (without having to spend precious time each year creating yet another crowdfunding instead of actually improving the code).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way it works is that Patreon will charge monthly on the 1st of each month (which means you\u0027re able to change your contribution at any time until then) -- note: although the monthly contributions on Patreon are the best for continuously helping those projects to be properly funded, you can still make a one time contribution at \u003ca href=\"http://www.pydev.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.pydev.org\u003c/a\u003e if you feel you\u0027re not ready to contribute monthly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, this doesn\u0027t mean I don\u0027t have anything planned... in the short run, PyDev needs to improve the support for Python 3.6 (PyDev 5.4.0 is already a good step in this direction, but it still has a number of open issues), and medium term I expect to be able to work in making it easier to setup projects and improving the workflows for users which deal with developing software remotely (such as in a different vm or a python board). As for LiClipseText, the focus is on improving the support for TextMate grammars and overall performance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e For the long run, I hope that those which are funding this project will also help in voicing their own opinions (and I\u0027ll probably never be able to do everything users have already reported at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.brainwy.com/tracker/PyDev\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.brainwy.com/tracker/PyDev\u003c/a\u003e, but I can definitely keep on continuously improving it ?).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you enjoy using the software I\u0027ve developed so far, it\u0027d be really nice to be able to count with your support to keep on improving it, and if you really can\u0027t support it, please help in spreading the crowdfunding to keep those projects steadily going!\u003cbr\u003e"
