    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eHello guys, my name is Fx and... I need your help!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I have been doing YouTube videos for the best part of 2+ years now and over that time I have been lucky enough to earn money for doing what I love to do and that is making gaming videos and entertaining peoples!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, over the past few months to a year, YouTube has implemented some awful policies which means that your favourite YouTubers are getting hit with various negative side effects when it comes to financial income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the most part, it has never effected me directly. I vary rarely get hit with a copyright notification (YouTube has recognised either a piece of music or a cut scene as copyrighted and thus has marked it as \u0027unable to be monetized\u0027) but recently, I have been hit with a NEW advertising review policy whereby MOST of my videos are now being deemed \u0027not suitable for most advertisers\u0027 which means - exactly what it says. This could be because of swearing from yours truly (I might be biased but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s THAT BAD...) or it could be (and most likely) because of the nature of the game I am playing. Unless it\u0027s a PG - happy go friendly game, I\u0027m in trouble!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo the reason why I have started this Patreon page is to help with the continuation of this channel. I am not begging for money, but if you like what I do and you want me to keep doing YouTube at the rate I am currently, I am unfortunately going to need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t know what Patreon is (and to be honest, I am still fairly new to it) it is a pay monthly subscription service, kind of like Twitch and Gamewisp but on here, there is no limit or set price you have to pay. So that means you can pay $1 all the way upto $8912723981723981 - the latter means that you get a personal lap dance from yours truly!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo! If you have some spare change lying around at the back of your sofa or you feel like you don\u0027t need that extra (insert money figure here) each month and would like to throw it my way; feel free to click the button that says \u0027become a patron\u0027 and let\u0027s see how this thing does!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have not thought of any way of paying you back for your contribution as of yet (paying back in the metaphor kinda sense, not literal). Other than continuing to produce content and stream, I would like to have a more personal touch to my patrons. Be it something like talking to you guys once a month on here or answering any questions you have or whatever. That is something I will look into in more detail in the near future, if this thing takes off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to take time in the last paragraph to say thank you to anyone who would like to contribute to the continuation and growth of FxGamerOfficial. From the bottom of my heart, you have kept me a happy man, allowing me to keep doing what I love and that is entertain your beautiful face. Thanks, boss!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Paul\u003cbr\u003eFxGamerOfficial\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
