    "summary": "THANK YOU for checking out the Frameable Faces Patreon Page!!!\u00a0 We are Doug \u0026amp; Ally Cohen and we own and operate Frameable Faces Photography - an independent mom \u0026amp; pop studio in West Bloomfield, Michigan in the USA.\u00a0 We have been livestreaming from our studio since March 2015 and we\u0027ve been in this location for almost 10 years!\u00a0 Ally is the photographer and Doug is the marketing guy, and our strategies have been featured on Social Media Examiner, SmallBizTrends and The Huffington Post.\u00a0 We have been featured panelists at Summit Live and Podcast Movement and we have trended on Periscope where we are Silver VIP Superbroadcasters with over 22,000 followers worldwide!\u00a0 We have an amazing community that really gives us life, and we have a zany time that often goes off the rails on our Doug \u0026amp; Ally Morning Show on Periscope T-F (\u0026amp; sometimes Sat) sometime between 8:30-11 AM EST.\u00a0 But even when it goes off the rails the ground rules of positive vibes and NO politics always applies.\u00a0 We share our lives and our knowledge and there have been many requests for a platform where we can be more focused with training and helping people with their own photography, social media approach for their own small business and entrepreneurial endeavors.\u00a0 It\u0027s hard to accomplish that with the freewheeling live setting with a wide open audience on Periscope and a dedicated platform with a subscription service would allow us to prepare some content with real value for folks in a sustainable way.\u00a0 A win win for everyone!"
