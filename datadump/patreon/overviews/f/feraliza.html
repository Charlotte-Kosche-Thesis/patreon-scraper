So Feral Tech is about moving forward with all our technology and knowledge gained from \"civilization\" into a new age, connected with each other and in touch with our environment.\u00a0 \u00a0So I\u0027m using all the technology available to me, to show you all exactly what I mean by that, in the real world, via the internet.\u00a0 Feral Tech is about doing the best you can with what you\u0027ve got.\u00a0 It\u0027s about ingenuity and thinking outside the boxes and prescribed way of doing things.\u00a0 It\u0027s about resourcefulness.\u00a0 It\u0027s not about being perfect, it\u0027s about improving, growing and embracing the magic in every moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor most of my life I have lived happily moving from town to town busking and taking gigs where they are offered.\u00a0 It\u0027s been me and my guitar since I left home in Auckland as a teenager.\u00a0 In my early days I refused to even sing through a microphone, let alone record anything.\u00a0 I refused to raise myself above my audience by standing on a stage.\u00a0 If you heard me play, it was an exclusive, one off, intimate experience.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen I was convinced by a dear friend of the importance of sharing the music with as many people as possible, because it is the gift I have for the world.\u00a0 So I played my first gig on a stage through a microphone, and made my first ever recording in early 2009, before I left NZ for Australia.\u00a0 When I arrived in Brisbane and quickly made my way to Byron Bay, I was swept into a whole new creative journey that took me all over the East Coast from Tropical North Queensland to Tasmania and everywhere between.\u00a0 I joined a band called The Walkers and walked from town to town with a trolley full of instruments playing in all the country pubs along the way.\u00a0 I recorded my first EP, Feral Eyes, with Kit \u0026amp; Kaboodle Productions, in Uki, NSW, and in 2012 I had a baby!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI returned to NZ in 2016 and in 2017 recorded a new album, Happy Thoughts, at Sandy Bay studios in Marahau, found a lost set of recordings from 2015 at InTents studios\u00a0 that I brought to light as \"The Grand Distraction\" EP, and made my first music video for my song \"Welcome to Wonderland\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I have returned to Australia, and in the last weeks of 2017 long term patrons of my art have gifted me with all I need to set up my own portable recording studio, a new laptop with which to make all sorts of magic happen, and a loop station!\u00a0 All with perfect timing, as this long time traveler reaches the stage in life to put down roots for an extended time, in Stanthorpe, South East Queensland, with family and long term projects to keep me busy and creative locally.\u00a0 But busking in a small town cannot support anybody for so long!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter Patreon...\u00a0 My new internet based global busking spot, if you will!\u003cbr\u003eNow you can all share the journey of my creative expansion in all sorts of new directions.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a Patron, you will have access to all my diverse exclusive content, regular uploads of music, video, visual art, poetry, comedy and more.\u00a0 Brand new songs, new versions of old ones, you might even get the odd cover (if you\u0027re lucky)\u00a0 It will get political, it will get philosophical, it will get ridiculous, but it will always stay authentic and real.\u00a0 And your support will give me the regular income I need to be able to put all my energy exactly where it needs to go!\u00a0 Into my family, community and creativity.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to getting to know you better on my feral tech forums!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
