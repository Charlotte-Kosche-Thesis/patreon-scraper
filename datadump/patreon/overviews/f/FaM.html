The best way we\u0027ve found to describe the shows we put on, is a cross between WWE programming and an action movie. It\u0027s not just wrestling, but instead, a highly cinematic and indepth viewing experience, that many fans have fallen in love with over the 7 and a half years we\u0027ve been active.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do we have a Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFaM has always been non-profit and we have always given these shows that takes 100s of hours to put together to the fans, for FREE! And we will never change that. However, we\u0027ve always wanted to bring the fans more, more and MORE. Patreon will allow us to give this to the fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does the money go towards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money generated through the Patreon will go towards a few things. The first includes the production side of things, paying for the upgrading of equipment, buying members equipment where needed, etc. This money is also used for the real people who work on FaM. As mentioned previously, FaM takes a lot of work, 100s of hours, so if someone who sacrifices all those hours can take some money from the Patreon to help pay some bills that month or to help put food on the table, that\u0027s a massive help to them.\u003c/div\u003e"
