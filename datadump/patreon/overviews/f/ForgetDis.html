Certain episodes will explain how music therapy can be a tool for growth in multiple areas, and other episodes will provide communities, caregivers, and individuals alike with valuable information for interacting and treating people with disabilities with respect and dignity. \"Forget Dis!\" aims to change perceptions of people who are differently abled by focusing instead on what they can do and what they do for their communities every day."
