Second, if you enjoy the soundtrack genre of music (Like say for example at the end of movies you\u0027d listen constantly to the film themes during the credits), then I\u0027m pretty sure you\u0027re gonna like the stuff I work on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI set up Patreon as a means for you to help me with my musical career. Its not cheap, it involves a lot of work (and travel), so it is a really good way to help me out with all that stuff. Here\u0027s some examples of what it goes to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e- Costs for filming, promotion and production of upcoming albums.\u003cbr\u003e- Flights, accommodation for conventions around the world.\u003cbr\u003e- Studio upgrades, including microphones, keyboards, audio interfaces, sound libraries\u00a0and everything needed to keep expanding and give you the most epic sound imaginable.\u003cbr\u003e- Hiring costs of musicians.\u003cbr\u003e- Producing runs of CDs for all my albums with all associated costs\u003cbr\u003e- Paying the rent towards the studio space\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eYou can get access to exclusive stuff from as low as the $1 a month perk, to originally composed music for the higher tiers. Have a look on the right, see if anything interests you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!
