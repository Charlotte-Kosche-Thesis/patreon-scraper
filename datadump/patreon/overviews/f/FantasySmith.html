    "summary": "2017 Update - I have totally revamped the www.PrinceArmory.com website and am populating the galleries extensively over the next few months with over a decade of past projects, it will take some time. \u00a0The next stage will be populating a private galleries section where I upload the WIPS of those projects for you Patreon supporters to access. \u00a0I really encourage you guys to check the site as it has a lot more content and if you\u0027re looking for design reference and inspiration the galleries will have it in abundance.\u003cbr\u003e-----------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eGreetings all! Thanks for checking out my campaign.\u00a0 This page is brand new and I\u0027ve still got a lot to do on it. My first phase will be in terms of freeing up some of my time so I can create \u0027content for everyone\u0027.\u00a0 I\u0027ll also be thinking about incentives for individuals.\u00a0 If you have requests feel free to get in touch.\u003cbr\u003e-----------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always so busy with the elaborate private client projects for Prince Armory I rarely have time for much else.\u00a0 And though I am passionate about what I do, I would also like to cater to a broader audience.\u00a0 Well, with your support I can begin to divert focus to a variety of things that I believe would be of great value to anyone interesting in leather working, costuming, cosplay, crafting, design, and fantasy things in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m talking about guides, books, videos, tutorials, blogs, articles, reviews, live-streams, Q\u0026amp;A sessions, pod casts, projects just for the sake of art, and anything else you guys want to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me offer one example of one of the first things I would start doing with your support.\u00a0 I collect numerous images and videos of my projects as I go and have for years.\u00a0 However 99% of this is never seen.\u00a0 This includes additional high res close up images, loads of Work In Progress images and even some video WIP highlights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, when I complete a project I process the few portfolio shots and archive the rest.\u00a0 What I would like to start doing is retroactively go through my best works and create elaborate articles that talk about the components and processes in depth along with revealing countless unseen WIPS and alternative angles.\u00a0 And of course gather even better documentation of future projects with more videos and tutorials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll show you what I\u0027m talking about, below is a screenshot of my image folder for the Asgardian Iron Knight project: 4.37Gigs and 684 files.\u00a0 And that\u0027s just one project. My primary \"Work\" folder is currently about 240GB with 208,000 files with most of that being images and videos.\u00a0  That is a lot of content I can use to make some really great stuff.\u00a0 And that\u0027s just the beginning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to help make this happen, consider contributing to\n the cause. The more funding received, the sooner I can transition\n time into creating content for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://princearmory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screenshot-2016-06-15-04.29.52-1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
