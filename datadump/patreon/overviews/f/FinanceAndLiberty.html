    "summary": "The independent media is under attack. Google is changing it\u2019s search result algorithms, and this change appears to be hurting the independent media.\u003cbr\u003eFinanceAndLiberty and many other independent news YouTube channels are experiencing reduced revenue. FinanceAndLiberty earnings and views from the first quarter of 2017 were down nearly 50% compared to one year ago. My goal is to continue running my independent media outlet and create even more quality content. So, I\u2019ve created a Patreon account. If you\u2019d like to be a supporter, simply make a pledge! Once we reach our $2000 per month goal, I will create an exclusive podcast featuring one of you. Yes, I will be interviewing one Patreon subscriber per month and let them tell their own story of how they woke up to the reality of our fraudulent financial system and the importance of owning real money. I want to build a community of like minded individuals. If you can make a monetary pledge to help FinanceAndLiberty, then awesome! Go to patreon.com/FinanceAndLiberty pledge as little as $1 per month. I understand that not everyone can pay for extra content, and I want the community to be open to everyone! I will be sending out the special monthly podcasts in the FinanceAndLiberty newsletter as well. Sign up by CLICKING HERE or going to FinanceAndLiberty.com."

In recognition of Elijah\u0027s unique message, he has even been invited to speak at the Liberty Mastermind Symposium, a national conference.",
