    "summary": "Good morning, Videogames! We are Filthy Casuals: a weekly video games podcast based in Melbourne, Australia, hosted by Tommy Dassalo, Ben Vernel and Adam Knox.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur show was born out of the three of us being mates and realising that our drunken conversations regularly turned to the topic of video games. We realised that none of us had seen the kind of podcast about video games that we wanted to listen to: a show that didn\u0027t stress too much about being the most informative or up-to-date show, but that was consistently funny and engaging.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last two years, the show has boomed in numbers. We have fans all over the world who interact with us every week and seem to genuinely enjoy what we do. This is extremely gratifying! We all love doing our show and we want to make it better and make more and more content for the people who enjoy listening to it every week. The reality is, the three of us all have a heap of other stuff going on so factoring in the time to do this is difficult. Plus, video games aren\u0027t cheap, so while we\u0027re lucky enough to be on a couple of press lists, for the most part, we have to spend our own money to buy the games that we review and talk about on the show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why we\u0027re on Patreon. If you like what we do, chip in a little coin each month and you\u0027ll get some (we think) sweet rewards. We worked hard to make sure these are interesting and good and hopefully things that you\u0027ll find worthy of your money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a while, people have been asking us to start making video content. Once we hit our monthly target on here, that\u0027ll give us the freedom to prioritise the time and work involved in starting and maintaining a video channel. We already have some great ideas for a range of different video subjects and we can\u0027t wait to share them with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, everyone\u0027s circumstances are different and we understand that not everyone is in a position to contribute and that\u0027s totally fine. When we do start up our video channel, rest assured: NONE of it will be hidden behind a paywall. It will be free and available to everyone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that\u0027s it! Thanks for reading this far and thanks again if you decide to contribute. It\u0027s extremely gratifying to know that people enjoy our half-baked and ill-informed opinions about games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd as we say at the end of every Patreon blurb: *Knox starts sweating and mumbles something incoherent*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Tommy, Ben \u0026amp; Adam"
