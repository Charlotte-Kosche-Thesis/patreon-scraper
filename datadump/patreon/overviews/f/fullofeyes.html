He is the incarnation of the eternal,\nself-revealing Word of God. He is the living exegesis of the invisible God, the\nname of God spoken in space and time, the glory of God radiated through flesh\nand blood, the Son whom to see is to see the Father and whom to know is to know\nthe only true God.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd\u2014wonder of wonders!\u2014the sovereignly chosen climax of\nJesus\u2019 ministry of God-revealing redemption comes when He pours Himself out in\nlove to the point of death on a Roman cross. Worldviews are baffled, paradigms\nare controverted, and entire universes of philosophical thought are shattered\nand re-forged when we realize that Yahweh God\u2014maker of heaven and\nearth\u2014definitively communicates Himself to creation in the crucified and risen\nman, Jesus Christ. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nall things exist for the glory of God, and if God is\nsupremely made known in the one who died and rose again, then we align\nourselves with the purpose of reality when we\u2014by the Spirit\u2014look to the cross\nso that we might know and love the Father through His slain and risen Son.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is why Full of Eyes exists.  My goal is to help people see and savor the\nfaith-strengthening, hope-instilling, love-kindling beauty of God in Christ.\nAnd I do this by creating free exegetical art in the form of pictures,\nanimations, and discussion guides. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFour Specific Emphases\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBiblical\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 God has authoritatively revealed Himself to us in\nScripture. If we are going to know and love Him, we must meet Him in His Word.\nTherefore, I apply the same rigorous exegetical principles that would go into\npreparing a sermon as I create these art pieces. If my work is to serve the\nChurch, it must be rooted in, saturated with, and communicative of Scripture. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nChristocentric\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 Within Scripture, God\u2019s supreme\nself-revelation is His Son, Jesus Christ\u2014and especially the Son\u2019s work of\nrevelatory redemption at the cross. Therefore the art of Full of Eyes is\nuniquely centered on the person and work of Christ.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nEvangelistic\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 Every piece of art that I create is born from\na desire to make the person and work of Christ more weighty, compelling, and\nprecious to the viewer\u2014whether they are saved or not-yet saved. This is what I\nmean by \u201cevangelistic.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nAffectional\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 Jonathan Edwards once said that he considered\nit his duty in preaching to raise the affections of his hearers as high as he\npossibly could\u2014provided they were affected by nothing but truth. This concept\ninforms my art. By God\u2019s grace, I want Full of Eyes to haunt hearts and kindle\naffections with the terrors and beauties of the gospel of the glory of Christ.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThree Main Undertakings\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nPictures\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 Each weekday I create a simple picture based on a\nshort text of Scripture (usually from my morning reading), while each month I\ndesign two or three more involved exegetical pieces. In creating these monthly\npictures I employ many of the tools used in traditional sermon preparation\n(studies in the original languages, discourse analysis, outlining, considering\nbiblical theological allusions, seeking to discern authorial intent, etc.). It\nis a true joy to see my training from Bethlehem College \u0026amp; Seminary used by\nthe Lord in this way.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nAnimations\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 Animations are the central labor of Full of\nEyes and usually take between three and four months of work to complete.\nThey\u2019re often based on a song that highlights some element of the person and\nwork of Christ, though recently I\u2019ve been moving toward  more \u201cexegetical animations\u201d built on\ninstrumental music and spoken Scripture. In either case the motivating desire\nis the same: to communicate something of the all-surpassing and soul-satisfying\nbeauty of God as He is climactically revealed in the crucified and risen Son.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nDiscussion Guides\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 Since 2014 I\u2019ve been making discussion\nguides that go along with each animation. These guides are intended to help\nsmall groups or individuals explore the scriptural and theological concepts\nthat fuel a particular animation\u2019s imagery.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
