    "summary": "Asalamualaykum Friends! If you\u0027re here, you probably already know about my YouTube channel and who I am (i hope!). And if you\u0027ve made it as far as this page, you\u0027re probably a true supporter of what I am trying to put out on the interwebs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you guys probably also know, most YouTubers make money through ad revenue, this means that they can make an entire living from posting YouTube videos and collecting their ad money every month. However, a long long long time ago, I decided not to have adverts on any of my YouTube videos as I wanted to insure that all of the money I earned was \u003cstrong\u003ehalal as possible\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am aware that you can filter the types of ads that one can have on his/her videos, but when I had tried that, it still showed videos that I just did not approve of. I do not want my viewers to be advertised alcohol, gambling or any other adverts that contradicts with my (or my viewers\u0027) faith. Likewise, I would not want to take money from those companies who offer immoral products (or moral products but in immoral ways).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI therefore made a conscious decision to \u003cstrong\u003edeactivate \u003c/strong\u003eadverts on my videos. Now, 2 years in to making videos and 20,000 subscribers along, \u003cstrong\u003eI am happy to say that I have never been paid by Google or YouTube\u003c/strong\u003e for any of my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that being said, do I think YouTubers \u003cem\u003eshould \u003c/em\u003eget paid for videos? \u003cstrong\u003eOFCOURSE.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor a long time I have had a sense of shyness or guilt for attempting to make money from my YouTube channel in some way, however, I have now come to the acceptance that\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003emaking 2 or 3 videos a week means taking hours and hours out of my day to produce \u0026amp; edit such videos. I believe that content creators should not feel guilty for feeling that they (just like any other job) have a right to earn a living doing what they love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe truth is that the more time I take to produce content that is loved by 20,000+ people, means that it is also time spent away from my job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have therefore decided to open a patreon page so that instead of my income coming from a company trying to sell products to my viewers in immoral ways, it can come directly from those who enjoy my content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Tier System\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUsually, patreon works with a tier system, meaning the more money you pay, the more things you get. I decided to scrap that system because if you guys are willing to donate even \u00a31.50 of your hard earned money, you deserve my respect, effort and love for the support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, how much you pay is up to you! You can pay as little as $2 per month (around \u00a31.50) and there is no maximum. By being a patreon subscriber you will get access to exclusive behind the scenes videos, bloopers and also some exclusive izaha drops and discounts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve read up to this far, I say thank you and Jazak\u0027Allahu Khayr. May Allah give you all good in this life and the next, ameen.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting me \u0026amp; my dreams, and helping me stay halal.\u003cbr\u003e"
