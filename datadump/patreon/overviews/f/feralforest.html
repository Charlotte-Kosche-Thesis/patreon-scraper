    "summary": "Have you ever wanted to simply run off into the woods and Live? Forget apartments, bills, traffic, and the 9 to 5 grind. Trade it in for a simple camp, the daily hunt, walking silent trails, and immersing yourself in the forest as just one more animal among all the rest. That\u0027s what Jon and I have done, and we want to share it with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJon and I are former homesteaders who came to the conclusion that farm life just wasn\u0027t wild enough for us - so we moved to a remote portion of Alaska in the spring of 2016. We love pushing ourselves to be increasingly sustainable and interdependent within our current landbase. Which means we hunt, gather, fish, and trap all kinds of wild foods, harvest wild herbal medicines, process hides and furs into clothing, make baskets to store our clothes and supplies, carve useful things from wood, and otherwise do our best to provide for our needs from our immediate environment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/5dd9d067f84711163b06d7139ca9aacf/tumblr_oq3q9tt65j1taz0z5o1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the daily Processes of our lives, we strive toward a simple sustainability - from building simple shelters with local materials, to starting fire primitively and cooking outdoors, gathering water from nearby creeks and rivers, and adjusting our diet and habits to the changing of the seasons. We Love living in the forest far from towns and cities, we Love making things with our hands and eating wild foods, and we especially Love sharing our skills with interested people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting this summer of 2017, we\u0027ll be doing all of this from a Sailboat in the Southeast of Alaska, using wind power to explore the 17 million acres of the Tongass National Forest. And we\u0027d like to take you with us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth Jon and I have years of experience teaching a wide array of skills, from private classes to public school kids. When we don\u0027t have students on-the-ground, we share what we\u0027re doing on our blog. Making useful information available to people is Incredibly important to us - and perhaps that\u0027s where You come in. We\u0027d like to be able to offer More: longer and higher quality videos, photo tutorials, and recordings exploring all the nitty gritty details that you can\u0027t find from a Google search. In order to do that, we need to save up for laptops that can handle video editing (ours are old and beat up!), and after that, a nice video camera so that we can record longer segments. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003eWhat/Why Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eMany years ago, people supported the work of artists they respected or admired by becoming their Patron. Their contribution allowed creators to focus on their art, and patrons often enjoyed a variety of perks and a special friendship with the artist they supported. Patreon is bringing back that practice, and making it easy to link us up - You, a potential Patron. And Us, the Creators. By gifting as little as $1/month in support, you can benefit from all of the content we generate - downloadable tutorials, how-to videos, all the in-depth information you\u0027d normally have to pay dearly for. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/dd82810fe3d82af6f3510d4f9dffbee9/tumblr_inline_ooxv84KBLc1sf3oue_540.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTeaching, and being a sound resource for people moving toward a wild, sustainable life, is our most important goal. But - it takes a lot of extra Time to edit video passably well, and put together nice tutorials, and make sure we get Every step photographed. And it takes Time to write out all the details to provide a really Thorough resource for folks. By getting involved in our project, you can gift us a small amount that, coming from a number of people, will help make it feasible for us to use the extra time and resources to produce this content. \u003cstrong\u003eMore Importantly\u003c/strong\u003e, we want this to be truly Accessible to as many people as possible. So the subscription blog cost is a \u003cstrong\u003esliding scale of $1-3/month\u003c/strong\u003e, and you choose which little amount to pay. If you choose to pledge More than that, we\u0027ll toss in other exciting treats for you - so take a look at the available Rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003eWho\u0027s Feral Forest?\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/95315689cf9c46f4c7097dbe6fe12086/tumblr_inline_opegh1c49w1sf3oue_500.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJon\u003c/strong\u003e grew up in the Pacific Northwest, \nfishing with his grandfather and brothers. He spent a significant amount\n of time in the woods, building \u2018forts\u2019 and other fun stuff. After 25+ \nyears in EMS, then working as a traditional blacksmith and teaching \nskills to unsuspecting city folks on the ways of survival and living \naway from \u2018the grid\u2019, Jon now lives in the Alaskan woods, building \n\u2018forts\u2019 and other fun stuff. Bush skills like building from natural \nmaterials, to hunting and trapping keep Jon from slipping back into \ncivilization to become a compliant consumer. Jon would rather stalk a \nmoose or bear all day than spend 15 minutes in traffic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoan \u003c/strong\u003egrew up in the rolling hills and forests \nof Pennsylvania, where she split her time between running\n through the woods climbing trees, and eating ice cream while playing \nvideo games. She didn\u2019t grow up knowing what plants and berries to eat \nor how to hunt, but it turns out she read enough fantasy novels to dream\n of a simpler lifestyle, and ended up moving into an intentional \ncommunity at age 19 to start to figure it out. That led to researching \nher way towards a sustainable life - from natural building methods to \nforest gardening, tanning hides to basketry, and healing with wild \nmedicinal herbs. As she lived in different communities and gathered \nexperience, she realized that living in tiny shacks and growing and \ngathering food were more appropriate challenges to her personality than \nholding down a job and keeping an apartment. In the spring of 2016, Joan\n moved with her honey Jon to Alaska. Now she can joyfully flee \nmosquitoes, swim in remote waters, tan hides and turn them into clothing, \ncraft bark baskets, stay healthy with wild plants, and revel in a simple\n life in the middle of nowhere. Her one wish is that her life will \ncontinue to get even more basic and handcrafted, working away from \nindustrial society and toward a glorious future primitive.\u003cbr\u003e"
