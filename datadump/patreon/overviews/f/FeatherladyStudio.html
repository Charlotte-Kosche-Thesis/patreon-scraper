I am an illustrator, painter, and writer who is also armed with a camera and takes the occasional adventure. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAfter more than a year of drawing, revision, and drawing some more, \"Dragon Fancy\", my first hand-drawn coloring book, will be released this month - and I could not be more excited! It\u0027s been a long haul, but my husband is compiling the files and I can\u0027t wait to show you this book in print form.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve many other projects underway - \"Off The Beaten Path\" is a long and slow labor of love, born from a two month long backpacking adventure I took on my own in the summer of 2015. It is a book project that will show readers through literary accounts, paintings, sketches and photography, just what it is like to wander Scotland on your own and taking the more memorable approach of breaking way from the tourist treadmill, slowing down and noticing the littler things. \u00a0 The supporters of that project will soon be beginning to receive their feather paintings from that journey. \"Caledonian Waters\" is a body of work also coming from that adventure, one which will be explained in an article in the near future. \"A Well Traveled Road\" is a somewhat similar project that will begin in Spring of 2018. Well, in all truth, that project is already begun - walking the 500+ miles that is the Camino de Santiago is not something you just wake up one morning and decide to do! Hopefully I will be fit enough by Spring to take that on without \u003cem\u003etoo\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0much physical adaptation!\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider joining me on these journeys. I will be listing at least two coloring pages per month for digital download for you patrons who choose that tier, more if I can manage. Many of these are sneak previews from books that are in the planning, so you\u0027ll be able to take those pages for a spin and tell me what you think of them. I\u0027m about to get\u003cem\u003e\u00a0a lot busier\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0on here, so you\u0027ll ALL see the aforementioned projects under works and many others. \u00a0Thank you for your support!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

It has served me well. I bought it at Stupid Prices in Federal Way 15 years ago. Since then it has been set up at many art shows and festivals. As my sons and I grew more active in Boy Scouts, it began serving as a cooking shelter for the Troop at jamborees. As I became more active in Clan MacLeod Society, it has been serving as clan tent at most of the highland games here in western Washington. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe poor old thing is tired and worn out. The telescoping legs collapse in strong winds. It\u0027s missing a sidewall panel. The center pole is sheared off so it falls out when tearing down and sometimes requires a hammer to set up. A sane person would have retired the poor old thing a long time ago. \u00a0As I\u0027m getting back into shows, markets, and festivals, I really need to get a new one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWatch this space, I\u0027ll be thinking up a nice little gift with which to celebrate when this goal is reached, and the poor old tired tent can finally rest!",
