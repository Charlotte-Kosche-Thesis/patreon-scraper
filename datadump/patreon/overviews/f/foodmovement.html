We met years ago and from the beginning believed that we were called to do more with the knowledge we have been blessed with to help people.

It comes from the preface to \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Agriculture Course\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, lectures he delivered in 1924 to farmers asking for methods to \u003cstrong\u003eregenerate the life force of their farms\u003c/strong\u003e and represent the birth of biodynamic agriculture. When Steiner was asked why despite his constant stimulus people\u2019s inner guidance and spiritual impulse was so weak, his thought provoking and surprising answer was as follows:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eThis is a problem of nutrition. Nutrition as it is to-day does not supply the strength necessary for manifesting the spirit in physical life. \u003cstrong\u003eA bridge can no longer be built from thinking to will and action\u003c/strong\u003e. Food plants no longer contain the forces people need for this.\u003c/em\u003e\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor me, this is it. \u003cstrong\u003eIf we fix food, we fix ourselves\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see a \u003cstrong\u003enew age for humanity dawning\u003c/strong\u003e. The old ways of doing things are no longer working, and new ways of organizing ourselves and conducting life are emerging. We can change the world for the better by doing our part to bring about the integration of natural and spiritual principles like regenerative agriculture and anthroposophy with human-centered technology like the blockchain. This union can bring an abundance and joy that the world has never seen, and allow every human to pursue the point of their passion in this lifetime.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/337eb5_62340e74db0c4ba49f106c4e06f5b1c7~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_319,h_319,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/337eb5_62340e74db0c4ba49f106c4e06f5b1c7~mv2.webp\" style=\"float: right; width: 190px;\"\u003eDespite all of my accomplishments, I am most proud of \u003cstrong\u003emy amazing wife and two kids\u003c/strong\u003e.
