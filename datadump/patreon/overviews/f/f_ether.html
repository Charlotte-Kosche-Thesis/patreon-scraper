    "summary": "With music as deeply connected to nature as the tree-laden mountains he calls home, Colorado musician f-ether has found a way to digitize the organic. But the concrete jungle has influenced his music just as powerfully, harboring a style all his own. Intricate drum patterns, prominent bass lines, and melodic arpeggiation are only a few spices in his flavor of electronic music, and he proudly displays his roots as a trip-hop producer when cooking up something new.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough he is a sapling amongst redwoods in the electronic scene, f-ether has begun to raise the eyebrows of musicians both locally and nationally through his diverse range of sounds. He has competed in various producers\u0027 competitions around Denver and has been a featured artist in many local showcases. He has shared the stage with other innovative artists and producers, including Great Dane, Anklepants, itchy-O, and Noer the Boy, just to name a few. f-ether has also been previously recognized for his grand-prize winning remix in Grand Marnier\u2019s 2015 \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/tags/BlendOut\"\u003e#BlendOut\u003c/a\u003e contest, as selected by A-Trak.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ef-ether creates an integral live performance through use of his experience as a producer, DJ, songwriter, and lifelong instrumentalist. He bridges the gap between what is tangible and what is ethereal through a melodic portrayal of abstract ideology, complex emotions, and the human condition in a way that words simply cannot grasp.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"He\u0027s also an Emoji Wizard\" -Evergroove Studio\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003econtact/booking: \u003ca href=\"mailto:fethermusic@gmail.com\"\u003efethermusic@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
