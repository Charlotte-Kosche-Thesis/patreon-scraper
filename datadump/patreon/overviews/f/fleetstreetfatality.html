Two years later, I\u0027ve made so many of you through my cosplays all over the world I can hardly believe it! But here we are! Cosplaying is something I am so passionate about, I\u0027ve realized there\u0027s nothing more I\u0027d rather do. So I\u0027ve decided to make it my living (with your help). Relating to characters and stories and creating are my greatest passions. I\u0027d love nothing more than to spend my days traveling the world telling you guys stories with my work and bringing our favorite characters to life!"

I can create 24/7, learn more things, travel A LOT more and a lot farther for cons WHICH MEANS I CAN MEET SO MANY OF YOU GUYS!! THIS WILL BE THE ULTIMATE DREAM FOR ME! I will be able to finally start the life I want so hard to get to. Reaching this goal would not only be the single greatest achievement in my life but a monument to the community i hope to build here in the cosplay world.
