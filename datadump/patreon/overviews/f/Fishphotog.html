    "summary": "I am a Flyfishing Photographer that enjoys traveling to remote places to catch and release fish. \u00a0I have traveled from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego and from Mexico to Iceland in search of trophy fish. \u00a0While in these beautiful places I have seen and photographed some amazing sights. \u00a0While landscapes are my primary focus, I also enjoy photographing wildlife, flowers, and really anything that catches my eye. \u00a0I don\u0027t currently shoot many people, but that is something I hope to engage in, in the near future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInitially my images were simply for my enjoyment, but as I have developed as a photographer the images continue to get more and more attention on my blog. \u00a0This pushes me to do more, be more creative, make more interesting images, and\u00a0now my trips are almost as much about the photographs as they are about the fishing. \u00a0Over the last few years more and more people have said \"you should sell that image\", or \"someone will pay for that\". \u00a0Well, I have a few avenues for people to do that if they would like, but in today\u0027s age of technology, the internet, and digital imagery I don\u0027t think people are really able to purchase prints from all the artists they want to support, there simply is not a house, or budget, big enough to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is where this Patreon comes into play. \u00a0This is a means for people to support me, and other artists, who are making our work available online, mostly for free, and help me continue to be able to be creative and produce images that so many people seem to enjoy, without needing to purchase a print. \u00a0I am not going to be \"living\" off of the support you provide, but it will allow me to offset some of my personal costs associated with my photography, and perhaps acquire additional tools that will allow me more creativity in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy primary social media outlet has been Instagram (Fishphotog) for the last year or so. \u00a0From there posts are also relayed to Tumblr, Twitter and Facebook. \u00a0I am going to continue to use these outlets to share all my content at no charge! \u00a0I will also continue to have the store at \u003ca href=\"http://www.fishphotog.com\"\u003ewww.fishphotog.com\u003c/a\u003e where you can see images I feel are print worthy. \u00a0If you see something on Social Media, but it is not available at the store for purchase just let me know and I will see if it can be printed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fishphotog/\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/fishphotog/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you continue to enjoy my work, and if you feel it is worth supporting, please consider becoming a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBrian"

     "about": "I photograph, and enjoy photographs of beautiful things and places, whether it be an element in nature, an emotion or expression a person reveals, a figure or form, or an abstract and random pattern, there is beauty in it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause beauty is a completely subjective idea, my images are processed for my enjoyment and will not likely satisfy the tastes of some, but I share them freely with anyone else that has similar interests and tastes.  I have no accolades to present, I have never won any awards, I am strictly an amateur at this point, fitting my passion into my busy life of family, friends, and the day job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs many professional photographers will likely notice, I am completely self taught in the art of photography.  My skills have developed over more than a decade of traveling with my father to fish in some of the worlds more remote locations from Alaska to Tierra Del Fuego, as well as point in between. My photographic interests later continued into my travels with my own family. \u00a0My vision for the images I capture is more about emotion and imagination than the actual subject matter, and every image I have and share will have been post processed by me to express that vision.  I fully understand that my vision will not resinate with many, but if you have come across my images and found your way to this site, you likely share some element of my tastes, and that being the case, I am delighted and excited that you have made it here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you continue to enjoy my work and are able to help support me in any way you can.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBrian\u003cbr\u003e",
