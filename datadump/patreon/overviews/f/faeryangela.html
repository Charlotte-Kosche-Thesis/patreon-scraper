    "summary": "I am a fairy artist primarily creating iridescent, aluminum sheet framed fairy wings as well as headpieces, some random art, and soon fairy wing graphic \u0026amp; photo stock as well as flapping wings tutorials and fantasy photos in conjunction with Jordan Price.\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon account will help support us in our passion projects, projects that while not crucial to my business, I want to bring to life for the sake of art and would love to make these things accessible to you.\u003cbr\u003eJordan has been working hard on creating a moving mechanism for my fairy wings, and we want to create a tutorial so that you can skip the costs of labor and DIY! This will not be for the wings themselves, however if you already have a set of Fancy Fairy wings, it will be easy to incorporate them into the flapping wings device.\u003cbr\u003eIt will be for those who have at least some experience with electronics, basic soldering skills, etc. We will include links to those basic skills as there are many of those already in existence.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe also would love to bring some more fairy magic into the world with fairy photo shoots and maybe short videos as well. We may offer some stock photos that you can use in creative photo manipulations as rewards, as well as graphic and photo fairy wings stock you can also incorporate into your photos and manipulations! We urge you to please make sure and abide by the rules that will be included with all of these offerings, such as attribution requirements, rules about commercial use, etc.\u003cbr\u003eIf I have time between all that, I hope to eventually add more drawing and painting here, though those may be offered as work in progress and behind the scenes peeks rather than tutorials, but maybe with some small tips on how I like to create."

     "about": "I am an artist of various mediums but mostly a full time professional fairy wing maker. I started out working as a fairy princess for parties \u0026amp; events, and once the wings I made for myself caught on they surpassed the party business, eventually seeing one of my dream goals realized by providing wings to the Victoria\u0027s Secret Fashion Show. I make costumes once in a while for myself although it takes me forever and I still have a lot to learn about it. I have loved drawing since the 3rd or 4th grade and once in a long while will actually find the time to draw or paint something, most recently in the form of virtual versions of my wings and digital fairy costumes in Second Life\u2122. I am also an anxious perfectionist and procrastinator, still trying to find the balance that will allow me to create more just for the sake of creating without feeling guilty for making art that isn\u0027t specifically to pay the bills.",
