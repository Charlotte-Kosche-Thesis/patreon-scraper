    "summary": "My name is Gene and I am a storyteller.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love telling stories about different kinds of people in fantastic situations. I love telling stories about characters who overcome great obstacles and don\u0027t just find their place in the world but make a place where they can be themselves in their world\u2014whether it be a world full of dragons and wizards or starships and blasters. I love telling stories of groups forging friendships closer than blood. I love finding humor in any situation because I think laughter overcomes evil more often than heroics\u2026 but I still love telling stories about heroic characters, particularly unlikely ones.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost recently I\u0027ve been working on a series of novels set in a light fantasy world in an epic fantasy wrapper with anthropomorphic tropes. I still dabble a bit in a couple of different science fiction and fantasy universes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf you\u0027re here because you\u0027ve read some of my work elsewhere, thank you for reading my stuff and for checking out my Patreon! If you\u0027re new to my work and wondering whether you might like it, here\u0027s a sample,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/sample-opening-14096673\"\u003ethe opening scene of my novel, The Trickster Apocalypse\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do I have a Patreon? I\u0027ve found I\u0027m much more likely to be productive and focused if I have deadlines that I\u0027ve promised other people I\u0027ll meet. The point of Patreon is the old-fashioned notion of patronage: you pay someone to create interesting things. If you become a patron, in exchange for your support, you will get to read stuff I\u0027m writing before anyone else does. Some of these stories may eventually be published elsewhere, but you\u0027ll get to see them first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always looking for feedback and impressions of what I write while I\u0027m working on it, and you\u0027ll see in the rewards how you can get involved that way, if you care to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time. I hope you check out my stories! If you find them worthwhile, please consider becoming a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
