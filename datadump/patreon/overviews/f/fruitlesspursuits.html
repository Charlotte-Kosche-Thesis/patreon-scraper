    "summary": "Welcome to \u003cstrong\u003eFruitless Pursuits! \u003c/strong\u003eOur little podcast collective lets us share our love of pop culture with all of you. All our shows are fun, irreverent, sometimes a little bit dirty, and all made with love. But I know what you\u0027re thinking; there are a million pop culture podcasts out there, what makes you jokers different? Check out the shows that we roll out for you each and every week:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFPCast\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0hosted by Luke \u0026amp; Jacinta\u003cbr\u003eThe \u0027all-purpose\u0027 weekly podcast where these two talk about pop culture news, review movies, discuss TV shows \u0026amp; video games, and whatever the hell takes their fancy. They\u0027re Australian, they have dirty mouths and love Sam Worthington a lot for some weird reason.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Book Was Better\u003c/strong\u003e hosted by Luke \u0026amp; guests\u003cbr\u003eA rotating roster helps Luke talk about a different (and usually terrible) movie novelisation each and every week. You\u0027ll laugh, you\u0027ll cry, you\u0027ll hurl and you\u0027ll find the answer to the eternal question...was the book better?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eScarJo-a-Go-Go\u003c/strong\u003e hosted by Luke\u003cbr\u003eJoin Luke as he dissects every single one of Scarlett Johannson\u0027s movies, and maps her rise from chipper child star to bone-fide Hollywood royalty. This show is not on a regular schedule, it just kinda happens when it happens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, so you\u0027ve told me all this stuff, but if I give you my hard earned cash, what are you going to use it for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m glad you asked, random internet citizen. To begin with, the bulk of the money we get from our supporters will be for promotional purposes, so we\u0027re talking business cards, flyers and bookmarks to hand out at the various events and conventions we go to. It will also help towards the hosting costs for the website, and the domain names. Beyond that it will go towards content for the podcasts themselves (movie tickets, novelisations etc). You can rest assured that any money we get will be going towards making our little shows as good as they possibly can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
