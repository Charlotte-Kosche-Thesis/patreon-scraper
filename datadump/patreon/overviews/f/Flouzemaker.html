If you have been entertained by these past and future videos, know that your potential patronage can help create more videos, by helping cover the costs of internet bills, recording, broadcasting, editing and graphic designing software, audio licensing, server maintenance costs, as well as the potential purchases of games to stream or showcase in future videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, this Patreon aims to do more than merely assist me in my own video creation endeavors. My ambition, by joining forces with TommySX, is also to build and grow a larger community, the UHC Club House, around which many other Minecraft video creators can get the opportunity to create content of their own!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe heart and hub of the community is the UHC Club House discord, which is free to join (even if you don\u0027t become a patron) with the link below!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/nchBZMg\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/nchBZMg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal is to use this communityto bring us closer and play more block game together; including on patron Minecraft Survival Multiplayer Servers, like The Flouze Crew SMP (vanilla Minecraft featuring realistic terrain generation) and the upcoming Modded Minecraft SMP (Mod pack still under construction), or in Moderated 1.8 and 1.12 UHC games on our UHC Club House servers.\u00a0 Other events are also in the works, like PvP arenas,\u00a0special Factions events, Adventure Maps, or the occasional UHC Club House Recorded Round!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of these servers and events will help TommySX and I create YouTube and Twitch content of our own, but they will also allow any\u00a0YouTube creator who is part of the UHC Club House community to use these to record, stream and provide entertainment for their own viewers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating, managing and improving these SMPs, UHC servers, PvP arenas and other mini-games\u00a0comes at a cost, and this is where your patronage can help Tommy, myself, and the UHC Club House create a flourishing community for players, viewers, and content creators!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past, YouTube revenue itself could have funded these servers, but YouTube\u0027s changing algorithms, demonetization policies and new partnership standards have changed the game entirely. Now, it\u0027s your help and patronage can help us keep the boat afloat and the dream alive.\u00a0 Here\u0027s the kicker; whether you become my patron or become TommySX\u0027s patron (here:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/user?u=10363033 ), you will get to enjoy both of our patron rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read all this, thank you for your patronage, and I hope we can SMP or UHC together soon!\u003cbr\u003e"
