    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003eAbout Find the Faith\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind the Faith is a Catholic teaching apostolate that promotes a life-changing study of Catholic doctrine. The apostolate seeks to serve Catholics by offering a \u201ctheological catechesis\u201d of the faith.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe apostolate\u2019s primary goal is to walk through the body of Catholic teaching by focusing on the four pillars of the faith\u2014the creed, the liturgy and sacraments, morality, and prayer. To do this well, its secondary goal is to teach people how to think theologically and philosophically and to provide them with the biblical and historical foundations of Catholic doctrine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe apostolate has two main modes of teaching: the Find the Faith book series and the Find the Faith podcast. Both complement one another, and both are intended to reach as many Catholics as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Find the Faith Apostolate was started by Jeff Vehige. Jeff holds a B.A. and M.A. in theology from the University of Dallas. For nearly twenty years, he has given talks and has taught a wide variety of classes in the areas of Catholic doctrine, Sacred Scripture, the sacraments, and the spiritual life. He was an RCIA Director, a Catechist Formation Instructor for the Diocese of Dallas, and the Theology Department Chair at St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic High School in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. He is married and has four children.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e* * *\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[Please note: Find the Faith is a private Catholic apostolate run, operated, and maintained solely by Jeff Vehige. It is not an organization in any legal sense, and therefore, any gift you make is \u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0tax deductible. It\u0027s a donation, pure and simple.]\u003cbr\u003e"
