    "summary": "Futureangel is a multimedia production company telling stories from the edge realms of consciousness.\u00a0Our films explore metaphysical concepts through an imaginative, surrealist lens. Blending reality with dream, we strive to tell these stories in a unique, novel, and aesthetically gripping fashion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are living in a dualistic society during a highly polarized time. It is impossible to ignore this context and its profound effect on our perception of the world around us. Through meta-storytelling, we seek to crystallize the slippery, inherently paradoxical revelations that hide in the corners of our minds, providing a unified alternative to the predominant cultural narrative. Our goal is to elucidate a new mythology to form the structural underpinnings for a more integrated future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating immersive cinema requires paying talent, renting equipment, having plentiful free time, and so much more. Our patrons provide us with all of this, and even more importantly, with a supportive community that inspires us, fuels us, and enables us to produce paradigm-shifting work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Futureangel patron, you will be warmly welcomed into our inner circle of co-conspirators. We offer a number of rewards at various tiers of support as a way of expressing our inexpressible gratitude for your generosity. Included is access to our patron-only feed, where we \u0027screen\u0027 our films long before their official premieres, and frequently provide behind-the-scenes updates into our creative process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"I am absolutely floored by the nuance and reserve you\u0027ve shown in putting together such delicate and intertwined ideas. The piece as it stands now toes a tenuous line, balancing the seemingly solvable against absurd futility. Realities overlap and overtake one another fluidly, forming the mosaic grand reality that is both the film and our life\u0027s experience.\" -\u003c/em\u003eZach Buli, actor, \u003cem\u003eWait\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore on our \u003ca href=\"http://www.futureangel.net/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOfficial Website\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.soundcloud.com/futureangel\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSoundcloud\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://futureangel.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBandcamp\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003eConnect with us on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/futureangelofficial\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/futureangelofficial\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
