You can check some examples of these here and here.\u003cbr\u003eBorn and raised in Colorado High Country I\u2019m trying to meld my Western experience with a diverse and unique vision of the future through character-driven tales. I hope you find these stories entertaining and punctuated with up-sight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhat is he trying to do?\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m attempting to leverage my daily routine and make more time for writing.

Every dollar coming in here is a dollar that writing printed. Patreon has saved my time from being consumed by other projects or traditional employment. While I\u2019ve never made what anyone could call a living through this service, it\u2019s given me enough buoyancy I\u2019ve not yet needed to seek other work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhat\u2019s in it for you?\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStories, about once every other month, will be yours.
