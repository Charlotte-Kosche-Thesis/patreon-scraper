You can even make a request... Do you want a drawing of your favorite X-Man? No problem! A sketch of a bird! I got you! Some limitations apply, but I will work with you.

If you missed the limited sketch tier (or if you just prefer not to receive something in the mail) but still want to get a little extra for your pledge, this is the level for you! In addition to the process posts and PDFs of my existing comics, you will receive monthly hi-res downloads of my digital art! That might include drawings based on movies or video games, special Titan art, superhero commissions, animal illustrations, or just about anything! There will be at least one hi-res download per month, and usually more!",
