    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor over ten years, Framing the World has been devoted to making documentaries surrounding the vital\nissues of our generation, in addition to educating the public on biblical truth and the New World\nOrder deception. We make documentaries, publish books, and sell informative and useful products at \u003ca href=\"http://www.framingtheworld.com\"\u003eframingtheworld.com\u003c/a\u003e to further spread that goal. To find out more about us \u003ca href=\"http://store.framingtheworld.com/terms\"\u003eclick here\u003c/a\u003e. However, if you\u0027re on this page, you more than likely already know who we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Problem:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently our team of four work daily at getting a long list of projects completed. We believe that it is important to reach as many people as possible and \nto do that you have to make your projects available for free, so people \ncan easily get this life changing material. However, this can be \nfinancially draining, as it is hard to make money off a movie that is \navailable for free on YouTube.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Solution:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the ever growing censorship on Facebook and google we are at a pivotal time to do \namazing things. That\u0027s why we have decided to create this Patreon page in hopes to raise the additional funds we need to make the difference we know we can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make up for this loss, we are looking for dedicated fans who are ready to help us financially. People who can help us balance the cost of making these informative but expensive films. If you\u0027re reading this, you\u0027re probably a supporter of us already. Maybe you\u0027ve even wanted to be a part of our exciting group but weren\u0027t sure how. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePartnering with you one on one\n can change the balance of power between independent media and \nmainstream media that is run and operated by the elites. With you partnering with us the possibilities are endless. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe main stream media is supposed to be the eyes and ears of the people\n and truly they are only proponents of the very few who don\u0027t give a \ndamn about you. Six major conglomerates control more than 90% of all \nmedia, this means 6 elite powerful forces are controlling the minds of \neveryone. With people powered news we can change this and we already have. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday for just $5 per month you can make sure we have the staff and\n funding to not only operate but expand our reach. That may not be a lot for you, but if everyone reading this did so, we could shake things up. We could release projects like Babylon USA, Deported, Understanding the Book of Revelation, and the Marching to Zion Restoration project by the end of this year. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe you have a little more money and could spare ten dollars a month. Or twenty. We have pledge tiers for everyone. And in return, you would get members-only benefits. Benefits like having your name in credits. Discounts off of our store. Exclusive never-before-seen footage like deleted Babylon USA scenes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, are you willing to step up and help us spread the truth? Are you able to donate to counter our production costs? If so, make your pledge now. \u003cbr\u003e"

However, this costs a lot of money to do, and this is another project we have had little support for. But if I could get $1000 dollars a month, I could afford to hire an editor to work on editing the full Marching to Zion interviews.\u003cbr\u003e",
