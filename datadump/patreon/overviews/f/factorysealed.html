This venture started as nothing more than a way to pass the time, but quickly became an obsession among friends looking to share their love of retro games with anyone willing to listen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmazingly, listen you did! It baffles us every single day as to why so many of you love to hear us tell the craziest stories we can muster, but we can\u0027t tell you how grateful we are that you all tune in every single week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a whole load of video game podcasts on the market, but what we wanted out of FS was to just more than drone on about games in a monotone voice. Instead, we talk about everything from the gaming world and beyond, with occasional monotone/slapstick/incomprehensible Geordie voices.                                                                                                                 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show will always go on and it will always be free. Period. However, we have ambitions to improve the show and expand further upon what we can do every week. What does that mean? Well, it can mean anything from Jess actually managing to finish games, to us giving you lovely people stuff for free as part of regular giveaways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny contribution to the Factory Sealed cause will go towards improving the show and rewards for our listeners. With regular donations from you, our fans, we can cover the hosting of our website and podcast, plus any bandwidth costs we might run into. We can also start developing new things, including website improvements, a Factory Sealed app, Tshirts, loot boxes and - most importantly - start running regular giveaways of both older and newer games!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo anyone who donates, regardless of the amount, we would like to thank you sincerely. You\u0027re helping to make Factory Sealed the best it can be and are officially an awesome, awesome person. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the bottom of our nostalgic hearts to the tips of our Nintendo-calloused thumbs, thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Eric, Dan, Tom, and Mike"

That\u2019s if we can actually get a word in as one of us goes off on a mildly-related tangent which soon descends into nonsense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the odd occasion, we\u2019ll also host special retro gaming shows where our team tackle a ridiculously long RPG and break it down disc by disc. This has prompted such discussions as \u2018Is Squall really dead for most of FFVIII after being stabbed in the heart by a giant icicle?\u2019 and other great insights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough we specialize in retro games, we are known to actually talk about some modern stuff as well from time to time. It\u2019s all fair game here; whether it\u2019s the SNES, Megadrive, Gameboy, Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, Gameboy Color Advance DS (alright, that\u2019s not a thing), NES, Xbox, Xbox 360, PlayStation or an obscure game cabinet tucked away in the depths of a dingily lit arcade inhabited only by a heavy breathing man with a suspicious moustache, we\u2019ll talk about it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStreamed live every Sunday, we\u2019d like to invite you to kick back in your favorite gaming comfy spot, grab a controller and join us as we relive the glorious days of retro gaming.\u003cbr\u003e",
