For me EVERYONE is equal, you guys are what makes my work awesome, you give me feedback, inspiration and thanks to patreon you also make my work easier (and this really has an impact). So although there are different benefits per group you have to know from the start that ALL of you are awesome people and that\u0027s also why everyone has access to our closed facebook group straight from the start.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Frank Doorhof and I\u0027m a fashion/celebrity photographer specialized in education. This means in short I share loads of tips, tricks and of course work via our social media channels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI teach workshops twice a week in our own studio in Emmeloord, but I\u0027m also an instructor for KelbyOne. You can also find me on tradeshows like PhotoshopWorld, Photokina, Imaging Days, Professional Imaging, The Photography Show etc. etc. where I speak and demo for the major brands. You might also know me from my book \"Mastering the modelshoot\" which has been released in 5 languages. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also run a very active YouTube channel with loads of videos and live streams. This is all delivered to you guys for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn your channel you will find :\u003cbr\u003eDigital Classroom : live streams and tips and tricks episodes\u003cbr\u003eQuite Frankly : news, reviews, products etc.\u003cbr\u003eBehind the closed DOORs : our vlog\u003cbr\u003eThe DOORhof is always open : Longer interviews\u003cbr\u003eElectrifying the DOORhofs : about EVs, Solar etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVia this Patreon site you can show your appreciation and of course help us out to make it possible for us to grow and give you more and even better material, BUT..... we also love to give back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI personally try to answer all questions and like all comments because I strongly believe that if you take the time to post something I need to take the time to at least let you know I saw it, and where possible help out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you join our Patreon you not only make my work easier but you also get a lot in return, so head on over to the options, I\u0027m 100% sure you\u0027re gonna love it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou Guys ROCK!!!!\u003cbr\u003e"
