I\u0027ve built guns, swords, axes, trinkets, and chainswords. Hell I\u0027ve even built a giant saddle for an over-sized macaroni noodle! Some of these have been commissions, some personal projects.. but all of them were loads of fun!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.fabricatordjinn.com/Images/Assorted/yokogun.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.fabricatordjinn.com/Images/Assorted/yokogun.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThats nice but, why Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nI\u0027m starting this because I want to do more work in the shop, and find ways to include you (the community) and other builders in the fun. I work full time in IT services, and as such everything more or less has to be done on the weekends or after a long day of work. This makes it fairly hard to find time and energy to do all the things I\u0027d like to. The things that get lost in my exhaustion are tutorials,\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.fabricatordjinn.com/build-log/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebuild write ups\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmhVJWVeB6Q\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eexplanation videos\u003c/a\u003e and all the fun little things that make this community such a great place.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u0027t know how I would have learned to do what I do if I wasn\u0027t able to lean on the expertise of the prop and cosplay community, and being able to give back some of that knowledge is high on my priority list.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.fabricatordjinn.com/Images/Assorted/imperiusdaryyl.png\"\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWhat would the money go towards?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nThe money from this Patreon is likely to go directly back into the shop. New tools, new equipment, better streaming gear, more events. Once goals are met, money from this page will get funneled into bringing guest builders down to my shop for build days (gas, food, bribes.. you know) for build events streamed for the world to see!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI love seeing how other people build their props, and the collaboration and fun that becomes possible when you stick a bunch of prop builders in the same room and tell them to build something quickly is amazing to watch (in my opinion). I want to see more of that, and a big part of this Patreon is to help enable those events to occur with increasing frequency and effectiveness.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith additional income, I would also be able to shift my priorities more towards creating more content. This would include tips, tutorials, build logs and videos - as it stands these things get moved to the back-burner more often then I\u0027d like due to my dwindling free time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.fabricatordjinn.com/Images/Assorted/shortsword.png\"\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWill you still be producing content for non patrons?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nOf course! What I do wouldn\u0027t have been possible without the wonderful people in this hobby/industry being willing to share their knowledge. People like the good folks at\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/volpinprops\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVolpin Props\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/punishedprops\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePunished Props\u003c/a\u003e have shared so many of their techniques with the world, and we are all the better for it. I feel very strongly about emulating this kind of helpful attitude, and hope the content I provide here and elsewhere can be as useful to you as their knowledge was to me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn short, I wont be holding content back behind a paywall. Patrons will get a more personal look into the build process, and early access/trinkets plus a hand in what content I actually provide. Not to mention additional resources and reference material - but everyone benefits in the end!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eAddendum\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nI have a full time job. The nature of my work cuts into my creativity and time pretty significantly, and because of this I won\u0027t be able to produce a massive amount of content immediately - I just dont have the time/energy. As this page grows and goals are met I will devote increasingly large amounts of time to content production - with a drastic increase in frequency of content as some of the higher end goals loom closer. Eventually, I hope to be making interesting things full time - but I\u0027m not there yet.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSome of my projects are NDA blocked aswell, so in the event those projects are occurring when I have a scheduled stream or otherwise, I may not be able to show you what I am working on ;_;\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eA warm Thank You\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nIf you\u0027ve made it this far, thank you.
