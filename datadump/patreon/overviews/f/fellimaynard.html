    "summary": "My name is \u003cstrong\u003eFelicita \"Felli\" Maynard\u003c/strong\u003e and I create artwork as a way to further understand myself, and help others understand themselves. I focus on themes revolving around the African diaspora, the Black body and issues concerning gender and sexuality. I am inspired by artists like African American photographer Carrie Mae Weems and South African photographer Zanele Muholi, who use Black bodies to challenge institutional stereotypes. Through straight photography my work brings to the forefront issues that are occurring within communities of color such as oppression and exploitation. I work across alternative photography processes (specifically wet and dry plate), digital art, altar work and an exploration of organic materials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWet Plate Photography\u003c/strong\u003e or the \u003cstrong\u003eWet-collodion process\u003c/strong\u003e, also called \u003cstrong\u003ecollodion process\u003c/strong\u003e, early photographic technique invented by Englishman \u003ca href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frederick-Scott-Archer\"\u003eFrederick Scott Archer\u003c/a\u003e in 1851. The process involved adding a soluble iodide to a solution of \u003ca href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/collodion\"\u003ecollodion\u003c/a\u003e (cellulose nitrate) and coating a glass plate with the mixture. In the darkroom the plate was immersed in a solution of \u003ca href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/silver-nitrate\"\u003esilver nitrate\u003c/a\u003e to form \u003ca href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/silver-iodide\"\u003esilver iodide\u003c/a\u003e. The plate, still wet, was exposed in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/camera\"\u003ecamera\u003c/a\u003e. It was then developed by pouring a solution of \u003ca href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/pyrogallol\"\u003epyrogallic acid\u003c/a\u003e over it and was fixed with a strong solution of sodium thiosulfate, for which \u003ca href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/potassium-cyanide\"\u003epotassium cyanide\u003c/a\u003e was later substituted. Immediate developing and fixing were necessary because, after the collodion film had dried, it became waterproof and the reagent solutions could not penetrate it. The process was valued for the level of detail and clarity it allowed. A modification of the process, in which an underexposed \u003ca href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/negative\"\u003enegative\u003c/a\u003e was backed with black paper or velvet to form what was called an \u003ca href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/ambrotype\"\u003eambrotype\u003c/a\u003e, became very popular from the mid- to late 19th century, as did a version on black lacquered metal known as a \u003ca href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/tintype\"\u003etintype\u003c/a\u003e, or ferrotype. (Britannica)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I am interested in creating a positive imagery regarding how the Black body has been portrayed by methods of early photography, specifically wet plate photography. In doing so I want to change the narrative that has been put in place by early ethnographic and anthropometric images made of Black bodies by historical hierarchies. I have learned the process of making modern \"tintypes\" and ambrotypes through the Penumbra Foundation and have fallen in love with the medium at the same time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always paid out of pocket for all my film cameras, film, lighting supplies, development, etc. I am now at a point where I can no longer afford it on my own. I believe I am destined to do this work and with your help I will be able to continue to learn and create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am creator and educator. Outside of art I am also the 1/3 of \u003cstrong\u003eSupport Black Art\u003c/strong\u003e, which\u00a0exists solely for the promotion and awareness of black artists worldwide.

     "about": "I use film photography to fight the traumas I\nundergo as a first-generation Afrolatinx person, who also happens to be queer\nand spiritually radical. Making art is a way for me to tackle our society\u2019s\nprejudices against minorities and less \u201cpowerful\u201d; people like my\nancestors.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\nFilm photography is my starting foundation. The\nprocess of creating images on film is something I hold a romantic relationship\nwith.  I combine film with video, digital\nartworks and installations. I am a documenter, manipulating images only very\nslightly to get my full point across. I am currently exploring the relationship\npeople in our present-day society have with images. We are living in a digital\nage, yet despite that I only shoot with analog cameras. I am a lover of the\nprocess, using my hands to create a part of the final product. It troubles me\nthat digital images have become so accessible and have created an oversaturated\nmarket. Digitizing has managed to desensitize our minds to what art in\nphotography can be. I use film that is scanned to the digital world and then\nbrought back to the physical world. By digitizing analog images, I am bending\nthe rules and combining the old with the new. By combing accessible digital processes\nwith the inaccessible medium of film, I am creating a space in which time does\nnot exist.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy current style is to document people of color in a\ndirect light, showing my audience these subjects in their raw forms. I hope to\ntackle the injustices that occur in brown and black people\u2019s lives, as well as\nthe joy that they experience on a day to day basis. I am offering the real\nstory, the part that usually goes misrepresented. \u003cbr\u003e",
