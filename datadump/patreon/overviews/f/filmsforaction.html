     "description": "At this amount, Films For Action\u0027s baseline security will be assured, allowing us to employ 1 full-time staff member at $15/hr ($2500) and leave us $500 in breathing room as well as cover our site and operational expenses. $15 is also what we paid our 2nd staff member for the 3 years we were able to pay him. We decided that even though it\u0027s much lower in the US, $15 an hour is what the minimum wage *should* be, so that felt like a good number to start with. We\u0027d also like to be able to offer a little part-time work as it becomes feasible, for writers potentially or editor work, help with video creation or people to focus on specific roles, like our city chapters or expanding our On Demand/PPV library.",
