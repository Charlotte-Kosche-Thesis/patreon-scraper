Though I sometimes crosspost between my Wordpress and tumblr accounts, the former pieces tend to be longer, formal and structured, while the latter are more freeform. What this means in practical terms is that I\u0027m capable of producing stupidly long essays about\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fozmeadows.wordpress.com/2015/01/22/teen-wolf-subversion-masculinity-and-gender/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emasculinity and Teen Wolf\u003c/a\u003e, angry rants about\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fozmeadows.wordpress.com/2015/03/12/the-andrew-smith-thing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSFF politics\u003c/a\u003e and quick posts\u00a0about\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://fozmeadows.tumblr.com/post/118114112046/the-importance-of-writing-sex-scenes#notes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe importance of sex scenes\u003c/a\u003e, but am equally likely to say \u003cem\u003efuck\u003c/em\u003e in all of them. So it goes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, the vast majority of my writing\u00a0is unpaid. Annually, I receive some very minor royalties and an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://arts.gov.au/literature/lending_rights\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eELR/PLR\u003c/a\u003e payment for my novels, I\u0027m paid by\u00a0\u003cem\u003eStrange Horizons\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and\u00a0\u003cem\u003eTor.com,\u003c/em\u003e and I\u0027ve earned a few small, one-off sums for my contributions individual anthologies, but as regular earnings go, it\u0027s not much. I love what I do, and I\u0027m continually amazed and touched that people enjoy my writing enough to share it, comment on it and show up again the following week. In fact, I\u0027d like nothing more than to be able to write full time - and that\u0027s where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWeek to week, I spend the better part of five days in every seven helping to look after my two-year-old son, and while my husband\u0027s working hours are flexible, I\u0027m still restricted to working part-time to supplement our income. Throw in my writing commitments, and this quickly becomes difficult to manage: energy and free time are both finite resources, and it\u0027s hard to keep up with genre news, new book releases and online commentary, let alone produce my own content, when I\u0027m constantly burning the candle at both ends. But if I were able to earn more regular money with my writing, it wouldn\u0027t just help out on the financial end of things; it would enable me to create more - and to do more - by providing me with a modicum of security. I want to write new and better things, and for that, I need your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim is to produce at least two major blog posts at Shattersnipe and one external review a month, with any tumblr-exclusive posts over 1000 words in length considered a bonus. All my content will remain free to view, any tumblr posts shorter than 1000 words won\u0027t count, and remember: you can put a monthly cap on your contributions, so if you pledge $1 a time, but don\u0027t want to spend more than $3 a month, you won\u0027t get overcharged if I end up writing five things. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
