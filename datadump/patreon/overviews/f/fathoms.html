    "summary": "Hi there! I\u2019m Ian Kane. I\u2019m an indie filmmaker, artist, and author. I\u2019m currently building a horror franchise called The Fathoms of Yiqomec. It\u2019s an expanded universe so I have short films and a comic book series for now, and features, video games, and even a tabletop role-playing game planned for the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve completed two out of the three short horror films. The first film,\u003cem\u003e The Visitor, \u003c/em\u003eis available free on this page so you can check it out and get an idea of what to expect. The second film, \u003cem\u003eNight of the Kanuak,\u003c/em\u003e elaborates further on clues left behind in \u003cem\u003eThe Visitor.\u003c/em\u003e It will debut in June 2018 and will be available to $2 subscribers. The third film, \u003cem\u003eEbonwood Falls, \u003c/em\u003ewill be shot over summer 2018 and will also be available soon thereafter. All three shorts take place before the feature films. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe comic book series, titled The Fathoms of Yiqomec, is available at $5. It follows the events that transpire in the forthcoming features and will continue on beyond them. Each comic\u0027s black \u0026amp; white art will be posted first, and their entire 32-page, full-color digital editions will be available for free to subscribers before anyone else. The video games and role-playing game are currently in development and will be detailed on this page through updates as they come to fruition. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeeling really supportive? Come in at $10 and you\u2019ll get everything listed, plus The Fathoms of Yiqomec comic book script pages, behind-the-scenes info and pictures of our film projects, weird and funny anecdotes, and exclusive, once-a-month entries that profile characters, organizations, and entities within The Fathoms of Yiqomec universe. Oh, and sketches of ideas that I draw from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, feel free to message and comment, I try to interact lots on here.\u003cbr\u003eThanks for considering this, and for being a friend to indie horror creators! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
