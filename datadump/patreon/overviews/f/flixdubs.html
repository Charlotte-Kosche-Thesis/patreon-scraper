I\u0027m best known for my music inspired by various genre! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this Patreon page for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking a living as a artist is tricky these days. With streaming overtaking album sales and platforms like Youtube becoming less reliable with monetisation, artists need other options. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe high quality of my productions is due to over 6 years of dedication, work \u0026amp; practice. I\u0027ve given my whole life to making music and platforms like this one allow me to do that while also having a job. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy job includes: \u003cbr\u003e- Producing\u003cbr\u003e- Recording \u0026amp; engineering\u003cbr\u003e- Playing (and buying) all the instruments\u003cbr\u003e- Mixing (this is by far the most time consuming part)\u003cbr\u003e- Mastering\u003cbr\u003e- Promotion, social media etc...\u003cbr\u003e- All managerial, clerical \u0026amp; financial stuff\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s a lot of work for one person! My songs can often take over 10 to 20 hours to create \u0026amp; that\u0027s not including the promotion \u0026amp; managerial stuff. In the past I worked on music in my free time while cooking in a restaurant or work at a customer service center... trying to balance that double life wasn\u0027t easy and it was hard to find time to make my music, let alone produce them to the level of quality my audiences now enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo when you become a patron, you\u0027re sending some cash my way in order to let me keep making the things you enjoy :)  In order to keep making this much music to this standard, it needs to stay my full time job.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat rewards do I get for contributing? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe music itself will be the main reward here. There will also be some early access to in-progress songs/artwork/demo mixes/behind the scenes prose etc. My creation process is intensely private \u0026amp; solitary so there won\u0027t be many group chats or livestreams or that kind of thing but you will be able to ask me questions, give feedback \u0026amp; stuff like that :)  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t believe in putting any exclusive songs behind a paywall, I want every fan to be able to hear every song I release regardless of their financial situation. My work is all about getting high quality, polished tunes made for all of you guys and that is what you\u0027ll be supporting. If that\u0027s enough for you to want to contribute then awesome! If not, I completely understand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNOTE: [reward tiers are not concrete and may change slightly based on fan feedback, but you will never lose anything you\u0027re getting I will only add] \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to everyone who chips in - you guys have always been super supportive of me. In fact it was you - the fans - who suggested joining Patreon in the first place. So thanks for letting me do my dream job, y\u0027all are the best :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eF\u00e9lix.\u003cbr\u003e"
