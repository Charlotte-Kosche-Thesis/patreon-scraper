Based in South London and artist-run, we aim to showcase and interview artists from across the world. We pride ourselves on a clean design with no advertising or flashy banners that get in the way of the artist\u2019s content, we also have a carefully selected \u2018Artist Opportunities\u2019 and \u2018Artist Directory\u2019 section.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach issue we create consists of 10 to 15 artist interviews, with a stylish layout and a high standard when it comes to the selecting process. Past issues have included well-known names in the art world like \u003cstrong\u003eRagnar Kjartansson, Gillian Wearing, Jules de Balincourt, Yinka Shonibare, Billy Childish\u003c/strong\u003e plus many more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy be a Patreon?:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt the moment our main revenue stream relies\u00a0on artists to submit their work, the artist pays a small submission fee to enter. But our goal is to eventually\u00a0phase out artist submission fees. We can only do this if we have enough patronage, we do not want to rely\u00a0on advertising revenue or artist fees as we feel our magazine needs to be free to enter and without advertisements on our\u00a0website. Putting the artists first, with the use of patreons\u00a0will give\u00a0the readers a chance to support the work we do in a more democratic way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Money Feelings:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as abolishing submission fees we would also like our magazine to be able one day support its self. We want to be as transparent as possible, so you can see what your contribution will go towards and give you a picture of costs and potential growth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWebsite costs:\u003cbr\u003eThis is where most of our money goes, web developers are not cheap and our site is in constant use. With updates and content management. Plus not to mention hosting costs for the site and emails.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSocial media boosts:\u003cbr\u003eAfter web developer costs have eaten its way into our wallet, some of the money we do have left is spent on social\u00a0media boosts. This is a great way to reach a bigger audience via Instagram and Facebook. It is our only form of paid\u00a0advertisement, as its flexible and can adjust the boost to our budget.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUs:\u003cbr\u003eWe have to eat, buy clothes (to replace the ones with holes in them) and pay them bills. We are all artists (who choose to be anonymous\u00a0for various reasons) and spend as much time as we can on the magazine in-between other jobs, our dream is to eventually\u00a0work on it full-time. Wouldnt that be wonderful!?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s\u00a0it in a nutshell, a free online publication for all, with no advertising, no fees. Be part of our growth and help us reach more people so our artists can get the exposure they deserve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFloorr\u00a0Magazine"
