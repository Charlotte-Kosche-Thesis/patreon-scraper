Along the way, they learn a lot about themselves, the world, and their place in it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of our episodes are \u003ca href=\"http://www.sixfeatsunder.com/podchats/episodes\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePodchats\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, a recurring feature where we talk games instead of playing them. Podchats talk about the elements of tabletop games - what works, what doesn\u0027t, and why we like certain kinds of things. Most of our podchats accompany a game we played alongside them, but not always. We\u0027ve done less of these lately, but they aren\u0027t gone for good just yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd lastly, a number of our episodes are \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sixfeatsunder.com/archive\"\u003eBonus Feats\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, which are a quick look at a variety of different tabletop games.
