We\u0027re obviously very passionate about the idea of doing what we love for a living, and by becoming a patron, you can come with us on our little journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eViewing this page\u00a0means that you are already a fan of Fanfickle, and you want to support our growth, which means a lot to us considering how we\u0027re currently very under the radar in terms of YouTube Fame.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Ryan Bauer, but you might know me on Fanfickle as Blazer Terribad, or Specter Spark. I represent Fanfickle when I say that we are very excited for the future of the channel and for all of you to experience it with us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the time of creating this Patreon Page, we are close to having 7,000 subscribers, which is super crazy from our perspective. We understand that 7,000 may not seem like much on Youtube, but that\u0027s still 7,000 people! 7,000 people want to see more of our content! if you took that same amount of people, you could fill a whole convention center!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan you imagine if those same 7,000 people came to this patreon and contributed just 1 Dollar to us a month?! 1 Dollar from 7,000 people, that\u0027s insane!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd as more people keep coming to see our content, we\u0027re just more and more excited to continue sharing our content with you guys. So from the bottom of our hearts, from the bottom of MY heart, thank you so much for your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
