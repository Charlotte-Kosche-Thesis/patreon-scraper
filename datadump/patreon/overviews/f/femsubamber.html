    "summary": "I\u0027d write stories even if I had to pay to do so. So why then should you consider supporting me? Because even a token level of support would help keep me caffeinated and probably convince my owner that she should continue to allow me to type away late into the evenings rather than do something more directly beneficial to her, like mop the kitchen, or light candles and give her a massage, or cook - and heaven knows nobody wants to see the abomination that is anything I try to cook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically you\u0027ll be pitching in funds that I\u0027ll immediately turn around and spend on artists within the furry fandom for artwork. I\u0027ll then write stories based on that artwork... in order to earn Patreon monies that I\u0027ll use to buy more artwork. It\u0027s a vicious cycle, but now you can be part of it! I\u0027ll try to take ideas from patrons on what themes to incorporate into future stories, OCs that might make appearances, etc. I\u0027m still fuzzy on if anyone cares enough to drop me $.50 for a cup of cheap, overly roasted coffee. But let\u0027s swing for the fences here nonetheless!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find examples of my fiction over at my Furaffinity page: \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/femsubamber/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/femsubamber/\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0 (very NSFW). The themes that I cover are at this point almost exclusively BDSM, femdom, and lesbian focused (occasionally with an introspective self-pleasure piece). If I stray from these themes into related ones or even wildly far afield depends on how much you folks think of my writing ability and how much you want to push me. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
