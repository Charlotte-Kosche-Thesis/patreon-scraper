The feeling of accomplishment that comes with the completion of a new piece is very rewarding also.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon page is at this time mainly going to focus on coloring pages - and I have committed to creating EXCLUSIVE pages if I can maintain a level of subscribers.\u00a0 Subscribers will gain access to the blog posts that will include the coloring pages of the month for you to download. At the end of the month, once I add the next month\u0027s coloring pages, I will delete the previous month\u0027s images from the post so be sure to grab them during the month you subscribe so not to miss out.\u00a0 I will TRY to be as timely as possible but given that life gets in the way sometimes I will commit to AT LEAST one new post per month.\u00a0 I might add more than one post per month for various tiers (YAY!).\u00a0 I will announce them on my Facebook page so be sure to like my page there as well!\u00a0 Also depending on the subscription tier, you will receive special coupon codes to my website store as well as my Etsy shop. I will also add some posts with tips on coloring - painting - mediums I use, etc.\u00a0 I hope to add some videos too eventually. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eI will also have random drawings for prints, goodies and maybe even original artwork.\u00a0 Some of you know I enjoy being able to do this for my Facebook fans, but I thought it might be fun to start up something here as well.\u00a0 Don\u0027t worry, I will still be having drawings for freebies on my Facebook page as usual!\u00a0 AND you can enter BOTH!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTERMS of USE for DIGITAL COLORING PAGES and COLORING BOOKS\u003cbr\u003e***All black and white coloring pages posted exclusively on Patreon and\u00a0 created by Molly Harrison are copyright protected and must not be shared in any way unless otherwise specifically allowed by the artist.\u00a0 Colored versions are ALLOWED to be shared on your social media accounts as long as there is credit provided to Molly Harrison and a mention of my Patroen page. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFor information about me and my work, please visit The Fairy and Fantasy Art of Molly Harrison \u003ca href=\"http://www.mollyharrisonart.com.\"\u003ewww.mollyharrisonart.com.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
