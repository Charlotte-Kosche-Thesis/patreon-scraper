This website is currently\n\t\t\tjust a Tumblr blog which has exploded in popularity far beyond anything I could\u0027ve ever imagined. So, I finally decided to purchase its own URL for it. I would love to dedicate more time and effort into its proper\n\t\t\tdevelopment but my time is limited. I\u0027ve enjoyed running this site and seeing it grow so much that I\u0027ve recently taken up a second job to help support it. But, as I mistakenly underestimated, it\u0027s mentally and physically exhausting to split my time between work and keeping this site up to date on cool sciencey things. The goal of this Patreon\u00a0is to help me earn enough to be able to focus more of my time on OC content. \"Never half-ass two things, whole ass-one thing.\" - Ron Swanson\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI understand that many, if not all, of you are in similar situations as I--barely managing to survive. This is completely\n\t\t\tunderstandable. I don\u0027t exactly appreciate the fact that I have to trade my precious time for pieces of paper just so I don\u0027t die...but that\u0027s a separate philosophical issue. Becoming a \"patron\" means you are directly\n\t\t\tsupporting my efforts to provide engaging content. You are directly supporting and encouraging\n\t\t\tthat which you thoroughly enjoy (hopefully).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\tInstead of concluding with an inspirational cliche, I will simply state that this is a plea\n\t\t\tfor any support you can give--monetary or otherwise. I love what this site has turned into and I love the community of non-douchey people I\u0027ve met so far. Now all I need is to reinvigorate the momentum.\u00a0The more I make, the more I can expand the breadth of content on the site. Aside from keeping the website exactly how it is--free from politics, personal opinions (when answering questions, I\u0027m sure some will slip in), and sensationalist journalism--I have plans to redesign the website, hire an additional science writer/journalist, potentially start making videos, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading,\u003cbr\u003eJames Heidlebaugh\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.fuckyeahastrophysics.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFuck Yeah, Astrophysics\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e"
