    "summary": "In the old days, a busy farmer might\nput his extra produce up by the dirt road in a roadside stand along with an\nempty fruit jar. Folks who appreciated the fruits of his labor would put money\nin the jar to help the old farmer recoup some of his expenses\u2014but anyone was\nwelcome to take a share of the goods whether they paid or not.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell I\u0027ve been very blessed to be able\nto put together a show that good people like yourself actually favor\u2014seein\u2019 as\nhow many of you support it by faithfully watchin\u0027 and waitin\u0027 for more episodes\nof the show. I really don\u0027t expect anybody to contribute any more to The Farm\nHand\u0027s Companion brand than to simply watch the show. (You takin\u0027 your own\nvaluable time to watch my little offerings is appreciated by me no little bit!)\nBut if you\u2019ve benefited from the Farm Hand\u2019s Companion Show, and you feel so\ninclined ... drop a little something in the jar, so to speak, by becomin\u2019 a\npatron of the show. (Though you\u0027re free to give more, pledgin\u0027 a minimum of $1 per each episode of the show to be released will make you an FHC Patron.) It\u0027ll tremendously aid my efforts to create more episodes\nas frequently as possible (and to be honest\u2014it may well underwrite the\noccasional emergency room visit, with as reckless as I sometimes farm). And if\nyou elect to \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e give a little\nsomethin\u2019, I\u0027ll still be as happy as a pig in mud for you to watch and enjoy\nthe show as often as you can!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m happy to say I\u2019ve got big plans for\nthe future of The Farm Hand\u0027s Companion project that I hope will be an\ninspirational boost to folks who are lookin\u0027 to be more self-sufficient on\ntheir farm or homestead\u2014as well as those who just want simple, homespun\nentertainment. All in all, I\u2019ll be pleased as punch to know you\u0027ve chosen to be\na part of it in a more substantial way by becomin\u2019 a Farm Hand\u2019s Companion\nPatron.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so much for stoppin\u0027 awhile\non my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e"
