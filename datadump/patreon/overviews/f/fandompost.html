Over the years, the Internet landscape has changed and the way we operated before is difficult as we were largely supported by affiliate income that came from readers buying through retailers. But with affiliate programs largely gone these days, it\u0027s all down to advertising. But we want to be supported directly by our readers and to find some fun rewards and things to do to build a stronger and more engaged community. We\u0027ve got a few ideas, we want more, but mostly we want to keep bringing you great coverage, lots of news and other information for years to come."

     "about": "Chris has long been involved in the coverage and consumption of entertainment media. His change came in the 70\u2032s when he saw Star Wars at the tender age of seven and it\u2019s all been downhill from there. Science fiction, adventure movies turn into comic books, videogames and anime. His love of film pushed him towards the laserdisc market and then in the late 90\u2032s, he was an early adopter of DVD and then eventually Blu-ray. In 1998, he began AnimeOnDVD.com which was one of the pioneering anime sites of its time and continues to write anime news and reviews for Mania.com, which he sold his site to in 2008 after a ten year run solo. He left that in 2011 to form The Fandom Post.\u003cbr\u003e",
