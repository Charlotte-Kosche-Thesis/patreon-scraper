     "about": "Terry Walker was born in 1965 and raised in London, England. He was first introduced to the art of photography when he was 19 years old and he was particularly impressed with the French photographer Jeanloup Sieff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe received his first camera in 1985, a fully manual, Russian built \"Zenit 11\", but it wasn\u0027t until 2005 and the purchase of his first digital camera that he was freed from the financial considerations of film, and was able to focus more on developing his craft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the driving forces behind his work is the belief that beauty is not confined to one shape, one size, or one color. Instead of trying to mold his subjects into a preconceived idea of beauty, he seeks out the beauty that is in everyone, and then proceeds to capture that in his images.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
