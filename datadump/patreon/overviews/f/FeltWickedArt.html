My\nbest known work consists of fantasy-inspired Witch Hats that have been featured on Buzzfeed, Bored Panda, Think Geek, Geekology, and Fashionably Geek. In 2017 two of my hats were featured in Faerie Magazine\u0027s Autumn edition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI remember always gravitating\ntowards the fantastical even as a very young child. So it is no wonder that\nfantasy has been the focal point of my art through the years. If I had to pin-point when \u201cfantasy\nart\u201d became a core part of my life, I know I would recall how I spent most of\nmy 6th grade study-hall time illustrating a little book I wrote myself about\nunicorns.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEven though I was pressured away from a career\nin art during my college years, my passion for it redoubled by the time I was in\ngrad school and had married. That\u0027s when I began felting, and from the very first\nI think I was searching for a felted creation that was the perfect blend of art\nand functionality. It wasn\u0027t until I combined my love of fantasy with my\ndeveloping felting skills that I created my first Witch Hat. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u003cimg src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/0d/17/a2/0d17a2c41419c1eb72f39dfbb1ccfc7d.jpg\" style=\"width: 299px;\"\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(165, 165, 165);\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My First Witch Hat 2013 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sold my\nvery first Witch Hat at a local craft fair, and I was so relieved\nwhen this really cool couple bought it. I remember thinking \"...wow I am so\nglad somebody bought that really weird hat...\" and I almost didn\u2019t make\nany more because sometimes it takes more courage to be different than most\nmight realize and highlighting a difference can make you feel vulnerable. But\nasking someone to give you money for being different can touch you down into\nyour deepest ego and leave you the most vulnerable of all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2013, when I made the leap to Witch Hat Millinery, I have built up a considerable \nreputation for\nmy work. In order to pay the rent and put bread on the table, I work non-stop year round filling custom orders for a range of domestic and international clients (including once the Hollywood star Kat Von D) \nand I teach felt\nmaking workshops around the US.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will your financial support be\nused? \n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short; my art is not a hobby or just supplementing my income. Since 2013 my earnings from sales and teaching have been my family\u0027s main source of income - thank you all so much for allowing me to do what I love for a living! In 2015 my husband graduated from grad school and your support has kept a roof over our heads and food in the fridge while he started his job hunt. To everyone who supported us by buying hats over these past four years I want you to know that you are why any of this works - thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0We\u0027re hoping with your help to use Patreon as a fun new way to interact and connect with fans and students, while also helping to cover some of our monthly expenses. Being creative and trying new things can feel extra risky and scary when you\u0027re trying to make ends meet. I\u0027ve got so many ideas for new things to make and I\u0027d love for you to be a part of it! So please consider pledging and watch what happens because of your generosity!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
