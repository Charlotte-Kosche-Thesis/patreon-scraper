     "description": "Many\norganically-approved pest control methods are normally used in field\ncrops: detergent sprays, hot pepper sprays, and oil sprays such as Neem oil and\nstylet oil. These are all safe for people, but they will \u003cstrong\u003eeventually kill \u003c/strong\u003ethe fish in an aquaponics system. This leaves us only with\u00a0 less-than-optimum methods of controlling vegetable pests in these systems. We\u0027ve developed a \"first-generation\" aquaponics system that allows the user to employ ANY kind of organic pesticide they wish without harming the fish. The support we\u0027re requesting will get this design to the 3rd generation, with all the bugs worked out (pun intended!) and fully documented so that it is easy for others to duplicate.\u003cbr /\u003e",

     "description": "In many places greenhouses are only\nused during the winter to keep crops inside warm. However, if that greenhouse\ncould be cooled at a reasonable expense, it could ALSO be used to grow crops in\nthe summertime, making it more profitable on a year-round basis. Basic trials\nhave been done on night-sky cooling, basic evaporative cooling, geothermal\ncooling, and reverse-flow evaporative cooling; we need funding to combine these\nand document the results. Based on some preliminary calculations, we think we\nwill be able to get the water inside an aquaponics system in the greenhouse\ndown into the 60\u0027s (F), and the air inside the greenhouse down into the high\n60\u0027s or low 70\u0027s, when the outside air temperature is in the 105 to 110 degree\nrange. This will be a huge benefit to those growers in hot climates who simply\nabandon their greenhouses during the hot months.\u003cbr /\u003e",
