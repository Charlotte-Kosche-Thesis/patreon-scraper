    "summary": "Flavius Valone Pisapia is a contemporary artist creating non-figurative drawings, paintings and sculptures. He is an Italian national born in Romania in 1981. He is currently based in India where he focusses on art fulltime. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.saatchiart.com/flavius\"\u003ewww.saatchiart.com/flavius\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003efacebook page @fvpfineartist\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArtist\u0027s statement:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Instead of copying nature, I am inspired by the natural world through a process of observation, creative inquiry and perception at a deeper level. For example if I want to paint a tree, I first look at it, draw it as it is, draw it again as a movement, then paint its mood in colour, and finally write a poem or make a physical gesture of it in space. I repeat the process several times, with different media and new approaches, until I have grasped the essence of the Tree. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis process allows a getting to know the being of the tree and how it manifests in nature. The resulting non-figurative work of art is a closer representation of the tree than its mere concept or outer appearance. In fact it is more real that the figurative artwork. Therefore, I work with the essence rather than the appearence. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I were to paint a figurative painting of a tree, for example, I would immediately recognize the concept: Tree. Because of this meeting of my perception with the concept Tree, the artwork needs no further engagement as I know what it\u0027s supposed to portray. The tree in fact is a very complex landscape of convex and concave forms in a particular relationship. It would do the tree an injustice just to copy it without entering into a more intimate conversation with it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNon-figurative works of art use the same elements that make a figurative work of art: planes, curves, edges, lines, colour, transitions, etc. These elements have been studied and incorporated consciously in my artworks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is another aspect of my artwork which is more daring. I believe those who have gained access to nature\u0027s secrets can try to give it a new direction. As most of us can observe, nature is a finished product. An acorn can only become an oak tree. My task is to get to know nature and free it from its limitation, by giving the spirit of the oak tree, for example, new ways of expressing itself in the outer world through a work of art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn non-figurative artworks the viewer contributes to the artwork through actively engageing in it, and by doing so both of them grow. The viewer in imaginative, inspirational and intuitive experiences and the artwork grows in a dynamic way, never quite being finished.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePune, India, 2017\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
