My passion for 10+ years has been to promote, support and nurture Female Indie Artists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI developed Women of Substance in response to what I perceived as a lack of opportunities for quality female musicians to promote their music. Every time I turned on the radio, 90% of what I heard was male artists. This needed to change...and I believe that Women of Substance has definitely played a major role in this shift over the last 10 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve grown a TON as a platform. Our biggest focus now is our Podcast which showcases Indie Artists in all genres. We have hit #1 on iTunes and won a Podcasters Paradise award for \"Most Creative Podcast\". In 2017 we have seen a HUGE increase in listenership - doubling and almost tripling to over 10,000 downloads per month. This is SUPER exciting and I know it\u0027s because of the time and resources we\u0027ve put into selecting stellar artists, creating a great show, and promoting the show on tons of social platforms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs our artist community grew, we created resources to help artists make money from music and learn how to think of their music as a business and like a creative entrepreneur. In 2015, the Female Entrepreneur Musician http://femusician.com was born. The site and accompanying podcast are a treasure trove of inspiration, ideas, training and real life examples of female musicians with thriving careers who are actually making money from music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd to support all the female artists learning and growing at FEMusician.com, I decided to create a free community on Facebook where female musicians could network, share, get support, gig swap and more. It has grown to almost 2,000 amazing artists. We constantly get comments and email about how valuable the community is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all of this awesome growth, it became necessary to build a team of fabulous ladies to make it all happen.
