    "summary": "A path begins somewhere when you are not looking for one. They are often quiet and unassuming while winding winds under feet, wandering off alone around a bend as if it had seen something of interest. Some even disappear up into the branches, or fall deep down into the soft earth. They return quickly, pretending they had not tried to lead you astray. Ribbons twisting in the wind. Bends of light through the loamy moss. Music that grows louder with every step forward. There is no end to this road, nor the beginning ever found, no matter how hard to strain to find it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe path continues onward, once the journey is over.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://fallenlights.net/patreon/fallenlights_colorsketch.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpcoming shows:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSt Louis Comic Con - \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJune 23rd \u0026amp; 24th,\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSt Charles, MO\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGenCon - August 2-5th, Indianapolis, IN\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStrange Folk Fest - Sept 28th-30th, Carondelet Park, St Louis, MO\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWebsites:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fallenlights.net/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFallenlights.net\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/laurapelick\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/3rdgymnopedie\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArtist, mom, and crazy cat lady (plus one lizard).
