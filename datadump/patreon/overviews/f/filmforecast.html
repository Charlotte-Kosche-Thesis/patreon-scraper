    "summary": "Hello, Friends! Thank you for coming to this page. Just by allowing your eyes to take in this information and deliver it to your brains, you are showing that you care about us and the silly-ass podcast we share with you every week. And for that, we thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you forgot, we\u0027re Cavan McGinsie and Kevin Holifield and we co-host \u003cem\u003eFilm Forecast\u003c/em\u003e, a weekly podcast where we try and share fun, funny, and less-often-than-not, insightful takes based on the trailers of forthcoming films and shows. We\u0027re starting out with a simple vision, some beers in our hands, and an inexpensive recording setup in a little home office in Indianapolis. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile this is what we are doing and always want to do, we would like to be able to make the listener experience better, do some monthly specials, add some video aspects, go on tours and most importantly build an awesome network of friends around the country who like to laugh along with us while we\u0027re at it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to do that we need your help in being able to afford growth. Hell, it\u0027d put a smile on our faces to even have a little of our monthly costs of hosting covered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you join our Patreon fam, not only will you help us continue churning out weekly podcasts, but you\u0027ll get to see us grow and do all these awesome things. We both will have a chance to focus more of our time and attention on creating, not only the podcast, but also videos, merch and tour opportunities. And you get to be a part of it.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e What you get:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e($1.00 tier): You\u0027re supporting our show, and you should feel good about that\u00a0because we sure do. You get good feelins\u00a0and access to our exclusive Patreon feed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e($5.00 tier): You also get \u0027dem good, good feels, and access to the Patreon feed, but you also get the shows a day early, on Wednesdays (when possible). Plus, w\u003cstrong\u003ee add you to the Film Forecast Wall of Film on our website and\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eyou get access to all of our bonusodes. That means Forecast Follow-ups for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e($8.00 tier): Now we\u0027re talkin\u0027! You\u0027re feelin\u0027 extra good with your early episodes. You\u0027re getting those Forecast\u00a0Follow-ups. Your beautiful name is on a Wall of Film. But you also get access to online chats with Kevin and Cavan and to possibly be heard on the show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e($10.00 tier): You\u0027re feelin\u0027 so good you\u0027re practically Michael Bubl\u00e9. You get the early access, the bonusodes, the WoF, the Skype chats and you get shouted out on the show once a month. Plus, you get access to secret content that will be posted and vary monthly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e($15.00 tier): You are our Khaleesi and as such we will give you all that you desire. Early access, bonusodes, Skype chats, WoF, monthly shoutouts, secret content, plus you get 50% off our any merch that we bring out, including our first shirts that should be coming out soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e($20.00): This is madness! You get everything everyone else gets, except that first-run shirt, that\u0027s all yours for free. Plus, you get the crown jewel of gifts: You get to co-host an episode based on an upcoming film of your choosing!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe created this podcast with the hope of creating an interactive group of friends who we get to make laugh every week. With your support, we can continue to do that and so much more. In the end, we\u0027re just beyond happy and lucky to have people like you listening and enjoying the show every week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCavan \u0026amp; Kevin\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. If you wanna know what your chedda is going towards here is a simple breakdown.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLibsyn: \u003c/strong\u003eWe host our show through Libsyn, because they\u0027re awesome. But, they also cost us a monthly fee, so by becoming a patron you\u0027re helping take that off our our plate.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSquarespace: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know that beautiful site we have with all the episodes and some other content? That\u0027s from Squarespace and that costs an annual fee, plus we gotta keep that dope URL.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAds: \u003c/strong\u003eWhile we hope to have ads on the show at some point, right now we have been paying for some ads to help bring more people like you to the show. That way, eventually, we can rely purely on you and a bunch of others shouting us out to the world. Until then, we gotta pay to play.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGear: \u003c/strong\u003eThose beautiful voices you hear coming into your ear holes could sound even better as time goes on. The setup we have is a simple one, and it works. But we hope to get better mics, better headphones, better editing software and to add a video component down the road.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShows: \u003c/strong\u003eThe biggest goal we have is to get out on the road and see your beautiful faces for live shows. Whether it be at podcast conventions, local theatres, or a sold-out show at Madison Square Garden (reach for the stars) it\u0027s going to cost us. So, we need to have a steady flow of income before we come to this venture, so we can take some time off of our day jobs and for things like\u00a0food, water, hotels, planes, trains, automobiles...you get the picture.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
