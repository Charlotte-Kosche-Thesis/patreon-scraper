Founded in 2013,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.floridaswimnetwork.com\"\u003eFlorida Swim Network\u003c/a\u003e is rooted in the pursuit of shining a bright spotlight on swimming and diving in the state of Florida. Each year, our efforts range from covering age group meets, and reporting LIVE from the Olympics, to traveling to meets, creating content (video, articles, photos), and providing it to the great state of Florida. The incredible swimming community within this state is what we live for. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.floridaswimnetwork.com/fullsizerender/\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve assembled a team of swimming and diving nerds who are capable of amazing things. Writing, editing, web development, photography, videography, podcasting, live streaming, reporting, and so much more! Owned and operated by two college students, our days are spent studying and completing assignments, as well as working on the site, and creating content\u2026 BUT the only way for us to take this to the NEXT LEVEL, is with your support!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(149, 179, 215);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT WILL WE DO WITH THE MONEY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eOur biggest goal is to be present at the most important events for Florida swimmers and divers. This includes meets like Senior Champs and High School states, as well as World Championships, Commonwealth Games, and\u2026 THE OLYMPICS! We want to shine the brightest light possible on our athletes from Florida, and give them the coverage that they deserve. We will start by combining our skills to make more content for EVERYONE, but of course, a little extra for our supporters!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(149, 179, 215);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAND A BIG NOTE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eFrom day one, this has been a huge experiment for us, and an eye-opening one at that. Working in the public eye can be tough, but we have learned so much already, and don\u2019t plan on stopping anytime soon. From mispronounced names and missed event coverage, to too little notice on meet coverage, we\u2019ve experienced it all. So, one of the biggest things that we want to provide our patrons with, is an opportunity to express what YOU want to see going forward. Do you want us at your child\u2019s next swim meet? Let us know by becoming a patron supporter.If there are new features, other offerings, new tiers, or anything else that you think we can improve on, don\u2019t hesitate to tell us. This is something bigger than ourselves. We do it for our athletes, and we do it for you.Here at Florida Swim Network, we pride ourselves on embracing the community and helping spread user-generated content to the masses. \u003cbr\u003e"
