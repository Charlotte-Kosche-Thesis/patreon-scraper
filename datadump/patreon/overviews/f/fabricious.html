     "description": "This amount would ease both my monthly costs, as well as provide me with enough breathing room to start planning lectures in 3D-sculpting, as well as about paleoart and creature design in general. This would mean I can support my community by providing in-depth knowledge about how I do things first hand and to give away some of the things I\u0027ve spent these past years learning.",

     "description": "This is quite the stretch, but it would mean that I can work on art 24/7 (or at least for a lot more time all week), weekly streams, monthly new finished artworks and more! It would eliminate the need to find an additional underpaid job and it means more goodies for you guys! Everyone wins! Goodies, in this case, would be more printable 3D-models, more fully fledged paleoart scenery pieces, finally some rigging and animation progress, possibly delving into Unreal Engine 4 (for world building) and, in the long run, maybe even demos to let you guys walk around some of the things I make!",
