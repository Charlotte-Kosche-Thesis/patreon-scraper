Our target areas are currently the southwest and midwest. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to do this, we need a stable set of funds to keep the work going and also to book spaces in advance of the retreats and classes themselves. Teaching itself isn\u0027t expensive but the space rental, travel, and audio-visual costs to document and bring the information online typically can be. This is where we need your help to be able to do this work, do it well, and be able to share it both on and offline.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour monthly contribution means being able to bring this work that is a true mixture of the secular yet still spiritual to more people.\u00a0Check out the ways to contribute on this page and also take some time to read my bio and background to learn more about me, my work, and what your contribution means to helping continue the effort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am happy we have met along the journey :-)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for support,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFiltod\u003cbr\u003e"
