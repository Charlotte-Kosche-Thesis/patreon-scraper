The medium first appeared in the 1920s, was\nhugely popular in the 1940s, and has experienced a successful resurgence in the\n2000s thanks to podcasting outlets. If you think about it, audio drama has\nexisted for about as long as the human race has been around. One could argue\nthat the stories shared verbally by our ancestors could be considered audio\ndrama.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWho Are We?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur names are Kasey Heimann and Amanda Gilbertson. We\u2019re a\ncouple of writers and voice acting enthusiasts based in the rural Midwest.\nBetween the two of us, we have a lot of stories we want to share with the\nworld. After discovering audio drama several years ago, we taught ourselves how\nto produce them and are working on putting our stories into audio form. Along\nwith us are several dozen voice actors who help us out on a regular basis. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eCurrent projects include:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupernatural Genderswap\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\nSupernatural is an extremely popular show aired on the CW.\nBeginning in 2005, the show resonates with a lot of people and has accrued a\nmassive following. One of the common complaints of the show is that there are\nno strong women characters or, when they\u2019re there, the show kills them off when\nit does nothing to move the plot along. There is also quite the strong call\nonline to see what Sam and Dean would have been like as women. So that\u2019s what\nwe did. The brothers are now Samantha and Deana, and we\u2019re examining the show\nthrough a more feminine perspective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStatus: Season two in progress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDear Boss\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\nDear Boss is a multi-episode romantic suspense set in the\nfictional town of West Haven, Michigan, that has a Jack the Ripper copycat\nterrorizing the locals.

He has help from a new transfer and old friend, Nemika\nWorthington, who\u2019s come to town specifically to help investigate the case.
