    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my Patron page. I am writing a book on driverless cars with Chris Rice and I wanted to involve people who are interested in the subject in that creative process. Patrons will gain early access to our writing as well as making a contribution to that writing.Patrons will get advanced copies of book chapters as we go along and advanced draft copies of the book in electronic form so they can contribute as we go along.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are writing this book because autonomous cars will alter our economies and our societies over the next 20 years. They will do so by altering our relationships with cars. The personal motor vehicle has significantly shaped the 100 years since the end of World War 1. Our relationship with our cars has changed our cities and our cultures. We are about to move away from a model where we own cars to a model where cars come to us when we need them. That new relationship will shape the next hundred years. Moving to transport as a service will change the car industry, its supply chain, and its business models. But it will also redesign our urban environment and free up large volumes of disposable spending in our communities. The change will destroy some industries, and spawn new ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor technological reasons, some of these changes are still years away. But many of the decisions we need to make will face us well before that. The book is designed to inform decision-makers on the information they need to make decisions, and just as importantly when they need to make them. Each chapter in the third section of the book will tackle a particular area or industry that will be disrupted, detail the strategic decisions that need to be made, and create a set of signposts for decision-makers to look out for.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe book is in three sections:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePart 1\u003c/strong\u003e is designed to examine the background of autonomous vehicles. This includes some basic background about the history of cars using the mapping framework we have used as the basis for the analysis in the book. It also includes the arguments for and against change, and some basic descriptions of the technology involved.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003ePart 2\u003c/strong\u003e dives down into some of the more technical details that are the basis for the technology adoption scenarios we will create. Part 2 also contains several technology adoption scenarios. We have decided to create several scenarios because the current levels of uncertainty make any single forecast useless. We know that producing fancy roadmaps with bold predictions is the way to get headlines and generate consulting income. We also know that the forecasting highway is littered with the bodies of people that do that sort of stuff. It is the height of arrogance to pretend to anticipate all the possible innovations and business models that will arise. So we will create multiple scenarios so decision makers can adjust their thinking as new information comes to light. The scenarios will be used in Part 3 to identify the possible timing of key decisions in every industry we examine. \u003cbr\u003eThis is the section of the book that will become dated the most quickly. Therefore, we will be providing regular updates at after publication of the book at a website we will create. This will include updates of the scenarios and changes to the timing points for key decisions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003ePart 3\u003c/strong\u003e is an examination of the many areas of our societies that will be affected by transport as a service. Each chapter will describe the disruptions in a particular area, and identify key decisions that need to be made. If you are interested in, or involved in a particular sector then you can just look at the chapters you think will affect you. However, we would encourage you to look at all of the chapters because change often comes from unexpected directions or sectors. Chapters include the bus industry, the parking industry, insurance, council and urban design, car dealers, car repairers, convenience stores, and tourism.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0It is my privilege to work as a futurist in an exciting world of big ideas. If writing this book makes a small contribution to better strategies and better communities then I will be well pleased. I hope that you will come along and support us in our venture, and make a contribution to our writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaul Higgins\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eDecember 2017\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
