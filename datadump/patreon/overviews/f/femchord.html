    "summary": "femchord started in when we got sick of hearing \u201cI don\u2019t know any women in music.\u201d Now, more than 70 episodes later, we\u0027ve talked with women and nonbinary people in all aspects of the music industry, from artists to poster designers to venue owners.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003efemchord is created and managed by Julia Wejchert and Kate Ida. Julia and Kate are former college roommates with masters in gender policy and an obsession with music. Julia and Kate use their combined passions of gender equality, activism, and music to create compelling writing and radio, and elevate voices of those who might not currently be heard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaven\u0027t heard femchord yet? You can stream femchord live every Tuesday night at 10 pm (ET) on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://radiofreebrooklyn.com\"\u003eradiofreebrooklyn.com\u003c/a\u003e. You can also find all episodes of femchord on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://femchord.com\"\u003efemchord.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe love bringing you\u00a0features, playlists, and a kickass radio show highlighting music acts and women and nonbinary people involved in all aspects music. But we need your help to support this work.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting femchord, you not only help us keep up day-to-day operations of running the radio show, but also help us to expand our endeavor to bring new and exciting forms of content. Here\u0027s a breakdown of how your support will help us:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEquipment:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Think femchord sounds great now? Don\u0027t settle. Imagine what glory will hit your ears with better mics, mixers, and other recording gear.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEvents: \u003c/strong\u003eWhat\u0027s better than Kate and Julia IRL? Last year, we hosted our first live-audience broadcast of femchord at the SXSW Podcast Stage. Your support will help us to continue to put on live events and femchord-sponsored concerts.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLearning: \u003c/strong\u003eSomeone once told Kate, in what was probably the worst non-compliment one can give a radio host: \"You\u0027re really brave for bringing a voice that isn\u0027t really a professional radio voice to the station.\" Aka, you\u0027re really brave for using your woman-voice. We want to make sure that women and nonbinary people involved in music are heard, but that women\u0027s voices are considered just as professional when they\u0027re on the other end of the mic.\u00a0We\u0027re looking forward to bringing on our first intern to bring more women and nonbinary people to radio.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMerch\u003c/strong\u003e: C\u0027mon, who doesn\u0027t love swag?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the beginning, femchord has been entirely listener supported. We want you to feel like your in the back seat of the car talking about the great new music that just came on the radio. (We really imagine this to be the back seat of the yellow convertible from \u003cem\u003eCrossroads, \u003c/em\u003eand the song to be something by Shania, but we don\u0027t want to limit your imagination.) So tune in\u2014the best support you can give us is your ears!"
