    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Rachel. When I was born, I was Rachel Kilian. Now thanks to the most wonderful dude, I\u0027m Rachel Allai. I am a passionate, creative free spirit who is asking for help. I am asking for your financial support so that I can fulfill my life\u0027s dream of helping animals and eco-systems around the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd how do I plan to do that? Well, money would be a great start! But once that ball gets rolling, I want to document my adventures and share all of this with you. I have a degree in wildlife biology, master-gardener status, a license to rehab wild animals and an unofficial certificate in the art of monkey bridge building. OH! And I play the violin. No fiddle. No violin. No. Fiddle. :D \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith patron support I will:\u00a0\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRaise awareness in my home town of Lawrence, KS about wildlife corridors \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelp rehabilitate and release injured and orphaned wild animals \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHave time to garden for me, the birds and the bees  \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAfford healthy, sustainable, local food \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eShare my music with you\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOffer how-to-play-the-violin videos (for free on you-tube)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTravel back to Costa Rica to help build monkey bridges!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy plan:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eCo-host a block party in my neighborhood \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eContinue to volunteer at Operation Wildlife which helps me gain insight into our wildlife/people conflict \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eShare gardening tips, including how to bring pollinators to your yard \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake videos or share behind-the-scenes content into both bands I play with, \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ean all-girl folk group called the Skirts\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eand the bluegrass band I have with my mate, Brandon, called Signal Ridge.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake violin tutorial videos (fiddle faerie)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDocument my travels and adventures with photos, videos, poems and/or stories!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo there it is. I am asking for $1 a month. I know that doesn\u2019t seem like a whole lot, but after spending time in nature (and with David Attenborough), it sure seems like the animals that accomplish astronomical feats are part of an incredible community. Take bees. In a year, one bee will visit 55,000 flowers and only make \u00bd teaspoon of honey. You might say, wow, that\u2019s not a lot of honey. But an entire colony can make a pound after 2 million flower visits. For the work I wish to do, it\u2019s going to take a hive. And 55,000 flowers is a lot of flowers!! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I know in my heart that this planet needs help. I also know that I need help! \u003cbr\u003eSo, In a nutshell, I will continue to do what I love to do, but be able to have financial stability. And peace of mind that I\u2019ve got a community behind me. And that. Is. Priceless.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading.\u003cbr\u003eSo much love!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRachel\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
