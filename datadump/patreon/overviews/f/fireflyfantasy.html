Now in case you\u0027re wondering what the heck my page is about here\u0027s the explanation you were looking for. I\u0027m a writer who is in the midst of several books and is looking to find a new audience after migrating from being on Figment (awesome writer community, for those who aren\u0027t familiar) for several years and as well have been working since I\u0027m about eight to make the transition from being a storyteller to those around her, to being a professional storyteller if you will. My goal is approximately every few months or so to complete the drafts of one of my books, and raise money along the way to be able to work with a top notch editor to start submitting to publishing houses and make the transition from being published solely online. My writing style is mainly magic realism and fantasy but I am also a poet as well. So if quirky, whimsical writing, with a sense of magic appeal to you then welcome, and I sincerely hope to make you a fan of my work."
