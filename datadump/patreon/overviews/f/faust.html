    "summary": "I write. I think I do so with a modicum of excellence. I am also poor. By varying the lengths of my sentences, it gives this paragraph an interesting flow. You don\u0027t believe me? Try reading this paragraph aloud, enunciate every punctuation properly; for instance, make sure to give almost a full \u0027period\u0027 break before saying this half of the semi-colon punctuated sentence! Okay, that was fun. Let\u0027s move on to serious discussion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a 26 year old writer. I have aspirations of becoming a science fiction and fantasy laureate. Those are high-minded goals, to be sure; however, I do not see them as unrealistic. The average fiction author in the USA makes between $24k and $32k. Right now, I\u0027m not the average fiction author- to say the least- and most of what I make goes to keeping myself fed, clothed, and out of the elements. That doesn\u0027t keep me from working hard, but it does make the process quite sacrificial. To write means to use time that isn\u0027t spent making money RIGHT NOW.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is something I\u0027ve adored since I was 4 years old. I would scribble on pages before I could form full, written sentences. In doing that, I developed a profound love of reading, writing, words, and those who craft with them. I have often, in my more haughty days, envisioned myself as the next Tolkien or Lewis, or Asimov. Sadly for me, most of them had careers in writing by my age and were establishing a name that would help them get published. Despite my talent that job market is drier than the average oasis mirage, just not as sandy. There\u0027s little way to get your foot in the door, and e-publishing has not made the biggest impression on the classical publishing world as of the present day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy giving me the financial freedom to create my works, you\u0027re accelerating my ascent into the realm of the published, and perhaps forwarding the release of a physical, or digital, piece of fiction literature. That sounds like a worthwhile endeavor, yes? I\u0027m not going to pander on my \"About\" blurb. I\u0027ll save that for the reward for patronage."
