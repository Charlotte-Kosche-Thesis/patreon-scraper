It\u0027s a blast! I also love teaching others the creative joy of needle felting and can\u0027t imagine finding anything more fulfilling to do with my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"308\" src=\"https://feltalive.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/kayx410.jpg\" width=\"281\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tell my students all the time that you can needle felt nearly anything you can imagine. I imagine all kinds of my favorite characters from pop culture, but I also have some loftier needle felting dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDid you know that you can help me needle felt my dreams?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI figured out a way I could needle felt the studio of my dreams - a place I\u0027ve imagined since I first started teaching.\u00a0 It\u0027s a creative place with plenty of room for friends from near and far to gather called the Felt Alive Fiber Arts Retreat Center. (check out my goals to learn more!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeedle felting something so big will take some help from my needle felting friends. \u00a0(You know what they say about a friend in need? :) \u00a0To join in, all you have to do is become a Felt Alive Needle Felting Friend and sponsor me for as little as $1.00 per new caricature doll I create.\u00a0 I\u0027ll make 3 or 4 dolls every month and with enough sponsors, I can literally needle felt my dreams into reality.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePlus you can share in all the fun as I make the dolls to build the dream!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so fortunate to have a community of needle felting friends through my zany dolls and through my video tutorials.  I know how much people love giving back and that\u0027s why I\u0027m confident we can all needle felt something amazing together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHOW DOES IT WORK? you ask\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is all set-up to handle your monthly pledge safely and securely.  Needle felted doll making takes a bit of time so you can expect to sponsor no more than 4 dolls each month - or you can set your limit for how many you\u0027d like to sponsor.\u00a0 And not that you\u0027d want to, but of course you can cancel your sponsorship at any time.\u00a0 No problem :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT DO YOU GET? you ask\u003cbr\u003eOf course, Felt Alive Needle Felting Friends will get a VIP pass to visit the Dream studio when it comes true.\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way, I\u0027ll share the behind-the-scenes fun on my felting pad.\u003cbr\u003eYou can help me decide on what caricature to make next and share in my enthusiasm of this fun craft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI post stuff that only my patrons can see\u003c/strong\u003e so for my students who are learning how to needle felt with me in my videos, the tips and advice I share as I bring my dolls to life may be invaluable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHERE\u0027S MORE! \u00a0Your sponsorship also helps me provide all of my tutorial videos free to the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, how about it? \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eBecome a Felt Alive Needle Felting Friend\u003c/strong\u003e and for just a buck a doll you can sponsor my dream AND help me continue to freely share this fun and amazing art craft with the world. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://feltalive.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/coneheads-feltalive-700x.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003ePer creation pledge? It\u0027s a rather new concept but just think of it as crowd-funding. It\u0027s brilliant, really, and it may just make the words \u0027starving\u0027 and \u0027artist\u0027 go their separate ways forever. And no worries that I\u0027ll go into super-sonic doll-making mode - you can put a cap on how many doll  creations you are able to support.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://feltalive.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/needle-felted-dylan-doll-bw02.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://feltalive.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cropped-dsc01046.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support means everything to me and I thank you from the bottom of my heart!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLove and hugs from your friend in needle felting - xoxoxo\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nKay Petal\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.feltalive.com\"\u003ewww.feltalive.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
