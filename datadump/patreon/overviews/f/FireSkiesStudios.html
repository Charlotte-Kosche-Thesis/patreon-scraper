The kind I wanted to play when I was a kid, and the kind I want to see exist now as an adult. Thank you for all support towards me and my work. It literally means everything in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Fireskies Studios has existed in some form since 2011, but along with life\u0027s ups and downs, has come in and out of my focus for various reasons (mostly financial!) Therefore I\u0027m determined now to make sure it can STAY my focus for a long a career as you wonderful people out there will allow me to have it. My game designs are based on original characters and trying to best express them and their stories through gameplay."
