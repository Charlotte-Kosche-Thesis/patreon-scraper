Based in Manassas, VA, the Library\u0027s twin goals are the preservation and education of the Furry Fandom.\u00a0The Library is available for people to look through by appointment or special event, with selections from the Library brought to conventions as part of educational presentations.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhat\u0027s in the Furry Library?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Furry Library is currently hosted on Librarika, at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://furryarchive.librarika.com/\"\u003ehttps://furryarchive.librarika.com/\u003c/a\u003e. There you can find the full index of works.\u00a0As of current writing, it is at \u003cem\u003e1,279\u003c/em\u003e unique titles and covers, with more items to be added.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eItems in the Furry Library include comics, magazines, Amateur Press Association publications, novels, non-fiction books, convention books and fliers, CDs, DVDs, calendars, art folios, and even some convention gifts. The Library also includes an apparently rare\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://furryarchive.librarika.com/search?category_id=44837\"\u003efull collection of Furrlough\u003c/a\u003e, all 199 issues including specials and a special Ashcan.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy develop a Library of Furry works?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u0027t want to lose our Fandom\u0027s history because all the comics and zines are boxed up in some closet - I want to make certain that the work of the early Fandom remains available to both older furs who missed them and newer furs who joined after they had fallen into obscurity. By expanding the Library with acquisitions and giving presentations, I hope to prevent these works to be lost to us as a subculture.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your help, we can make certain the Furry Fandom\u0027s history remains something we can be inspired by as we create new works.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does the Furry Library do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBeyond archiving and cataloging, the Furry Library also aims to educate. So many are unaware of the existence of older comics and books. For this goal, the Library (where possible) does panels and talks at Furry conventions, making selections of the Library available to be looked at.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition, the Library e-publishes monthly updates from Rabbit Valley blind box openings, as well as new acquisitions bulletins and eventually articles, interviews, and eventually a unified database for research and analysis purposes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does pledged money go towards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPledged money goes to three general categories: Acquisitions, Supplies, and Upkeep.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAcquistions covers all purchases of Furry comics, magazines, APAs, novels, convention books, and all other items that the Library\u0027s mandate encompasses. Supplies both includes boxes, packing slips, tape, furniture, as well as any equipment, licensing, or hosting. Upkeep are any expenses incurred to the Librarian directly because of operating the Library. At sufficient funding levels, this also includes a salary for the Librarian to work full time on the Library.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Library will publish a monthly report detailing expenses and payments made by the Furry Library.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho is the Librarian?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Henry Thiel, but I\u0027m more commonly known in the fandom as Summercat. I joined the Furry Fandom in 1999 when I was 14, and attended my first event at the Prancing Skilltaire\u0027s 2003 Christmas Party. As I grew older I absorbed the stories the older Furries I hung out with had to say, and developed a passion and desire to collect Furry comics. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Furry Library grew from my personal collection out of a desire to preserve, educate, and keep alive the older works that helped inspire and grow the fandom I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for reading!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this entire spiel. I hope that I\u0027ve convinced you to toss a few bucks my way! Every bit helps. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e"
