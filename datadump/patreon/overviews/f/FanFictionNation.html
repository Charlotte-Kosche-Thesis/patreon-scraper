    "summary": "OK here\u0027s the deal with who we are and why we\u0027re starting a Patreon account:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Situation:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are Mark Cotoia and Kyle Andrews, two friends and fellow comedians who grew up in Toronto and have spent years writing and performing fanfiction for local audiences. We started Fanfiction Nation in the fall of 2016 on the theory that fanfiction-based comedy could and should be consumed on a regular basis as a form of escapism and entertainment from the MADNESS around the world right now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe had initially been working as part of a different fanfiction vehicle previously, dating back to 2012, but for creative differences we had to go our separate ways. Too many cooks in the kitchen. You get the idea. But we still loved creating fanfiction to a freakish degree and wanted an outlet. So we put our own savings together and invested close to $1000 into this venture. This included website and logo creation, podcast hosting fees, and recording software and accessories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFanfiction Nation has had a great start and slowly but surely we\u0027ve been developing a unique and enthusiastic listener base. In the last year, we\u0027ve written and curated over 50 episodes, and Fanfiction Nation has become essentially a part-time job for us.  We know two things now: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) We want Fanfiction Nation to go on for a long time. The beta test is over. It works. We have listeners and viewers. We\u0027re obsessed with writing fanfiction comedy\u2014it\u0027s some of the most fun we\u0027ve ever had doing anything. This should continue for a long time, in some form or another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) We need to make Fanfiction Nation self-sustaining for this to work. The \"fund Fanfiction Nation with savings\" plan was fine for Phase 1, but it\u0027s not sustainable. Our savings are unimpressive. If Fanfiction Nation is going to go on for a long time, it has to be able to support itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThinking about the long-term self-sustaining plan, we decided we don\u0027t want to use ads. Ads are annoying and hurt the user experience, and we can come up with a better way to do it. So far, we have one key method: \u003cstrong\u003eDonations\u003c/strong\u003e. We\u0027ve had a lot of fans tell us that Patreon is a best way for readers and listeners to support our site. So we\u0027re trying it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way Patreon works is any fan can donate whatever they want per month and the donation is recurring each month after that. So anything, from $1/month up, is extremely helpful to the cause.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We\u0027ll Use the Money For\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur initial goal is $3,000/month. That money will be enough to keep our site going, indefinitely. Here are Fanfiction Nation\u0027s costs:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHosting. We need a robust enough hosting plan to support the highest spikes in traffic we ever get so we don\u0027t crash during those moments and ruin my happiness. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMailChimp. The service we use to email posts out to the subscription list. This fee grows as the email list grows.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOngoing web development. It\u0027s a website, so there are always upsetting glitches coming out of nowhere and occasionally, we add a new site feature. Neither of us has any programming skills, so we need to pay someone for this.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFacebook post \"boosts\". When we announce a new post on Facebook, this makes sure that the announcement gets onto 1/3 or 1/2 of our Facebook followers\u0027 News Feeds.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUs.\u00a0We need to continue to eat things and wear things and turn lights on as we write and produce funny content for you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose are the basics. With those pieces covered, Fanfiction Nation can support itself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d be happy to keep doing things exactly how we\u0027re doing them for a long time, and now we can. We\u0027d also love to do even more if it becomes possible, which is where the stretch goal comes in: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStretch Goal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe stretch goal will allow us to take Fanfiction Nation to the next level, enabling us to do things like: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eProducing more weekly podcasts\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLaunching a web store\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpgrading our audio and video recording equipment\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHaving the ability to produce video sketches each week\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePaying for famous people to guest on our show\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTour at Comic Cons\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe stretch goal would be amazing to hit, but simply being totally supported by reader generosity makes us endlessly grateful, no matter what else happens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, thanks for any support you can offer if you decide to, and thanks for being a reader!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2013 Kyle and Mark"
