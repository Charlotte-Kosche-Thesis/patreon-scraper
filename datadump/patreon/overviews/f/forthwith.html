Join Twilight on her epic quest to destroy The Elements in Harmony in time for the thousandth Summer Sun Celebration to save Princess Luna\u0027s/Nightmare Moon\u0027s life and freedom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny fan fiction I write has been and always will be free, but the more financial support I receive for my writing, the more often I can indulge both in writing and in delivering chapters to you, the reader. In addition to receiving more words more often, you may also receive some of the fabulous prizes listed to the right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith \u003cem\u003eThe Moon\u0027s Apprentice\u003c/em\u003e drawn to a close, it\u0027s time to move on to what comes next. \u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922890/1/\"\u003eHarry and Hermione Starring In: The Digital Revolution\u003c/a\u003e (title change on FF.net pending) is a Harry Potter story where Hermione convinces Harry to actually listen to her and prepare himself for the challenges ahead of him, rather than relying on dumb luck and fate to keep him alive. A midnight conversation between the two leads to a promise to do better, regardless of breaking one, two, or a dozen laws along the way. With a definitely safe wand, allies expecting her to be the next dark lady, and a free summer, what is a girl to do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is its own reward, but having so many readers makes it even more worthwhile.
