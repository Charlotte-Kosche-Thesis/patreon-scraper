Xander is very video game and YouTube oriented so it was decided we would do our projects on video. We want to encourage other parents to learn with their kids. Make the makers! We created this Patreon account to allow our follower to have an option to support us. All monies raised here will be first and foremost used to support our projects by buying supplies, equipment, and parts. We thank all of you for following and supporting us in any way you can."
