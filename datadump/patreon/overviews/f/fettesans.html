Each of these five days will reveal a different installation and/or performance.\u003cbr\u003eOn the morning of August 1st, 2017, I will leave the room.\u003cbr\u003eBy the end of November 2017, I will produce a book as a conclusion of my time spent in the room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page was created specifically for this project, it is meant to exist as a sort of a hallway to the room. In this hallway, from now on and for the duration of the five-month long performance, I will leave traces of my passage, hints as to why I will eventually be in this room, what I will be making, and who I will be meeting there. These perimeters will also allow for a certain language to develop - how does one communicate with the *outside world* when the world is already *inside the room*?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e---\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the work \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fettesans.com/fabulist.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eUntitled [The Fabulist Hunting the Fringes]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, I staged the rehearsal of a fictitious performance between two people, namely, \u003cem\u003eThe Director (Her)\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Actor (Er)\u003c/em\u003e.
