    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eContinued Development\u003c/h3\u003e\nFortressCraft is a complete, released game.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, like Diablo 3 and Team Fortress 2 before it, it\u0027s not a finished game. I love my game, and I want to add so much more to it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently I\u0027ve got 122 weeks of planned features:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g6b5KS49Ni19HjA0-tbisNLuYtH8uDmXJ2yQ94ZN7xs/edit#gid=1206591954\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g6b5KS49Ni...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e...and more are being added and suggested daily.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a dev, I get a very small proportion of the proceeds from the sales of the game (Tax, Publishers and Valve all whittle that away). Whilst it is doing quite well right now, thanks to DireWolf20, TangoTek and friends, to continue to work on the game long-term requires a lot more money than the game is currently making - and by \u0027long-term\u0027 I mean the next 5 to 10 years. PCs are gonna get a lot faster in that time!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve already implemented \n\u003ca href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/400400/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDLC\u003c/a\u003e to help supplement my income, but to be quite honest, that only just about gives me enough to survive on - to pay contributers and artists for new work needs a further revenue stream. I do not want to have to get a part-time job to support myself writing this - I want to continue to plough 100+ hours \u00a0a week into improving the game I love. Hence, Patreon (Tax aside, I should receive 95% of the money taken through this!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003e\nThe advantage of Patreon is that it\u0027s regular, guaranteed income - as an added bonus, it gives extra motivation to get the next mainline patch out! Steam income comes and goes; Summer and Winter sales are AMAZING - whereas the lull around February/March is horrible. \u00a0Just to be clear, this is mainline releases, not the daily Bleeding Edge patch!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/h3\u003e\nI\u0027ve requested a \u0027private\u0027 DLC AppID from Valve, and Patreon backers above $10 should receive that. This will, at a minimum, contain a unique skin, a unique ARTHER skin, a unique SpiderBot skin, and access to the TechAxe.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.fortresscraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bleh-02.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.fortresscraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bleh-02.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\nHelp us build the Community Pack rewards!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\nI plan to continue releasing patches on the same cycle as currently. This is roughly 2 weeks of frantic feature addition, 1 week of polish, and 1 week of bug testing. This should mean patches come out roughly once a month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons will get access to all current and future Expansion packs (Tentatively titled \u0027Frozen Factory Expansion\u0027 and the \u0027Magma Core Expansion\u0027)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince the game left Early Access in October 2015, there have been 4 major patches released, featuring dozens of new machines and features, and the next one is due around the start of March. Pledge now and be the first to get the exclusive Patreon skins! ;-)\n\u003cbr\u003e"

If you\u0027re here thinking \"Wow, this guy is really trying to fleece us here!\", then this section is for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting games is expensive. Running a company is expensive. The general wisdom is that you take someone\u0027s wage, and double it, and that\u0027s how much they cost you. So if I have a studio of 10 people, earning a fairly-crappy wage of \u00a325k, then that\u0027s going to cost me half a million a year just to keep them in wages. Every year. And that leaves no money or wiggle room for expansions or failure.
