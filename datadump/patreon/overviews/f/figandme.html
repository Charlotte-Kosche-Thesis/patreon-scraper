    "summary": "Welcome!\u003cbr\u003eI am so happy you have found yourself here, another little corner of the vast world that is Fig and Me. My name is Fabiola, but everybody calls me Fabs; I am a doll maker and creative in many other areas as well: writing, photography, teaching and mothering. I live between Canada and Mexico, \u00a0have a small family I lug everywhere with me, including a rowdy pup called Luna.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut why are we here? I created this nook this year so that I can connect at a deeper level with YOU. Let me explain.\u00a0I firmly believe that when you place yourself on the right path, magic happens. I had been meaning to create more videos, vlogs, quick tutorials, and most especially to turn some of my stories into little movies. The dolls alone don\u0027t leave me much time to spare, but I really want to put my intention into this new adventure and share more with you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have created this portal so you and I can have fun together. I will take the videos (and make occasional goodies too!) and you will get to enjoy them. These videos are made for your use, indulgence, witnessing and further understanding of the beautiful art of dollmaking...and for my pure raw creative pleasure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHOW DOES THIS WORK?\u003cbr\u003eGlad you ask. I have only one tier (we like to keep things simple). By becoming a Patron of Fig and Me for $10 per month (charged monthly) you will be provided with a weekly video, that can range from a short vlog where I discuss current creation process, how a doll is being made, sewing or knitting tutorials, and more importantly: doll stories too. You can delete your pledge whenever you want to (but you will be charged for that specific month) and you have to pledge every month in order to keep watching the videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease know, \u003cstrong\u003ethese are NOT doll making classes, nor is this a doll making school\u003c/strong\u003e. I don\u0027t want you to subscribe if you think that\u0027s what you are getting into. I am working on putting together in-depth online classes for you to take, but what I publish here are small doll making videos, little snippets of the dolls\u0027 creation and their stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you, \u003cstrong\u003ethank you\u003c/strong\u003e if you are considering being part of my Circle of Trust and allowing me to share with you the deep passion I have for what I do."
