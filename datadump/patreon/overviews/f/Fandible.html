    "summary": "The\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.fandible.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFandible.Com Roleplaying Podcast\u003c/a\u003e is a group of five dedicated and incredibly nerdy gamers based in New York City. We\u2019ve combined our love of crafting one-of-a-kind stories with podcasting to produce a weekly actual play podcast since 2010.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Fandible?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFandible.Com has grown since its initial inception in 2010, but at its core our mission has always been the same: have a hell of a lot of fun, record it, and hope some people out there on the Internet find us entertaining. Over 4 years into this experiment, we\u2019re having just as much fun as ever, and find new like-minded gamers and listeners every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe play as many Saturdays a month as we can get together, playing games in a variety of genres. From big names like Warhammer 40k and New World of Darkness, to playtesting the latest indie story games, we look first and foremost for games that will allow us to put the stories of our wild adventurers first. Our game sessions are then edited into 1-2 episodes, and posted every Friday like clockwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the core podcast, we also write articles about gaming and short stories continuing the adventures of our characters or fleshing out the collective worlds we play in. We also have the semi-regular \u2018Geeky Topics Round Table\u2019 podcast, which involves a lot of drinking and laughter as we debate the latest geeky news or wax nostalgic about our favorite geeky pastimes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind out more about Fandible\u2019s members through our social media sites:\u003cbr\u003eWilliam Coffing -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/108299379272570945806/about\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGoogle +\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TheMindfulFool\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAngela Craft -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+AngelaCraft/about\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGoogle +\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/angelacraft\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDavid Donnelly -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/117639127479121679764/about\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGoogle +\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Distractionista\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDaniel Rodriguez -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/+DanielRodriguez42/posts\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGoogle +\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/katsushiro\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJesus Rodriguez -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JesusARodriguezEternal\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGoogle +\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Arvandus\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eALL of Fandible\u2019s offerings will continue to be free for the public to consume on our website. This Patreon campaign is just to help defray a few costs and help us continue to grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon and why now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve been thinking about doing some fundraising for Fandible for some time now, and Patreon is the right tool at the right time for us. With a recent gift getting us much better sound equipment, we want to make sure the rest of the site is matching up to our fabulous new sound. Your contributions will help pay for concrete things like webhosting and quality of life upgrades like (potentially!) no more Google Adsense ads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also feel that while the internet is an amazing place (it\u2019s where our podcast lives, after all!), the gaming community is far more than just the internet. If this Patreon reaches a high enough milestone, we\u2019ll be able to start offsetting travel costs to gaming conventions around the northeast, and even around the United States. Individual members of Fandible have traveled to Origins and Pax East, and we made our debut as a group at Metatopia in 2013. We had such fun attending that con as a group, we hope to make it the first of many conventions we attend and participate in - as gamers, GMs, and panelists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy sponsor us?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are tons of excellent actual play podcasts out on the internet, but we believe that Fandible.Com brings a few special things to the community\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eCommitment to diversity: Our players reflect the reality of the gaming community today, a diverse group of men and women interested in having fun and telling stories. We strive to tell complex stories that have respectful and positive portrayals of people from all walks of life.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReliability: Fandible.Com has been going strong for over\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003efour\u003c/strong\u003e years with no slow down in our posting schedule. We aren\u2019t a fairweather group that will fall apart and leave you hanging as soon as the going gets rough. We are committed to each other and the stories we tell on Fandible and now we\u2019re committed to you, our patrons!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDiverse selection of games: While we started out by relying heavily on Warhammer 40k, we\u2019ve branched out to play games in almost every genre of tabletop games conceivable, from urban fantasy to horror to historical. We\u2019ve even dabbled in some traditional high fantasy games as well. We love exploring new play styles, playing games that use special dice, tarot cards, or a Jenga tower to test skills, in addition to the usual polyhedral dice gamers everywhere are familiar with.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does Fandible produce on a monthly basis?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.fandible.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFandible.Com\u003c/a\u003e already posts an episode of our actual play podcast every Friday evening, and that won\u2019t be changing! You\u2019ll continue to hear the high quality gaming that our fans have grown to love. In addition, we\u2019re committing to a regular schedule of blog posts and supplemental podcasts to thank the Patreon community for their support. Because of you, Fandible.Com will include the following every month:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e4-5 new actual play podcasts, one posted every Friday\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA minimum of 4 blog posts per month, related to gaming or geek culture, posted once a week\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA minimum of 1 Geeky Topics Round Table podcast per month\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
