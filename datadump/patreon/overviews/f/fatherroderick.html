    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m father Roderick Vonh\u00f6gen, a Dutch Catholic priest. And a big Star Wars fan, as you may have noticed :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThousands of podcasts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSince 2005, I have been creating thousands of audio and video programs that have reached millions of people all over the world. In my shows\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://trideo.com/category/wlk/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Walk\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://trideo.com/category/thedailybreakfast/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Daily Breakfast\u003c/a\u003e, I talk about movies, games, technology, geek culture and faith.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOn my personal\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/fatherroderick\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYoutube channel\u003c/a\u003e, that of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/trideomedia\"\u003eTrideo Media\u003c/a\u003e and on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.trideo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTrideo.com\u003c/a\u003e, I share my video productions and vlogs. My first reaction Star Wars video was seen by more than a million people. It is an amazing opportunity to reach out and bring them joy, hope and inspiration. It\u0027s a fitting mission for a priest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHelp me expand my mission!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRight now, there is a huge audience on Youtube that we can\u0027t reach with audio shows. Luckily, I have been working in television production for many years now, and I have a lot of ideas for video productions. But video is more time-intensive and costly than audio.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I need your help. With your support as a Patron, you can help me expand my mission to the world of online video. There is a great need for video productions that bring the world of faith and popular culture together. Like in my newest project: I hope to make a Lego web series for kids to help parents teach them about faith in a fun and entertaining way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you become my patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWith your support, I can realize this project and many other video projects. And of course, I want to give you something in return in the form of extra content, both audio and video.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut the most important reason to join me as a patron, is that\n\u003cstrong\u003e you can help me make a positive difference in this world\u003c/strong\u003e. So many people who saw my videos told me how much joy it gave them. How it changed their views on priests and on faith. How surprised they were to learn that the world of geeks and popular culture has such amazing connections to deeper layers of faith and spirituality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope you will join me. And together we can rule the universe... no wait, that was someone else\u0027s line. :)\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut join me anyway!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFr. Roderick Vonh\u00f6gen"
