I\u0027ve been absolutely against providing my work for a cost or even asking for donations as this is my passion and never feels like work, but now that I\u0027ve made doing this my full time work, every bit of support is extremely appreciated.\u00a0By helping support me with this Patreon page, I can dedicate more of my time to creating the video game guitar videos that you guys have loved and I\u0027ve loved making!"
