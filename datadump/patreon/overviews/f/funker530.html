    "summary": "We have been told by YouTube that our YouTube channel and most combat footage on their site may be deleted at anytime within the next 30 days due to the controversial nature of the content. We have already been kicked out of our YouTube network without an explanation, and it\u0027s only a matter of time before Facebook follows suit and we are shut down for good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe anticipated that this would happen years ago so we already have our own website and video servers up and running, but the cost to upkeep and grow a video hosting website is extremely high and we need to grow quickly if we want to survive and continue to reach all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e100% of funds generated from our patrons will go directly to improving our website with more social features, launching a mobile app, and hiring more combat veteran writers and staff. The new website and mobile app will allow us to continue reaching the masses with important news and videos, without a spin from the mainstream media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to grow quickly, employ more combat veterans, and keep all of our content FREE for the world to see. Patreon is the best way for us to achieve our goals while avoiding memberships and pay walls like other sites have chosen to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout Funker530:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFUNKER530 is a combat veteran owned and operated organization that strives to bring the public an unfiltered view into conflicts unfolding around the globe. Our veteran writers do their best to use their experiences to analyze and translate footage so that the general public can better understand the world outside of their bubble.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also realize how important it is to archive combat footage now that most other large video platforms are deleting crucial pieces of history by the thousands each day. We have been told by YouTube that they may be deleting our YouTube channel within the next 30 days, which will destroy the largest archive of combat footage from Afghanistan and Iraq. As far as the rest of the world is concerned, those specific events will have never occurred.\u003cbr\u003e"
