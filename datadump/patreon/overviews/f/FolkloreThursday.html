    "summary": "Firstly, we\u0027d like to thank all of our wonderful Patreon sponsors, who really do all make #FolkloreThursday possible, as well as thank everyone who volunteers with us, writes such amazing articles, and every single person who comes on the hashtag day each Thursday to share in the glorious lore that makes #FolkloreThursday what it is!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe #FolkloreThursday hashtag day runs weekly, each Thursday, on Twitter and is moderated from the @FolkloreThurs account between 9am and 8pm UK time. The website (\u003ca href=\"http://www.folklorethursday.com)\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.folklorethursday.com\u003c/a\u003e) is updated weekly with a range of fabulous articles about selected folklore topics and the best folklore events and happenings in the global folklore community. You can sign up for our monthly newsletter via website, where you can find out all the latest #FolkloreThursday news, receive exclusive discounts on folklore books, as well as enter our competitions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#FolkloreThursday is run solely on a voluntary basis, taking around 20-50 hours a week between us to monitor the hashtag, organise articles for the website and keep everything running smoothly! At the moment, we have nearly 18000 Twitter followers joining in the hashtag day, and an average of 19000 website visits each month - all with no money coming in to help with website costs, the hosting package fees, prospective mailing list charges, or the time it takes to run. While we\u0027ve appeared in the Independent newspaper and on the BBC, we don\u0027t receive any external funding to help us, and that means we have no money coming in to grow into something bigger!\u00a0(In fact, at the moment we\u0027re scared to push #FolkloreThursday anymore, as we will soon be whacked with a massive bill for website hosting - help us to shout about #FolkloreThursday and get even more people joining in by pledging just a little each month to help us!) You can pledge any monthly amount over one dollar, but we\u0027ve given a few pledge amounts and ideas here on this page to start you off ... right from a $1 a month \u0027appreciative nod\u0027 through to a $15 a month \u0027tip of the hat\u0027 to be an official #FolkloreThursday patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love #FolkloreThursday and find yourself clicking post after post for hours on end each Thursday, do consider making a pledge to help us keep #FolkloreThursday alive and sustainable. All pledges - however small - will be gratefully received and seen as a tip of the hat to the work we\u0027re doing to build a place for folklore at the modern fireside that the internet has become!"
