I have been writing for as long as I can remember and now that I am an adult I shall turn my love of creating stories for others into a sustainable job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am deeply honored that you are interested in joining my community of fantastic readers! I would be writing stories no matter my situation but it is through Patreon that I have the ability to focus on my works and continue to create for you. As one of my patrons, you will receive perks that are specifically designed for you. From sneak-peak looks at upcoming chapters, behind the scenes look at the design process for characters/species, and even special chats where you can openly talk about the book and maybe even influence the stories shape. This is only the beginning, for I desire to do only more for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut why Patreon?\u003c/em\u003e Well, taking care of business takes money so at this time I am focusing on my day job and thus am only able to work on my book a small portion of the time. So, with the help of Patreon I plan on eventually quitting and focusing only on my stories. If writing my stories fulltime also brought in the money necessary for living I will be able to do what I love, creating more content for all of you at a more rapid pace resulting in more stories for all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also open to commissions, be it writing or art, if you are interested. Just send me a message and we can discuss the details. You can find more works at my Tumblr.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/blog/fae-works\"\u003ehttps://www.tumblr.com/blog/fae-works\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you are excited to watch this community grow from the ground up, for I know I am."
