    "summary": "I am a middle aged artist who is still struggling. I really hate struggling. People say the starving artist is motivated by starvation. I say the only people who say this probably did so on a full stomach, while doing something other than trying to get people interested in their artwork. Starving doesn\u0027t help anyone do anything except choke down meals made by people who can\u0027t cook and making them happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I am very poor and struggling in very low paying jobs that go nowhere, which has taken time away from doing what I should be doing, making art. A friend directed me to Patreon to help me survive the mountain of medical bills and debt from health issues and other things that I face every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m asking for help from you, the People who value art and those who produce it. And let\u0027s be frank, it\u0027s easier to do it when you know you have an audience. It\u0027s a lot better than putting your work out there and hoping someone sees it let alone actually buys some from you. So here, you also get the satisfaction of being an influence on my art directly. You will make it possible, and you can make suggestions for subjects for my work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe style I work in primarily is something I call Chaosline, a series of designs and patterns that form a larger work. This is a unique style I have been doing for many many years, and I am trying to be prolific and produce a lot of art before my time on Earth is done. I mostly make them in computer art programs and paper and ink pens sometimes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI often only have some idea of a subject when I start, but the designs come out best when they are not planned and I just go with it. Right now I am making a series based on the concept of spirit animals, using animal and human elements mixed together in interesting ways. But also I am just making whatever comes to mind as it happens, which is part of the fun. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe majority of these works I make available through several t-shirt web services, but these sites pay very little per sale, and I haven\u0027t money to advertise so I don\u0027t sell a whole lot. I need to change that, so here I am. Thanks for being here too!\u003cbr\u003e"
