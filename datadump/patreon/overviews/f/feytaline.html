I choose a character and convey so much more than a single mood--I\u0027m showing not only what I have created in that moment, but the story of that character. \u00a0Cosplay is not only a way of saying \"thank you\" to the creators for the stories they have told, but also saying \"This is what your creation means to me, this is how it has changed my world.\" \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/E1CwmNB.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePhotographing Luminosity in Sandusky, Ohio, June 2016\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy Photography?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWhile my cosplay work is about self revelation, it is not created alone! \u00a0I would never be able to express myself without photographers. \u00a0I have created many of my images as self-portraiture, or with the help of my partner, Jordan. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, when I\u0027m able to work with a different photographer, another aspect of creativity and self-expression comes into play--theirs. \u00a0Together, we\u0027re able to combine our talents to create an image that has a bit of each of us inside it, something that we couldn\u0027t do alone.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eIt\u0027s that bond that I want to create with other people, so I\u0027ve fought through my debilitating anxiety to begin working with cosplayers as a photographer. I want to help them express themselves as the wonderful, unique people they are; to show the world what they want to say with their costumes and expressions.

Patreon gives them a chance to, as well as giving me a way to thank them with rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI understand many other cosplayers are in similar financial situations, and I want to help them express themselves. I love photographing free of charge, as well as planning local events for anyone of any skill level to get quality photos in incredible environments. However, planning events and editing photos are a lot of work, and upgrading equipment gets very expensive.\u00a0 Patreon allows those that are able to financially support me to ease these costs, so that I can work to provide quality content to everyone!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt isn\u0027t easy to make my dreams into reality.
