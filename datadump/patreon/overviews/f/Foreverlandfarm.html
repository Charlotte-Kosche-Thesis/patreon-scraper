We are so excited to have you along on this journey with us. \u00a0Rescue life is hard and we couldn\u0027t do it without all of you! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi Everyone,\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Brittney Kane and I am the founder of Foreverland Farm. \u00a0This\u00a0has been a lifetime in the making. I have rescued animals my entire life (just ask my mom) and now we are working towards doing it on a much bigger level. Recently my wife and I purchased a small farm in Amelia, OH where we take in neglected, abused, abandoned, and slaughter bound animals. Since the purchase of the farm in November we have started taking in lots of animals! We have been so fortunate to be surrounded by such loving, compassionate people who will stop at nothing until the animals are free and given the lives they deserve. \u00a0This is our way of continuing our efforts to take in more animals that need our help, and eventually expand our property to take in even more! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider donating even a $1 a month to help the animals. Every dollar counts and it goes such a long way insuring that these babies get to live a life free of starvation, torture, abuse, and slaughter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love you all so much, thank you from the bottom of our hearts for being a voice for all creatures great and small.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;3 B"
