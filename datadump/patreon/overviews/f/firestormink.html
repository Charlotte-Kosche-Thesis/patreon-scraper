I want to provide more opportunities for people who have a variety of different play styles to come together to create an amazing experience together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have worked around cooperative games for a while. While I was working on producing content for \u003cem\u003eCyberGeneration\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0I came up with my first cooperative RPG called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/86751/Geasa\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGeasa\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003eI\u0027ve always wanted to go back to that kind of space. I\u0027ve even had a few ideas of taking that system and using it for other projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I\u0027ve decided that I want to do something different and new. With that my first project I\u0027m going to release is\u00a0\u003cem\u003eWe Used to be Friends \u003c/em\u003ewhich is a cooperative, powered by the apocalypse teenage detective game. The goal there was to create a mystery game that would be a surprise for everyone involved.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second project in the works is \u003cem\u003eRent\u0027s Due\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0which is a cooperative mockumentary cyberpunk game. Kind of like the Trailer Park Boys meets Blade Runner. Ultimately it\u0027s a game about community and how your problems will eventually spill out into your community and how you can try to deal with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe third project is called\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThird Life\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0which is a game where you play monsters trying to fit back into society. I want to make this game in such a way to try to avoid the traditional pitfalls of RPGs where physical conflict is the basis for how everything is resolved.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe biggest part of this Patreon is that I want to have a conversation with you about what we can do with cooperative games. I\u0027m going to try to have regular content that\u0027s available only to backers so that there is some extra benefit to putting forth the financial effort into backing this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for being one of those backers! Let\u0027s make cooperative games together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic for the video is Summers Coming by Dexter Britain taken from the Free Music Archive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideo Transcript Below:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHi. I\u2019m Jonathan, and I have been making games for over a decade. I\u2019ve been drawn lately to more cooperative games. I want more games that require little prep-time, and accommodate a wide variety of play styles so they can come together and create something amazing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy backing this Patreon we\u2019ll have discussions about co-operative games, explore the cooperative play space, and push the edges of what we think a co-operative game could be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe 1$ level gives you access to all the Patreon only posts, where we will talk about cooperative games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe 5$ level gives you a copy of the PDF when the game is completed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe 35$ level gives you a softcover copy of the game with shipping included in North America.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo back this Patreon, and let\u2019s make cooperative games together.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
