I have\nbeen doing for a little while and I can vouch that not everybody can do this.\nIt\u0027s hard because it takes time, a keen eye and a lot of creativity. Sure,\nthere are a lot of tutorials out there and depending on what tools you choose\nto use it can make your life easier or harder, but ultimately it\u0027s not the tool\nthat creates the models, it\u0027s you and you alone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUltimately, my goal is to raise enough funding so I can hire\nother people to work alongside with me and continue the progress on my own\nideal and projects.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat tools do you use?\u003c/strong\u003eI mostly only Maya for all of my 3D\nneeds. However, I do use other programs like Blender to help with the porting\nprocess. I have personally loved Maya and it made my life easier, the interface\nis easy to work with and the UV Mapping was more or less automatic without\nhaving to struggle too much on more complex models.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy only 5$ for all the models? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNo,\nthis is not a scam. 5$ is the minimum amount you will need to donate in order\nto get access to my 3D Models and that\u0027s it. I am not asking you to purchase my\n3D Models, I am asking you to support me if you would like to do so and in\nreturn I will offer you copies of the models I post. Think of it as renting out\nthe model and you can use it as long as you want. Since the model themselves aren\u2019t\n\u201coriginal\u201d however the rigging, animations and the time put into the models is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any there are any questions, please let me know!
