The American and Swiss pair\u0027s initial tours across the United States, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands have caught widespread attention with touching and imaginative performances. Their upcoming debut album \u2018\u003cstrong\u003eOne Day Baby\u003c/strong\u003e\u2019 is internationally anticipated as a result.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eFamous October\u003c/strong\u003e are intimately intertwined singer-songwriters, combining vocal harmony with cello and guitar in a way which gives breath to a new acoustically driven, yet hauntingly bold sound. Their writing daringly pulls from americana and modern folk music with underlying classical arrangements. The songs tackle the \u2018Schluesselerlebnisse\u2019 (key moments) the two have faced separately and together in the wide scope of their collective paths. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eSarah Bowman\u003c/strong\u003e is an American born songwriter and multi-instrumentalist with a legendary voice. She studied cello, piano and voice in Pittsburgh, PA and Baltimore, MD respectively. During her studies she was invited to teach cello in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, which later became the subject for her solo album \u2018Empty Houses\u2019 in 2012. Born and raised in Davenport, IA, she toured the United States and Europe with her twin sister Claire Bowman after arriving in NYC in 2004. The Bowmans compiled 4 albums and performed more than 1,000 concerts internationally. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eRene Coal Burrell\u003c/strong\u003e stepped on stage at age 16, gaining immediate success and recognition as a rising star in Switzerland, the youngest of the three musical Burrell brothers. Early in his career he was invited to open for Neil Young, ZZ Top and Amy Winehouse. He then went on to become Switzerland\u2019s most recognized voice of Country Music. He released 5 acclaimed albums, including his own vision \u2018The Song Circus\u2019 which brought Switzerland\u2019s biggest talent on stage with Coal and His Band. Today, hit songs from his previous albums are spun regularly on national radio.\u003cbr\u003e Famous October are based in Central Switzerland via New York City. Since their move, they have really turned heads with their dedication to independent artists, as well as their own music. They come to Patreon on the eve of their upcoming debut release \u2018One Day Baby,\u2019 produced by Todd Sickafoose, and recorded at the Clubhouse Studio in Rhinebeck, NY.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",

We bring independent artists from all over to our little listening room for a few events each month, but we wish it could be more. We do all of our work here: private music lessons, rehearsals, recording sessions, video editing, promotional design, booking, office work, etc. When we sell tickets, all of that money goes to the visiting artists and towards some of the event costs. We\u0027re always paying a bit out of pocket, and we\u0027d love to take the pressure off- maybe even replace a bad cable or two. You can help us to build upon the dream we have with this place- to bring people together through music in a cozy, personal, truly fulfilling way.",
