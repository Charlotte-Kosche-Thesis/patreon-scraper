The site consists mostly of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fashionninjutsu.com/category/glamour-spotlights/\"\u003eGlamour Spotlights\u003c/a\u003e, which showcase new outfits I\u0027m using for the game\u0027s various classes. I also occasionally write about the game more generally, such as when new\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fashionninjutsu.com/2016/09/21/patch-3-4-gear-set-previews/\"\u003epatches\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fashionninjutsu.com/2016/10/14/stormblood-announcement-and-glamour-spotlight-healers-101416/\"\u003eexpansions\u003c/a\u003e arrive, and offer my thoughts on the game in other ways, including\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fashionninjutsu.com/2016/10/12/fanfest-predictions/\"\u003especulation\u003c/a\u003e and musings on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fashionninjutsu.com/2017/03/17/heavensward-retrospective-exploratory-missions-the-diadem/\"\u003egame\u0027s\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://fashionninjutsu.com/2017/03/06/heavensward-retrospective-saga-of-the-anima-weapons/\"\u003econtent\u003c/a\u003e.

Most posts on the site include high quality in-game screenshots, and since the site\u0027s inception, I\u0027ve amassed enough of them that I\u0027m going to hit the limit on free online media storage sometime this year, requiring paying for additional storage if I want to maintain the site\u0027s image archive (and I do!). That means running advertisements on the site to try and offset some of that cost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdvertisements suck, though! I don\u0027t like having them on the site (and I\u0027m sure my readers don\u0027t either), so I\u0027m turning to Patreon for another option. With enough support, I\u0027ll be able to disable advertisements on the site entirely. Beyond that primary goal, with greater support of the site\u0027s Patrons, I hope to begin writing a larger number of reviews of Mog Station gear, taking glamour requests from Patrons, including more screenshots, and updating more frequently, among other things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what, though, I intend for the site to always be free. Sharing my love of the game has been a rewarding experience for me. All posts on the site will always remain freely available, whether I have no Patrons or 100 of them\u2014but with your support, I think I can make the site better for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd Finally, Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI wouldn\u0027t be setting this Patreon up if I hadn\u0027t had so much fun running Fashion Ninjutsu, and I wouldn\u0027t be enjoying myself so much if people weren\u0027t reading it. Thanks to everyone who reads the site and everyone who comments on, likes, or shares each post.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking out the Fashion Ninjutsu\u0027s Patreon, and of course, thanks again if you decide to contribute to the site!\u003cbr\u003e"
