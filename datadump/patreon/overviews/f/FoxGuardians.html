I am passionate about foxes and would like to inspire more\npeople to treat them with respect and compassion. By helping to finance \u201cFox\nGuardians\u2019\u201d films, you will enable me to increase understanding of these\nbeautiful indigenous animals, and at the same time gain entertaining and\neducational insights into their daily lives, seasonal behavior patterns and\ncomplex social structures\u003c/em\u003e. Thank you for your support and helping me to give those a voice that have none.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbout me\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy name is Dora Nightingale. I am a filmmaker, wildlife lover and\nanimal rights advocate. In the summer of 2016 I got well and truly \u201cfoxed\u201d when\ntwo wild urban fox cubs visited my wildlife garden in the middle of the day\nwhile I was watering the lawn. They returned daily over the summer and I got\ncompletely hooked on watching and filming them. I named them Freya and Faith\nand felt honoured that they had chosen my garden as their nursery. I loved that\neverything happened on \u003cem\u003etheir\u003c/em\u003e terms \u2013\nthey came and left as they pleased and I never attempted to touch or tame them.\nI provided a safe space for them and supported them with food, water and when needed\nmedical aid. This is how I first became a fox guardian. I have filmed many fox families since and have\nalso been involved in some fox rescues. Now I hope to inspire more humans\nthrough my films to join me in the quest to understand and protect foxes by\nbecoming fox guardians. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy encounters with the \u201coriginal\u2019 fox cubs\nFreya and Faith had a profound impact on me and I felt the need to share our\nstory. This is why I decided to create my first wildlife documentary \u201cFoxed\u201d, chronicling Freya\n\u0026amp; Faith\u2019s journey from cubs to juvenile foxes and telling the story of our\nunlikely inter-species friendship. The film had a big impact \u2013 many people\ncontacted me via social media to tell me that until they saw \u201cFoxed\u201d they were\nindifferent towards foxes or had even considered them as \u201cvermin\u201d. One woman who used to be involved in fox hunting told me how \u201cFoxed\u201d\nmade her see foxes for the first time as individual sentient beings that\ndeserve our respect and protection, rather than being hunted by a pack of hounds.\nTo my great joy, she turned her back on fox hunting for good. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am grateful and thrilled that \u201cFoxed\u201d\nhas reached so many people and has been received with much positive feedback.\nThis success inspired me to set up a dedicated Facebook group where I have been\nposting fox clips for over a year now. But even though many of these clips have\ngone viral (Footage of Freya and Faith playing on my sun lounger was viewed almost 5 million\ntimes via \u201cthe Dodo\u201d), they did not produce\u003cem\u003e any\u003c/em\u003e income. Monitoring and filming foxes is now taking up all of\nmy time but in order for me to continue this work, I do need your support. Giving\na regular donation of whatever you can afford will make a big difference and\nenable me to continue creating fox films. Together we can be the voice for foxes\nand give them the \u2018good press\u2019 they so desperately need and deserve. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have already filmed more interesting fox\nstories and really want to share these films with fellow fox lovers like you.\nYou can help to get these films made by becoming a Fox Guardians\u2019 patron which\nwill enable me to focus my time exclusively on completing these independent\nfilms, and film more stories as they evolve, instead of working on commercial\nproductions. With your help, I can tell the fox stories that you would never\nsee on TV.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHere are just some of the fox stories that I filmed recently and hope to\nedit and publish soon: I chronicled the life of a young fox mother who reared\nher five tiny cubs all by herself in my friend\u2019s garden; I filmed the \u201cParadise\nLost\u201d fox family who are being evicted from their \u201cparadise\u201d, a large and\nre-wildered building plot that is now being built on with a nine storey block\nof flats. I recorded a video diary showing the many ethical questions that\npresented themselves to me when I was involved in the rescue of a fox with a\nbroken leg.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNot all of these fox stories have a happy ending but I believe they all\nneed telling to paint a multi-faceted and realistic picture of urban fox lives.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy becoming my patron you enable me to\ncreate new fox films that will have the power to change more people\u0027s negative\nviews about foxes. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for having open eyes. Together\nwe can open other people\u2019s eyes and give foxes the good press, protection and\ncompassion they deserve. Please join me in my quest to protect and guard our\nfoxes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a \u201cFox Guardians\u201d patron, you will be\nthe first to see all my new fox films when I publish them on my Patreon page. We will also thank you with other exciting and rewards such as gaining exclusive\naccess to photos, behind the scenes material, or being credited as one of the Fox\nGuardians film\u2019s producers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"

At this level, we can really push the\nlevel of quality for the Fox Guardians documentaries. I could, for example, pay\nfor specialist elements of post production such as sound mixing to remove bumps,\nhisses and traffic sounds from the footage; color-grading to really make the\nfootage \u2018pop\u2019, and graphics for titles and credits. For \u201cFoxed\u201d I paid for\nthese external post-production costs myself but I have no budget to spend on\nfine-tuning the new Fox Guardians films. Presenting my films professionally\nsound-mixed and color-graded will open up a bigger audience. The more people\nsee the Fox Guardians documentaries, the more humans will get a better\nunderstanding of foxes and will hopefully treat foxes with the respect and\ncompassion they deserve. Any donations that will not be invested into post production or\non-going filming costs will be invested into further equipment such as trail\ncameras, memory cards and hard drives to back up the ever growing amount of raw\nmaterial I film daily.",
