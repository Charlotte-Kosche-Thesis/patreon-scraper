While initially Film Roast was meant to be a YouTube series, Julia and Hannah transitioned their show to a podcast in early 2017 and have been \u003cstrong\u003eover caffeinated and under qualified\u003c/strong\u003e ever since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFilm Roast is divided into three segments: \u003cstrong\u003eMain Volumes, Coffee Corner, and Mini Movie Moments\u003c/strong\u003e. In Main Volumes, Julia and Hannah focus on one theme (such as terrifying scenes from children\u2019s movies) and discuss their favorite (or least favorite) movies surrounding that topic. Coffee Corner brings listeners shorter segment focusing on current events in pop culture, entertainment or movie news. And looking for a quick review of the latest movies in theaters? Mini Movie Moments has you covered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you\u2019re a seasoned movie buff or just that person who loves to rant about the latest film franchise, Film Roast is the podcast for what people love to talk about when they talk about movies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJulia and Hannah put in hours of work to bring free content to their thousands of listeners. They are starting a Patreon in hopes that the funds will be used to provide their listeners with more merchandise, content, and laughs!\u003cbr\u003e"
