Despite the ignorant attacks and slander of others I\nrefuse to let them muzzle my creativity,\u201d Shelton said.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShelton began shooting nude models in 1996 and has done so\nin the most unusual of ways, without the use of talent agencies or fancy\nequipment, embracing a DIY attitude and his own resourcefulness to cultivate\nmodels, wardrobe, props, settings and anything else necessary to create images\nthat are unique, provocative and entertaining.\u003cbr\u003eIt is for this reason Shelton is exploring Patreon, hopeful to further satisfy a larger audience and provide him with the necessary resources and funding to keep his art alive.\u003cbr\u003e\"In Kentucky I have no viable market for my art. Despite this fact I refuse to create art to simply fit into a commercial niche,\" Shelton said. \"I know my niche exists somewhere in the world and I hope Patreon can help me find it.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn 2010 his image \u201cKnothole\u201c was selected by Erotic\nSignature to represent him as one of the top 200 erotic photographers in the\nworld in its fourth annual collection.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHis first solo exhibit titled \u201cHillbilly Chic \u2026. The Art of\nCharles Wayne Shelton II\u201d was shown at the KAS Gallery in Louisville from\nOctober 2011 until April of 2012.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn 2016 Shelton returned to Kentucky to display his\nexhibition \u201cInfamous\u201d at the Singletary Center For The Arts in Lexington.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShelton has exhibited his art across the country and in\nEurope including \u201cThe Dirty Show\u201c in Detroit, The Art Undressed Touring Exhibit\n(Miami, New York, Montreal, Chicago, and Los Angeles), The Seattle Erotic Arts\nFestival and the \u201cPersona Art Festival\u201c in London.\u003cbr\u003e\u201cSome people consider my work to be erotic simply because it\ncontains nudity but personally I consider it to be more editorial than\nanything,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cNudity is simply a vehicle which helps the audience\narrive at the narrative.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/3e5d439660f305441bdbddc2735e6dad/tumblr_oo6ihj0xUq1r9vhd9o3_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eShelton opened Famous Fotografy Studios in 2007 and has seen it flourish into a capable collective of artists over the past decade. Teaming up with makeup magician Bradley Catpell Shelton has been able to add extra punch to his editorial work and a more finished look to most everything the duo collaborates on. The pair is eager to begin working with the studios newest collaborator, Hi-Rezzolution Cosplay\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eand its lead creator, Rez. The team is excited to begin creating fan service image sets which will explore the more psychological, emotional and sexual identities of pop culture characters and icons. With a serviceable budget Shelton, Catpell and Rez are confident they can create a product that will please its audience both visually and intellectually. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/26a7268c11a0c515aaffb056670c6666/tumblr_oo6ihj0xUq1r9vhd9o8_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eShelton and Famous Fotografy Studios intend to take patrons on a fun and imaginative journey through the creative process of their 2017 projects. To bring these projects to life the collective is asking for monthly support which will enable them to hire a wider array of models (which includes travel fees), purchase materials to create characters and sets, and travel to unique and aesthetic outdoor locations. In exchange the collective will create exclusive content for patrons, give them access to behind the scenes videos, social media accounts, special exclusive prints and digital downloads and even the opportunity to conceive and direct a shoot, either in person or by means of communication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/55204a6917eed0c1da644e6287c9cbe7/tumblr_oo6ihj0xUq1r9vhd9o9_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eShelton\u0027s art nude photography has revolved around several basic concepts. The majority of his editorial work falls into his \"Hillbilly Chic\" theme although he has also dabbled in representations of pop culture. In addition his more familiar themes involve nudes in nature and figurative posing, shot in-studio with more controlled lighting.\u003cbr\u003eShelton is looking to expand his concepts in 2017 including a foray into cosplay. He is also continuing with his love of alternative lighting and is crafting a series in which models will wear independently powered LED lights, as seen in many anime and Kawaii-inspired fashions. Rather than being sewn into clothing however, the LEDs will adorn the models\u0027 nude figures.\u003cbr\u003eCrossing paths with master BDSM rigger Jason Sias has also opened new artistic avenues. Shelton intends to integrate some of Sias\u0027 unique, rope and bondage techniques and treatments into his already surreal settings. The pair have already conceived a Native-American themed shoot with art model, Ariauna.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
