I could try to go the traditional route, get published in magazines, enter contests, go to publishers and so on, but I feel that, in the age of the Internet, this is the way to go for now. This is my experiment to try and become somewhat succesful and I hope you will support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to pledge, know that you have my eternal gratitude. These are the words you will hear from all creators (or should) but that doesn\u0027t mean they are any less valid the fiftieth time around. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout you I would not be able to even chase the dream. If you do not pledge please consider doing so if you like my work, even if it is just one $ every month. Without monetary compensation I will have to one day quit writing, as time will become a more scarce ressource over the years and you can believe me that I would hate nothing more than to leave stories untold.\u003cbr\u003e"
