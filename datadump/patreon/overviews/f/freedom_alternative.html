    "summary": "I make videos from a freedom-first perspective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have very few limits and I\u0027m not afraid to be politically incorrect. In fact, I insist upon offending the sensibilities of the modern culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLiving in the aftermath of a totalitarian Communist regime - I simply refuse to believe that if someone disagrees with you that constitutes \"oppression\". Oppression is when you\u0027re purposefully deprived of food in the name of the \"common good\" (a common practice under Ceau\u0219escu). As a result, I reserve the right to be brutal in expressing thoughts and also reserve my right to approach un-PC topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePerks for patrons:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor starters, it says \u0027month\u0027 (with quotes) because Patreon refuses to allow \u003cstrong\u003emonth\u003c/strong\u003e (without quotes). Maybe it\u0027s a glitch that will be fixed, I don\u0027t know. But the quotes are there solely so the word can be seen. There are no hidden clauses. The pledges are monthly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides the rewards listed bellow, all patrons, regardless of the pledge, can request audio files with the episodes uploaded on Youtube - so you can take them and listen in your, car, at the gym or whilst traveling. [will oblige only upon request]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImportant note: The rewards are monthly as well. So for instance with a $10/month pledge, you get to request a video a month - not just once.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will also have access to some of my older \"Voice of Europe\" podcasts from the early days of the show. I am uploading from time to time a new episode from Voice of Europe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsidering that Patreon has not solved many of the systemic limitations that it had in June 2015 when I created the page (e.g. low limits per file) and in fact it has added several problems (e.g. charging EU patrons VAT), this platform will only be used to broadcast announcements for patrons and maybe coordinate hangouts at some point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will patrons be charged\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatrons will be charged at the end of the month, just like in any other monthly campaign/pledge.\u003cbr\u003eThis model was chosen because of the large amount of episodes released monthly - which would\u0027ve made a per-episode arrangement impractical and/or unaffordable for the patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs/Was the \"kittens\" goal a joke?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, it\u0027s not. Kittens unite every kind of people and are darn cute. Even those who aren\u0027t a cat-person still like a proper kitteh video :D\u003cbr\u003eThe Kittens goal was fulfilled in November 2016 so in December 2016 I delivered on the promise: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7op_OhXLoXA\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7op_OhXLoXA\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in the bag for the future?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTravel videos have become a common feature on the channel since I started the Patreon page - largely thanks to your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTravel tours so far:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJune 2016 Western Ukraine tour: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYIigOqDAKnQRsaclqheiXRssUVbVQ5PI\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYIigOqDAKn...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe 2017 Hungary, Georgia and Armenia tour: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYIigOqDAKnTCjT1nE-F48GwqSIrY_p3M\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYIigOqDAK...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe 2017 Sweden tour: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYIigOqDAKnQbF6Ym_Gglz1Ze6seIPSvv\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYIigOqDAKn...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2018 there will be for sure three tours: The United States 2018 tour; the 2018 Albania tour and the Jordan-Israel tour.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDates and details to be announced in Patron-only posts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring 2017, much of the donations have went into buying new equipment, significantly raising the quality of all the types of the video (compare any video from 2016 with any video after July 2017 and the difference is quite striking!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is still more equipment needed even though the urgent basics have finally been covered.\u003cbr\u003eFor instance, I still need a camera that can record 720p MP4 files and have the capacity to record sound from an external source (i.e. external mic). \u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, I still don\u0027t have proper studio lights - though this is mostly a technical issue rather than a financial one.\u003cbr\u003eAlso, as time goes on, my database grows gigantic. So I will also soon need one or even two 4TB HDDs (about $180/each in Romania).\u003cbr\u003eBesides, there\u0027s always miscellaneous (cables, lavalieres, etc.) and redundancies (secondary batteries, redundancy recorders, etc.).\u003cbr\u003eAll the excess funds will go towards improving the behind-the-scenes equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, if I\u0027ve convinced you - thank you for pledging shekels to support my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S.: I also run a channel in Romanian, be sure to check that out and subscribe to it: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/FreedomAlternativeRO\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/c/FreedomAlternativeRO\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
