What started out as a small group of women meeting every Sunday in Oakland blossomed over the years into multiple-day training seminars and camps in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Costa Rica and Maui, drawing attendees from all over the world. Nearing ten years since the group was established, the Sweaty Betties are still going strong.

In 2013, the Female Fighter Project had its first solo show at Photobooth SF, however shortly after the project came to a halt due to the dwindling photographic resources in SF (R.I.P. RayKo Photo Center and Photobooth SF) as well as the ongoing costs to produce it. However, after a recent outpouring of support and pledges from beautiful patrons like you, I have newfound inspiration to restart the Female Fighter  Project in bigger and better ways!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your support \u2013 we can\u2019t do this without you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
