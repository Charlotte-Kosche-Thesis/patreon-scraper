I make comedy and hidden camera pranks on Youtube.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to entertain and inspire.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIn 2008 I was diagnosed for social phobia. \u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2013 I was picking up girls naked.\n\u003c/strong\u003e It\u0027s three years later now, and I even think I was insecure compared to the one I am now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy thirst for life and growth has formed my propaganda phrase, \"Free Yourself From The Social Prison\". Hope it becomes a religion one day.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can break out of your social prison. It\u0027s doable. In fact there\u0027s no limit to how free you can be. Life is incredible behind your fears. You can illuminate the fears. It doesn\u0027t need to run your life. \n\u003cstrong\u003eYou do not have to suffer\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy channel now has 224,000 subscribers, and I can\u0027t believe that many people have made a decision to watch more of my videos! I\u0027m being recognized on the street which is something I never imagined could happen to me. Its nuts to think about!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2015 I had a rather slow year on Youtube. I didn\u0027t upload a video for four months! That was stupid, sorry about that, but glad that you\u0027re still around, and if you\u0027re new here, welcome!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much money do I make from posting videos?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nOver the past year I\u0027ve been making $200-300 per month from doing videos. Now it\u0027s a little less. It used to be $1000-1500 in the golden days. I work about 20 hours per week with videos. My revenue per view is lower than most Youtubers due to explicit content in some of my videos :) Still, it\u0027s not tragically low.\u00a0There are Youtubers who make way less. I was in Brazil, and the Youtubers there were making three times less money per view. My ad revenue is about 30 percent lower than\u00a0most American Youtubers, probably due to a tendency of toilet and genitalia humor.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMoney was never important to me.\u003c/strong\u003e Maybe that\u0027s why I don\u0027t have it. \"Can you make money on that?\". That\u0027s the most common question a Youtuber receives. Most people stop there. Some go further. \"How much?\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI never understood why that was so interesting. I just wanted to create funny videos, and maybe get a bit famous.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve heard stories about people with 500,000 subscribers working at Starbucks, and having to quit because too many fans were visiting them at work. I\u0027m glad I haven\u0027t experienced that, lol.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBut there is nobody to blame.\u003c/strong\u003e Youtube can\u0027t control what advertisers are paying them. They\u0027re still taking a mighty share though, 45 percent of the gross revenue. And YOU have the full freedom to skip ads you want. Hey, ads are boring. Fuck those. Even I use ad block. Besides that, my videos advertise for random stuff I don\u0027t even know what is. I trust that my videos generate enough karma to live a rich life. I have actually considered taking off the ads. Maybe I\u0027ll experiment with it in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPS: I\u0027m supposed to not tell anyone about what I make but I don\u0027t care about that rule. You should have the right to speak about your income, especially if it\u0027s too low.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u0026lt;h5\u0026gt;\n\u003cstrong\u003e\"Get a job Fred!\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026lt;/h5\u0026gt;I mostly get this from people in my family, but as I\u0027m coming out here, this will probably strike my comment section. \u003cbr\u003e\nI have MASSIVE respect for people who have jobs, and I understand their frustration with me.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThis is the only thing I think about.\u003c/strong\u003e I don\u0027t party, I\u0027ve never had a girlfriend, I don\u0027t date and I barely hang out with people. I\u0027m neurotic about what I\u0027m doing. I tried the army in 2010. I was too absent-minded to even put on my uniform, so roommates had to dress me up. Super beta, haha. I got out of there after 10 days. I worked in a sporting goods store for two months, but got fired due to being a \"slow learner\", forgetting to give people their receipts, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nMaybe I\u0027m addicted to the life of being a free spirit, as I\u0027ve lived it for too long now.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to make a impact on the world, and I believe my best way of doing that is by making content. I believe I\u0027m making less money than the impact I\u0027m having. Last month, people spent 600,000 minutes on my videos. On the other hand, I can sleep at fan\u0027s houses all over the world. That\u0027s also wealth. But I\u0027ll fight for my life to make this my actual livelihood. If\u00a0that\u0027s still not enough (and I\u0027m still alive), I\u0027ll go get a boss :)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you support me here, I\u0027m obviously incredibly grateful, and won\u0027t hide it. I\u0027ll give you rewards such as\u00a0\n\u003cstrong\u003eexclusive content\u003c/strong\u003e and even \u003cstrong\u003eprivate time with me\u003c/strong\u003e, to make sure that this is a win-win, no-brainer deal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo scroll down the rewards bar to see all the cool stuff you get by supporting me!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn sincere, deep and heartfelt gratitude.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFred Ligaard\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
