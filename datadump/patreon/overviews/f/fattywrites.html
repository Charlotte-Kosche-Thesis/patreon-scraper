    "summary": "I write short stories that contribute to the FA community online. I cover male, female, and narratorxreader gains. Plots vary from general gain to stuffing, \u00a0bloating, force-feeding, \u00a0mpreg, expansion, or general admiration for excess weight. I also dabble in breast expansion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe current series I\u0027m releasing is called Culture Shock. It\u0027s a fantasy series based on a college exchange student\u0027s journey from Wesonos, an idyllic land of common sense, sweat, and hard work, to Estras, an oasis of indulgence, laziness, and extreme excess. Updates will be released every other week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can be contacted at fattywrites1@gmail.com .\u003cbr\u003eFor more stories, visit my deviantart at fatty-writes.deviantart.com\u003cbr\u003e"
