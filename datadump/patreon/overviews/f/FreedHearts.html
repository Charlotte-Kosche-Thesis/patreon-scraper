Families are destroyed. And the non-affirming church not only does nothing to stop this tragedy, it encourages it with false teaching so unlike the Jesus they claim to love and follow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a better way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe help free the hearts of faith parents learn that to unconditionally love, accept and affirm their LGBTQI child is actually consistent with their faith. We help free the hearts of those in the LGBTQI community heal shame from parent, church, community and internalized homophobia. And we stand against the hate coming from non-affirming churches, and change the conversation to help the church be inclusive and affirming. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe struck a nerve within the Christian and evangelical communities and we have so many opportunities to deeply impact lives. We continue to develop resources - including our comprehensive video courses - for parents, for LGBTQI, and for those in the faith community. We free hearts to love, heal and affirm and we work to change the human conversation on inclusion. We continue to develop new resources including new books, videos and conferences. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is critical that we build a team of people who share our hearts for these parents, their kids, and the church, and who feel so led to come alongside us as partners. Your help will enable me to continue to write -- and your stories often inspire my topics!\u00a0 Your help will also enable me to finish new books, and develop many additional video series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a few small thank-you gifts based on monthly support levels. Please be as generous as your funds allow, but only as the Spirit leads. Remember that any amount is most welcome and deeply appreciated! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so grateful for the Moms, Dads, those in the gay community, and other friends who encourage me every day with your words and prayer. Thanks so much for reading this and for considering being a financial partner with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove, Susan\u003cbr\u003e"

This will enable me to say \"Yes!\" to many more \nof these. This level of support will also enable me to finish and \npublish additional books, as well as more additional resources for \nparents, LGBTQI, and the faith community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne key focus is to reach parents who are still struggling with \ntheir child being gay. Many of these parents are still \"in the closet\" \nabout their gay child and it is not safe for them to attend a \nconference, or even have anywhere safe to ask questions. We now have FreedHearts Online (www.FreedHeartsOnline.org) providing full online video courses to help parents \ndeal with core issues, and help them reconcile their faith with \nunconditionally loving, accepting and affirming their child. Other video series help those in \nthe LGBTQI community \"discover and celebrate the truth and beauty of the \nreal you\" and heal shame from family, church and community, and a number of video series to help those in the faith community and church leaders learn how \nto become truly affirming and radically inclusive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support here at Patreon will provide the core base of support that will help make all of this possible.
