    "summary": "Hey guys! My name\u0027s Shadow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing Destiny Fanfiction over on my tumblr blog\u00a0Fireteam Daybreak for about a year and a half now, or I\u0027ve been trying to at least. If you\u0027ve been following my work there, you know the struggle I face to find time, and as some of you that visit this page may know, I lost my job around the end of March because of some medical issues and I\u0027ve been struggling to find work that would suit my needs since. So while I now have all the time in the world, I no longer have a source of income; my condition requires a stay-at-home job for me to remain in good health, which ideally, would be to draw and write. It\u0027s what I want to do, it\u0027s what I\u0027ve \u003cem\u003ealways \u003c/em\u003ewanted to do, but I was not ready to commit to making that dream a reality while I had a full-time job. Now that I\u0027m unemployed, however, I am willing to at least try to lay the groundwork for that end-goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page is not going to make the content I currently have out exclusive to Patrons (\u003cem\u003ethough Patrons will get exclusive, small fics every once in a while\u003c/em\u003e), it is to help support and drive me to continue my work toward making a name for myself as a creator, so I can pursue a potential career in my own intellectual properties outside of my Destiny Fanfiction and Fanart. The money I make from this Patreon will go toward commissioning other artists to help flesh out my Fireteam and bring to life their stories, and helping me pay my bills while I continue to make content. Fic writing takes time, and waiting to see updates can be hard. For becoming my Patron you\u0027ll get more frequent sneak-peeks on what I\u0027m working on and what\u0027s being worked on for Daybreak, exclusive fics, and you\u0027ll get direct access to my Discord chat, where you can have discussions or ask questions about my characters without having to go through my askbox on my blog. I\u0027m also willing to look over your characters and offer critique / advice on how to strengthen your own work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u0027d like a more in-depth look at my project or are a fan of Daybreak already, please consider becoming a patron of mine!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCredits\u003cbr\u003eBanner image --- nagunkgunk\u003cbr\u003eProfile image --- littleulvar\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e**Updates will be on Mondays when I have them available**\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
