A lot of you have asked how you could help me over the years and this is it ! By contributing to my campaign you are enabling me to spend more time making videos and also you can have the choice (depending on your sponsorship level) of being able to request videos which I will produce with a quick turnaround to the usual exacting Bum standards ! Also, I will make monthly one-off videos and series that are exclusively for the supporting bummers so if you support me you will see videos that no non-bummers can ever get their filthy hands on !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese videos will be available for download in full, uncompressed HD from a password protected location and will NEVER be uploaded to youtube ! This will mean I can cover all kinds of topics and speak freely without fear of straying out of the youtube guidelines so you will get the full, unadulterated bumming you have all been waiting for !\u003cbr\u003e"
