The channel started as a spillover channel for CraigslistGameFinds many years ago called FantaFinds; it then became a gameplay channel due to the lack of games we could find while game hunting. It lay relatively dormant for several years until I rebranded the channel to FANTAVISION and shifted my focus to this channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFANTAVISION focuses on discussion of video games/games industry, stories of my many years in retail, and maybe in the future discuss other hobbies of mine that my audience also enjoys such as Magic the Gathering. There are endless possibilities as to where this channel\u0027s future lies, and Patreon will help it grow and increase in quality the fastest!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Start a Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMany fans were asking me how they could support me, and that they wanted to donate to help me grow the channel. I figured Patreon would be the easiest way to achieve this and would allow me to directly communicate to you how I will be spending the money that comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are you Spending the Money on?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to use every penny of this money to further the development of FANTAVISION. It has become such a fun channel to work on, and I want to be able to continue to improve it in every way I can. I aim to be as transparent as possible to you all and make sure that you know that your money is being put to good use!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for your support!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
