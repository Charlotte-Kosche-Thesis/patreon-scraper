We\u0027re quite silly, and we assert the world could always use a little more silliness. We have a show,\u00a0and we hope you\u0027ll hang out with us once and awhile. Maybe we\u0027ll make you soil something - be sure to let us know if that ever happens.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve had the chance to rub shoulders with some of the biggest celebrities and Youtubers around. We\u0027ve learned a lot. They\u0027ve inspired us to do what we love. So here it is! Fatty and Chubs making silly videos because we love it. We would be deeply honored for you to join us and help to keep the show going. If we could at least cover our monthly expenses of a studio space, we\u0027d be so blessed! We work hard to not only entertain, but also inspire. We\u0027d be honored to have you as our patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of my favorite stuff (Fatty), like Monty Python films for example - were so off beat that they couldn\u0027t find money to produce their stuff from any \"normal\" film making paths. Members of bands like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and the Beatles stepped in to fund various Python projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, creators don\u0027t need rich rock bands to thrive, \u003cstrong\u003ewe just need you\u003c/strong\u003e. Viewers giving a buck here and there to help us keep going! Thank you so much! Don\u0027t just dream big, Dream Fatty and Chubs. ;)"
