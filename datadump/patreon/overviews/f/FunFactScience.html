Without our fans, we might not have made it to where we are today. What began as an effort to share some basic facts about the world around us, turned into a science communication page with over 60,000 followers and new content daily!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSmall Beginnings\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/ffscience\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFun Fact Science\u003c/a\u003e started, I was a first year physics undergrad trying to find a way to explain what I was studying to my friends, in a way that wouldn\u0027t put them to sleep. I began to notice that a lot of the things science students took for granted as \u003cem\u003ecommon knowledge \u003c/em\u003ewere actually completely unknown or misunderstood to the rest of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt first the plan was to tweet a 140 character physics fact out to the world each day, but then our Facebook page started to attract people asking questions about different areas of scientific research and news.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Motivation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately much of the science content available online is the form of scientific papers that are difficult to read for people outside of academia, or oversimplified stories with attention-grabbing and often misleading titles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to bridge the gap between these two worlds and create and provide honest, educational, and interesting content for people of all ages and backgrounds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eModus Operandi\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re coming up on our 600th consecutive day of #FFS tweets and aren\u0027t planning on stopping any time soon. On our page you can find the latest space news or a great video from one of the amazing science communicators we work with. You can even message us for answers about the science that matters to \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLooking Ahead\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently we are working on developing a website that will be a source of information and explanations on a range of scientific topics, all presented in a way that is accurate and easy to understand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter that we plan to create podcasts and other forums for scientific conversation on a range of topics, but with the singular focus on critical thinking.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a world where information is so readily accessible, people are finding it hard to separate the real facts from the misinformation and the best way to do that is to foster an environment of open, honest discussion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, we hope to achieve these goals and help bring the cosmic perspective to the world."
