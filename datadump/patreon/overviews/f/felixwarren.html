Some of this art is tarot artwork for an upcoming deck, so you also get a bonus mini lecture on a tarot card every time I post art for it. All of my art is usable for magic and I give instructions on how you can do that. I also post WIP books, articles in advance, and spells/rituals I\u0027ve been working on. Sometimes I make these posts available to $1 patrons, or I post other special surprises at that level. The spirit work advice forum is regularly updated with new info and with answers to questions, and you direct what\u0027s posted by asking what you want to know! If you\u0027re in the spiritual creativity course, you also get three lessons a month plus access to a private forum to discuss exercises with your peers. Each tier lets you access all material that\u0027s from the tiers that cost less than it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wWjYwRtl.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Ace of Cups from my tarot deck in progress\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Spiritual Creativity Course\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting in the month of September 2016 I began teaching a course on how to work with The Court of the Work In Progress, a system for leading a creative life in balance with spirituality. It also teaches how to use spirit work and magic to bolster and support your creativity and help you prosper through it. The system and the course have been created under the instruction of my personal pantheon of spirits who give me insight into the creative process. The heart of the work is finding inspiration and healing via creativity. It is meant for writers, artists, and all types of creators, whether pro or hobbyist, who want to develop themselves and their lives as creative works in progress. Learn the magic of art and writing and how to express the unique light that lives inside you. Create your own system for creative work, whether working with spirits or archetypes, and through it, change your world.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://da-at-ass.tumblr.com/post/151017323898/da-at-ass-da-at-ass-its-here-the-court-of\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHere is a more in-depth description of the course.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Trash Magic?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrash Magic is a book about exactly what the title is: kinds of witchcraft and sorcery you can work with only trash, found objects, and other ephemeral things. It was based on a post I made where I listed \u003ca href=\"http://da-at-ass.tumblr.com/post/126943764403/trash-witch-tips-go\"\u003ea bunch of trash magic tips\u003c/a\u003e--the post got popular and I realized I had a lot more to say on the subject. When I asked if people wanted a book, I received a resounding YES in response, so I started writing it and \u003ca href=\"http://da-at-ass.tumblr.com/tagged/trash-magic\"\u003eposting excerpts\u003c/a\u003e to my blog. Trash Magic will be published as a full book when it is complete. I will make the first draft available for all patrons here to read as I write it. I regularly post a PDF and epub of the manuscript as I update its material, making note of where I added things. I also post excerpts from time to time so you don\u0027t have to look through a whole PDF for new material. I\u0027ve got clearance from a publisher interested in Trash Magic to post everything up to the first draft to Patreon. (The revision phases will not be featured on Patreon.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you new to Patreon? Does it seem a bit confusing? There\u0027s info on how you pay\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq?ftyp=patrons\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. The quick and dry summary: international payments are accepted, you can use Paypal or a credit card, and you can limit the amount of money you contribute per month. This means there\u0027s no surprises for you and you can stay within your own budget! My project is set up on a flat monthly contribution so you pay the same regardless of how much content I release a month. This means if I post extra content every now and then, you\u0027re still charged the same."

I\u0027ve been on the pagan path since 1997 and working with demons since 2001. My personal code is to treat demons just like I\u0027d treat any other spiritual entity - with the respect due them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnline I\u0027m looking to network with like-minded occultists, pagans and magic-users with an appreciation for experimentation, research, thinking outside the box, and a liberal dosage of fun. I occasionally integrate pop-culture magic into my work and am excited by the new and creative things being shared about both PCM and chaos magic on the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIn 2001 I found the accessible traditions involving demonology didn\u0027t suit my purposes and thus I ended up inventing my own tradition, which I refer to as \u003ca href=\"http://da-at-ass.tumblr.com/post/74254799739/i-finished-it-this-is-the-court-of-four-corners\"\u003eThe Court\u003c/a\u003e. At the core is a method for crafting one\u0027s own pantheon in which one can place a group of demons that balance each other and yourself, without having to appropriate the trappings of an existing religion. After years of work with that and with the demons in it, I\u0027ve started to publish some of my findings and methods online. I am planning a book on it in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

You will get lessons and creative prompts each month and have access to a private forum to ask questions, discuss lessons, and share your creative work with like-minded peers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get access to all tiers that cost below $12 as well!\u003cbr\u003e",
