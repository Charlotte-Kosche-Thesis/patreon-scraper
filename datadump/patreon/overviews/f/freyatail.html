My name is Freya and I am an anthropomorphic artist and aspirant games concept artist and developer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping to use Patreon as a form of incentive to get me to really knuckle down and go places with my art. To get support from people like you would tell me that people are interested in what I do, and I would make more material both quicker, and of better quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m an artist! I mostly create digital art in Painter, and usually make anthropomorphic and science fiction art. I have galleries present on DeviantART ( https://freyatail.deviantart.com ) and FurAffinity (\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.furaffinity.net/user/freyatail/\"\u003ehttps://www.furaffinity.net/user/freyatail/\u003c/a\u003e ).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future I\u0027m hoping to learn about 3D modelling and game development, and develop things for both board games and digital games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you get from supporting me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI produce a lot of sketches that never see the light of day. Small scribbles and whittles that ultimately become the complete images I make. These will all become available to patreons, so you too can see this part of the process. I will also make full resolution images and work folders (.rif files, and only non-critical files) available to patreons.\u003cbr\u003ePatreons will also be able to see and be a part of special little projects I\u0027m working on. No telling when or what they might be, but there are things in the works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I hoping to get out of having Patreons?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from the obvious finaincial support, having patreons proves to me that there are people who care about the work I make. That people are excited and enthusiastic about the beings and worlds and stories I make. To have that would mean a lot to me.\u003cbr\u003e"
