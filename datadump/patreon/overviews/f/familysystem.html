We have Dissociative Identity Disorder - DID - a traumagenic disorder which caused our identity to \"split\" so that rather than integrating into one person, we became multiple. We work as a social worker in NYC, living paycheck to paycheck and doing our best to survive capitalism. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re so thankful for every pledge, because you\u0027re all allowing us to spread the word and fight stigma about a deeply misunderstood mental illness, while also ensuring that we can pay our bills. In return, we\u0027ll answer questions in Q\u0026amp;A sessions, write out our memories and stories, and act as pen-pals for anyone who\u0027d like to speak to a specific alter - or to more than one of us, it\u0027s up to you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can read a bit about each of us here:\u00a0https://awbrainno.tumblr.com/family\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re excited to share our experiences with you, and want to thank y\u0027all again for stopping by and pledging whatever you can - every little bit helps buy food for our cats, pay our medical bills, and generally contributes to our quality of life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by!"
