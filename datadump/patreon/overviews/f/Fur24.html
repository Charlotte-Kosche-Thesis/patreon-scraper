    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eHi, I\u0027m Fur (yes, my name is Fur) and ever since I was a \nkid, I\u0027ve loved making films. Except for now, instead of stealing my \nmom\u0027s 90\u0027s camcorder and forcing my entire family to sit down and watch \nmy videos, I have my own camera and I upload to YouTube. So not THAT \nmuch has changed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really love making silly comedy \nsketches, music video parodies, or exploding fruit with rubber bands. I \nalso love anything Nintendo/Anime, so you\u0027ll often find me in my Mario \ncostume, playing my Ocarina, or opening Pokemon cards. So I segregate these two different types of videos and upload twice a week. \"Fur is a Nerd on Tuesdays\" where I upload a video about Pokemon cards, Nintendo, or anything video game related. And \"Fur is Normal on Thursdays\" where I upload a traditional Fur style video. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, making these \nvideos cost money. I work and go to college full time, and all the money\n I make from work and the little I make from YouTube go towards living expenses and to helping my family. So I can\u0027t afford buying ten packs of rubber bands to explode something, Pokemon cards for Fur is a Nerd, or that Link costume for\n this Zelda video idea I had, or any prop really. I usually have to settle in the prop department, or sometimes even scratch the idea all together! But listen, even plain old vlogs cost \nmoney, since I rent my editing software monthly! So every penny of this \nwould go towards my productions. You would be paying for any props, costumes, and every single rubber band you see me wrap around a fruit. You would be sponsoring me. You\u0027re keeping my channel afloat! Helping me grow, and even raise my production quality for you! You\u0027re helping me do what I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect anyone to contribute - if you watch my videos, that is enough support in and of itself, and I am so so grateful for you. Thank you for that. I love you. But if it is in your heart to become my patreon sponsor, (and you are able to do so), I am at a loss for words. Thank you for helping me. Either way, I look forward to this journey together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
