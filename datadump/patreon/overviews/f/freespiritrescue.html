    "summary": "Free Spirit Rescue is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization which was originally designed as an equine rescue.\u00a0 However, we quickly learned the need for farm animal rescue in our area was extremely high so we opened our rescue to many animals.\u00a0 We currently have horses, ponies, mini ponies, donkey\u0027s, pot belly pigs, goats, cats and dogs.\u00a0 All of these animals came from extreme conditions and most were seized through animal control.\u00a0 The horses we take in come to us weighing around 600 to 650 pounds and after rehabilitation will reach at least 1200 pounds.\u00a0 We take rescue and rehabilitation serious and all of our rescues, once rehabilitated, are evaluated and some are adopted into forever homes while others are trained as therapy animals.\u00a0 We share these therapy animals with veterans and children with disabilities.\u00a0 In January, 2018, we will be certifying our mini ponies as full therapy ponies and these ponies will be attending toy drives, visiting nursing homes, foster homes, hospitals and veteran programs across not only the Tampa Bay area, but if needed, throughout the state of Florida.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to our rehabilitation program, we offer a case by case training program for each individual animal.\u00a0 Some of these programs takes months and others can take a couple of years.\u00a0 The abuse and neglect that these animals have endured are extreme and trust is a huge problem when they first arrive.\u00a0 We give every animal all of the time they need to rehabilitate and in some cases, we choose to keep the animals as sanctuary animals due to the recurring health care they will need for the remainder of their lives.\u00a0 Our training is built around the animals needs and abilities.\u00a0 Some horses go on to become wonderful trail horses for families and some become a pet companion and enjoy the life of leisure and laziness.\u00a0 It is important for us to determine the best scenario and capabilities of these animals to ensure we match them to the perfect family and home.\u00a0 We pride ourselves in making sure these animals are never returned to rescue.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe deal with animals (mostly horses) who have been beaten, abandoned, abused or neglected.\u00a0 We deal in cases with beginning expenditures beginning at $500 and some requiring expense life saving surgeries\u00a0 with prices tags of $10,000. As a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization, donations are our lifeline to saving these animals.\u00a0 We work hard fundraising on a monthly bases as our expenses are great.\u00a0 Due to the type of rescues we accept, our expenses are no less than $4500 per month and with emergencies can reach $6000 in a month.\u00a0 Your donations are greatly appreciated and all amounts add up.\u00a0 As a nonprofit, your donations are 100% tax deductible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have the ability to help our organization, please join as a patron above.\u00a0 With the continued support of those with the ability to donate even $1 per month, we can continue to save the lives of the animals in need.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay tuned to more surprises coming in 2018.\u00a0 We are determined to make a difference in the lives of not only these animals, but individuals who can benefit from us sharing the amazing animals with them too!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003eTeam Free Spirit\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0"
