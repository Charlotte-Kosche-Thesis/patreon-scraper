I have had work exhibit around the world in places such as Paris and Berlin. \u00a0I have had some press in various culture sites, as well as distribution of my work as a musician.

Because I am usually focused on money being a means to simply to survive, I sincerely wish to spend it on art and musick instead. There are many goals I wish to accomplish, hopefully with your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I will be able to afford all of this more easily, and have a tiny peace of mind in someway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e93"

Visions often constitute as a religious experience received from higher beings. Though I may have a glimmer of what that may entail, the subjects and aspects of my work involve the layers of reality that may be not seen at ready appearances. A so-called altered mind-state is involved in many traditions of mysticism one way or another, and this is the case for my own practice. A fixed gaze, the evocation of emotions, awe, terror, a rhythm in the nature of the interpretation of that very piece; this is what I hope my work will do.",
