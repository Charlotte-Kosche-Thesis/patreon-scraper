As I have been on YouTube as long as I have, I want to grow and expand my channel, so I use what I have in terms of equipment (an emulator, a mic stand and mic and my macbook pro). I love what I make but however I believe it\u0027s time for new equipment \u00a0for me to use. Why can\u0027t I get it myself out of pocket? I am a freshman in college who is a communications minor and doesn\u0027t have enough to expand into my channel. That is the purpose of my patreon account to hopefully get enough money from anyone that wants to help me grow my channel. This includes getting equipment like a 3DS with capture hardware installed and a capture card for my Nintendo Wii. Should you check out my channel I can almost guarantee you it will be a fun time! So if you can help me grow my channel that would be fantastic! Thank you so much for your time at the least!"
