    "summary": "Hey there! Thanks for coming by to visit the Falstaff Books Patreon page. We are a small press publisher in Charlotte, NC, focusing on bringing you new voices in science fiction, fantasy, and horror. We currently publish somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 books per month, and we publish novels, novellas, anthologies, and short story collections. In the next few months, we are adding RPG modules to our line, so there\u0027s cool new stuff coming for the gamers, too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning a small press is challenging, and we want to use this Patreon to help provide an emergency fund for our operation, in addition to providing another revenue stream for our authors. This isn\u0027t a cash grab from some giant corporation; half of all money brought in will be distributed back to our authors each month. Plus, with no paid staff and operating out of my home office, I don\u0027t think we could be considered a giant corporation, even by the loosest of definitions. :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve published award-winners and first-timers, and we\u0027re dedicated to bringing you the most awesome urban fantasy, fantasy, sci-fi, horror, and weird fiction that we can find, month in and month out. I hope that you\u0027ll join us for this ride, and become one of the Misfit Toys of Fiction!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
