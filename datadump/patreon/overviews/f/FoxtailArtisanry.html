Custom made pieces.\u00a0 Pieces made specifically for \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 The more we make from Patreon, the easier it will be for us to work on new weaves and experiments, as well as to see about getting out to the various craft shows, which in turn should help us make more funds, and generally get this whole ball rolling.\u00a0 If we get to that point, we hope to have a lot more monthly prizes happening!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Please, visit our webpage at \u003ca href=\"http://foxtail-artisanry.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://foxtail-artisanry.com/\u003c/a\u003e and check out all the beautiful shiny things we\u0027ve already been making!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 - Raffle / Prize notes.\u00a0 For our international folks, unfortunately, we can\u0027t cover the cost of shipping out of the US ourselves (at the moment).\u00a0 If you\u0027re willing to pay the extra shipping on any raffle you win though, we\u0027ll be happy to make the pieces for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Also, you only get to win one each of the small chainmaille and custom chainmaille pieces per year.\u00a0 Obviously, when we\u0027re under 12 patrons, it\u0027ll cycle a bit sooner, but I want everyone to have a fair chance.\u003cbr\u003e"
