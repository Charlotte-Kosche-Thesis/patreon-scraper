I find joy in this and its a great stress reliever to people \u00a0in the world that need it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI picked up this hobby after my first trip to Kansas City Renaissance Festival back in 2011. Creature costumes...it needed more creature costumes! So, I set out on a journey to make my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI became addicted to the high of making these critters. I was going through a tough time at the time I started building them and it was a great portal to get away into a realm that had no troubles and only crafting a creature to perfection.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a natural knack for this, it seems, and I would like to mainstream costume building one day, especially in the realms of the 501st and Rebel Legion (Starwars not-for-profit costuming association), \u003cbr\u003eI am a big Fan of Star Wars and a lot of my personal projects are StarWars related or based.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot many people specialize in producing custom orders for creatures or anthropomorphic humanoid aliens in the Star Wars universe. This is a unique niche that has not been taken up yet, in the costuming community of Star Wars. I want my foot in that door.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also do non-Star Wars projects of various animal costumes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me put another smile on a kids face and help me to help broaden the characters in the Star Wars Universe to mesmerize Comic-Con goers all over the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am good at what I do and I can only get better with your help!\u003cbr\u003e"
