    "summary": "If you found my Patreon Page then you are probably a member of my Facebook Group. \u0027\u0027Film Historian (Learn about Films made between 1917 and 1960)\u0027\u0027 Or perhaps you are a member of my group We Love Classic Movies 1917-1960.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love old movies and I love to share this love with other people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBut as you probably know I spend most of my spare time running my Facebook groups and creating post for them. If you like to show your appreciation for all the work that I do then please make a small donation. I am a creative artist \u0026amp; Musician in daily life and I have a hard time making a living out of my artistic work. The work that I do relating to old movies is purely a hobby of mine. But the time I invest on Classic movies means that I spend less time on my music and art that I create to make a living. So any donation that you make to show your appreciation for my work is very much appreciated. It gives me motivation to keep on doing what I am doing and perhaps with enough donations I am able to invest even more time then I already do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust to give you an idea of all what I do for my Facebook group. Here is a small overview.\u003cbr\u003eI Create Classic Movie GIFS that you can share on Facebook, Create Tribute Videos and Biography videos and upload documentary\u0027s that are all related to classic movies on my Classic Movie Youtube channel. I create classic movie wallpaper art using Photoshop that people can use on the desktop of their computer. Create Classic Movie Banners that people can use on Facebook, Every weekend I create download links of old movies that you can download, I restore old movie publicity photos using Photoshop, I search for interesting information about Old Hollywood stars and movies that you can read about on my Facebook group, Create Photo Albums of publicity photos that I restored with Photoshop that you can find on both my Facebook groups and a lot more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this is beginning to sound like a day job, well sometimes it almost is. That is why I decided to start this page on Patreon. For those that like to show their appreciation for all my efforts in creating the best Classic Movie Group on Facebook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy donating, you are showing your appreciation for all that I do and by doing so you\u0027re encouraging me to invest even more time. What means more Wallpapers, More Movies for you to download more Restored Hollywood Publicity photos, More time in digging up Movie Trivia and so on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
