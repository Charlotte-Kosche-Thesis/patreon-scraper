    "summary": "Hello fellow netizen! I am a happy mad-hat hardware hacker with a livid imagination. You may have found me via BSoDtv, Youtube or a few other places. As long as I could remember I have always enjoyed electronics \u0026amp; tech. To be honest I just want to share my ideas and creations with you, and hear all about your own! Once I started to make how-to and tech videos I really began to enjoy the community that started to evolve. I don\u0027t know everything. There is so much I don\u0027t know, I don\u0027t know that I don\u0027t even know it. Which is why there is no such thing in my world as a \"noob\" question, since Iv\u0027e seen the simplest questions and comments evolve into some amazing group projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan an engineer be an artist? My paint brush is a soldering iron, my canvas is a circuit board. When I read code it can flow like poetry, or be so complex it hurts my brain-meat. Whether through your phone, your laptop, or just a good comment, my goal is to show you that \u00a0technology is not just some gizmo ... technology is an extension of who we are and what we can be. Together we can put together some amazing things. I really enjoy making videos but I always need questions and feedback from others so I know what kind of material and content to cover. So I need a lot of feedback and support from you."
