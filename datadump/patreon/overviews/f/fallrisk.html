    "summary": "Fall Risk is the music project of songwriter Matthew Wayne Selznick. Let\u0027s stop talking about myself in the third person, all right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write, record, and perform music, often acoustic, raw, and lo-fi, under the name Fall Risk... but ideally, Fall Risk isn\u0027t just me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFall Risk is an open invitation to the other musicians I know, both locally in Southern California and all over the world, to add their creative inspiration to the songs I write, so that the end result might come closer to the version I hear in my head... or better yet, something greater than I could have imagined.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eHow Can You Help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003eYour pledge of at least a dollar for every Fall Risk Bookcase Session I release (see below) is an ongoing vote of confidence for the Fall Risk project and my music, and that matters a great deal to me... and practically speaking, your pledge makes it possible for me to quite literally\u00a0afford to spend more time making music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s important to note that you should not feel obligated to become a patron. The Bookcase Sessions videos will always be available to watch for free on YouTube, and of course you can always simply purchases songs and albums as they\u0027re released, if you like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to provide ongoing encouragement and support not just for each song, but for the time and energy and work that goes into writing, practicing, recording, producing, and all the other aspects of music creation... then you \u003cem\u003eshould\u003c/em\u003e become a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some of the things your patronage directly supports:\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Bookcase Sessions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first thing I do when I write a new song for Fall Risk is to record a Bookcase Sessions video and post it on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Bookcase Sessions videos are live recordings of purely acoustic performances (acoustic guitar and vocals) usually done in front of... you guessed it... a bookcase. You can\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE6A9B4F57D243740\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eview the Bookcase Sessions as a YouTube playlist\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSong Sketches\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOften, I\u0027ll also record song sketches, or demo versions, of new Fall Risk songs. These multi-track recordings are meant to be \"scratch\" versions to be built up by other musicians and myself over time, until they are eventually ready for prime time. \u00a0Some songs will merit a \"full band\" arrangement. Others might just need... a little something. The song sketch is how it all begins.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNew song sketches are posted to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/fallriskproject\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe Fall Risk page on Soundcloud\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLive\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016, it\u0027s my intention to bring the songs of Fall Risk to live audiences in Southern California as often as possible. Logistics being what they are, most of those gigs will be just me and my guitar... but special guests will be welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the pledge rewards for a way you can enjoy a monthly virtual Fall Risk concert, too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks For Your Support!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
