My friends call me \u003cstrong\u003eAnt\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve worked as a professional artist for over 22 years, making monsters and designing scary places for a living, and it\u2019s been a good life. I\u2019ve been a mentor and a teacher. I\u2019ve conducted workshops to demystify the mechanisms behind world-building and help students on their own creative voyages. I love helping folks make the most of their imaginations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow it\u2019s time to create something for myself, and I\u2019m inviting you to ride shotgun. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy novel is entitled Walking the Glass and it\u2019s in the home stretch of its first draft.  Creating worlds and characters? I can do that blindfolded. This is my third book but my first shot at fiction. I\u2019m feeling equal parts excited, scared and bewildered, as the beast has assumed a life of its own. What was supposed to be a novella has turned into a series. Huzzah! And oh shit!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYour Patreon dollars support me as I finish up this novel and the art; they allow me to share the process with you so we can learn together; and they unchain me from The Man. My ultimate goal? I have enough of my own material to last a lifetime and I mean to unleash it by whatever means possible. The world doesn\u2019t need more widgets. It could use some more good stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSound interesting? Then toss what you can into the kitty and come along for the ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with my work you can find it \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fyreant.deviantart.com/gallery/6207220/Magic-Arts\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Art-Magic-Gathering-Lizz-Baldwin/dp/0786911786/ref=sr_1_1?s=books\u0026amp;ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1427934609\u0026amp;sr=1-1\u0026amp;keywords=the+art+of+magic%3A+the+Rath+cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-little-book-of-pain/id592040834?ls=1\u0026amp;mt=11\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/video-game-art-movie-monsters-and-more-new-ifx-11135212\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, and also \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fyreant.deviantart.com/gallery/6207360/Magazines-RPGs\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
