    "summary": "My name is \u003cstrong\u003eForeverJameses\u003c/strong\u003e, and I make videos for Youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know. You have probably never heard of a Youtube video guy, so I will...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m kidding. The world needs another Youtuber like it needs anal warts, BUT it does actually need more left wing creators addressing their ideas. I think it needs more dialogues about the bigger ideas of the left. I aim to help out with that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of this youtube hell-scape is just a bunch of people yelling at each other for clicks. I really don\u0027t care about that too much. I mean, I enjoy it, but I do think it is more sport than activism. So, what is my big idea? What am I doing here?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make entertaining videos that engage and make you laugh, but I also have two other goals in mind. I think many Youtubers are new to a lot of the bigger political ideas but engage in debates where an understanding of these ideas would come in handy. I am no expert by any means. In fact, I tend to view myself as a \"vanguard idiot\" to these ideas with which I want to wrestle, getting answers for myself and letting you guys in on the process. My first series of videos (called \u003cstrong\u003eReading the Right\u003c/strong\u003e) will engage with some of the bigger ideas that currently float around the right. I choose one book of importance on the right with which to engage. The result is usually a long ass video, laying out right wing ideas and debunking those that are wrong and dangerous (and accepting those that have a point).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy second series will engage with my second goal. Called \u003cstrong\u003eFucking in the Future\u003c/strong\u003e, I hope to debate ideas about the future of the human species. What do we need to do to survive or, dare we dream, even thrive? Once we start engaging in ideas about what is possible and necessary, then we can create a shared political framework that strengthens the left and helps people to understand what leftist causes are really about. And what we can achieve. (I hope.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis all sounds so lofty to be almost too silly. But who knows? It could be a lot of fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you for considering being my patron. It will allow me to put more time onto this (which is incredibly time consuming) and to be more responsive to my viewers. People like you are the best kind of people. I thank you in advance!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
