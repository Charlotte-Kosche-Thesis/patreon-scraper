For example, if you successfully donate for the month of October, you will be charged on October 1, and any rewards will apply during that month. They\u0027ll renew when your pledge is processed on the 1st of the following month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you pledge mid-month, you will be charged up front, and receive rewards for any remaining episodes that month. If none are left, your rewards will kick in the next month, when your pledge is processed on the 1st of the following month. Check the FWIW Site to see our last release - we typically release every other week."
