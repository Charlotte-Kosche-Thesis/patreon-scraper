    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor the first time in nearly thirty years, General Aviation is seeing an increase of college age student pilots interested in owning their own aircraft.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a recently certificated pilot, I hope to share my aviation adventures over the next few years while attending Worcester Polytechnic Institute in central Massachusetts. There is so much to be learned on every flight about how our national aviation system operates, from airspace and communications, to fixed base operators and airport diners. Modern video sharing and filming techniques allow my peers and I to capture nearly lost information about flying that has only appeared in print until today.\u00a0 Additionally, I intend to bring my unique computer graphics skills to the community, as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a number of contributors to YouTube and ShareAviation.com that I would like to mention in particular as being an inspiration to my channel;\u003cbr\u003eMrAviation101, steveo1kinevo, FlightChops, and MzeroA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEpisodes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFull length episodes, typically between 15 and 20 minutes in length, follow a flight in the New England area; investigating good airmanship, pilot decision-making, and other items of interest. The passengers I take flying always provide great conversation and ask intriguing questions in any phase of flight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMinisodes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShorter \"Minisodes, offer a quick look at frequently asked questions that keep even seasoned pilots awake at night, or chronicle an adventure I had with friends at a destination airport. Anywhere around five minutes in length, these miniature episodes can be considered lightweight, next to the full length episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBlog\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOften, us pilots spend the better part of a day researching a simple question, or never share the good answer they got from their old flight instructor. As I learn, so will you! I intend to keep a curated list of all such knowledge I gleam while on my adventures. I will also share current information in aviation and local events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was barely old enough to remember, my father took me flying only a few times before a bout with cancer and worsening eyesight spelled the end of his flying career.  It has always been a dream of mine to fly since then.  I made some difficult financial decisions in the past year to make aircraft ownership possible, so I am looking forward to sharing my experiences for at least three years while I am still living in New England.  The ultimate goal is to move to the Sunshine State of Florida with my family to continue my entrepreneurial ventures."
