    "summary": "Hey everyone!\u003cbr\u003eI grew up just outside of Vancouver BC, and when I was 12 I went to my first convention. When I was there, there were these two people in red fox costumes and they were the life of the party, the center of a lot of attention, including mine.\u003cbr\u003eI vowed to learn how to make these suits, and eleven years later I have been involved in several branding attempts and collaborations, creator of countless suits and characters, and now a bit of a local icon who has helped tutor the next generation of fursuit loving youths.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI came to patreon to help me further the quality of my equipment and help pay some of my bills to relieve some of the stress of being a startup company.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurEverAfter was launched in 2016, promoting longtime (8 years) fursona Myffanwy to CEO and introducing Thalia the Corgi as the face of the label. The change was a bit of a shock for people who had been diligently following me for my youthful years, but I felt it was necessary to step into the new, competitive suit making scene. Local kids and conventions weren\u0027t going to cut it anymore. I launched a Youtube channel, Instagram, Etsy and Amino all under this new branding and I feel the pressure to find better equipment and increase the quality of the content I output.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am hoping this is where Patreon comes in, and I want to thank each and every one of my supporters for donating and taking the time to read this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e((Icon made by Auburn.Tale on amino))\u003cbr\u003e"
