    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Nicole Frost of Frost Yarn (@frostyarn) and I\u0027m here to disrupt the proprietary, secretive and highly cliquey world of independent yarn producers. If you follow me on Instagram, you know that I\u0027ve been producing 60 second tutorials on how to clean/dye/card/spin and knit for over 3 years now (see for yourself by checking out #frostyarndyetutorial #frostyarnbatttutorial and #frostyarnspinningtutorial).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to have a show that is a cross between Bingeing with Babish and Mythbusters centered on this weird little offshoot of the DIY craft movement known as hand dyed and hand spun yarn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a taste of what your hard earned cash is going to help crowd fund into existence:\u003cbr\u003e-A full scale dye atlas of both mx/dx and acid reactive dye\u003cbr\u003e-difference in the dye uptake on superwash vs non superwash fiber\u003cbr\u003e-every speckle technique put to the test\u003cbr\u003e-how to kettle dye in stages\u003cbr\u003e-vinegar vs citric acid\u003cbr\u003e-how to thicken your dyes and stencil a sock blank\u003cbr\u003e-a real lightfasness test of the dye manufacturers claims\u003cbr\u003e-exactly how much dye *can* you force in before it starts to bleed\u003cbr\u003e-how to dye bamboo and cotton\u003cbr\u003e-\"breed test\" aka dyeing merino/bfl/polwarth/Targhee and seeing the difference in the dye uptake.\u003cbr\u003e-corespinning with different cores\u003cbr\u003e-vinegar vs citric acid as a mordant\u003cbr\u003e-kool aid vs Wilton\u0027s food coloring vs natural dyes\u003cbr\u003e-everything I know about art yarn spinning\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd more! Every month I\u0027m going to crowd source what you want to know about and see demonstrated. All the batts and yarn created for the show will be gifted back to you, my patrons, as well as dye atlases and instruction booklets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a lot of misinformation, bad science, and a weird shroud of secrecy around how the (yarn) sausage is made. I think that\u0027s an outdated business model that excludes more than it includes. When I started out in 2008, full of enthusiasm and utterly clueless, I encountered a lot of slammed doors in my face. I made minimum wage, part time, and couldn\u0027t afford a $250 workshop or $500 dye class. I sold school books in the middle of the semester and ugly knitted things to afford dye and fiber. I scoured Ravelry dyer forums, dye manufacturer manuals, read endless blog posts and nearly lit my dad\u0027s kitchen on fire teaching myself the mechanics of dyeing. Ten years into it, I\u0027ve got some shit to say and things to teach. If you\u0027re into the concept of open source information, if you want to be part of nurturing and growing the next generation of fiber artists, please do join me. I promise to give you 100% of what I have learned, with some rad perks on the side."

While Dharma trading is easily purchased in the United States, it is incredibly expensive or impossible to import internationally and the major dye manufacturer available to our International friends is Jacquard. This would be significantly less costly and time-consuming than the Dharma line because there are only 40 colors as opposed to 85 or 156.",
