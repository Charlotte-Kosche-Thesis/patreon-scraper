    "summary": "Friday Night Fanfiction is a podcast dedicated to reading terrible, awful, possibly erotic fanfiction and turning it into a drinking game. In our podcast, which comes out weekly outside of inter-Season breaks, is almost entirely community-oriented: we read fanfictions submitted to us and have an open guest application policy for people to come on the show to read. We are very active in hanging out in our Discord server, which is where people can chat while listening to the live broadcasts (on Wednesdays@8PM EST) and partake in many other aspects of the community. You can find out all the information at http://www.fridaynightfanfiction.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs part of our commitment to provide the community improvements and features that they want, we\u0027ve set up this Patreon to offer the ability to monetarily support the podcast. The show has running costs to keep it going (SoundCloud Pro, domain name registration, web hosting, the livestream for broadcasts and our FNF radio), and we\u0027re committed to remaining ad-free for the foreseeable future. This is a show that we do for fun, and we want every episode to be something we enjoy as much as we do today as we would in 20 years. Fans have requested the ability to help us out with these operating costs, so here\u0027s a way to do so!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeep in mind that due to the nature of our show and the community, we don\u0027t feel right offering anything significantly extra as Patreon perks. We hang with our fans because we enjoy doing that, and don\u0027t want to gate off anything of that sort with a paywall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to this, please go out and support the people who have written the stories that we read. Find Patreons for the authors of the stories that you enjoy and give them money to help them continue making their material, such as Nidoranduran (https://www.patreon.com/nidoranduran) and Peter Chimera (https://www.patreon.com/heisanevilgenius)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA big thank you to our entire community and everyone who helps us do what we do. We love you all."
