    "summary": "Hello there!\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting my page. All my life, I have been drawn to telling stories. Some of these stories are drawn from personal experience and some are drawn from places that are unknown to me. People tell me that I am a conduit for stories and that I have a gift for tapping into the great nexus of the universe and bringing things to life that otherwise would remain hidden. All I\u0027m really sure of is that I love to tell stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0As a DJ, I have been telling stories with songs for a long time.\u00a0 I jumped into mixing for an online audience with a monthly podcast.\u00a0 As of 2017, the monthly podcast expanded into a 3 hour, once weekly podcast that covered not only music but also gaming topics and random news items.\u00a0 These days, the Icebox is on once a week and focuses more on gaming, humor and music. I hope to keep expanding the Icebox with improv comedy, skits and featured guests.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat makes the Icebox radio show different from other music podcasts? For one, it is a highly curated show featuring musical gems from throughout the ages. Starting off in 2014 as a monthly mix program focusing on Tech House music (back then, known as the Tech House House), the Icebox is always evolving and includes all electronic genres as well as classic tunes from a wide variety of eras. The show also will feature improvisational skit comedy, interviews with quasi-famous people and random cats. It\u0027s three hours (sometimes more) a week of feely goodness straight from the heart with no politics and no drama.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a music producer and am working on my first full length album, which should be out by midsummer!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, creativity itself does not keep the lights on.\u00a0 Your contributions give me the time and the energy to keep creating and to push myself to a wider audience.\u00a0 As a patron, you will gain access to exclusive rewards and have a personal view of all things Fyrewolf. On top of it all, you\u0027re helping a simple dinosaur keep putting her voice out into the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp keep my creative dreams alive, contribute today!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
