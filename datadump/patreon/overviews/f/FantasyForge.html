Phair), and I own a small comic and gaming studio in Springville, Utah. I was previously on three of Amazons Bestseller lists for a digital comic I did called Diabolical Rising in 2015. When creating this comic I did not expect to be competing against some of the best Anime and Manga comics which is the genre this comic was in. I also did not expect to rival some of the best comic franchises in the industry.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am motivated by creating things. I have always had a vivid imagination but want to take things to the next level. I wanted to create a series of stories that are separate but still correlate to one another since I love writing and creating things in multiple genres.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am using Patreon as a way to connect with fans. Me, Sarah Phair the co-founder of Patreon who is also my wife,\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://fantasyforge.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Catrina-Reichelt.jpg\" style=\"width: 242px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eCatrina Reichelt and the rest of the Fantasy Forge team believe this will be successful and we want to update everyone\u00a0on what we are doing for people who are passionate about my work. I appreciate support from friends, family, friends of friends and anyone else. I am just a dreamer hoping to reach people who are passionate about my stories and what I am trying to bring to fictional reading in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCatrina Reichelt is not only a part of our Patreon team but she also has a character who is made after her in the Apocalypse franchise of Fantasy Forge named Abrielle. This character plays a crucial role in Apocalypse and in the Fantasy Forge Universe as she helps our main character in Apocalypse Zoey. All of the names in any work I do has meaning. Abrielle means \"God Is My Strength\" which is an Easter Egg in itself if you can figure it out. There are many Easter Eggs through each of our comics as well as Easter Eggs in pictures we post. It can be fun to try to figure them out. As we release more and more issues the Easter Eggs will be more apparent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCesar Collazo is a entertainer and also is a muse for Dark Knights as a original Werewolf named OZ which means strength and courage. The name Oz is also a Easter Egg in itself. Cesar will also be helping with the promotio\u003cimg src=\"https://fantasyforge.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cesar-Collazo.jpg\" style=\"width: 247px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003en\u0027s for our Patreon page.Dark Knights is our horror section of the fantasy realm and covers some\u00a0of the most diabolical monsters ever created as well as some new additions that we will be adding. Among these monsters and horrors is the Original Werewolf Oz who has lived beyond a mortal man. He was witness to the beginning of the plot of what happens in the Fantasy Forge Universe to our ultimate stand off. He also changes the minds of others who were once evil to help him forge a war against the mother of all evil Akasha, the first vampire and first wife of Adam. You will see the most detailed parts of stories that relate to Bloodlines in Dark Knights. In fact, there will be more Easter Eggs on where the final battle will be and how it will take place revealed in Dark Knights then in any other part of Fantasy Forge. Apocalypse is the backbone of the story, but Dark Knights is the revelation to the backstory of the ultimate battle between good and evil and how the fate of the Fantasy Forge Universe may unfold for the future of humanity itself.\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI am currently creating 5 comics and writing a novel. We have been producing this idea since October of 2017 and have been working on the idea since February of 2016. We have been preparing our Patreon page, rewards and strategy since January of 2018. A lot of thought, time and effort went into this. We are here now and ready and you will be seeing many updates so please bookmark our page and let us show you daily what we are doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are also announcing the release of our card game. We made a previous card game in 2015 called Konflikt that was also turned into a app game. We are using that same design and game-play concept to start as the foundation for our card game. We will be releasing information about this but wanted to give a heads up regarding our new category that we are entering here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am 100% committed to this. I will make at least three posts a week. You will see at least one Patron free post every w\u003cimg src=\"https://fantasyforge.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cosplay-Outfit.jpg\" style=\"width: 352px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eeek. I am working with like minded people and they will also be sending me their posts to edit and submit on here as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe want to earn your trust so take some time to read this and if in doubt, come see our page and let us show you we are committed to following through on what we say. Take the time to read what I have presented and let me show you that I am the real deal and that I have what it takes to being this to life and to find out more about what Fantasy Forge is.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(One of my Amazon rankings for Diabolical Rising)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://fantasyforge.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DR-36-Rank.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI created app games as well as a card game called Konflikt. I had many ideas for not only Diabolical Rising but also for other stories in the categories of Medieval, Steampunk, Zombie Apocalypse, Sci-Fi and more. The problem I found was that I wanted to create in multiple fantasy genres but did not want to have to re-brand each one. I had an idea to connect all of these fantasy concepts together to form what I called Fantasy Forge. Ultimately this concept intertwines how fantasy began and merges all fantasy genres together. I decided to take all of my ideas and add them here.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nView some of my past work:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(Game app I developed called Conflicted Space)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://fantasyforge.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Conflicted-Space-Boss.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(Conflicted Space Promo Video)\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/162203978\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(Konflikt Promo Video)\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/155496294\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFantasy Forge links all of these ideas together under one universe which we call the Fantasy Forge Universe or FFU. I have many ideas and plans to incorporate Fantasy Forge with comics, graphic novels, app games and card games. I have done this before but with separate brands of comics and characters. I now am going to combine everything under one brand all surrounded by the FFU. What makes it exciting is that Fantasy Forge is made up of all fantasy creations and collides all of the different fantasy genes and universes together which we have not seen in any comic franchise at all which includes medieval, Steampunk, Gothic, Monster, animal fantasy, pirate, Sci-Fi, and Apocalypse to start off with.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere are some previews of what to expect with Fantasy Forge and a inside look at two of the franchises within the FFU:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(Fantasy Forge: Dark Realm)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDark Realm is the main extension of the Fantasy Forge franchise after Apocalypse. It deals with the medieval realm that is the starting point of all fantasy realms to start being included into the Fantasy Forge Franchise.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://fantasyforge.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Fantasy-Forge-Dark-Realm-1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(Fantasy Forge: Apocalypse)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nApocalypse focuses on the zombie filled world that is the core of the Fantasy Forge Universe with all other parts of Fantasy Forge. You will see how these two connect to this part of the franchise and why Apocalypse is one of the most important keys to the FFU.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://fantasyforge.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Fantasy-Forge-Apocolypse.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am rewarding even Patron\u0027s of $1 a month with a special edition of a comic that will not be released anywhere else. I like to think that I made the rewards very generous as I do this for the love of creation and want to share that with as many people as possible. I love creating and want to invite as many people to become involved with my creations as possible.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOn my thank you page for Patreon I also give my e-mail where you may contact me. I want to socialize with any Patron who wants to give feedback, has suggestions, comments, etc. I want this to be a community effort mixed with my imagination and story telling abilities.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere are some things that we are doing to add something different to the comic and gaming world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n1\u0026gt; Creating a concept that has longevity.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2\u0026gt; Creating a Patron community that interacts with me the creator and I take those comments, suggestions and ideas back to improve on my concept.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n3\u0026gt; We have rewards even for $1. No need to shell out money if you do not want to but still be able to enjoy a great reward.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4\u0026gt; For the love of creation. I am doing this for the love of creation. I am going to be releasing\u00a0 a mainstream comic through Amazon in 2019 as well as card games and app games. I want to include people early who like me love comics, creation and new ideals in storytelling.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n5\u0026gt; Patreon is cool and a great concept. I want to reward fans whether in small or large numbers if I even get numbers at all. This is a labor of love.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease not that every tier will receive a reward distributed between the 5th and 15th of the month after Patreon payments have been processed Every tier for Fantasy forge receives a monthly reward. All higher tiers receive all tier rewards for that tier underneath it. Physical rewards will be processed and the products will be manufactured and we estimate delivery to be between the 20th and last day of the month. Physical Rewards are our monthly Loot Crate and receive all rewards under it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs we continue to grow Fantasy Forge we will add more tiers. Bookmark our Patreon page and check back for more updates as we grow Fantasy Forge and our Patreon page.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMe and everyone else on the Fantasy Forge team thanks you.
