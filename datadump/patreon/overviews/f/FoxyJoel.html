    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHihi!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Joel Karadsheh and I\u0027m an entertainer on Twitch.tv! You may also know me from Youtube and maybe Twitter! Here\u0027s a little bit of info on me...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve been making content for around 7 years now and I\u0027m only 19 years old, weird right? Also notice how I didn\u0027t say \"good\" content for a straight 7 years. Please I\u0027m not that conceited in myself. I used to primarily make youtube videos, but after awhile I started to realize I was getting nowhere with it and most of the videos were getting demonitized due to Youtubes weird ad friendly crusade, so I moved over to Twitch streaming and immediately fell in love with it. I love interacting with fans and friends on twitch! Meeting new people and having them pop in the stream and actually enjoy watching me is one of the best feelings in the world. Whether it\u0027s my art streams where we all chill out and relax or if it\u0027s one of my game streams where the hype lives on! I always have a good time doing it \u0026lt;3\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why make a patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMmm, I don\u0027t have an exact answer for that. My life isnt in jeopardy without patreon, but my streaming quality is. I don\u0027t have a job since I am in college for 60 hours a week and streaming takes up the rest of the time, so I have no way to gain money besides this and very gratious donations from fans. I need money so I can improve my equipment standings as my stuff is very old, I also use the money for new games that come out so I can play them for everyone and keep up with the times! It can also be really helpful for when I am idiotic and run out of food early and have nothing to eat (Sadly it happens a lot...).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI also use it to feed my crippling hentai addiction. ( Don\u0027t judge me, I\u0027m an addict you know?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get as a patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHonestly I\u0027m still figuring out this part. I was thinking I could take drawing requests and give out special chats and roles on discord, maybe even have exclusive Movie Nights with Patrons and or Karaoke Nights or Game Nights! I\u0027m also always open to suggestions on this aswell! I really want to be able to show my appreciation to everyone who donates to me and willingly keeps my whole twitch lifestyle afloat. I honestly do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI love you all! Thank you so much for reading and/or investing in me!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
