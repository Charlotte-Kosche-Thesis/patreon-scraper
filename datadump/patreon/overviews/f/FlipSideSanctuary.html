    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eFlip Side Sanctuary is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit animal sanctuary providing a safe haven for animals that have been neglected, abused or abandoned. We educate to inspire change in the way they are seen and treated and advocate for a cruelty-free lifestyle. We have been a nonprofit for 2 years and are 100% volunteer run. We have rescued over 250 animals to date.\u003cbr\u003eWe thank you for taking the time to visit our page and support our sanctuary!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Cindy Holm and I, along with my husband Gregg, have co-founded FSS. I am a vet tech in the field for 20 years and Gregg is a carpenter for even longer. We have been rescuing animals since we have been together for over 27 years. When we rescued Milton, our first goat and the true founder of Flip Side, things started to change. He was thrown over a fence at a dairy, discarded like trash. He changed our perspective and made us see ALL animals as individuals and all deserving the right to live and be free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been in California for the last 10 years but have recently purchased ourselves, the new site of FSS in Tabor City, North Carolina.\u00a0 The property we were buying here has become undesirable for a sanctuary. With recent laws in California, we are being surrounded by agricultural grows and feel this is not a safe or appropriate environment, first and foremost, for the animals, but also for us, volunteers and future visitors. We know we can make a bigger impact in an area where a sanctuary is really needed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also make art from recycled and re-purposed materials where 100% of donation goes directly to the animals. we will also be able to make many more items after the move and raise more funding and awareness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Running a non-profit has\u00a0 many expenses.\u00a0 Feed , routine health care, maintenance, building, utilities, vet bills, vet bills( oh did I say that already?) fundraising, marketing, transport, insurance, oh, and vet bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron, you can be a part of our move, expansion and build and have input in the plans and design of the sanctuary. You can help us focus on what is most important, the animals,their stories and educating to help change the world!\u00a0 We thank you for your support!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE***\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
