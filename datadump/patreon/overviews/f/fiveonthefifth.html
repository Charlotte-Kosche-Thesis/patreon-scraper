We publish 5 stories, as well as original cover art, on the 5th of every month. We just finished publishing our 13th issue, which can be read at \u003ca href=\"http://www.fiveonthefifth.com.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.fiveonthefifth.com.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur editorial staff is entirely volunteer (non-paid). Our goal is to support writers and artists by providing a monthly showcase for their work. We also do our best to promote our writers and featured artist on social media. We pride ourselves on publishing great short fiction every month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t charge reading fees, and access to all of our fiction is free. However, that doesn\u0027t mean that we, as publishers, don\u0027t have costs. We currently run Five on the Fifth at a monetary loss to ourselves to keep it going. Our costs include website hosting, the fees for our submissions management account, advertising fees, as well as the cost of our own hours spent reading and editing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support us with even $1.00 per month, that money will go 100% toward our overhead costs to keep Five on the Fifth running! Eventually, too, we would like to be able to pay writers. We feel it is important to pay writers and artists for their hard work!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your consideration, and we hope you will read a story (or five) at www.fiveonthefifth.com.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
