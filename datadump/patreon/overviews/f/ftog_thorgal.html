My first computer was an Amiga 500 that my parents bought me for Christmas of 1987. I\u0027ve been hooked to computers ever since and while I have an education and multiple certificates in Network engineering, server administration, and have also worked as a programmer analyst, by true passion in computers has always been gaming. So in the summer of last year I decided to start making YouTube videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter I had to quit my last job to take care of my father full-time, I decided to focus on producing gaming videos full-time because that is pretty much the only thing I can do from home, and while it is a lot of fun, it doesn\u0027t pay the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I have no choice but to stay home to take care of my father, your support would help me to relieve financial stress and to buy better recording equipment and software to make better quality videos and content.\u003cbr\u003e"
