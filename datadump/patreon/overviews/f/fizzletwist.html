    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Elizabeth and I am writing a completely original fantasy novel! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat\u0027s this? I hear you cry. You can not possibly have fantasy without Dwarfs and Elves and Goblins and Giants. WRONG, say I! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirstly, Why Am I Using Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI believe strongly in what this website and system stands for! Allowing artists to create the content THEY want to create whilst allowing the consumers to pay what THEY feel the product is worth feels like a genuine step forward.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel confident enough in my work to now throw it out there to the masses! I am not using Patreon to earn a bajillion macaroons, rather, I want my work to be in the hands of people who can then provide feedback, critique and ultimately enjoy the work I am producing. The tip jar, is just that :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat Actually Is This Book You Are So Excited About?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis book has been a passion project of mine for the better part of a year now and since I started the book has only become more and more real. I currently sit at 25,000 completed words with the entirety of the complete book already planned out. My key aim of the project is to prove that the fantasy genre does not need to be bound down by\u00a0clich\u00e9 or convention and that an entirely original story can still be produced. I always find it amusing when people simply hear the term \u0027fantasy\u0027 and assume it must be a wizard fighting a dragon with help from the elves. I think I have produced something different, something that I really hope you will enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe book is a fantasy novel with a comedic twist. I was heavily inspired by the works of Terry Pratchett - one of my favourite writers. I adore his Discworld series and his style of comedy is something I find fantastically entertaining. As I have said previously, I believe my world to be entirely original and all I ask is for you to read the first chapter! It\u0027s free! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI intend to hit at least 70,000 words (that\u0027s the rough word count of Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone) but at the moment it looks likely that it might hit 100,000. I do have a trilogy set out in my head ideally. But at the moment I ma just focused on the first book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho Actually Are You?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Elizabeth Hall. When I was younger I was a reading machine, I remember going into school with four books in my pockets and two more in my bag. I actually used to see it as a challenge how many books I could read in a week! These days, I tend more towards video games and movies, but I still read from time to time. When I was younger I always used to try and write a book, I would sit on my dads computer writing. However, I was quite young, so they rarely amounted to much :P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe strongly in diversity and equality - something I sometimes feel the fantasy genre can lack.\u00a0I believe try to carry this belief through into my writing! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd The Money? What About The Money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs I have mentioned above. I am not looking to make enough money to buy an island! I am looking more for criticism of my work and for you to enjoy reading what I produce. HOWEVER, any money you can provide will go a long way to helping me\u00a0\u00a0with this project. I will provide the content for free regardless of whether you choose to donate or not and if you are unsure I urge you to not donate. However, if you feel that you can and you particularly enjoy my work then I would be lying if I said that it didn\u0027t help! I would love it and shall do my best to provide benefits to those who choose to become patrons :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
