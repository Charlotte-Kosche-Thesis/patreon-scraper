We bought a proper camera, lights, microphones, and we upgraded the PC that we use for editing and rendering the videos.\u00a0 We also have some ongoing costs - editing software (Adobe Premiere Pro has a monthly fee), web-hosting, backup services, internet access.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut our major investment in the show is our \u003cstrong\u003etime\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0 Arranging guests, preparing for and doing interviews, editing and other post-production activities all take a lot of time.  And although we are proud of what we produce and love meeting the people of our community, we can\u0027t keep doing this on love alone.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp to now, Andrea has worked on the podcast on top of her work as a singing teacher.  This \nmeans that she is working seven days a week, including evenings, to fit in the podcast.  We were \nhappy to do that to test the idea, but it is not sustainable.  If the \nshow is to continue, Andrea will have to reduce her teaching work to a minimum and \nfocus on the podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eWhat\u0027s this \"Patreon\"??\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an established online platform that allows fans to provide regular financial support to creators.\u00a0 Patreon was created by a musician who needed a easy way for fans to support his band. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eWhat do you need?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Please \u003cstrong\u003esupport Fruity Knitting financially by becoming a Patron\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0 Patrons agree to a regular monthly contribution, starting at $5 per month (\u003cem\u003ewhich is around $2.50 per episode\u003c/em\u003e).
