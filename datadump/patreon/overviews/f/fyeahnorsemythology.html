    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho We Are.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFuck Yeah Norse Mythology is a bi-annual digital magazine and blog. We are busy all year round researching, answering questions from the community, and providing advice. The magazine aims to be well researched, of good quality, and bring major contributions to the discussion of mythology, history, archaeology and literature. We want to redefine what writing for a \"popular audience\" means by creating work that is both accessible to most people and still accurate and academically responsible. We were founded in December of 2010 on Tumblr as a blog. In \nthe Summer of 2014, the founder gave up the blog to current Editor. Now in 2016 we \nare happy to make our move to a magazine format. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the off months, in addition to working on the magazine we do weekly \nQandA posts where we answer informal questions about Norse mythology, \nScandinavian history and archaeology. Due to popular demand, we also \nprovide a free 1-on-1 spiritual consultation service to other Norse \nPagans who are looking for an understanding ear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow We Are Different. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a lot of Norse mythology related projects out there. It is one of the most popular ancient mythologies and has a very lively religion attached to it, as well as influencing pop culture in huge ways. We strive to set ourselves apart from the other options out there in three key ways: Academics, a non-religious focus, and a strong stand regarding issues in our community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAcademics\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe FYNM Magazine\u00a0 seeks to get more people interested in academics, mythography and literary studies. It is not a journal of academics and not a peer reviewed source, but instead seeks to make academic topics and discussions accessible to the public while still being accurate. Too often, articles that are written for a general audience over simplify a topic. We seek to avoid this problem as much as possible. Although we are \u003cem\u003enot a peer-reviewed source\u003c/em\u003e, we will always provide our publications completely free and help people who need peer-reviewed sources to get them. We want to aid other academics to find the sources they need. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNon-Religious Focus\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of other sources in the field, even well researched ones, have an explicit focus on Norse Pagan spirituality. Although the Editor is a member of the faith, this publication seeks to provide a non-religious alternative. In an effort to keep religious discussion out of the magazine itself, we offer an email address where people can contact us privately if they wish to discuss spiritual topics 1-on-1.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eKey Issues\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eFYNM is committed to providing a high quality publication that is \ntotally free to the public. One of the biggest issues in academia is \nresearch being closed off behind a publisher\u0027s paywall, often against an author\u0027s will. Major publishers prevent the author from reproducing their work or making it available for free even on their private webpages. It can be hard to get access to these articles if you don\u0027t have a subscription to costly journal services or access to a University library. FYNM Magazine will always be free to the public, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eWhere other publications and websites try to refrain from touching on the topic of bigotry, FYNM maintains that the problem is too prevalent in the community that surrounds norse mythology. We are committed to explicitly condemning the bigotry that this subject matter attracts. We are a safe space for women, MOGAII/Queer-identified folk, people of color and anyone else who is interested in this topic and might be afraid to look into it because of a minority of people. \u003cbr\u003e"
