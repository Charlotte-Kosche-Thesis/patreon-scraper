    "summary": "Sadly as I reached my early middle age, a series of health issues since birth have finally forced me to find a means to work from home. I refuse to go onto disability when my mind, my art, and my passion can hopefully pay some bills. I want to work and I humbly ask you to support me so I can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing is often original but I love fanfiction too. I write mainly male x male stories, except for one fandom \"Labyrinth\" (The Jim Henson Movie). Jareth is a frequent visitor in my art. The only woman you\u0027re likely to see in my art or my writing is Sarah. Otherwise, it\u0027s general Male romance or homoerotica artwork and writing. Fandoms I\u0027ve worked with in the past is Hetalia, Avengers, Gundam Wing, Yu Yu Hakusho, generally anime is an inspiration, however my artistic style is my own. A blending of western comic meets anime blending. I\u0027m a stickler for proper anatomy in my artwork, real bodies and re-envisioned versions of hopefully some of your favorites.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not opposed to people asking for fandoms they would like to see me try my hand at drawing. However, I ask you give me artistic license and just mention a fandom you like or a pairing you like and let me come up with the rest. I can\u0027t guarantee I\u0027ll be able to draw it, but I will certainly always consider it. Just leave me a comment. Just please do not ask for furry, shota/loli, non-con, artwork. I cannot do furry any justice and for personal reasons shota/loli and non-con are a trigger for me and I can\u0027t, I\u0027m very sorry. I am always romantic, prefer tasteful nudes, and homoerotica, in the epic fantasy and science fiction genres.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not take requests for writing, that\u0027s a more intimate art for me and the creativeness in that area I just cannot force and have it worth reading and not actually burning as kindling. I\u0027m also sorry there, but I will try to deliver the goods so to speak. I have a desire to please \u003cem\u003e(and eat, pay the mortgage, pay medical bills, old graduate student loans, etc...).\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also do not mind if you post my web-safe size images to social media, tumblr, facebook, twitter, Instagram, etc... \u003cem\u003e(if I am credited as the artist)\u003c/em\u003e. I also do not mind if you want to use my art as avatars, facebook headers, twitter backgrounds, etc... I\u0027m not like a lot of artists, I don\u0027t mind how you use my images for personal use. Just never edit out my signature \u003cem\u003e(unless of course it\u0027s an avatar and you have to crop)\u003c/em\u003e and we\u0027re all good.
