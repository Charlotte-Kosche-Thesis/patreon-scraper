I\u0027m Frank Fradella and thank you for visiting my Patreon page! Great to have you here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhat are we creating here?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eFor months now, I\u0027ve been obsessing over an idea for a weekly comic strip about the tales of young Thor and other Asgardians. We know that, as gods, at a certain point they seem to stop aging, so Thor at 35 and Thor at 350 basically looks like the same guy. But he was born. He was nursed. He had a childhood.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHOUSANDS of years before he married Sif, they played together as children. Loki and Balder and Heimdall and Frejya played some ancient Viking version of \"ring and run\" with frost giants.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we were children, we played in our neighborhoods and we had to worry about strangers with candy. These young Asgardians would face wolves and bears and deadly trolls.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are the untold stories of young Asgardians.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut more than just a series of adventure tales, this ongoing web comic will explore the themes of love and judgement and belonging and obligation and so much more. It\u0027s such rich and fertile ground for storytelling!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eHow do we as patrons play a part?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI created this Patreon account because I wanted to create a community that could follow the entire process of creation. When I do sit-down sessions for the character designs, you\u0027ll be invited to attend the livestream and contribute ideas and comments. You\u0027ll be able to take part in patron-only polls about the name of the strip. You\u0027ll vote on what content gets shown, from the writing to the art to the additional non-comic products we make. Keychains? Bookmarks? You help me decide! I\u0027m creating this to be as collaborative as possible!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWait, what is Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003ePatreon is a site that allows creatives to become \"patrons of the arts,\" like in the days of old. Leonardo Da Vinci had a patron when he painted the Mona Lisa! Being a patron allows you to pledge a few bucks every month (with the option to cancel at any time!) and actually be a part of making more beautiful things appear in the world. Now, instead of an artist having one patron on the hook for all of their monthly needs, Patreon allows you to join a small group of patrons for a particular artist and collectively share the glory.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWho are you again?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI\u0027m Frank Fradella! I\u0027m a writer and artist who, among another things, wrote and illustrated The Complete Idiot\u0027s Guide to Drawing. I\u0027m also a published novelist, member of the Rabbit Hole Artist Collective, and the founder of The Geek\u0027s Guide to Consciousness. I live in Italy. I\u0027ve got three sons (Caspian \u0026amp; Aegean (the twins\u2014aged 5), and Nero (who is 3), and a pit bull named Lady Jane."
