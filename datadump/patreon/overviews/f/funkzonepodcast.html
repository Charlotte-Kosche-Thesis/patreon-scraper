    "summary": "Hi folks, welcome to \u003cstrong\u003eThe FunkZone Podcast!\u003c/strong\u003e I am your host \u003cstrong\u003eTed Mills\u003c/strong\u003e, and I devote every week to finding interesting and talented artists and creatives to sit down and talk about \u003cem\u003ewhy they do what they do\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.funkzonepodcast.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCheck out the most recent episode here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started as a print-only interviewer, but I soon realized that the conversations I was having lost their flavor when turned into an article. It was only after talking to artists past the usual publicity-based opening minutes that things got interesting. Hence the \u003cstrong\u003eFunkZone Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e got started, to get those interviews archived and available for you to check out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn our first season\u003c/strong\u003e I talked to artists, writers, screenwriters, film directors, poets, philosophers, restauranteurs, musicians, architects, historians, gallery owners, and curators.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I make the podcast for \u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e and will continue to provide it for free, but \u003cstrong\u003eWITH YOUR HELP\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0you can help make the show even better. The show doesn\u0027t magically appear, ya know! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck this out: I have to go the guest\u0027s studio and record the show. Then I have to EQ the results and edit the interview. Then I have to record the intro, edit that in, mix the music intro, tweak everything, export it, upload it, create a page on the website for the episode, filled with art and links, and then publish the entire thing. \u003cstrong\u003eEvery week!!\u003c/strong\u003e All so the show sounds high quality and not like it was recorded in an underwater garden shed with a $5 microphone made of tofu.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA dollar per episode\u003c/strong\u003e is absolutely awesome and helps towards our operating costs for the show. And as you\u0027ll see to the side, \u003cstrong\u003emo\u0027 money equals mo\u0027 fun\u003c/strong\u003e. You\u0027ll get shout outs, merchandise and original art. Mo\u0027 money will also equal mo\u0027 segments, and special correspondents in future shows. It\u0027ll also help us take the podcast on the road! And won\u0027t that be fun? You bet it will!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please, Internet friends, do like John Turturro does in \u003cem\u003eMiller\u0027s Crossing \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eLOOK INTO YOUR HEART\u003c/strong\u003e and pledge towards the \u003cstrong\u003eFunkZone Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e and making it the best damn arts interview program! (Ever! In the history of podcasts! or at least this month!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote:\u003c/strong\u003e Any rewards I offer will be fulfilled the week after you pledge. Patreon will tell me who gets what and who loved us just that little bit more. And that\u0027s how we know who to thank.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
