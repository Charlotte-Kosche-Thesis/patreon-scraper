    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0My name is Frenk. A guy living in the Netherlands with his cats, Pixel and Manny, being as creative as possible on as many levels as possible. And you might be thinking: \u201cDid he just write his name with an \u2018e\u2019 instead of an \u2018a\u2019? That\u2019s quite out of the ordinary\u201d. Yes, yes it is. Officially my name with an \u2018a\u2019 but thanks to my friends I\u2019ve been dragging this misspelled name around for more than 16 years. I have all the basics right now to keep myself busy. I have the Adobe software to visualize my work and Google Drive to write down all the stuff that\u0027s in my head. The main goal, eventually, is to quit my dayjob and go full-time crazy with everything I want to make. Tell more stories, maybe animate some of them, etc. All of this and more, knowing that there are enough people who would support that. Whether you want to support me or just tag along for the ride, that\u0027s all up to you. Patreon gives you the freedom to do whatever you want, whenever you want. You\u0027re not stuck with a subscription and when you feel like you don\u0027t want to support the project anymore, that\u0027s okay! Tag out and shake hands. Like proper gentlemen. But for me it\u0027s the option that gives people a chance to support the work that I do, which then gives me the ability to expand. Maybe hire talented artists to create some work for my project. Concept art, character creating, etc. Maybe even to release the books!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is it you do?\u003c/strong\u003e Time to begin explaining this big project. A project that I\u2019ve spend many days, months and years on. Writing pages and pages of information, collecting over 2000 images for inspiration and used the Unreal Engine to try and figure out what my galaxy would look like, flying through it.\u00a0\u00a0During this whole process, I also started visualizing several things. Weapons, logo\u2019s, city layouts, etc. Loved it! Still do. Even now I\u2019m trying out several things to help visualize the universe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter playing with the idea of using the star system we all know and love (with Earth, but more advanced, etc, etc), I chose a different route and steered away from actual Earth and created a whole new universe. But to have a familiar start, I re-implemented our solar system, just for a brief moment, quickly moving to something different and new-ish. To make sense of it all, I\u2019m gonna pull you through the first chapters, skipping a few details to not spoil everything:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eOur current solar system. Earth and Mars were colonized, Jupiter had an orbiting station and all were heavily occupied. So yeah, somewhat familiar ground. Luckily, there\u2019s nothing to show and not that important anyway, because we\u2019re leaving right away. Why? The sun has created trouble in paradise. So Earth, Mars and Jupiter Station created a colonization project to discover new habitable planets and create new homes, outside of their current star system. Of the many Colony Ships that were launched, one got struck by an unknown glitch, that steered them away from the pre planned path. Because the journey would take many years, everyone was put in cryostasis, so nobody could counter the glitch. The silent space drifter eventually ended up\u00a0 in the future, like it was nothing. [How, you ask? It\u2019s one of the great unknowns. Every universe has one]. The ship automatically ends up making an emergency landing on a nearby planet. Crew is released from cryo years later, when the ship\u2019s energy hit a critical low. Fast forwards several years more and the survivors (including many scientists and astronomers) figured out their current (and new) location, which will also remain a secret for now. Because of this finding, they got a rough estimate of the time they\u2019ve been asleep. They slowly start colonizing once they discover that they could never go back, or contact anyone they left behind. They ended up with a lovely place of their own and things went swimmingly, planning to continue their interstellar colonization\u003c/em\u003e\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo there you have it. You guys or in the know\u2026 sorta, kinda. If you think everything I said sounded vague, Sorry. I did my best to keep a good balance between \u2018giving a decent impression\u2019 and \u2018not giving to much away\u2019. There\u2019s just so much information that I sometimes get lost in words, while explaining my project to someone. But I think this explanation turned out okay for now.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "Final Chapter: The man and his following continued their journey, far beyond the clouds of the realm. He looked back at the people, still holding the platforms of information and carrying his bags. He felt guilty, but also lucky to have them by his side. The journey ended in front of a house. There was another group standing in front of it. They were holding a key and handed it over. With a pad on the shoulder they let the man through. He looked up and saw a banner that said: \"House of Time\". He unlocked the door and entered, together with everyone who joined him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[covers: websites, software, hiring artists and create full-time]",
