It is a place of learning, but also a place for companionship and good times. I offer a variety of history courses, which are called either Hearthside History (for special topics) or History Raids (for themed courses). In those posts, I explore the various aspects of the medieval North, especially the Viking Age and medieval Iceland. I also offer Lore Tomes which contain resources for learning more about the Old Ways of the North. But much more happens here in my Hall! There are great sagas to find, and there are interactive maps that will help you explore the world of the medieval North. And so I encourage you to stay, join our fellowship, and grab a horn full of mead, for the night is young and our stories have yet to be sung!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Fjorn?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I am a Graduate student working on a Master\u0027s degree in History. I started this project back in September 2015 not having a clue what it would eventually become. I was just a college student obsessed with the Vikings, playing too much Skyrim over the summer, and browsing the seemingly endless sea of Viking-themed pins on Pinterest. One day, however, I made a blog on Tumblr to share things I knew about Viking History. Eventually that blog grew into a full-fledged website, which is what Fjorn\u0027s Hall is today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, w\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehat is Fjorn\u0027s Hall?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis hall is a place of (free) learning for anyone interested in the medieval North. I hope to establish a place where anyone interested in the Norse world can learn and find useful resources. As a Graduate student, I ensure that my sources are credible, even though I personally may not be (yet). Eventually I hope to have a PhD, but even then I want to use it to make Fjorn\u0027s Hall a more reliable place for learning.\u00a0Long story short, my friends, Fjorn\u0027s Hall is a place to gather and learn about the Norse world, even if your money is tight. It also stands to support academics (like myself) by sharing their labor and providing resources that may help their research or give them a place to study further. But most importantly, it will remain a free resource that people of all backgrounds can enjoy without the worry of harmful inaccuracies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can you help? Join Fjorn\u0027s Fellowship!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to contribute to the building of Fjorn\u0027s Hall, I would gladly welcome you among my Fellowship. Your support would help me write more posts every month, enhance the overall quality of the website (especially by adding interactive materials), purchase new research materials, create new graphics and resources, and much much more. With your support, this Hall will become a gathering place worthy of all the wanderers who need a place to stay and learn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00deakka ykkur k\u00e6rlega fyrir,\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Thank you all affectionately,)\u003cbr\u003e-- Fjorn the Skald"

     "about": "Although the name Fjorn complements the Norse aesthetic far better, my real name is Steven T. Dunn. I am a graduate student with a Bachelor of Arts in History, and I am currently working towards an M.A. in History, with a concentration in Medieval History. Presently, I study with the University of South Florida\u2019s History Department, where I also work as a Graduate Assistant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI originally began this project without a clear purpose, and it seems to have remained in obscurity since that fateful moment back in September of 2015. Yet, a purpose has slowly come to form, which is to build not only a connection between the worlds of academia and the public sphere of interest, but also to build a bridge between old and new. Not only do I do this in my studies (in a historical sense), but I also seek to bring history closer towards contemporary relevancy. The stories once told in the thirteenth century (and before it), on a remote medieval island called Iceland, can still sway our hearts and minds to this very day. There is much about the medieval period that still speaks to modern audiences, and the goal of this blog is to formulate a voice for that sort of discussion. We need not keep the past locked in a jar on a dusty shelf. We can understand it, respect it, and use it to help enrich our lives today.",
