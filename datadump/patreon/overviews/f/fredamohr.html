    "summary": "Hi.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a fiber artist in Baltimore, MD, making modern lace jewelry. I also make a lot of random stuff, displays, and crafts. I talk a lot about mental health because struggling with mine is a daily, hourly, by-the-minute task. My life has been hard and sometimes I\u2019m open about poverty and trauma. I used to write a lot more, and sometimes would even perform or be in a band. My day work primarily consists of child care, but I\u2019ve had lots of other jobs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I have been creating all of my life, the lace jewelry has become a way for me to really express many ideas. Although I am not going to stop creating jewelry and offering it for sale, I am focusing on restructuring my process so that I can do what I love doing: designing new pieces.  What this means is that I have to do a lot of things I\u2019m not good at yet enough to get better at them. A bit of this stuff is very mundane, and eventually I want to hire people to do them for me. By focusing on such things, I will eventually be able to create the work I really want to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis space is crucial because I want to make it easy for those who support my work to see tangible results of their patronage. By contributing, even at the lowest tier, you are giving actual value to my life and making it more possible for me to live. This will give you access to my process through it\u2019s ups and downs, with a perspective I haven\u2019t provided often of late. Each level of contribution will have a different perk, a way for me to say thank you for getting me closer to having breathing room, and hopefully even some flexibility in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I have tiers of support for as little as $1/month to $15/month to get things started. I will eventually have higher tiers as I get more comfortable with this platform, and when I can offer juicier fruit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m so full of gratitude for everyone who has helped me along the way, and look forward to sharing a ton of new work and ideas with you!"
