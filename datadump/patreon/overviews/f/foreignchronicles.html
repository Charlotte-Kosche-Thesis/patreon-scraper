I make around 3 or 4 videos like that a year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cIn the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him.\"\u003cbr\u003eOrson Scott Card\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn this channel we connect the dots, in order to get a story behind every each of the videos uploaded. I often try to get in the head of each faction/person implicated directly, or indirectly, in a geopolitical conflict.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach video is around 150 or 200 hours of hard work. Which I accomplish with joy and patience. This is why videos are uploaded at such a slow rate. Their format do not properly plays by the rules of Youtube, and this is one of the reasons why the channel is slowly (but surely) growing. On the other hand, I have to say that I am really proud of the quality of my supportive community, which I have been happy to meet on a few occasions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis channel is both a great joy and a struggle, as it is so much time spent, for such an enthousiastic result, but also for such a financial disaster :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour help is very welcome of course. As the maximum of videos that I can upload each year is of 3 or 4, I have decided (the 11th of March 2018) to higher up the pledges. Because if someone pledges 1$ by video, it will only help me at 3$ or 4$ a year. And I don\u0027t think that I will have a community big enough, soon enough, so that this small pledge reallly helps me in my work. This is why I am now putting the pledges at 3$ - 5$ - 10$ - 20$. And then it could really help to develop the media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am trying really hard, with lots of heart, to give you the best I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI very warmly hug those who help me. Please feel free to contact me. I will be very glad to discuss with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFaithfully.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrice d\u0027Arras"
