(I do an interview series about food and fiction also, but that\u0027s not what we\u0027re doing here.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.franwilde.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pendant.png\" style=\"float: right; width: 186px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eI\u0027m first and foremost a person who makes things* and a mom. I\u0027m a programmer, a poet, a singer-of-loud-car-songs, and a fine artist (vastly out of practice). I write about disability now and then. I have yet to attach a laser shooter or a bike bell to my cane but I\u0027m thinking about it. (*I make lots of things. My approach to stress is basically: where\u0027s the glue?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout You: \u003c/strong\u003eYou\u0027ve maybe come across one of my stories, or seen me being ridiculous on twitter (I was funnier on twitter before twitter got weird). Possibly we\u0027ve met on the road. You\u0027re here because you\u0027ve chosen to access my work in a way that will allow me make more of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy This? Why Now? \u003c/strong\u003eDuring some recent storms, I started sketching again. A few of them turned out to be things people liked. I started a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.threadless.com/@WildeInk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethreadless\u003c/a\u003e shop, but that wasn\u0027t really what I wanted to do with the prints (but if you need a starlight lighthouse shower curtain, I\u0027ve got your back). Mostly I wanted to find a way to print and send them out, plus maybe other things like small collections of related essays or poems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.franwilde.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sketches.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the previous storms before that, I started writing more poems. I posted a lot of those on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fran_wilde/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e, but that\u0027s not what I really wanted either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat this is:\u003c/strong\u003e The storms keep coming and I\u0027m hoping to build a place where I can share things that I make during them.\u00a0Getting through the storms, and continuing to work on fiction and essays, is what I\u0027m hoping to accomplish with this patreon -- and with your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.franwilde.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/poem.png\" style=\"width: 383px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eThere\u0027s plenty of me around the web that you can read for free, but not everything. There are books you can buy too. But essays can be hard to find, and poems even more so. And news? well if you want it early, this may be the right place. Here\u0027s where new storm-makings will live, new drawings, new poems, and bits of WIPs, before they go up anywhere else. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery so often, I might do a hangout at the higher levels, to talk about art across different media, and ink, and pixels. And, probably, storms too. Plus a mostly monthly email update.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking this journey with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e~ Fran ~"
