These are mostly horror and sci-fi based but have also explored a plethora of subjects such as identity, family, bullying, self-esteem and coming of age stories, with a diverse range of characters. These comics have gone on to much critical acclaim, with several getting nominated for awards and nabbing a 2015 Bronze Ledger Award for my comic \"Monster Zero\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/9e0ce5d2ac502617fca86f1a90390b7e/tumblr_nw6xmreNcF1st2jj6o5_1280.jpg\" style=\"width: 418px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite decent sales and reviews, this has been a labour of love and not a full-time career, leading me to take a break from comics in 2016 to decide if I wanted to take my comics to the next level. In 2018, I have returned to creating, working on a 60 page standalone comic \"Prince Transylforia\" as well as making minicomics on the side, starting with \"Worse Things\" released in February and many more to come. Creating these comics has been time and cost consuming, and I am forever grateful to the fans that have supported me along the way, so I\u0027ve decided I want to take my comic creating and turn it into a respectable career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/28e03ada1fe0f10701fba8ca9aa59ff7/tumblr_p0hfgwnjMs1st2jj6o1_1280.jpg\" style=\"width: 419px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you pledge to my patron, you\u0027ll gain access to previews of my upcoming comics, brand new digital copies of upcoming comics as they are released as well as my older comics (selection of your choice) as well as custom sketches of anything you could possibly dream of!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also experienced quite a lot in the eight years I\u0027ve been doing this comic thing, and I want to share my advice with upcoming creators, fans and anyone interested in self-publishing comics, so you\u0027ll receive this advice in the form of a blog that you\u0027ll have access to on a monthly basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledging to my Patreon means you\u0027ll receive all these rewards before the general public, as my way of saying thanks for supporting me.
