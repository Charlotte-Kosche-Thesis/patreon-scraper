We\u0027d like to be able to reward them for all the hours of hard work they have put in investigating, interviewing, editing, photographing, and reporting on issues and topics important to Minnesota and national soccer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur advertising on the site and partnership with Brave New Media covers hosting and other operating costs, so every dollar you pledge goes directly to the writers, creators, editors, and other people who have helped make FiftyFive.One the great site it is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy our website, Twitter and Facebook posts, we ask you to please consider contributing so we can continue creating the great soccer coverage you have come to expect from us.
