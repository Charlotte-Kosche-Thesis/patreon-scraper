These stories are predominantly\nfantasy male/male erotica and epic fantasy erotica varying in explicitness,\nfrom those that deal with BDSM and dark themes, to those that are completely\nnon-explicit and don\u2019t focus on romantic or sexual relationships at all. The\ncharacters are queer, some are pansexual, some are homosexual, some are\nasexual. There is always a strong leaning towards careful characterisation, and\nplots that centre on character development and growth. The sex scenes are long,\nand the hurt/comfort is real.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe mainly follow Augus Each Uisge, a predatory Unseelie\nwaterhorse, and Gwyn ap Nudd, a somewhat overzealous War General who has\nexperience at being King of the fae; he\u2019s a hero who needs to learn how to be\nless of a hero. Unfortunately for them (and fortunately for us), they have a\nhabit of getting into all kinds of chaos that creates general mayhem for a lot\nof the fae world and each other. Also they make out.

I like to update regularly,\nand I produce about 250,000-400,000 words a year (this is a conservative\nestimate). I charge per chapter instead of per month, so that if I have a bad\nmonth due to health, you won\u2019t get an out of pocket expense! I\u2019ll also cap\ncharging at four chapters, so if I have a bonanza month, you wouldn\u2019t get an\nunexpected charge! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\nwill generally try and produce two chapters a month, which might be a good\nthing to keep in mind when you\u2019re thinking about how you want to pledge. I also\nlet people know how the writing is progressing \u003ca href=\"http://not-poignant.tumblr.com/\"\u003eon\nmy Tumblr account!\u003c/a\u003e But I have been consistently posting new material\nfor over five years, and have logged over 1.5 million words of original work in\nthe \u003cem\u003eFae Tales Verse \u003c/em\u003ein five years! That is all currently freely\navailable.

Additionally, I have elements of\nmy writing which readers very much enjoy, which traditional publishers can\nsometimes steer away from because it doesn\u0027t always fit the parameters of what\nis easy to market, publish, or sell (such as a single story which is 425,000\nwords in length!) I know folks enjoy it, since the serial format allows you to\nsee very quickly what readers are responding to and what they want. The Patreon\naccount enables me to give folks like yourself who might be willing to\ncontribute a dollar per month, to get a serial that is a little different to\nanything else currently out there. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAdditionally, it\u2019s very difficult for many authors and artists to support themselves\nlong before they can ever officially publish works through any channel! I am on\na Disability Support Pension in Australia, and have a rare, incurable genetic cancer\ndisease called SDHD PGL1 or Hereditary PGL PCC (fun, huh?). In the past this was \u0027under surveillance\u0027 but I do currently have cancer, which entails a lot of MRIs / CTs and occasional PET scans etc. Some of my medical expenses aren\u2019t covered\nby my DSP, because of certain conditions I have that put me into unsubsidised\nareas of care. I cannot currently afford to get some of the preventative\ntreatment I need, and my writing (and to a lesser degree my art) are all I can\ncurrently do to both sustain myself and hopefully make some independent income.\nYour patronage would not only ensure greater peace of mind for myself while I\ncreate, but also help my quality of life overall. It will, hopefully, also lead\nto publication of books in the future! Ideally, I\u2019d like to come off the DSP\nthrough my writing one day \u2013 sites like this are a step in the right direction.\nEven if it doesn\u0027t happen, every little bit counts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u2019s your\nbackground in writing? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nactually am published in short stories under the name Pia Van Ravestein, and\nwhile not specifically relevant to writing, I have also been a published artist\nunder the name Pia Ravenari, and done book covers for authors like Juliet\nMarillier, and internal illustrations for books like \u003cem\u003eShe Walks in Shadows\u003c/em\u003e, which won the 2016 World Fantasy Award for\nBest Anthology. I am an award-winning short-story writer. I have a completed\nuniversity education in creative writing, script-writing and technical writing,\nand have experience as an editor of published novels, including having betaed works\nfor Aleksandr Voinov and Lane Swift. Of course, since you\u2019re getting raw\nmaterial in its early stages \u2013 some of this work will need some polishing\n(though it does go through some edits and betaing before it comes to you!) \u2013\nwhen I move to start releasing works as books; they will be going to editors\nand other professionals in the industry, to make sure you\u2019re getting the best\npossible quality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you do it this way, instead of publishing books? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe plan is to start\nself-publishing novels in 2017! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs to the serials on AO3, I do it because it\u2019s\njust a lot of fun! It straddles the line between original fiction and fandom\nformat (the serial format). It\u2019s a liminal writing world where anything can be\nexplored, without it necessarily having to be \u2018trending\u2019 in traditional\npublishing. I\u2019m not bound by constraints relating to wordcount or \u2018the number\nof sex scenes\u2019 or the many other rules that make up the more mainstream publishing\nworld. I have nothing against these rules and I like writing to them as well, I\njust \u003cem\u003ereally \u003c/em\u003eenjoy the serial format,\nand I know some of you do as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often am I\ncharged? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou are charged \u003cem\u003eper chapter, to a maximum of four chapters a\nmonth, even if I release more. \u003c/em\u003eThis means if you pledge $2.00 per chapter, with no cap, and I post\nfour chapters, then you\u2019ll pay $8.00. If you pledge $6.00 for one chapter, with\na cap of $6.00, you\u2019ll only ever be charged $6.00 for that month even if I post\nmultiple chapters. Payments are processed at the end of the month. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is not a single donation site like\nKickstarter, the idea is that you offer a smaller pledge to offer regular\nsubsidised income for a creative person like myself. However, if you can only\nafford a single donation, you can do this too! Just select that option instead.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNo matter how many times I update, you will only be charged your capped pledge\namount! It\u2019s direct debited at the end of the month, and you can pull out at\nany point. You can also change your pledge amount \u2013 higher or lower \u2013 as your\nlife dictates! This is meant to work \u003cem\u003efor\nyou, \u003c/em\u003eso do whatever feels comfortable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCredits:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBanner artwork by \u003ca href=\"http://sulamoon.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSulamoon / Ursula Dorada\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBanner design by \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/DaniTaillefer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDani from The Dream Argument\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDescription illustrations (i.e. the ones in this part) by \u003ca href=\"http://djinngin.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDjinngin\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledge Icons by \u003ca href=\"http://morbidlizard.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMorbidlizard at Tumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://djinngin.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1197.photobucket.com/albums/aa422/PiaRavenari/Others%20Art/djinngin-gulvi-250x_zps7927da57.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
