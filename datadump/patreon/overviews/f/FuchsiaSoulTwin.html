    "summary": "\u003cblockquote\u003eI create beautiful bags, fashion and paintings.\u003cbr\u003eThank you for making it to this page. The fact that you are here shows me that you care about my creations and are interested in what I\u2019m doing next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003ePatreon helps artists like me to make the world a more diverse colourful place.   I  do this anyway, because this is who I am, but it also offers me feedback about the importance of thinking outside the box. It gives me, besides some well needed love and appreciation, the freedom to not have to question my way of living, due to financial and personal sacrifices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy? \u003cbr\u003eYour support on patreon helps me to grow as an artist and worry less about paying my monthly bills. This would be a huge help to do what I feel I am supposed to be doing in my lifetime on this planet. It frees my time to do what I do best: Creating things. This way, I can bring all those ideas in my head into reality which otherwise stay just - pretty ideas. It removes a huge amount of stress about having to leave this beautiful country  - Greece, wich sadly is in an finacial crisis, in order to make more money to be able to do what I love and have some savings to visit my family and friends from time to time\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is in it for me? \u003cbr\u003eDifferent exciting rewards waiting for you in each support level of your subscription.\u003cbr\u003eI like to convince you to choose one. Even for $1, you have access to all my patreon only posts and get a look into the secrets of how I create a new piece of art.\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to go above and beyond and help me with any of the larger support levels it would allow me to invest in new materials, art or sewing tools, machines such as a high quality scanner \u0026amp; printer, screen printing equipment, a knitting machine, a plotter and much more. \u003cbr\u003eI would greatly appriciate your financial support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to even read all this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout me:\u003cbr\u003eIm a passionate artistic soul, that loves to create new stuff.\u003cbr\u003eFrom a very young age I haved dreamed about becoming a fashion designer.  I was always very interested to dress the human Figure.  In resent years I developed an interest for the Body as a canvas and got into Body and Face Paint. My newest discovery is the art of making Tattoos. \u003cbr\u003eDrawing and painting have been a essential part of my life.   From an early age I went to art classes after school such as pottery, silk painting or sewing workshops. After graduating from highshool I  studied fashion design in Berlin where I lived for 8 years. After finishing University I worked in the German and Canadian Movie industry and in theater departments of Cruise ship companies. In 2014 during a cruise ship contract I met an inspiriering Painter from the Philipines. He encouraged me to pick up the paintbrush again and I have not put it down since. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Situation:\u003cbr\u003eLife always surprises me with new wonderful experiences.   I fell in love with another beautiful soul during a holiday in \"PAROdiSe\u201c as the local people lovingly call it. I packed my stuff and moved to beautiful Greece. On the island I have worked as a seamstress for an interior design company and sewed beautiful pillows and curtains. I like sewing a lot but creating my own ideas is my deepest passion. Financial reasons forced me to get a better paying job and  now I work as an assistant in a little jewellery store.\u003cbr\u003eThis summer I plan to launch my own street business idea wich is a combination of children\u2019s Face painting and the selling of handpainted bags.  They are our new generation and I would love to teach art classes for children and teenagers one day. Passing on my knowledge and wisdom and encourage little humans to create beautiful things with a happy heart is one of my future goals.\u003cbr\u003eDifferent cultures and Travelling is another passion of mine. It brings me, just like creating, into the present moment and whenever I discover a new place,  my senses are open and I am amazed by the diversity that the universe created on this planet. Though after a 4 month study stay in Auckland New Zealand, and a one year work expirience in Vancouver, Canada. Greece is my third none home country where I live right now.  I\u2019m sure that there are many more to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarm regards and lots of Love,\u003cbr\u003eFuchsia\u003cbr\u003e- Pledges are per month\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0I release at least one post per week except on travel holidays once a year\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support every little bit is highly appriciated\u003c/blockquote\u003e"
