    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eWelcome to Fantasysfm!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePublic videos on \u003ca href=\"https://fantasysfm.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://vrporn.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVRPorn\u003c/a\u003e and some on \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fantasysfm/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eReddit\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eMost videos are male POV and features all kind of lewd stuff with models from video games and animes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe software resources I use are all free available on the internet. Source Filmmaker (\u003ca href=\"http://www.sourcefilmmaker.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSFM\u003c/a\u003e) is a 3D animation software by Valve. The models, maps and other stuff can be found on \u003ca href=\"https://sfmlab.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSFMLab\u003c/a\u003e, as well as tutorials on how to start with SFM.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo get a proper experience viewing\u00a0the videos, a VR headset is required and a VR-video-player with loop function is recommended. I use an Oculus Rift CV1 with the free DeoVR video player as it has a lots of functions and is able to play all kind of VR video formats. With the Samsung Gear VR I recommend the Samsung VR-video-player.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho is the\nguy behind Fantasysfm, why is he doing this and how can he afford it?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHi, my name\nis Dave. The theme virtual reality caught my very early on a videogame contest\nin the mid90s. There was this Virtuality 1000CS machine for the visitors to use\nthat fascinated me immediately after putting up the helmet with the displays\nand seeing my own hand in that virtual space moving accordingly to my movement\nin the real space. After that experience, it was clear to me that I will follow\nthe evolution of this technology with great interest. Sadly, the Virtuality\nmachines where too expensive for the mass and later machines and techniques\njust were no serious option due to poor quality (virtual boy, red-green glasses). Nearly 20\nyear after that contest, finally, Samsung came up with his GearVR and Google\nwith his Cardboard as cheap solutions. Lucky I had a Samsung Note4, so I got myself\na GearVR innovator edition and was very satisfied with the quality of the image\nand the head-tracking.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThough the\nhardware was now affordable and powerful enough to get a good immersion in the\nVR world, the adult content regarding CGI videos was for me as video games fan not\nsatisfying at all. After some googling I found out that some of most appealing CGI videos were made with Source Filmmaker (SFM) and to convert them for VR there is \u003ca href=\"https://sfmvr-stitch.neocities.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esfmvr_stitch\u003c/a\u003e, what made me start using SFM to produce VR videos and share them on tumblr.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile \u003ca href=\"https://www.blender.org/foundation/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblender\u003c/a\u003e is used to piece together the frames of the cameras recording the animation. It supports 6 cameras per eye for 360\u00b0 videos. Every camera used records a resolution of 2160p to provide a part of the 8k image generated and taken for further processes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlmost a\nyear ago I started this project. With savings from my previous employment to\ncome up for my ongoing livelihood costs, I was able to afford to invest most of\nmy time in learning on how to use the software needed to make naughty\nanimations and produce VR videos. As I thought it could be possible to get\nenough income from interested backers all over the internet, to make a living. Meanwhile I have to\nrealize that the VR market isn\u2019t big enough yet to give me the support needed\nto go on with this project without making deficit every month, and I\u2019m running\nout of own funds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFantasysfm is going to shut down early next year if the basic cost coverage funding goal isn\u2019t achieved until then. With\nmore backers this can be delayed and stopped after reaching that goal. What you\ncan do to help me continue with this project, is to spread the word about my\ncreations and make some advertisers wherever you can and it\u2019s appropriate.\nPledging more money is of course also always welcome. On my side, I\u2019m making\nnightshifts to improve in quality and runtime of the animations and will bring\nup some improvements on the patron page coming months.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSide note:\nstarting with the name sfm4vr, the change to Fantasysfm was made to get a more appealing name. The new name could be\ninterpreted as \u201cFantasy SourceFilmMaker\u201d for the imaginary fantasy characters\nfeatured in the videos made with SFM, or as \u201cfantastic system\u201d combined with \u201cfrequency\nmodulated\u201d, referring either to the SFM software, that is really fantastic considering\nits content and support provided by the community, or any other software that I\ncould use instead for future projects, and \u201cFM\u201d for the sound that is also good\nto produce with SFM and makes imho a video complete.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
