    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027ve been working very hard to get Disney\u0027s Songs translated into other Languages, even Unique languages that have never had any movie dubbed in YET\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve done organized small fandubs with the collaboration of fantastic people, in languages such as Bavarian, Sicilian, Mirandese, Scanian, Chamorro, etc... But Now, I want to expand the 42 standard languages Disney dubs their movies in, and create new Versions in totally new Languages, (recorded in Studio, with Native Professional singers and Actors). However, the only thing not allowing these versions to exist is that I need some financial support and even $1 would help me A LOT! I totally understand\u00a0if you can\u0027t help me for some reason, but if you want to see dubs in new languages, please, I would highly recommend for you to donate what you can for now and be part of my team! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made some math and I would say that about 30 seconds of an HQ, ready, Movie Version Quality, would cost about 30 dollars, not bad right. Well, that\u0027s about a dollar per second. but if 30 people help me, the price is gonna go as low as 1 dollar per 30 seconds for each person :D Maybe we can get as low as 1 cent, who knows?... :)\u003cbr\u003eThe Languages that I am probably gonna work with are Bengali, Yoruba, Zulu, Italian and German Dialects, Welsh, Belarusian, Macedonian, Marathi, Punjabi, etc...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Thank You"
