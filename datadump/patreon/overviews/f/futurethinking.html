    "summary": "Hi, I am Anthon Botha and I am passionate about the future. Why, you may ask? Is the future not unpredictable? Yes, but at the same time it is not predetermined. We, as human beings, have the capacity to create the future.\u00a0Patreon is about the future of funding\ncreative people. FutureThinking is about creating the futures we want,\u00a0and choosing the desired one for you, your family, your business, your community\nand the world at large. With your participation as a patron\u00a0you will give me an opportunity to continue a\nconversation about the future that I started in the academic world and business \u00a0with you as individuals. Together, we will build a crowdsourcing\nplatform for all of us to learn more about the future and how it will evolve and affect us. It will enrich our thinking, develop thought models that we can take away and apply in our own lives, work, social interaction and community involvement. I thank you as patrons for your interest in the future and for helping me to create this conversation.\u003cbr\u003e"
