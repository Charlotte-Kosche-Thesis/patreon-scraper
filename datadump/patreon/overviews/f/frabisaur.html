Being a thinker, teacher, and creator--as time went by I grew increasingly frustrated with how hard it was to find good tutorial and training content for people trying to learn fighting games. Nothing online was particularly helpful to me and I knew there had to be a better way than this trial and error, bang your head against the wall till you get it method. Enter The Fighter\u0027s Dojo project. Since launching my youtube content I have received SO MUCH support and I can\u0027t thank you all enough for it! After making this content many people have asked for my personal help as they develop as players and I wanted to find the most effective way to do that. That\u0027s why this patreon exists, so I can connect with and help as many people as I can!\u003cbr\u003e"
