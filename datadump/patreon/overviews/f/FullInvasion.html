We originally came together to continue development of Full Invasion 2, but have since set groundwork to take on additional projects in the future. Our goal is not only to create experiences which players enjoy, but to create a community for them to be a part of.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat is Full Invasion 2?\u003c/h4\u003eFull Invasion 2 is one of the only cooperative modules available for the tremendously successful Mount \u0026amp; Blade: Warband by TaleWorlds Entertainment. It allows players to play together with the goal of defeating ever-growing waves of enemies and bosses. The module boasts an incredible number of factions and maps ranging from fantasy to sci-fi which pushes Warband\u2019s engine to its limits.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFull Invasion 2: Amber has been voted as the most popular multiplayer module for Warband a number of times, with nearly 500,000 total downloads across its lifetime.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhy Do We Need Your Help?\u003c/h4\u003eFor a long time, we have worked on Full Invasion 2 with no funding at all. Servers have had to be donated by members of our community, and we\u2019ve invested thousands of hours of our personal time into creating this module for everyone to play for free. We love working on Full Invasion 2 and do so out of a love for both the game and the community  \u2014 this is why we are asking for your help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith support from the community we will be able to invest more time into development, rent larger servers, commission new artwork and assets, hire mappers from the community, and prepare development of Full Invasion 3 for Mount \u0026amp; Blade II: Bannerlord.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause what we do is free and no one is required to support us, we would appreciate it even more if you choose to do so. You\u2019ll be guaranteeing development continues on our projects and that it remains free for everyone to enjoy, whether they support us here or not."
