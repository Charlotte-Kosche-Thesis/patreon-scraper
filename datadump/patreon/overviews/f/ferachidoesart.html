I\u0027m Anthony, a freelance illustrator and character artist huddled up all warm and cozy in my tiny room with a tablet and a dream! I\u0027m from the southern region of the U.S, but I moved up to the PNW a few years back attempting to make that previously mentioned dream of mine a little more tangible. My life\u0027s goal is to become an illustrator full time and to create things that not only entertain, but give others the same feeling of joy and wonder that I have whenever I experience a beautiful new world either through illustration, comics, or games. Of course this dream isn\u0027t exactly unique and it\u0027s because of that that I\u0027ve come to Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I\u0027m putting about twenty hours a week into my art which is far, FAR less than I feel it deserves.\u00a0 This is due to a 40 hour a week non-art related job to keep the lights on and keep my grumpy self stocked in food and insulin. While I\u0027m grateful for every commission I get and every small project I have the privilege to work on it\u0027s simply not enough to sustain myself between monthly bills and medical costs. Which is where you, yes \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0come in you awesome, caring winner of a human you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo lets talk turkey. These are a few things I\u0027m hoping to bring to my patrons in the coming months and hopefully as this page grows so too will this list of goodies and fun times for you all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to an archive of my completed pieces\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWIP\u0027s/Sketches/ Other unfinished content\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatron exclusive raffles for art\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLive art streams for patrons and non-patrons alike!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eArt tutorials ranging from simple shading to color theory to anatomy\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that\u0027s a tiny list of goodies, but hopefully we can build it up together in time.
