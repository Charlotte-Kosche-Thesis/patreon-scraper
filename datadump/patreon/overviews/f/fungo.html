It\u0027s good to support any YouTube creators you enjoy with just a small pledge considering the variable nature of YouTube and their strict monetization system. Because of all the YouTube cuts to all creators\u0027 wages, we have to rely on YOU to fund the entertainment we produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.fungoreview.com/images/header1v2.png\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eI make quality YouTube videos on Souls Lore, No-BS Guides, and Fungo Review. I\u0027m known for videos on the Dark Souls, Silent Hill, and Resident Evil series. Anything horror, basically. I tend to do deep and analytical dissections of video games. I love what I do and it\u0027s the best job I\u0027ve had (despite, of course, the financial issues which brings you here in the first place). I\u0027d love to continue doing this, and, through you, I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.fungoreview.com/images/header2v2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eThis is Patreon, a well-respected site a lot of YouTube creators utilize to gain funding from their viewers. It\u0027s a month-by-month support system. Via several funding methods you can pledge money and it will be deducted in the first few days of every month. Just $1 minimum is all it takes to show your support, and if 100 people pledge $1, then that\u0027s $100! It adds up and that\u0027s what I hope for. Also, this keeps me independent from advertisers and sponsors for good, allowing me to focus more on the content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.fungoreview.com/images/header3v2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eI cannot survive on YouTube\u0027s ad revenue alone - it\u0027s poor. Like any job that you dump countless hours into, you would like some sort of financial security. Without your monthly financial support, I wouldn\u0027t be able to continue bringing content you enjoy as regularly as I do because I would have to get a full-time job, and I would be unable to manage a YT channel and another job at the same time. When I was forced to go out and get a part-time job when YT first started demonetization, I was only able to release one video a month! I am, however, able to bring you four videos a month at the right funding. I struggle to survive to do what I love and have been doing this for a decade. Luckily, I don\u0027t need much to live off of. At $400 I don\u0027t need to work a part-time job to sustain myself, that way I can bring you a guaranteed four videos a month. That money would go into groceries and utilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.fungoreview.com/images/header4v2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eGreat, I knew you\u0027d understand! This has been one long struggle and perhaps you\u0027ll be one step to ending my financial stress. You\u0027d be supporting the good cause of joyful entertainment! I really appreciate any and all support as many other artists on Patreon! And a special thanks to those who have supported me thus far! I promise to never lose sight of my core values, continue working hard, and maintain great, quality content.\u003c/div\u003e"
