Any support will go towards improving the quality of the podcast; equipment, sound packages (voice-overs, theme music) and podcast season artwork. IF we start receiving a fair amount we may resurrect the Let\u0027s Talk Wrestling podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWriting - \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve written for a few magazines (\u003cem\u003eScreen Power, Jade Screen\u003c/em\u003e \u0026amp; \u003cem\u003eMyM Magazine\u003c/em\u003e) and several websites (\u003cem\u003eChris \u0026amp; Phil Presents, MCM Buzz \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eFilms \u0026amp; Swearing.com\u003c/em\u003e). I have access to Comic Conventions in Glasgow hosted by MCM to write up panels and write booklet pieces for their show-guides.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently have access to review movies released through distribution labels; \u003cem\u003eArrow Home Video, Curzon Artificial Eye, Signature Entertainment and\u00a0Kaleidoscope Home Entertainment\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cu\u003eIF supported I can increase the amount of Blu-rays and DVDs I review to include titles from other labels such as;\u003c/u\u003e\u00a0Anime Ltd, Arrow Academy, Lionsgate Home Entertainment, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, Warner Home Video, Studiocanal and Freemantle International (World Wrestling Entertainment).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Full Review Experience \u003c/strong\u003e- When reviewing I normally summarise my thoughts on Special Features. Some labels such as Arrow Home Video give you such a pleura of special features it\u0027s a lot to write about. Through this Goal you can expect an extended-cut of my reviews, the public review and a full breakdown and opinion on every special feature included on the title I review.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am occasionally invited to press screenings for features, but unable to attend as I am missing the suitable funding to cover travel expenses. Any pledges can go into supporting the attendance of screenings. I am only keen to attend film festivals and provide coverage on as many features as they can let me see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do have an interest in extending my ideas for blog posts, extending the likes of my Kurt Russell Challenge to more than just a single page with a checklist - possibly turning it into a series of posts with short reviews on the features etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAudio\u00a0Commentaries \u003c/strong\u003e- we had moderate success with the WrestleMania commentary which was recorded during the PPV and we released the commentary as a MP3 the following day. WWE produce PPV every month and properly financed we can provide more commentaries, whether it is just the big four PPV\u0027s or every PPV it will come down to the amount of support/interest we receive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking to time to read this and I would be in your debt if you supported me in any form.\u003cbr\u003e"
