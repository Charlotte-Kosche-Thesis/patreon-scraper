I\u0027m genuinely concerned with climate change issues and ecology. I\u0027m an intensive gardener, I was raiser by my farmer grandmother and I am tired to hear people say that the planet is fine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI think as artists we have a responsability to communicate through other means than information and that\u0027s why I dedicate my time to creating art that illustrates my approach to ecological issues.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOther than that, I like dogs, goat cheese and the colour blue.\u003cbr\u003eCello is my favorite instrument, fig my favorite fruit and peony probably my favorite flower.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://headtalker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/profil-300x225.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does she do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI paint and I make pots and I write. These activities are what you\u0027ll support if you support me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI make as many open call applications as I can to try and spread my work but I love t particularly collaborate with public institution to spread the beauty and the idea behind my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eClimate change?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eYes, climate change, global warming, ocean depletion, destruction and exhaustion of our global common resources, gaz emissions, the destruction of our planet and our only home.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI create art that reflects on our link with nature or our apparent disconnection from it. About the link between our western vision of happiness and our notion of success through accumulating things and its consequences for the environment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe know the most \"developed\" nations are the biggest polluters too, so why is it so hard for us to care not only in our thoughts but through our actions?\u003cbr\u003eThere are public posts where this is what we talk about, have a look and tell me what you think, see what we can do to make a difference.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe difficulty today is that developing a project for even a small art centre takes months. I did it for a science museum and between the research, the works and the catalogue, it took me about a year of work. I can\u0027t work full time on these projects because they also don\u0027t bring much money in but they matter to me and to the visitors. They inform and they can be a trigger for change.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAccess to art and culture is important, it\u0027s my belief and it\u0027s what I devote my time and energy to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/399cc8_44f51537b4e8470fba5e7fc8fff58235~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_578,h_432,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/399cc8_44f51537b4e8470fba5e7fc8fff58235~mv2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get by supporting her?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIf you become a patron you will be able to follow the slow progress of this project and the others as well as occasional posts about the films I\u0027ve seen, the exhibitions I\u0027ve visited, the good news, the bad news... LIFE. \u003cbr\u003eIf you click support on this page, you will support an artist, this is different from a kickstarter project, you will trust me to work on projects that I think are worth working on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI write posts I\u0027d say twice a month in average, sometimes more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can put a single dollar and it will help me and I will be grateful. Also note that we can fine tune rewards if you have something in mind I\u0027m totally open to that. Some people like to chat for example or skype their creators, that\u0027s likely something I\u0027d enjoy doing, be creative and do let me know what would make you feel like it\u0027s a fair trade. \u003cbr\u003eYou can stop your pledge anytime, it is not complicated and it won\u0027t take ten clicks. \u003cbr\u003eGive it a try, connect and see if you like it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/399cc8_2a18fc70f8c5417f802beb61a1f69170.jpg/v1/fill/w_555,h_432,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/399cc8_2a18fc70f8c5417f802beb61a1f69170.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is she on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eDoing this alone is difficult, financially but also emotionally. I need people to support me and make me think I am doing the right thing, that art is important to you too and to the hundreds of anonymous that will get to visit the installations and see the paintings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing an artist is absolutely great. It is! It is the best thing that I know, and I am not thinking about going back to a \"non artist\" life (employee with a monthly salary). But people think because we love our work, we don\u0027t need money. That\u0027s where there is a little misconception :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love our work, it doesn\u0027t make it a hobby. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur work takes a lot of time, there is no waiting for the sublime inspiration, it\u0027s work, it is to continue to explore new paths as well as repeating what you have learned to stabilise a skill. \u003cbr\u003eIt takes a lot of faith, a lot of engagement, a lot of motivation, to receive dozens of negative responses to your propositions and to still keep going. \u003cbr\u003eIt takes a lot of support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is why I am on Patreon, crossing fingers that you read til here and did not get bored! \u003cbr\u003eI need your connection and I need your support to carry on those really cool projects. I need you to reassure me that I can do it, and as practically cold as it sounds, I need the financial support to pay for the material, the frames, the oil, the shipping of the works, the time I spend working on it that can\u0027t be spent working on something else...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/399cc8_c3f4fbcfe5a14be69e90ba5e5373f4a0.jpg/v1/fill/w_516,h_432,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/399cc8_c3f4fbcfe5a14be69e90ba5e5373f4a0.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant to read more?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eSure, here you go:\u003cbr\u003eMy works generally look hazy. Hazy landscapes or seascapes or hazy flowers. It is not really abstract nor is it figurative and I think that debate is pretty pointless.\u003cbr\u003eMy work\u00a0expresses a vision of beauty that that I find in harsh wild natural environments. A sense of beauty that I think we\u0027ve lost. I\u0027m a big hiker, I walk in the wild and I like it to be wild, as it should be, no path, signs, painted stripes on the rock. It scares people nowadays. We\u0027ve lost touch with nature, lost interest too for a lot of us, we\u0027ve lost this ability to contemplate the beauty where it started and I think we\u0027ve lost a sense a flow and it hurts our society. I talk a lot about that through my paintings, the place the humans have carved for themselves in nature and that restrains them, what we have lost as we evolved, \"the way of nature and the way of grace\" as Malick puts it. How we construct our identities by defining an edge between us and the world, through our capacity to transform it and shape it. \u003cbr\u003eWhat does it mean today to live our lives when it implies to destroy our environment and the source of life itself?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis is the question that preoccupies me.\u00a0I use images of the land and the sea to investigate this question. Blurred landscape, as blur as our connection to nature has become. I paint pictures of piers that humans have build and that are torn down by the elements... I paint memories of landscapes that will soon be lost if we don\u0027t take serious actions today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have read til here, I\u0027d really like you to connect. Looks like you\u0027re a patient reader.
