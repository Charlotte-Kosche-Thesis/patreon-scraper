I make Let\u0027s Plays. And I think they\u0027re pretty good.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to do games justice, which means that my LPs are often quite different from one another. Lots of commentary, barely any commentary, LPing with friends, LPing alone, barely any editing, or lots of editing that may go largely unnoticed; whatever it takes to present the game in the best way it deserves to someone who either doesn\u0027t have the time or enough of an interest in it to play it themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI think that\u0027s worth at least a dollar.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do have simpler LP ideas in mind, but, generally, I spend anywhere between two and ten hours on each video, from recording to exporting, longer projects typically involving more of the little details that make the experience better overall. I\u0027m okay with that, but I have more ambitious LP projects planned that would take even more time, and resources. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s vain to say that I make good Let\u0027s Plays, and I think people enjoy them. If you think the work I put in is worth the end result on each video, feel free to send a dollar or more my way\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePay if you want, and if you don\u0027t, don\u0027t worry about it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t plan on not making videos if I don\u0027t get any donations, and unless I got a pretty significant amount of money, I couldn\u0027t guarantee videos would come any faster than I put them out. This Patreon is a tip jar right now, and hopefully can be something more as time goes on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really want to stress how much it would mean to receive your support, though. Even a dollar shows me how much you think of my work that you\u0027re willing to pay for it. If you don\u0027t want to, or can\u0027t support me financially, that\u0027s okay as well. You can share my LPs around and hopefully help them reach more people and increase my chances of finding people who want to support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s all I\u0027ve got. Thanks for giving this a read-through; hopefully I\u0027ve convinced you to part with your pocket change, and if I haven\u0027t, then I hope you enjoy my LPs anyway!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-ft\u003cbr\u003e"
