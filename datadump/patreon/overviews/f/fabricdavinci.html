    "summary": "Born and raised in the notorious Englewood neighborhood on the Southside of Chicago, Darren Buchanan discovered at an early age that the world had so much to offer outside the unfriendly confines of the Hood. Always curious and independent, he traveled to Los Angeles alone at 8 years old to visit his older sister. In this moment, he caught the travel bug and has been exploring the world ever since. As the youngest of five, Darren\u0027s desire to fit in with his much older siblings contributed to his fast development. In elementary school he would look at his older sister\u0027s high school books and as the runt in the family, he developed a love for competition and playing the role of the underdog--traits still present to this day. Despite humble beginnings, Darren would attend the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he\u0027d graduate with Departmental Distinction in Sociology en route to completing a Dual Degree in Political Science as well. After graduating and working in public policy for a year, Darren set off for the London School of Economics where he\u0027d earn his masters in philosophy and public policy. With political ambitions in tow, Darren moved to Southeast China while awaiting a decision from the Country\u0027s top law schools. After being wait listed at top institutions like Penn, Harvard, University of Chicago, etc.; Darren realized flaws in his approach. He had done everything in his power to be a perfect cookie cutter law school applicant--holding in many talents. The disappointment of rejection and the epiphany of an alternative means of accomplishing his goal of social change gave birth to Fabric da Vinci: The Modern Renaissance Man. As Fabric da Vinci, the mission is simple: Educate, raise awareness and bring about social change through fashion, music, art, entertainment and social entrepreneurship. With this said, we would like to thank all our patrons for their support in making this passion project a reality."
