They come from a background in film and video production and strives to turn the channel into a new form of entertainment on the Internet. PD is passionate about social political matters and believes that media is the way to enforce real change. PD is particularly passionate about feminism and female representation in lead roles, the normalization of queer/LGBTQ people in media, and the positive portrayal of Asians and Asian Americans in leading and supporting roles in stories.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTobi\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4632/39423612225_97b67bdebd_c.jpg\" style=\"width: 645px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cem\u003eConsidered one of the \"OGs\" on the channel, Tobi has been around since the early days of Form of Therapy contributing as a reactor along with many others. However, when PD axed the original reaction show, the entire cast was gone but he made sure to find a place for Tobi because he saw potential in her. While she has gotten much too busy for regular reactions, Tobi will be debuting (again) on the channel this Spring 2018 via the new talk show \"Seoul \u0026amp; Spirit\". She is friendly, ambitious, a social chameleon, a talented dancer, and a true lover of K-Pop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuyen\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4649/39423603785_0b50460679_b.jpg\" style=\"width: 646px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cem\u003eBefore PD axed the original reaction show with a full cast, he was scouting for new talent. After one audition PD saw something special in Quyen and even though he wound up cancelling the main reaction show, he decided to keep Quyen around with the belief that she would be a good on camera personality. She will also be debuting on the channel this Spring 2018 alongside Tobi in the new talk show \"Seoul \u0026amp; Spirit\". Quyen (pronounced Quinn) is more soft spoken, gentle, but never one to turn down trying new things. She is an avid DAY6 fan.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
