    "summary": "My name is Fraser Ronald (given name Fraser . . . always\nconfusing) and I write genre fiction (mostly fantasy, but some science fiction\nas well) and design role-playing games. My little company Sword\u0027s Edge\nPublishing has produced \u003cem\u003eSword Noir\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eKiss My Axe\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eCenturion\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eNefertiti Overdrive\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eSword\u0027s Edge\u003c/em\u003e. You can find out more about my game publishing at the \u003ca href=\"http://swordsedgepublishing.ca/\"\u003eSword\u0027s Edge Publishing website\u003c/a\u003e.\nI have had fiction published in \u003cem\u003eOn Spec\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eBlack Gate\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eFantastic Stories\u003c/em\u003e. You can read more about my fiction writing and reviews at my personal blog, \u003ca href=\"http://swordsedge.ca/\"\u003eSword\u0027s Edge\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve also been a co-host of a modern gaming podcast and am now a co-host on the Ottawa Game Publishers podcast which you can find at \u003ca href=\"http://accidentalsurvivors.libsyn.com/\"\u003eThe Accidental Survivors\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven when I\u0027m not crowd-funding new RPGs, I\u0027m constantly working on projects, and this Patreon is a way for me to share those projects. I have RPGs that have been written but not released and adventures that I\u0027ve completed for both my home groups and conventions that I\u0027ve never shared. If you have found my previous work of interest, I believe you\u0027ll enjoy what I\u0027m cooking right now. The adventures are written for my RPGs, but because those games are simple, abstract systems, they should be relatively easy to port into other systems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor this Patreon, I will be releasing RPG adventures, short RPGs, and genre fiction. Some of the adventures will be designed for convention play, meaning they are one-shots that run about four hours. Other adventures will be longer stories designed as campaigns. The RPGs will be under 50 pages, with simple mechanics geared toward supporting narratives - think more \u003cem\u003eFate Accelerated \u003c/em\u003eor \u003cem\u003eApocalypse World\u003c/em\u003e than \u003cem\u003eDungeons \u0026amp; Dragons\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eWarhammer\u003c/em\u003e. The genre fiction will be mostly fantasy short stories, but I am also interested in pursuing some serial fiction of novel-size, much as my hero Alexandre Dumas pere did with his works like \u003cem\u003ethe Three Musketeers\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ethe Count of Monte Cristo\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, this Patreon has seen the release of the adventures \u201cLawless\nHeaven,\u201d \u201cFace \u2018Splosion,\u201d \"For A Few Sword\u0027s More\" and \"HardCASE\" for \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/223753/Swords-Edge\"\u003eSword\u2019s Edge\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, \"Hispania Ulterior Motive\" and \"Vandalissimo\" for \u003ca href=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/124649/Centurion-Legionaries-of-Rome?src=Patreon\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCenturion: Legionaries of Rome\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \"Judged\" for \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/159386/Nefertiti-Overdrive\"\u003eNefertiti Overdrive\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eBroken Tiger\u003c/em\u003e, a supplement for Nefertiti Overdrive, and \u003cem\u003ethe Wall\u003c/em\u003e, a role-playing game.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/q0j5Hlv.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eComing in May will be an adventure for\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/159386/Nefertiti-Overdrive\"\u003eNefertiti Overdrive\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e called \"Daughter of the Sun,\" which follows the death of King Tutankhamun as his queen, Ankhesenamun, seeks to maintain her independence and avoid marriage to the vizier, Ay. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I hope I can count on your support.
