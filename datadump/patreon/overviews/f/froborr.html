    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Near-Apocalypse of \u002709\u003c/em\u003e is a multi-year, episode-by-episode analysis and study of the DC Animated Universe, a 1992-2006 metaseries of six to eight (depending on how you count) cartoons, most with multiple seasons, and four movies. The goal is not to create a traditional guide or critical study, but rather a psychochronography; I am less interested in the sort of information that could be looked up on a wiki, and more interested in exploring the ideaspace within which the show functions: the ways in which it is a product of its times, its politics and philosophy, works and events which influenced it, and those which it influenced in turn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see, the project is quite ambitious, likely involving three or four times as much content, research, and time as the similar projects I\u0027ve already completed (or will have completed by the time this project starts going live): \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mlpomo.blogspot.com/p/readers-guide-very-soil-madoka-magica.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Very Soil\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e (on \u003cem\u003ePuella Magi Madoka Magica\u003c/em\u003e) and \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mlpomo.blogspot.com/p/new-readers-guide.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy Little Po-Mo\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e (on \u003cem\u003eMy Little Pony\u003c/em\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe immediate purpose of this Patreon is to raise money for incidental expenses that come with any project of this sort: buying copies of the works I\u0027m studying, mostly, not just the episodes (some of which, such as \u003cem\u003eJustice League\u003c/em\u003e, are readily available; others, such as most of \u003cem\u003eStatic Shock\u003c/em\u003e, are not), but also of any supplementary materials I need to cover. For instance, I already know I\u0027m going to need to watch some of \u003cem\u003eGargoyles\u003c/em\u003e, read some \u003cem\u003eStatic Shock\u003c/em\u003e comics, and research apocalyptic themes in pop culture of the Long 1990s. Some of that I may be able to find ways to do for free, for example at libraries, but some will cost money, and this Patreon will help pay for that. I also want to move from the free, get-what-you-pay-for blogging platform I\u0027ve been using to my own domain; that too costs money for hosting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the longer term and more blue-sky... well, I have a full-time job, but many people in my field freelance. If I can start making enough money on a monthly basis through the Patreon and/or book sales to switch to part-time freelancing, that frees up more time to work on \u003cem\u003eNear-Apocalypse\u003c/em\u003e, which means new entries come out faster. This second goal is what my milestones are about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
