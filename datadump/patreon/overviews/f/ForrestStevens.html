    "summary": "Thank for for checking out my campaign!\u003cbr\u003eExcited to have you here. Money is tight with the projects I am working on and every dollar helps me create more, and give back to you, the viewers.\u003cbr\u003eI would like to take the time here to talk about what my goals are and the reason I chose to ask for monetary help. \u003cbr\u003eMy fundamental morals and goals are always to teach. Presently I have done this by showcasing alternative dwellings weekly on my youtube channel, in hopes to teach people how to pursue a different and personally passionate way of life, if that is living in a van, building a tiny home, or living off grid. I still plan on doing this, but I plan on doing so much more. \u003cbr\u003eRecently I started a podcast called \"Travel for Nothing, Come Home Rich\" Once again this is me trying to fill the gap and educate on the subject of budget traveling and making money remotely. \u003cbr\u003e In August 2018 the plan is to Hitchhike to Alaska from Vancouver island. My plan is to make loads of youtube videos showing the best way to travel by the thumb, and guerrilla camp. This will be a massive collaborative project where people can be a part of it in so many ways, anyone can come with me for a leg of the journey if they are willing to help with editing, filming, and creating. This is perfect for the Youtuber, instagramer, writer, photographer, musician, and creative, Those who join and contribute will receive credit and partial equity share in thee final project. You will be helping create a new documentary called \"Hitchhiking\" which explores the rise and fall of the cheapest way to travel. This is a collaborative effort because I will be reaching out to my audience for places to stay, WiFi, adventures, and rides. It is collaborative because you as a doner get exclusive views into the trip, while also being given the opportunity to become sponsors and executive producers of the youtube videos, and movie.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I learned a lot from making the feature length movie \"The Reality of #Vanlife\" and one of my biggest take aways surprised me. Because it was about camera gear. Often people will say that camera gear is the last thing you should worry about when you are creating something, and that the content should be the number one concern. I agree with this sentiment however even if it is not the number one concern it still needs to be addressed. I got help filming the movie by my friend Gabe, he had better camera gear than myself. however I still ended up having to shoot a ton of stuff on my own with a different camera. this produced problems that even keen editing was unable to correct. The film was still made, and it was made at the low cost of 170$. but not without problems with audio and video that are apparent in the final product.\u003cbr\u003e I want my next movie to be better. I want it to have better story telling, be more engaging, have more beautiful imagery, have consistent video color profiles, and clean uniform audio. and I want it to be more accessible and transparent in it\u0027s creation.\u003cbr\u003eThe trip itself will cost very little, as that is the point as I explore the idea and teach how to \"Travel for nothing\" however I want to go fully equipped with the best travel film gear I can possibly bring.\u003cbr\u003eNone of the money raised will be used for travel expenses. It will only be used for Film making equipment for us to be able to tell this story and create the hitchhiking movie that needs to be made.\u003cbr\u003eHere is the full list of technical gear needed with approximate costs in Canadian dollars. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSony A6500 - 1600$\u003cbr\u003eexternal SSD - 200$\u003cbr\u003eChrome book - 200$\u003cbr\u003eCloud space - 20$\u003cbr\u003eMavic Air - 1200$\u003cbr\u003eLav Mic - 100$\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to make the best film I can make. I have the skills, now I just need the gear. As you can see it will roughly cost me just 3,000 CDN to get the equipment I need to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m reaching out to you today for help doing so. If you have old gear you want to donate contact me at depictedreality@gmail.com I\u0027ll accept things I need to resell even.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I am also accepting payment through Paypal at the above email.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is also some specific camping gear that will help us with power generation while traveling, insuring our batteries are topped up so we can capture the footage we need. I didn\u0027t include these in the crowd funding campaign because I don\u0027t want to ask to much of the community. If you do have these and would like to contribute them you can do so by mailing them.\u003cbr\u003eHowever for these items primarly I will be looking to companies to sponsor a video or two for the cost of the items. If you represent a company that produces some of these products or ones like them please contact me, or select the sponsored video tier. If you send me these without sponsorship fees included, they will get an affiliate link in all the youtube travel videos which will generate tons of sales, and will be featured naturally as we use them in our videos. For dedicated review/unboxing or mentions, details will have to be discussed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBiolite Campstove 2 \u003cbr\u003ehennessy hammock (or equivalently well built hammock tent)\u003cbr\u003eWater proof Ponchos\u003cbr\u003esmall and medium Water proof bags\u003cbr\u003ecompact sleeping bags\u003cbr\u003ehigh quality compact wool sweaters\u003cbr\u003eAction cameras\u003cbr\u003eWifi extender\u003cbr\u003ecompact cooking set (pots/pans)\u003cbr\u003ebackpacking water storage\u003cbr\u003eDried food products\u003cbr\u003ePortable battery packs\u003cbr\u003eHeadlamps and Flashlights\u003cbr\u003eAnd email for something you think would be useful that isn\u0027t on here. \u003cbr\u003eDepictedreality@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd most of all!
