    "summary": "Welcome to the Patreon for False Swipe Gaming! First of all, thank you so much for taking the time to even view this Patreon page! Any support towards False Swipe Gaming helps immensely! False Swipe Gaming is a channel devoted to creating sleek, concisely edited gaming videos that aim to inform and entertain. Part of what makes it so tempting to sink yourself into the competitive scene of a game is the wealth of information and trivia behind them \u00a0- but sometimes, it can be hard to find all that knowledge in a consolidated source. I want to share the deep histories and intricacies behind my favorite games (Pokemon and Smash Bros. mainly for now but I\u0027m down to branch off into other things) in an easy-to-digest and enjoyable format.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do we need this Patreon?\u003cbr\u003eFSG wants to use the extra money from this Patreon in order to commission more artists, editors, and writers in order to make content faster and make more series! We have a tons of ideas but what we really lack is time. Having more people on board gives us more time! Now I could try to get people to do work for the channel for free but I think that is messed up and good work should be properly compensated. Until recently, I have been doing everything on my own (research, writing, editing, etc). I can afford to pay a writer and a sound person to work on the main series for the time being but like I said, I have A LOT more ideas that I want to bring to life, I just lack the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi! My name is Kellen. I\u2019m a grad student going to school for editing in film production. I\u2019m looking to use my editing skills to make content on something that\u2019s been with me forever. I\u2019ve been playing Pokemon since I got Pokemon Red for my 4th birthday and it\u2019s been a dedicated love affair ever since. I hope I can tap into some of that almost 20-year old obsession and spread it with all of you. I also love Smash and other competitive games and one day hope to make FSG a hub for everything you need to know on other competitive games. With your support, I will be able to accomplish just that while hanging out with you, the dedicated FSG fan base, in the process. ANY support helps and I am of course eternally grateful to you for even considering.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again Thank you so much for your consideration!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the best,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKellen\u003cbr\u003e"
