By 2017 we\u2019d pretty much reached the end of our tether with this way of life; not feeling like anything we were doing \u003cem\u003ereally mattered\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eLike so many of our generation we felt a bit numb by it all. We\u2019re more connected than ever before but we\u0027re also more lonely, more time-poor, and more stressed and, to top it off, we just did not feel like our work was ever \u003cem\u003ereally \u003c/em\u003emaking a positive difference. So in July 2017 we decided to quit that life in search for something more meaningful.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY VOLUNTEERING?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/h2\u003eFeeling that we\u2019re not really making a difference in the world was one of the biggest drivers for our drastic lifestyle change. It really matters to us both that our time should be spent helping others and being catalysts for the change that we talk about so often in our down time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOutside of the daily office grind and the money-driven career paths, there is some truly inspiring hard work going on - and work that really is changing our planet for the better (even the smallest of projects). These projects, organisations and charities are largely under-supported and rarely get shouted about.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFigures show that volunteering in our age group is dying out. In the UK, the average amount of time spent volunteering amongst 25-34 year olds plummeted by 60 per cent between 2000 and 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re on a mission to bring our enthusiasm and skills to some amazing projects, people and organisations across the UK and Europe. We want to inspire others to get involved in volunteering projects -especially young people- and we want to give a platform to the projects that deserve to be shouted about!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT SORT OF VOLUNTEERING?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/h2\u003eMid-2017 we packed in our jobs, packed up our home, hopped in our car and hit the road to European volunteerdom.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re really passionate about the environment, sustainability, and organic food, and so far that\u2019s led us to projects from helping small-hold organic farmers in the Alps to planting trees in Snowdonia.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe want to be able to make a real difference on projects of all sizes, across the UK and Europe and this is why we\u2019re looking for your help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY SUPPORT US?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/h2\u003eWe\u2019ve stripped our outgoings to the bare minimum to support this mission, but unfortunately money still talks. We pick up freelance work where we can to keep us going, but the more of that we do, the less volunteering we can actually commit to.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe found that in essence we\u2019re attempting to live a more traditional life referred to as \u2018Living in the Gift\u2019. It\u2019s a natural mode of exchange that pre-dates money. People give gifts of time, skills, possessions, food, accommodation, for free - without expecting anything immediately or directly in return. We think there is something really wholesome in gift giving, as it moves the \u2018gift\u2019 from one person to the next, and naturally those who need the \u2018gift\u2019 the most will tend to end up with it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo this is how it works: if you like our mission, you can \u2018gift\u2019 us a small monthly amount here on Patreon, which we will then use to gift our time and labour to worthy projects for free. Everything we get from our supporters goes into a pot specifically to cover our volunteer lifestyle - such as fuel, food, insurance and equipment. The more we get, the more volunteering we do, the more people we can help and the bigger the projects we can get involved in. Maybe one day we\u2019ll be able to run volunteering projects of our own!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYou can gift us as much or as little as you like (there are suggestions on our Patreon page but you can gift any amount at all), and we\u2019ll share our updates and stories with everyone and anyone regardless.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eYou can find out more about us and what we\u2019ve done so far on our website \u003ca href=\"http://freetobimble.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efreetobimble.com\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/freetobimble\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einstagram.com/freetobimble\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWe hope you can be part of this story, and we thank you so much for your support!\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.freetobimble.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
