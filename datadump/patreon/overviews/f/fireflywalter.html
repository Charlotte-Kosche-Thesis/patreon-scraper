You could say that I am deeply in the throes of an on-going, PASSIONATE love affair with the Muse.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe source of inspiration for my work is the transformation of the self as a vehicle for transformation of society, the mystical journey, and of course, Love. Music is a way to bring us out of our heads, open up the heart, and access the world of myth and symbol to which all human beings are connected. I bring more than a decade of experience leading and crafting theatrical and ceremonial experiences for groups, into what I call \"prayer-formance art\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I share my music, I have people coming up to me thanking me for the deep place my music opened within them. This is inspiration for me to continue generating, crafting, and sharing. Patreon is a fabulous way to stay connected! Your donations, no matter how big or small, really do make a difference! It helps create a compelling case that my art is valuable and is something that can support my livlihood that offers something beautiful to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am steadily improving the quality and quantity of the content I offer.  As a patron, your donations support in allowing me to devote more time to recording, video production, upgrade equipment/technology (oh the things I could create with a mic and a macbook!!), and even record my 2nd CD! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Firefly walks in many worlds, and through music bridges heart, mind, and spirit. She has been exploring sound her entire life, from training in classical clarinet to self-taught guitar and piano, folk singing, campfire storytelling, contemporary folk music, devotional chanting, and group singing. She weaves in poetry and symbolism of the mystical path and the hero\u0027s journey into a fresh synthesis of original compositions, spoken word performance pieces, inspirational speaking, sound healing, and workshop facilitation. Her favorite word to describe her creative expression is \"prayer-formance\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up in Northern California and now living in Ashland, Oregon, Firefly has deeply immersed herself in a movement of community building. Music for her\u00a0 is a fantastic vehicle for speaking to the changes taking place within the collective heart \u0026amp; psyche that is manifesting as transformational festivals, the human potential movement, new technological developments, social media, innovation in ecological sustainability, spiritual community, and new way of relating with self and others through the radical expression of unconditional Love. \u003cbr\u003e",
