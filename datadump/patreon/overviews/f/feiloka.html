    "summary": "Hey thanks for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeiloka is the stage name for me, a Sydney (AU) based musician and singer songwriter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy real name is Shasha, and I\u0027ve loved music since before I was born. Did you know that foetuses can hear and register music? Yep I was one of those according to my mum.\u003cbr\u003eAfter trying out a few instruments throughout my life: recorder (no seriously), keyboards, french horn, I ended up falling for the guitar. In 2010, under the heavy spell of \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eAna\u00efs Mitchell\u0027s Hadestown\u003c/span\u003e folk opera, I began to turn the poems and prose I had been writing since I was 15 into songs. And then new songs came. Suddenly playing more than cover songs and learning the guitar felt exhilarating and meditative. I felt purpose driven even though I had little clarity other than \u003cem\u003e\u0027I need to write and sing this dammit!\u0027\u003c/em\u003e. And in 2015 I decided that fear of the stage wasn\u0027t going to hold me back any longer, that I will pursue my music dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003esongs\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e that are\u00a0folk and pop (ish).\u00a0I make regular \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eposts\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e about my adventures being a working musician/freelance writer. I also make \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003epodcasts\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e that tie them together nicely. Subscribe via\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/feilokas-podcast-a-show-about-freelancing-and-music/id1375416332\"\u003e iTunes\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/feilokas-podcast-a-show-about-freelancing-and-music?refid=stpr\"\u003eStitcher\u003c/a\u003e .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I chose to focus on music at a later stage in life (after all I\u0027m a post graduate), I don\u0027t have that rich network (yet!). Releasing on Patreon is a fantastic way for me to connect to and hear back from the wider community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, what does being a patron mean to you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs one of my patrons, you\u0027ll get first access to new creations (weeks in advance!), including MP3s which you\u0027re free to keep forever. You\u0027ll also get access to exclusive \u0027patron only\u0027 discounts, tickets, commentaries, where I delve right into the writing process, see how my songs come to life, and hear them breathe like a dragon! Or maybe a sleepy cat!\u003cbr\u003eThere are a few tiers you can choose from, depending on the perks you like the most. And you can control the amount you pledge each month by setting a maximum amount. You can pause at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s the serious thing though ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy main goal is to share my experiences through song and words as a woman, a migrant, and a person of colour \u2013 with the hopes that by doing so, I can contribute to musical landscape, to keep it diverse and most of all, to reach many who are like me. I cannot NOT do this basically!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI aspire my music to be a positive outlet for anyone out there who can see themselves through my experiences and can relate through my stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy other goal is to meet the financial needs of being a working musician, such as production and equipment running costs, as well as paying the rent. And because getting paid for the things I create encourages me to create more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNothing will stop me from creating more music, because it is who I am and without it, I am a depressed unhappy sad blob.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much again for being here! I look forward to connecting with you and sharing with you this amazing, hopefully long, journey everyday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ex Feiloka\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003ePS.
