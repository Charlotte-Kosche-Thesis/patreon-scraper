    "summary": "Dear Friendsy users,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCongratulations on finishing up another year of school, and we hope you\u0027ve had a great time using Friendsy! \u003cstrong\u003eWe created this page to give you an update on the status of our company and what that means for you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFour and a half years ago, Friendsy started with the vision to create a way to help college students meet the amazing people around them. In the time since then, \u003cstrong\u003ewe\u0027ve grown from a dorm room dream into a venture-backed startup, and together, we\u0027ve created over 3 million matches between hundreds of thousands of college students. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve offered Friendsy completely free to you and all of our users since our inception because we truly believe a product like ours should be available for everyone, but we\u0027ve been under increasing pressure to start generating revenue. This is why iOS users have seen ads in our app for the past couple of months, and why we introduced a premium version of Friendsy with highly coveted features last week! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately, it\u0027s not easy to monetize products like ours, and although we\u0027ve made several attempts to, our operating costs greatly exceed our revenue. In fact, we ran out of money in March, and we\u0027ve been personally funding all of our costs for the past couple of months. \u003cstrong\u003eWe\u0027re a team of college students and recent graduates who have been working day and night to give you the best Friendsy experience possible, but we also have servers to keep running and rent to pay.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 140, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u0027re writing to see if you\u0027d be willing to help us keep Friendsy alive at your school a little longer by either subscribing to Friendsy Pro, or by making a recurring or one-time donation to us here.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eNo pressure. We just want to be fully transparent with you that if we\u0027re not able to raise the funds necessary to keep the company alive (~$4k/month purely on infrastructure), we\u0027ll likely be shutting down at the end of this month. If you choose to donate to us for providing this service to you, we\u0027d really appreciate it. If you make a donation of $3 or more, our team will write you a witty compliment, and if you make a donation of $20 or more, we\u0027ll send you a special gift! Either way, we would like to say a big thank you to you for being a part of our Friendsy dream, and you\u0027ll hold a special place in all of our hearts forever \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nLove,\u003cbr\u003e\nTeam Friendsy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n(friendsyapp.com/team)\u003cbr\u003e\nP.S. If you have any questions or want to chat about this, feel free to email us at admin@friendsyapp.com\u003cbr\u003e"
