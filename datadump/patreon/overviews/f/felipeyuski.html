It have 100 pages , while to the other 2 that have 500 to 600 pages. It was created as a closed story, with no need to know the past stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Why 2 to 3 minutes episodes?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Doing it alone, isn\u00b4t possible to do long videos in sequence. The prodution of 10 minutes animations, with only one person doing it everyday non-stop can take over 7 months to get done. So, shorter episodes will let me do various with bigger quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What will be the periodicity of episodes?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: The intention is to be each 2 months, sometimes tey can come with a month of difference.
