I\u0027m a 31 yr/o, white, Canadian, pro-intersectional, critical feminist and PhD student blogging about feminism, risk society, rape culture, slut shaming, racism, ableism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, heterosexism, and much more. \u003ca href=\"http://feministingforchange.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCheck me out!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, I\u0027m also on disability leave from school with fibromyalgia, IBS, interstitial cystitis, GAD, extreme depression, and social anxieties and I\u0027m in need of some financial assistance to survive :( \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy research is in the social construction of crime and deviance from an intersectional feminist perspective but it\u0027s been slowing down to a crawl over the last few years bc of my increasingly worsening illnesses. To cope with this, I\u0027ve been spending more and more time on tumblr and other social media to distract myself from the pain and other horrible symptoms I experience. I\u0027ve also found tumblr to be a fabulous way to keep up to date on current events and (perhaps most importantly) stay involved in cyberactivism (YAYAYAY!!!). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe big problem is that bc I\u0027ve not been able to work on my dissertation, I\u0027ve had to go on disability leave to stop the PhD clock so I don\u0027t run out of time. I also haven\u0027t been able to apply for any grants to support my work because they don\u0027t fund students on disability leave. Furthermore, I obviously can\u2019t get a job atm bc I can hardly even take care of myself. And since my boyfriend makes over $1000/month I can\u0027t get any social assistance... seriously. Between all my meds, special diet, cats, rent (\u0026gt;1000 btw), utilities, food, and so on and so forth, I\u0027m broke and scared on top of all the pain and troubles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor that reason, I\u2019m here asking that if any of my lovely followers feel compelled and able, I would love it if you would consider pledging a monthly donation to my blog \u2013 any amount would be highly appreciated! For larger pledges (25+), I would also consider doing small pieces of writing, blog posts, or editing/proofreading for anyone interested (I\u2019m also amazing at APA btw). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can pledge as much or as little as you want and stop at any time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also give a single pledge via e-transfer or paypal. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(email me at feministinforchange@gmail.com for more details)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease consider pledging!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArtwork by \u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/thejoyfulfox\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethejoyfulfox\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e"
