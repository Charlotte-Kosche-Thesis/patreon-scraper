     "description": "\u003cdiv\u003eThe more funding I get through Patreon the more animals I will be able to feed. Patreon is the first and most important source of income to help homeless animals. I have been randomly helping many animals over the last few years i have never really bothered to set up a donation page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWith your donations we will be able to buy more\u00a0food this is our first priority, I\u0027m currently looking for a new store room, so i can store rice and dry food in a spare room so the rent needs to be covered on that which is around\u00a0US$170 per month.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently looking after a sick pitbull reversing her cancer and treating her dermatitis which has started to reverse and her hair is coming back to normal again. Many of the lumps have gone away so I\u0027m really happy about that. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI normally roll from dog pack to dog pack and if I see an animal I try and help it doesn\u0027t matter if its a dog or a cat. \u00a0As have taken home 3 homeless cats before. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe following prices roughly are for dogs only.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFood \u2013 Around US$20 every day.\u003cbr\u003e20kg Pedigree Dry Dog food is US$35 USD a Bag.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eRice= US$20 to $30 per 20kg Bag\u003cbr\u003eChicken is $4 to $5 a kilo need 2 kg per the second day\u003cbr\u003eWhen money flow starts coming in I will be switching over to healthier food like veges etc. Chicken and rice is the cheapest thing.\u00a0Dog Treat sticks US$3 per large pack.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNeuter = US$35 per Operation (we need 4 females done in one pack as the Thai lady that looks after one pack has 15 dogs already and doesn\u0027t want any more.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe just lost 4 of our pups and its heartbreaking.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eEar Clean Wash = US$8\u003cbr\u003eFoster home rent and live-in carer \u2013 US$520 per month\u003cbr\u003eAntiCancer Treatment \u2013 US$50 treatment\u003cbr\u003eVaccinations \u2013 from US$6 to US$9 each\u003cbr\u003eTick treatment \u2013 US$8 to US$10\u003cbr\u003eVitamin C tablets (to treat distemper) \u2013 180 tablets last 2 days and costs US$26\u003cbr\u003eVitamin C injections US$40\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eUS $9 Organic stevia to stop Lyme disease.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI can make Colloidal Silver now so i just need the supplies to make it. So those fees have come down as it was around $15 a bottle for 500ml. I might need to upgrade to a commercial unit down the track so I can get a consistent\u00a0silver rate happening.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOnce i save up enough money the plan is to get a second hand pick up ute so i can pick up animals that are injured because right now i don\u0027t have a motorbike with a side cart and I need something safer for the animals because they tend to freak out on the motorbike. I do have access to a car to borrow but not all the time. Already had a few accidents the last few months involving a few dogs, one being run over by a car which i never found the driver and another paralysis and another dog i had to get put down due to distemper virus. Once i get a pickup then the rest will be spent on monthly ongoing food and medication for animals and vet bills. Everything right now is coming out of our own pocket and things are not getting easier without setting up donation page this is the first time working on donation page we will appreciate any donations publically or privately.\u003cbr\u003ethank you\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e",
