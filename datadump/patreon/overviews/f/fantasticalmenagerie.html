This is something I have been wanting to create for a while, I\u0027ve just been lacking time. But a new year brings changes, new challenges, and opportunities to grow. I am Kim, of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/fantasticalmenagerie\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFantastical Menagerie\u003c/a\u003e. I work in polymer clay and mixed media, to create unique sculptures and pieces of wearable art. I have been creating since 2004, and working with clay since 2011. I love clay because it allows me to sculpt what I see in my head. Unfortunately, pencil and paper will only get you a basic stick figure. Currently, you can see my things on Facebook, Etsy and in person at art shows and ComicCons within 12 hours of North Carolina, USA.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI live with my husband and two pups in Pleasant Garden, NC. Pleasant Garden is just south of Greensboro, near some of the best barbecue places in the state, as well as a flourishing local art scene, and some really great shows within a short driving distance. When not creating, you can find me playing with my dogs, near the ocean, or reading a good book.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am hoping that Patreon can help me dedicate more time to actual creating and sculpting. I spend a lot of time on paperwork, on travel, and everything involved in making my art a business. This platform could help streamline some of that, and connect me with other artists and patrons that I might not find elsewhere. A large goal is to meet up with Sea Monkey Cove Trading Co at least every six months, for joint projects and inspiration.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
