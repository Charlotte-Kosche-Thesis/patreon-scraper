We know we have some work to do so let\u2019s just get on with it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEating is an agricultural act. Our buying power determines what farmers grow and we create demand with every bite that we take.

We\u2019re providing information on how to take control of your own personal agriculture, connect, and decentralize our food system, bring focus towards the qualitative value of food, and grow as much of it as we can! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe do this by using growing \u003cstrong\u003emethods that are beyond organic\u003c/strong\u003e.

We\u2019re reaching far less than 1/10th of our follower audience. Facebook demands money to reach our followers. Follow us here, like \u0026amp; share, and we will reach more people \u2014 or we can capitulate and pay to boost important announcements. Help us shift our Facebook audience here, because you actively want our content, why should Facebook hold it ransom? In the meantime, we will need to let our audience know we\u0027re moving.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEquipment and Software.\u003c/strong\u003e We put out money for equipment and software, but to improve quality and speed up processes, we need one-time purchase power for better equipment and software.

Imagine what it would be like if we could free up even more of their time! Oh, mama-mia!! Just freeing up Criss (who surprised us with her range of skills and talents!) for more content production \u2014 or eventually even delegating editing work (below) and so Criss can do quality control, and producing more of her own content (creating books and courses on herbs, making herbal preparations, wildcrafting, sprouting, cooking, chicken raising, etc.). More videos with the \u201cSoil Doctor\u201d Evan Folds. His information teaches people how to grow amazing healthy soil for the most nutrient-dense food so that every yard farmer can be successful! And Marsha\u2019s Plot to Plate, Food Truth Education. Healing one forkful at a time! Help support us, and watch out for a Farm-A-Yard content avalanche!
