    "summary": "Sup y\u0027all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking a moment to peep my Patreon page. I\u0027m Fluent, and I\u0027ve been a huge fan of role-playing video games for a long time. I was around 5 years old when I played the original Zelda on NES and have never looked back. I\u0027m 32 now, so that\u0027s 27 years of RPG nerding!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(In b4 \"But Zelda\u0027s not really an RPG!\" :P)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why Patreon? I\u0027ve been working on a little YouTube channel for several years. It is dedicated mostly to RPGs, and while I play other genres, too, I like to focus on role-playing games for the channel. I\u0027m a big fan of old-school style RPGs but also new stuff, too, and will play any and all of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to make some money on Patreon for a few main reasons. They are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. So I can pay someone to edit my videos. I can upload a heck of a lot more videos that I\u0027ve already recorded if I had help editing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. To buy better equipment to make higher quality videos. I\u0027m using a Shure M58 mic but could definitely improve my PC to make more 4K Let\u0027s Plays and higher quality videos in general. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. I think I was actually the first person to ever do a \"Let\u0027s Play in 4K\" on YouTube! Don\u0027t quote me, but go check out my Oblivion LP! :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. To buy new games and basically just have extra money to improve my channel in different fun and exciting ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo there you have it! I\u0027m looking forward to making a lot more quality RPG videos to add to the 850+ I already have uploaded. With your help I can make the channel even better. Let\u0027s increase the subscribers from 1500 and get cracking on some really dope videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for reading. I\u0027d really appreciate your support, even if you just watch the videos or like and comment. I appreciate you all who already do that, too! Peace family!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Flu\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
