    "summary": "You stopped by? Thank you. That kinda makes my day!\u003cbr\u003eSo, who am I? Well, I\u0027m a writer trying to make my way in this world with my little stories in tow. They all need good homes, but good homes are hard to find. See, my stories are warrior stories. They deal with brotherhood, bravery, goodness, and overcoming evil. They deal with deep darkness pierced with small shots of light. My children\u0027s stories lean towards the \"Brothers Grimm\" style of finishing off the villain. My YA stories focus on kids shouldering adult responsibilities, not on their boyfriends. In all this\u00a0soberness, I mix the most beautiful words I can find, a\u00a0generous scoop of\u00a0tantalizing setting, a pinch of steampunk, and a drop of whimsy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon, I have two goals that you can help me with:\u003cbr\u003e1) \u003cstrong\u003eFind my Readers:\u003c/strong\u003e If you have enjoyed my stories via my blog, Facebook, or Twitter, come let me know. If you love my longer YA novel and want easy access to updates, rough drafts, ARC\u0027s and more, this is the place to be. I want to know who you are, dear reader, and I want to know what you want to read.\u003cbr\u003e2) \u003cstrong\u003eWork:\u003c/strong\u003e Right now my husband is getting ready to go to seminary. I would love to bring in an income doing something I love, and still work mostly from home. Your support, your sharing, can make this possible. I know it\u0027s not going to be easy, but this is the long term goal. By signing up, you are helping fund a seminary family. You are also helping me move one step closer to making writing my part-time job instead of a hobby. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best thing you can do for me, beyond all this, is read. Read my stories. Give me feedback. Share them with your children. Share them with your families. Once you have them, print them off and give them to your young readers. Do you want to see\u00a0more like Bruce and the Daisy? Do you love\u00a0The Texas Cousin Adventures? Let me know.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Thank You for your support, I\u0027m going to give you access to the Birthday Faerie Stories I\u0027ve written for all my nieces and nephews. These are short stories of young boys and girls facing down magical enemies, finding new friends, and being brave (of course). For those who can commit more, there are opportunities for you to be a character in my story, receive a signed copy, and other treasures. Please visit my \u003ca href=\"https://faerie-stories.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e to learn more about me, read my rambling writings, and link up on the rest of my social media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I have 100 patrons, I\u0027ll face my fear of the camera and do a live reading of one of my stories. We\u0027ll take a poll and see which one everyone wants. Before that point, there are some other fun goals you can help me reach.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write warrior stories, and warriors need a warm hearth to come home to. Will you be that hearth?"
