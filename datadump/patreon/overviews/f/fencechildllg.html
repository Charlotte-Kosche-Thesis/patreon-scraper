    "summary": "Greetings LLGs and people of the world! I am a variety Twitch streamer who goes by the moniker of FencechildLLG, AKA \"Fence\" or \"Ryker\". You can find my channel\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/fencechildllg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003ehere\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0My mission is to create a haven for all and reach out to those who feel misunderstood or out of place and create a community that isn\u0027t just about coming together to joke or goof off, but will also be there for you and care for you like family. The Fence is a place where individuality is both encouraged and appreciated. I am a mental health advocate and work towards raising awareness for mental illnesses and educating through first-hand experience as well as providing a place where those who wish to share and talk about their own experiences with mental illness absolutely can without any fear of scorn or judgement.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a writer, poet, and musician, all of which I wish to share with the world. Through writing, music, and video games alongside my support group, I was able to overcome many of the barriers my illness placed before me, and I learned to cope and manage my behavior as somebody with Bipolar Disorder. Now as an adult I struggle with it in new ways, but upon recognizing what got me through it the first time, I wanted to provide that same system of support to others as well as be someone to relate with. In doing that, I hoped to create a community; a family; of loving, caring souls who had open minds and hearts towards the world and people around them. Well I\u0027m ecstatic to say that we\u0027ve created that, together. The LLGs of The Fence are some of the kindest and most generous people I\u0027ve ever had the pleasure of meeting. I see it everyday when someone comes in with a real problem and they rally to help this person. We\u0027re there for our fellow man, and to me, that\u0027s part of what living is all about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Fence is the name of our channel, and our show has a strong focus on viewer interaction. Each day I get to know my viewers better by asking a new Question of The Day where they can share about themselves and get to know one another. Another feature of our channel is the exclusive Item Shop! This shop ran by our friendly Moogle allows viewers to use their hard-earned Gil (our pseudo-currency) to interact with the stream in a variety of ways such as choosing which game I will play for an hour, extending my stream session by an extra hour, creating your own bot command on the channel, entering into giveaways and much more! We are live six days a week and each day has it\u0027s own theme such as Terrifying Tuesday where we play horror games or Thoughtful Thursday where we ask a hard-hitting question that challenges viewers to think critically.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I\u0027ve started a Patreon account is to offer my audience an opportunity to help fund these efforts as they do take a large amount of time and energy. I never saw myself as an entertainer or public figure, but I thought that through Twitch and my love of gaming and it\u0027s community, I could make a positive impact on the world and give back some of what was given to me. I would love to do this work full-time and reap the benefits of it as a career. Having seen how I\u0027ve touched lives already only makes me want to do more. With funding, I could also expand my efforts and reach out to communities in bigger ways than before through organized events, merchandise, meet-ups, presence at conventions and more!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me, what I do and for visiting my Patreon page! I greatly-appreciate your interest and hope to see you soon where you are One among The Fence."

     "about": "I am a livestreamer, writer, and mental health advocate. My goal is to support those who feel like they are alone and provide a consistent source of guidance and positivity. I do this through the power of gaming and it\u0027s ability to bring people together, in conjunction with livestreaming technology to create a fun, friendly, and interactive online atmosphere in which one can appreciate video games, offer/receive support to/from others, and feel like they belong all from the comfort of one\u0027s PC or device. Together with my Keepers of The Fence, I host a family-friendly show instilled with good moral values and flowing with positive energy that can be appreciated by viewers of all ages. I promote free-thinking and self-actualization through our Questions of The Day which allow viewers to share their thoughts and experiences and in turn, offer others an opportunity to broaden their perspectives and learn from each other. \u003cbr\u003eMy show is hosted on Twitch at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/fencechildllg.\"\u003ehttps://www.twitch.tv/fencechildllg\u003c/a\u003e which you can follow me on and experience what it\u0027s like for yourself. \u003cbr\u003eIf you would like a more personable experience with less chat delay, you can also watch and participate in the show on the Beam platform at \u003ca href=\"https://www.beam.pro/fencechildllg\"\u003ehttps://beam.pro/fencechildllg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI strive to make a positive impact in the world and create a haven with The Fence (Our community \"home\") where everyone feels accepted and like family while raising awareness for mental illnesses and the struggles of those who suffer from them. The Fence is a place where you can share your burdens with people who are genuinely interested in your life and care about you. You never have to go through it alone. Together we can make a positive change in the world through the power of love, gaming, and harmony. This is the mission of the Limited Liability Gamers.
