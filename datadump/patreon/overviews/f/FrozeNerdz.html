It means the world to us that you have taken the time to learn more about our Patreon.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon will collectively support the Frozen Nerdz Podcast, the Epic Questions Podcast, The Frozen Nerdz Report, and any other projects that may arise! With the support of this Patreon, you will be directly supporting the creation of future content funded and directed by you the Patron on the show!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon has been created by Epicinasnity and Kilroy who have been podcasting about Blizzard Entertainment games since December 2013. Between the two of us, we have had over 200 podcast episodes recorded and published, over 50GB of data downloaded by millions of fans worldwide! And without you, the show would have not been possible over the years. Because of you we have been given the chance to attend multiple BlizzCon\u2019s with Media Passes where we were invited to VIP Meetups, given the chance to speak at different fan created panels at BlizzCon, and much much more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrozen Nerdz has been solely funded by the creators of the show, but now we want to take it to the next level and that\u2019s where you come in. Over the years we have been asked by countless numbers of listeners of the show on how they can directly support the show. We\u2019ve taken prize donations or just shrugged it off not having a way to directly collect financial donations for the show. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, thank you so much for taking the time to check out our Patreon and we look forward to having you as a future patron of the show!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have additional questions, or would like to talk to us in private about our patreon, please contact us via email (\u003ca href=\"mailto:IceBox@FrozeNerdz.com\"\u003eIceBox@FrozeNerdz.com\u003c/a\u003e). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNerdz out!\u003cbr\u003e-- Epicinsanity \u0026amp; Kilroy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are the Frozen Nerdz?:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe Frozen Nerdz is a Blizzard Entertainment discussion podcast that started on January 28th, 2014. On the show, we cover the Blizzard Arcade, StarCraft, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, Diablo, Overwatch and World of Warcraft. Every Tuesday, we release a new episode highlighting important news topics, our weekly Top 5list, our Blizzard Entertainment discussion topics, as well as featuring a Blizzard Arcade (StarCrade) game each episode. But we are more than just a podcast, we are also getting our feet wet by creating YouTube videos, and looking to branch out into other areas of video game content. We have already recorded over 200 episodes, over 350+ hours (close to 75GB of audio) of audio podcasts already, and we are not stopping there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Frozen Nerdz is hosted by Kilroy and Epicinsanity. The two started out together on Epic Questions, a World of Warcraft Q\u0026amp;A podcast, and moved over to Frozen Nerdz after having a burning desire to talk about more than just World of Warcraft. Between both hosts, we are actively playing World of Warcraft, StarCraft, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch and Diablo. We raid together two nights a week, and record our podcast together on Sunday nights. We release new episodes on iTunes, Stitcher, etc. every Tuesday morning!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the Epic Questions Podcast?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe Epic Questions podcast started at the beginning of 2013 by Epicinsanity to answer World of Warcraft questions from the community. After 45 long glorious episodes, the show went on hiatus in order to focus on Frozen Nerdz giving Epicinsanity and Kilroy the ability to talk about all Blizzard Entertainment games. In 2016, Epicinsanity decided to bring the show back with a different twist. Instead of just answering World of Warcraft questions, he shifted the focus of the show on answering all Blizzard Entertainment questions. On the show Epicinsanity answer questions from YOU the listener on the games that you are currently playing in the Blizzard Entertainment universe and also includes a personal topic from time to time. You can find new episodes of Epic Questions on iTunes and Stitcher every Thursday!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEven before the creation of Frozen Nerdz, we had been contacted by numerous listeners wanting to support the show. Since we haven\u2019t had any formal way to track, or reward those that have given to the show, we wanted to create a Patreon in order to give back to those that take the pledge to give back to us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot everyone understands the behind the scenes process of podcasting. So here is a quick breakdown on how it works for us for each episode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order for our episodes to into the hands and ears of our listeners, we upload them to a web host server to be stored. When you download an episode via iTunes/Stitcher, you are downloading it directly from our web host. In order to have this storage, we pay a monthly service fee in order make that possible. Over the years, this fee has been covered by the hosts of the show, and will continue to be covered even if the Patreon isn\u2019t successful. Currently, our monthly costs include: Web hosting, web domain fees, web security, and podcast hosting. The total of these fee\u2019s is around $100 per month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to keep the podcast focused 100% on Blizzard Entertainment games and not interrupted by hearing from our latest sponsor, we\u0027ve decided to start a Patreon. Patreon gives listeners a safe and convenient way to help cover those costs while receiving rewards in return. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven with the pledge of $1 per month, would mean the world to us. If you break it down, it\u2019s $0.25 per show or $12 per year. You can pledge for $1 for one month, or $1 per month until the end of time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if the Patreon isn\u2019t successful?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe creation of Frozen Nerdz content will not change. Nothing with the show will change, besides the possibility of advertisements, no matter the success of this Patreon. If we raise $0, or\u2026. OVER 9000! nothing will change with the show. We will still release a new Episode every Tuesday. Epicinsanity will still try to release new episodes of Knights of Ebon once every leap year, new episodes of Epic Questions as often as possible and new videos on YouTube when we have the time to create them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKilroy and Epicinsanity will continue to work their 40+ hours per week jobs and have no intentions of stopping that anytime soon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if there is extra money?:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEach and every dollar raised via Patreon will be put right back into creating video game content. Once the bills have been paid, the rest will be funneled right back into the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we reach a milestone goal, any extra pledged funds will be saved for future month\u2019s expenses. If we receive a sufficient amount, we would use it to upgrade our equipment, purchase additional giveaways, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat the money will NOT be used for?:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNot a single dollar will be used for anything outside of the show. For example, we will not be buying Christmas presents for our family, new toys for our pets, or a year\u2019s supply of RedBull for Epicinsanity. After we receive our payments from Patreon, we will be releasing a monthly newsletter which will include a transparent financial statement showing Patrons exactly how the money is being spent. Our main focus is to be 100% transparent with our Patrons with our finances to show that the money is being spent in a effective way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have made it this far, we want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for taking the time to read everything about our Patreon! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards Explained:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat are the \u201cFrozen Friendz?\u201d: \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor just $1 per month ($0.25 per show), you will gain membership to the Frozen Friendz!

Come join us as we bring new points of view, in a not so standard format; to the games, the worlds, even the handheld ones; that you have all come to play and love\u2026 AND maybe a few you haven\u2019t even tried yet!\u003cbr\u003eWe cover every Blizzard Entertainment game on the market, what can we say\u2026 we have a thing for the cold! We actively play World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, Diablo 3, Starcraft 2, and beyond! But the fun doesn\u2019t stop there. Each week on the show we play our featured Steam Game, as well as playing a game in the Blizzard Arcade, or what we like to call it, the Starcade. From time to time we will also venture onto the Indie gaming scene to cover the latest news and games that may catch our eyes and ears.\u003cbr\u003eSo if you are looking for more than just a podcast and want entertainment like you are sitting in the same room as the hosts, check us out. But we can\u2019t promise we will stay on point, or that one of us doesn\u2019t sing a song or two while we record\u003cbr\u003eThe Frozen Nerdz podcast is hosted by Kilroy \u0026amp; Epicinsanity, who were previous the brains and operation behind the Epic Questions Podcast. EQP was a World of Warcraft Question and Answer podcast that covered all topics World of Warcraft related. No question went unanswered and no listener went unheard. They covered things from what glyphs were to violence in video games to crazy off the wall questions ignored by most other podcasts. After 45 Episodes, Epic Questions came to a close\u2026 and these two Nerdz forged the podcast\u2026 The Frozen Nerdz.\u003cbr\u003eYou can find us on Itunes, Stitcher Radio, and Hipcast every Tuesday morning.
