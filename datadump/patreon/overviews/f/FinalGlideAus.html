Patreons get exclusive access to information via an exclusive web site and are able to ask me direct questions which I answer via an exclusive online sessions. If you want me to continue doing what I have always been doing over the last 2 years then I am grateful for your support. I like to stay independent from various manufacturers so I can be honest and free to do and say what I like.  That means no sponsorship money coming my way. \u00a0My personal morals are very important to me and that is why I choose the direction I do.  Thanks again.

     "about": "I consider myself to be an FPV enthusiast/ambassador. I am a founding member (co-presenter) of Rotor Riot, a skilled quadcopter pilot (racing and freestyle champion) and am highly sought after as a technical advisor to a wide range of component manufacturers. My one aim in this hobby is to help people to develop their skills in any way I can. I do that by ensuring that, as an true ambassador of the mini quad hobby, and that when I speak/advise/review about products or components, I do it with complete honesty. I will never ever hype anything up in order to gain a commercial advantage. I always publicly disclose UP FRONT if I am being paid commission or sponsorship money by a commercial entity when I talk about products. Many of the products I have had a hand in designing/ tuning/ developing I actually use myself every day I fly - frames, propellors, motors, flight controllers, backpacks etc. I refuse to use my reputable name to make money simply because of my celebrity status. I am not employed as such but instead earn a meagre income working as a consultant/advisor/R\u0026amp;D developer for drone component manufacturers. I have recently returned to a passion of mine - gliding - and intend to impart some of my gliding skills to my followers. If you wish to support me please do so through my Patreon account.\u00a0I value my Patreons highly and want each to know that they have an open line to ask me any questions at any time - about FPV, about coping with depression and about gliding.",
