    "summary": "Welcome to the From the Pit Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, thank you for listening to our show and, at the very least, being interested enough to check out this page! From here on out, this is going to be the heart of this project, where we hope to not only receive enough funding to keep this show afloat, but eventually take it to even greater heights. And realistically, the only way we can do that is with help from (highly attractive) listeners such as yourself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur primary goal is simple, and it always has been/always will be the same: we want to bring you nothing but the biggest, baddest, gnarliest bands in the underground heavy metal, hardcore and punk scene (with a few good beer suggestions thrown in for good measure). We do this because, when you get down to it, we\u0027re really just a group of guys who are truly passionate about extreme music. If our show sounds to you like a bunch of guys just hanging out and shooting the breeze about the latest tunes, that\u0027s because it is; we just decided to throw mics into the mix. But while this kind of thing comes naturally to all of us and we love doing it, keeping up this level of commitment can be a challenge, especially when cash is king and, like us, you don\u0027t have much of it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings us back to you, the listeners: this is us asking for your help. Yeah, we said it; we aren\u0027t too proud to admit it. We want to keep bringing you the loudest, craziest, nastiest tunes we can unearth, making sure that all the hometown heroes don\u0027t stay in those hometowns. Any and all contributions you\u0027d be willing to make will mean the world to us - you\u0027d be part of this show\u0027s lifeblood, and for us, that\u0027s pretty significant. Thank you for listening and, we sincerely hope, donating!\u003cbr\u003e"
