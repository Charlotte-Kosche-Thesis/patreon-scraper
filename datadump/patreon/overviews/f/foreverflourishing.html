Women continue to be met with overwhelming levels of inequality at all major societal intersections, yet we still fight relentlessly for change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we fight for change and the dismantling of oppressive systems meant to keep us small, how are women simultaneously supposed to ensure that we are flourishing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis the question we were created to answer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Solution\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eForever Flourishing is all about honoring, celebrating, and championing women. We believe women are the shit. We also believe that all women - no matter their age, race, or ideology - should be vocal about their greatness and work towards self-actualization, even while fighting to smash the various systems that bind us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlways...in all ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLaunching in early 2018, Forever Flourishing will be a one-stop shop of soul nourishment created for women by women offering community, online courses, merchandise, a podcast and much more - all created with the goal of keeping women fueled and supported as we navigate our journey through this society...because we all deserve to flourish.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eOur Planned Work\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommunity\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eCommunity, in general, is important to the health of all individuals but it is extremely important to the health of women because womanhood inside a society with such inequality can sometimes make women feel isolated and alone.
