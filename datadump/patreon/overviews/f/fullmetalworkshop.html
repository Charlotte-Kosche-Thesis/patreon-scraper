You get to decide if you want more Kepler\u0027s Ark, Celebrity Wine Bible, or any of our other IPs that we love so much! And having you all on one amazing platform will make delivering exclusive content to you much easier for all of us. \u00a0And last, but not least, we want the majority of our content to be free!
