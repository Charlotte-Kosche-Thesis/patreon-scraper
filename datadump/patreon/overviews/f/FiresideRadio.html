    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eFIRESIDE\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is an audio drama podcast that harkens back to a time when radio was a place where folks told stories of epic proportion. The show is set in the small town of Hamilton, a place filled with high tech research and future thinking innovators. Our show begins with Alex and Angie, Hamilton natives with no technical experience who are tasked with starting a radio station from scratch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are planning on producing a new episode every two weeks for a total of 13 episodes for the first season. We are hoping to bring more seasons down the line as well as bonus content and extra and more stories, as time and money permits.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon will provide funds for paying our actors, graphic designers, and potentially a composer down the road. We will also use the money for equipment upgrades, to pay for our RSS hosting and our web hosting. With enough funds, we hope to have multiple FIRESIDE projects. We think we have created a very interesting world and would love to expand it, but we need your help! \u003cbr\u003e"
