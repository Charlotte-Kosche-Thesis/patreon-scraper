I am the Food Emperor, the faceless poet who helps you get laid with my amazing\u00a0recipes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhen I have an idea for a recipe, I try and experiment and try again until the result is as scrumptious and luscious as I expected.\u00a0Have you ever prepared a tasteless dish? One that leaves a bad after-tastelessness? This will never happen again if you follow my advises. You will not be disappointed. So far, my videos are in Polish and Italian, but I am planning to make videos in some other languages in the future. However, the written recipes on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.foodemperor.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e are in English, so everybody can have a try at cooking them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be able to present my videos to you, I of course first need to film them, edit them, and publish them. I am sure you can imagine that I spend more time than I actually have doing all of it.\u00a0My channel is taking me more and more time. If I have to take the time to make my videos, unfortunately it has be to the detriment of something else.\u00a0Since, as far as I know, you can\u0027t offer me time, the idea would be that I get to make time on my various obligations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the time component, I regularly need to put my equipment up-to-date. By equipment, I mean my filming and editing material as well as my kitchen appliances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy would you support me on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess you already know the concept of crowd-funding. It is when someone has an idea of a project but doesn\u0027t have the money to realize it, and people give money to finance the it. The concept behind Patreon is the exact opposite: the idea is that people can support an \u003cem\u003eongoing \u003c/em\u003eproject and help it improve.\u00a0It is a platform that emphasizes the bond of trust that exists between content creators and their audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore supporting me, you should ask yourself these three questions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0Do you think that the job I do\u00a0\u003cem\u003ejustifies \u003c/em\u003eyour support?\u003cbr\u003e- Do you \u003cem\u003ewant \u003c/em\u003eto support me?\u003cbr\u003e- Can you\u00a0\u003cem\u003eafford \u003c/em\u003eto do so?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust to be clear, if one dollar is more than what you can afford, if it costs you more than what you are ready to give, do not hesitate: don\u0027t do it. It has to be sheer volunteering. You can also choose to only give once instead of a monthly basis; it is perfectly understandable and there would be no hard feelings from me. Regardless of whether you can or wish to contribute, my channel is free. The absolute best thing you can do for me is just keep watching my videos and cooking my recipes yourself (plus maybe sharing my videos).\u003cbr\u003e"

That\u2019s what this site is all about, me sharing my passion for food. I\u2019m tired of food critics taking into account the premises, when all I want to know is if the steak was lean and the cook knew how to prepare his sauces. If you\u2019ve ever been to a top rated restaurant, only to find that behind the beautiful facade there\u2019s an incompetent chef, you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. Not to say that good food can\u2019t be served in beautiful places, some of the world\u2019s best restaurants have both. I\u2019m just saying that for once, the reviews of my site will not take into account anything but the food. Speaking of food\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFood is subjective as any art. There is no universal tongue all can or should follow. Instead, look around for different cooks and food critics, and eventually you\u2019ll find a favorite with whom you share your preferences. If you share my taste for the good, this is your one-stop to all that\u2019s tasty. The restaurants I recommend, the recipes I cook and the products I buy are all my personal favorites.\u003cbr\u003e",
