I currently work in the video game industry as a 3D generalist (the swiss army knife of 3d artist). I love what I do for a living and I\u0027m very lucky to be where I\u0027m at...seriously! Before that I worked for a research department at a school dedicated to game development, where I got to develop behind the scenes tech but also help students learn the inside ropes of programs like Maya, Zbrush and a few others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut as much as I love the 3D world and everything that comes with it, I love to draw, always have. Started as a kid, haven\u0027t stopped and it turns out not even all the coolest tech and computer programs in the world can get me to stop doodling. It\u0027s crazy and I fail to understand it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast year I started a little series on Instagram called \u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/fangledmelon\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#daddoodles\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e that I absolutely love doing. They chronical the daily escapades of my almost two year old son and help me cope having to spend so much time away from him for work. It\u0027s been great so far!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut why, Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an amazing community, and with your support, you would help me turn my dad doodles into a daily comic strips encompassing all aspects of being a dad in the late 2010\u0027s. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also be working on an eventual romantic/comedic graphic novel about my life growing up as a twin, in a three bedroom/one bathroom house with 8 people and how my wife and I\u0027s friendship blossomed after she kicked me in the balls...Instant connection.\u003cbr\u003eTo top if all off I\u0027ll be turning my illustrations into posters and prints!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your pledge (no matter what) you\u0027ll get my undying thanks and a huge supply of fun, lighthearted happy drawings (with the occasional disturbing flesh eating zombie fangly watermelon thrown in every once in a while).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf this really takes off I will take a dive into the 3d world, but with a focus on you, my patron. That means tutorials, break down vids and files for you to pour over.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
