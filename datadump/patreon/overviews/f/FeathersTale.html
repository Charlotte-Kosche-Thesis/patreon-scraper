    "summary": "Hey everyone! So many of you who follow me on Youtube of facebook know who I am and what I am trying to achieve here in Tanzania for the children. For those of you who don\u0027t, in brief I am a volunteer aid worker if you like, but now I am a little more than that, as i am the fGuarfian of over 100 children here too! Not all biologically mine of course! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I want to make clear, i still do all of this as a volunteer, and always will. I don\u0027t want to be paid for what we do here, I have no need to be, there are people around us daily who need things like food and shelter, much more than i need some numbers being popped into a bank account!....\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e....but to be here alone incurs its own costs, such as missionary and work permits at $1000 a year, and a flight to see our families back in Europe once a year, (we do miss them a lot naturally). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne other thing most of you know, is that in the last 3 years i have become the guardian of over 100 children! and with it my journey in life as a Father has begun in a big way it seems! :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI love my children, and I always will... but as a father who is a volunteer, I dont earn anything to treat them. Our donations are most often used on things like medical care, housing, and food for people here.... things that are essential for life if you like. So, I never feel comfortable with the idea of treating the children, but I would love too!\u003cbr\u003eFor instance this year our 35 boys who lived on the streets, who all come from very traumatic backgrounds... I would love to take them to the national parks to see the animals (as for all they live in Tanzania, all they have seen is the hectic unsanitary market streets they grew up on) its not a fortune for a Tanzanian to visit a park, its very cheap in fact! But we would need to hire some vehicles to do it is where the cost comes from... Thing is these things could be, and will be very healing and i hope, motivating for the boys to begin working toward a future they want, instead of dwelling in the past they have had.\u003cbr\u003eNormally like any father i would work, and save and then take them... but my work is unpaid, so I cant afford such treats for them at present naturally...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is what I would use my Patreon for... I dont want to pop it in the bank for a rainy day, as most days is a rainy day for someone around us here... we just want to use it allow us to cover the costs of us being here externally from the donations for the children, so i can carry on saying 100% of what is shared goes directly to the children we are trying to help, or the Tanzanian staff we employ (most of whom are from poverty also too varying degrees)... and lastly, to let me treat the children with days out, or perhaps the odd movie and popcorn night and so on... I feel they deserve that after the starts they have all had in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who have never heard of me, below is a little of what we do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp to now using social media we have built (and are building) Feathers Tale Childrens eco village... an off the grid communitythat is home to over 75 children, more than half of which have special needs ranging from cerebral palsy, to blindness and aspergers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI also opened a rehabilitation center in the local town for street involved children, to get boys back of the street and into a safe home where they can receive education or training to get themselves back on track in life...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also have a childrens fund supporting over 1100 children out in the community with anything from food, shelter, clothing and education...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have other side projects too, such as creating washable sanitary pads at a vocational training center we opened to teach children how to be tailors or seamstresses. The pads allow girls to attend school who otherwise would not when menstruating!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly we have an animal rescue shelter with 70 dogs in it!! This happened kind of by accident next to the childrens home as dogs are very badly treat here... but we do have an open door policy at our mission, 2 legged or 4! :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo these are our core projects, and I make youtube videos for all of them as often as i can...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never set a goal here, as i felt anything that goes over what we need for permits and a flight would go on the children anyways, and with over 50 coming into our care in just the last 1 year, I presume that in another year we\u0027ll have more than i can guess at ! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who already follow Feathers Tale and I, and for those of you who suggested i go for it an open a Patreon, thank you for your continued love and support. Be it prayers, the kind and loving comments and messages you leave... or indeed sharing a little something to help us do what we do...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeathers Tale is built on people sharing with the children and our vision for a better way of life for all our children.... I always say it, but we really cant do a thing with out you guys, so we are as always forever grateful for helping to make our dreams \u00a0reality here in Tanzania...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSharing can and does change lives... You just need to watch our youtube to know that :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove, light and gratitude from Feathers Tale everyone :) x"

     "description": "Hey guys, so with Fritzi and I expecting our first baby, and as you all know we are not earning anything from the charity, we have had to accept that to live our lives, and still be able to see our families, we need an income for the 3 of us to stay connected to our families in the UK and Germany.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo here it goes!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFlights will be $3300 per trip for all 3 of us, plus we need accommodation also, as our families have no space! We try to use Air BnB but its still around $60 a day. This soon adds up of course! and with 2 trips a year, it comes to around $9000 a year... not including food etc\u003cbr\u003eWe then have our permits, which to do what we do in Tanzania we must have a Resident Class C permit, costing us $2000 a year for the pair of us. Then we have medical insurance, which not surprisingly is quite expensive for Tanzania for a English/German combination of spouses! That is $400 a month, so $4800 a year.\u003cbr\u003eThat puts us on $17800 a year just to be in Tanzania with insurance and visit our families, we then need clothing, and baby things (hoping we can get some donated from your lot to save buying any! :) ) and of course we need money for emergencies, just in case we need to fly home for sickness, or loved ones, and for family time too. In July 2017 my mother had an accident and broke her back (\u0026lt;g\u0026gt;shes\u0026lt;/g\u0026gt; doing well now :) ) but this was a difficult time for \u0026lt;g\u0026gt;us,\u0026lt;/g\u0026gt; and the family, and I had to wait 3 \u0026lt;g\u0026gt;months\u0026lt;/g\u0026gt; until \u0026lt;g\u0026gt;I\u0026lt;/g\u0026gt; had enough to go and visit... I \u0026lt;g\u0026gt;Dont\u0026lt;/g\u0026gt; want to have to go through that again in an emergency if \u0026lt;g\u0026gt;i\u0026lt;/g\u0026gt; can help it...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think you all know any excess we had from Patreon we aimed to use on days out for our children here in Tanzania, but up to now we have not really had any extra for that, but rest assured if we ever did it is still the case that we would use it on the children.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t want to bank or save money here, that\u0027s not something we could or would ever do now we have so many in need around us, but we also don\u0027t want money donated for the children to go on us, so this is our way of letting everyone donate for us, and to see exactly what we would spend it on. \u003cbr\u003eWe just want to find a way to support our family whilst being able to see our nieces and nephews grow up twice a year, and see our families beyond that, and of course for our parents be able to see their granddaughter or grandson grow up too...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is why we have set a goal, and we hope in the next few years we can get there so we and baby bump, who soon wont be bump can stay where we are without using any of the donations that are meant for the children to do so.\u003cbr\u003eAs always thank you, for all your love and support, we cant do this without you...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eLove, light and blessings all :) X\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe altered this goal a tiny bit on november\u00a029th 2017, we weren\u0027t being greedy! We just underestimated insurance costs as we missed out air ambulances here is all... Sorry :/ :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove and gratitude all :) x",
