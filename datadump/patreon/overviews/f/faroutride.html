    "summary": "Hello! We\u0027re Isabelle and Antoine, a couple dreaming of being on the move and we\u0027re seeking for the ride of our life! We bought a Ford Transit van, converted it to a campervan, sold our house, quit our engineer careers and hit the road full-time to make our dream a reality. We hope to inspire and help others to follow their dreams too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Problem with our \"Old Life\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActually, there was no problem! We had everything we wanted: well paid permanent jobs with benefits, a nice house, cars, friends, mountain biking trails, whitewater rivers, craft beer scene, etc. We\u2019re not attracted by luxury (except for mountain bikes!), so we considered ourselves \u201crich\u201d in a way that we could afford all the fun we wanted (keeping in mind that we\u2019re reasonable people! are we?).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLife Was Good, but could it be Better?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe lived a comfortable life, but when reaching our mid-thirties the years seem to repeat themselves. The idea of repeating the same pattern until our retirement was not really fulfilling\u2026  there had to be better?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCould We Afford It?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne does not simply take a year off or two to travel in a van\u2026 we had to prove to ourselves that we could sustain it financially. Before we leave for our trip, we had to save enough money to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay for the van\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay for the trip\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSave cash for our transition back to our \"normal\" life after the trip\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eThis is where things get interesting... once we got the van, we spent most of our time working on the conversion. More work + less \u201cfun\u201d = less spending!\u00a0The rate at which our saving started to increase was pleasantly surprising. We realized how much beer, restaurants, bike, lift ticket, gas, etc, costed us in our sedentary life. We finally met our objective much faster than we anticipated, yay! This could also means that we could maybe extend the trip duration\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWE\u0027RE TAKING THE PLUNGE!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re young, resourceful and healthy. In the end, what is the worst that could happen? Have our van \u0026amp; stuff stolen? We\u2019re insured. Run out of money? We\u2019ll just go back to our old job, we will most likely get re-hired. Regret our decision and want to go back to a sedentary life? Go back to a sedentary life and have a good laugh at all of this.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eEnough excuses, WE\u2019RE DOING IT!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJOIN US!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe love sharing our experience and learnings with others, that\u0027s why we created\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://faroutride.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFarOutRide.com\u003c/a\u003e in the first place. The response we got from it is beyond what we ever dreamed, THANK YOU SO MUCH! Now that we completed our van conversion and we\u0027re travelling full time, our adventure has reached a new level: everyday is an opportunity to live a new adventure (good or bad...) and to learn a few things. We think Patreon is the best way to get closer to our audience, get feedback and encourage us to share more of our story!\u00a0"
