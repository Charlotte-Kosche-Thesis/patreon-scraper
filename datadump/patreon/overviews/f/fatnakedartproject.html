    "summary": "I currently have three photo projects. My newest, that I hope to launch this year, is called Body Love Through Struggle- named after a facebook group by the same name. It focuses on people who have or have had eating disorders and, specifically, hopes to focus on marginalized groups that rarely get representation in the eating disorder communities or conversations surrounding eating disorders.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Fat Naked Art Project, my oldest photo project, started in 2013, and showcases the diversity of the human body and represents people who rarely get positive representation in the media or our society. For just over three years I\u0027ve been photographing fat naked people. \u00a0As a fat woman I see how poorly fat people are treated and I firmly believe that everyone should be treated with a basic respect regardless of weight, health, or how closely they resemble the cultural beauty ideal. I\u0027m based out of Durham, NC, but would love to be able to travel all across the US and, maybe, someday the world, taking beautiful photos of beautiful people. I\u0027ve currently visited NYC, Atlanta, cities all over NC, and am planning a trip to San Francisco in 2017.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy third photo project is called Body Beautiful, and presents all bodies as beautiful and wonderful. Again, this project focuses on marginalized groups, but is inclusive of everyone who wishes to participate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my blogs, I have been on Huffington Post Live, have twice appeared on the Friend of Marilyn, will be speaking at The Fat Activism Conference in August, and am involved in the filming of a new body positive TV series that features The Fat Naked Art Project. I run several online body positive spaces, write for my own body positive blog: Fat Girl Posing, and have participated in others including a collaborative blog called Fierce Freethinking Fatties.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBody Positivity has become my full time job (in addition to taking care of my family), but unfortunately activism doesn\u2019t always pay the costs of photography equipment, cleanings, repairs, travel, or space rentals. This is where you can help! By funding this project you will be helping to spread a message of body love and happiness to people who may never have experienced self care before. I believe this is essential in helping the world. So please, make a difference in someone\u2019s life."
