Instead of asking for $5 or $10 a month and allowing access to\nspecial training content that can only be found on Patreon, I am asking for a\n$1 monthly pledge to help make the channel better.  There are lots of things I would like to do\nthat I simply cannot dedicate the time and money to do on the ad revenue\nYoutube creates for me. I would love to have a better (non point and shoot) camera, an external microphone (to kill off all the annoying wind noise), and better props. If half of the subscribers to the channel\nthrew in a dollar every month I could not only get out more but could dedicate\nall the time I spend working security side jobs to making more and better\nvideos for all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe whole idea of this project was to be a positive voice\nfor Rank and File cops and to get critical info out for free to those that need\nit most.
