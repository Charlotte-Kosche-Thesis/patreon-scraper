    "summary": "Well hello,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd welcome\nto the Ford Cassella Patreon Campaign for the queer entertainment web hub \u003cstrong\u003eWe\u0027re Funny That Way\u00ae\u003c/strong\u003e! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Mission \u0026amp; You\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003eWe are Ford Cassella Productions and our motto is:  \u201cDo Good. Do Good Business.\u201d We intend to change the world by creating web hubs for underserved communities and niche audiences all over the planet. (Motto #2: Niche is the new mainstream.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA bit about who we are- Katie Ford has a very storied resume. She was one of the creators and writers of the hit movie Miss Congeniality, a producer/writer on Family Ties and Desperate Housewives, and wrote the Emmy-nominated film \u201cPrayers for Bobby\u201d which starred Sigourney Weaver. And if we do say so ourselves, Katie\u2019s also a kick ass monologist who\u2019s able to evoke both laughter and tears from a live audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaggie Cassella, well, she\u2019s been around since the late 80\u2019s when Lea DeLaria (Orange is the New Black) spotted her hosting a show and said \u201cYou\u2019re gonna do stand-up\u201d. They became writing partners (one book, two screenplays) and continue to collaborate to this day (Obie Awards, We\u2019re Funny That Way). Maggie has produced series for Canadian TV and hosted her own nationally televised talk show (Because I Said So). She\u2019s appeared on every major Canadian network (as well as CNN) as a commentator (did we mention she used to be a lawyer) and was the creator of we\u2019re funny that way \u00ae (the first queer comedy festival in the world). Her live production experience spans 25 years since she put on that first show with Lea back in 1989.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo back to reinventing. How are we two ladies going to do that? Well, with our fierce determination to underserved audiences we intend to \u201cask questions first and shoot later\u201d (Motto # 3).  That means engaging the audience in the creation of the content they want to see, identifying and bringing along new talent and interesting content from each of the communities we work with, and making a space for the members of that community to communicate with each other. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eServing, plus mentoring, plus creating\u003c/em\u003e for the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch1\u003eThe We\u0027re Funny That Way Web Hub\u003c/h1\u003eWe\u2019re starting with \u003cstrong\u003eThe We\u2019re Funny That Wa\u003c/strong\u003ey web hub.  An online community for queers and queer adjacent folks to experience entertainment content, interact, share, comment, and opine with people all over the world. How to characterize the We\u2019re Funny That Way web hub? Well, take cabaret shows, web series, stand-up performances, poetry slams, singers, songwriters, a bookstore, Angie\u2019s List, Instagram and Facebook, throw them in a queer blender and you\u2019ve got the We\u2019re Funny That Way web hub.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve already got ground-breaking original content in development - A talk show called \u003cstrong\u003eLate Night Lezbo\u003c/strong\u003e and exclusive video of the \u003cstrong\u003eWe\u0027re Funny That Way Festival\u003c/strong\u003e - the first and longest-running queer performance festival in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that, our pre-launch Facebook posts and videos have reached hundreds of thousands of people. It\u2019s proof that in spite of many gains, the queer community remains underserved, underrepresented and searching to see ourselves, hear our stories, and to connect with each other on a global scale. Oh yeah, we\u2019re definitely onto something.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eBe a part of creating this brave new world! \u00a0\u003c/h1\u003eOkay so here\u2019s where YOU can come in:\u003cbr\u003eYou can be a part of the action every month by becoming a patron on \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/user?u=3315209\"\u003ePatreon\u003c/a\u003e for only $5 or $10 a month. \u00a0That\u0027s all we\u0027re asking for!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy monthly?  Well, given Maggie Cassella\u2019s experience hosting talk shows and interviewing famous people (not to mention grilling folks when she was a lawyer) our first foray into original content will be a talk show hosted by Maggie called \u201cLate Night Lezbo\u201d.  The show will feature a lot of interviews, plus talent you may or may not have heard of, that we intend to foster and expose to the world.\u003cbr\u003eBecause this is an ongoing production we have specific goals and immediate needs like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe own one broadcast quality camera, we need a second identical one so that we don\u2019t spend money on rentals that would quickly add up to actually owning the second camera.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDitto for lav mics.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe\u2019d love to take our crew and travel to interview some of our favourite famous queers.  We know how to operate on a shoestring budget but we still need the shoestring.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eOur budgets* are skinny but still budgets (yes we intend to pay people for their work) so any pledge is a helpful pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd we thank you ahead of time for even considering us. There isn\u2019t really a model for what we\u2019re doing (a for-profit endeavor to include and reach underserved communities while also mentoring talent and engaging with the audience), so the mountain is high but to misquote the great Diana Ross \u2013Ain\u2019t no mountain high enough to keep us away from you world.\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to read this and helping us to Do Good. \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e Do Good Business.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Budgets available on request for large sponsors or backers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eImportant PS! \u003c/strong\u003e We also have an established charitable Foundation - the We\u0027re Funny That Way Foundation. WFTWF has helped numerous queer charities across Canada. We aim to support queer youth and the most needy queer charities we can find.  Since its inception, the WFTW Foundation has donated close to half a million dollars AND we are moving to expand world wide.   All of the net proceeds from the we\u0027re funny that way\u00ae festival have and will go directly to the Foundation AND a portion of our swag will go there too. Because like we said, \"You can do good and do good business\"!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

To purchase a second camera identical to the one we have now so that when we are shooting interviews for Late Night Lezbo we don\u0027t waste money renting a camera that can be purchased with the cost of a few rentals.  Included in this purchase are two 4k keys so we can broadcast in a quality that will literally make you think you\u0027re on something cuz it feels like you\u0027re in the room with the players. Also, to purchase two high quality lav mics. (Approx $5000 all in.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. To cover costs of shooting. \u00a0That includes travel, lodging, shooter/sound person, hair and make-up for talent for interviews with celebs on set, in studio, wherever we can get them in NYC, LA, and Toronto.  Travel est. to LA and NYC for us and our crew is approximately $2000.  Crew $1000/day. Lodging, ya know, Trivago or Air BnB or but still, $400/day (unless we crash at your place ;).) Hair/Make-up for talent $250 day.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. To cover social media marketing.  If you don\u0027t do this you might as well not do 1 or 2 above.  $1500 per month at launch. $750 per month pre-launch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. Shekels for the intern.  When we say we want to pay people we mean we even want to pay our intern.  We understand being an intern for credit means no pay but we don\u0027t understand how millennials will ever make it if we don\u0027t pay so there\u0027s that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd those are our top $$ goals. \u003cbr\u003e",
