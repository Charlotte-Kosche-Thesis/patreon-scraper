Since I was a kid, I\u0027ve wanted to write for a living - to write an incredible book or short story, see my name on the cover and have millions of people talk about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I\u0027m an adult, I\u0027ve had the chance to both refine my craft and grow out of my naivety. Now I know that in order for my books to be considered good, they have to entertain. If what I write can make the reader\u0027s day just a little bit brighter, a little bit more happy, then I will have succeeded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything that I write, that I consider worthy of Patreon will be posted both on my Fictionpress account (with the same handle) and here. I believe that my writing is good enough to be worth a dollar or more. If you believe that too, and back up that belief, you will have my eternal gratitude and a promise that I\u0027ll continue to write to the best of my ability for your entertainment.\u003cbr\u003e"
