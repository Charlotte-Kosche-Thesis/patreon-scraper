So I started working. Health food store jobs led to gardening and landscaping jobs led to small organic farm jobs led to  my farm job and farmers\u0027 market founding led to now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePast\u003cbr\u003ePersonal\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a Colorado native but lived most of my life in Texas along with some short stints in OK, GA, and MN.
