We are a fire performance group that also works to provide learning resources and give back to the flow community. Luke Hanna is an Egyptian-American who has been spinning since 2014. He was primarily self-taught from videos before he began to branch out and attend fire festivals where he was able to learn in person. He is now working to try and give back to the community for future spinners. Luke met Kaye Pearson at a fire spinning festival in 2016. Kaye was a brand new spinner who was excited by the idea of creating resources for others like herself. Together they founded Fire Amusement in 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat are Fire Amusement\u0027s Goals?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goals are to create learning resources for fire spinning, provide interesting and accurate information about the community and provide props to spinners in third world countries. To create learning resources we run a YouTube channel with tutorial videos. Our hope is that our channel will be organized to make learning easy and efficient. We provide information about the fire spinning community through a blog run on our website. We are planning and organizing trips to provide props to spinners around the world, the first being to Egypt in June of 2018. We hope to bring props to a group that performs at resorts and currently needs to re-wick between every performance because they don\u0027t have access to better props. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow Patreon Helps\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting us on Patreon helps us in a number of ways. Even supporting us with as little as $1/month makes a big difference! Knowing that we have a steady income of money to help pay for the little parts of our performances like fuel and Spotify allow us to focus more on making content for our followers. In addition, part of our Patreon money is put aside to be spent on props for performers and spinners in third world countries that can\u0027t get LED or kevlar fire props of their own. Patreon money can also go a long way towards improving our content on YouTube and other mediums, as it can allow us to upgrade our lighting and camera equipment or help pay monthly fees for editing programs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eLuke Hanna and Kaye Pearson of Fire Amusement\u003cbr\u003ewww.FireAmusement.com\u003cbr\u003e"
