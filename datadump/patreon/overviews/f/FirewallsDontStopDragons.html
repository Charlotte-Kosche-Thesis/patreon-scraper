If you\u0027re like most people, you probably have \u003cem\u003eno clue\u003c/em\u003e - and guess what, that almost surely means that you\u0027re closer to the wet paper bag! But lucky for you, you\u0027ve found \u003cem\u003eFirewalls Don\u0027t Stop Dragons\u003c/em\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Wake Up Call\u003c/h3\u003eFive years ago, after the bombshell revelations from Edward Snowden, I began my quest to train everyday, non-technical people how to defend their digital castles from hordes of hackers, spammers and Internet invaders by \u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/FDSD2-AMZ\"\u003ewriting a book\u003c/a\u003e. Your computer, mobile devices, and online privacy have never been more at risk than they are right now - and it\u0027s going to get worse before it gets better. But what can you do about it? Surely, it\u0027s hopeless... a lost cause... but\u003cem\u003e it\u0027s not!\u003c/em\u003e There are \u003cem\u003edozens\u003c/em\u003e of simple\n and free things we all could (and should) be doing to protect ourselves, and my book explains it all - without jargon or judgment, complete with step-by-step instructions and pictures! Using simple analogies, plain English, and even some humor, I take the time to explain how things work and why they\u0027re so important... but also give you the option to skip straight to the checklists. Here\u0027s just a small sampling of the questions I answer in the book...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat do I really need to worry about? How secure do I really need to be?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow can I choose good passwords and still remember them?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow do I protect myself against identity theft?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIs there any way to avoid being tracked everywhere online?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIs it safe to shop and bank on my computer or smartphone?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat is malware and what can I do to avoid getting infected?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow do I configure my home network?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow do I keep my kids safe on the Internet while respecting their privacy?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI was (and still am) extremely proud of that book, but I felt that I wasn\u0027t reaching enough people. So I started a \u003ca href=\"http://firewallsdontstopdragons.com/\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e, created a \u003ca href=\"http://firewallsdontstopdragons.com/newsletter/\"\u003enewsletter\u003c/a\u003e, and even taught some continuing education courses at Duke University. But still I felt like I could do more...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eKicking It Up a Notch (or Three)\u003c/h3\u003eI decided it was time to hit the big time: I started my own \u003ca href=\"http://americaoutloud.com/show/firewalls/\"\u003epodcast\u003c/a\u003e! Once a week, I break down the cyber news that actually matters (and debunk the stuff that doesn\u0027t), provide a useful Tip of the Week, and interview top people in the field of cyber-security and privacy. My guests so far have included Ladar Levison (owner of Lavabit), Michael Kaiser (Executive Director of the National Cyber Security Alliance), John Graham-Cumming (CTO of Cloudflare), and several folks from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. From time to time, I have podcasts focused on a particular educational topic in a series I call \"Castle Defense 101\" - topics like choosing good passwords, backing up your files, and so on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMy Continuing Mission...\u003c/h3\u003eThe mainstream media, despite good intentions, simply doesn\u0027t do a good job of covering highly-technical topics like cyber-security and online privacy - they just don\u0027t have the experience to identify what\u0027s \u003cem\u003etruly\u003c/em\u003e important for most people nor do they have the expertise to \u003cem\u003eexplain\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eit\u003c/em\u003e in a way that the everyday person can understand and act on. That\u0027s my skill. That\u0027s my calling. I want to help you get past the hype, filter out the click-bait, and focus on the stuff that matters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut there are so many things I still want to do! In the near term, I need to update the book (third edition) and significantly expand my podcast audience. In the future, I want to write more books, create instructional videos, and expand my training with both in-person and online courses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this takes a significant amount of time, effort and money. Right now, this is still something I\u0027m doing in addition to my day job as a software engineer - but as soon as it\u0027s viable, I plan to make cyber-education my full-time pursuit! In the meantime, to do this right, I\u0027ll need to hire some help for marketing, editing and just day-to-day administrative tasks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd that\u0027s where YOU come in! \u003c/strong\u003eWhether you want to help me to help you, or help me to help humanity, I would be flattered and honored to accept your support for this quest!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThank You!\u003c/h3\u003eI want to be sure to thank everyone who has already supported me on this journey so far - from the initial KickStarter campaign to write the first edition of the book, to all my Twitter followers, blog readers, newsletter subscribers, students, and listeners! And thank you for reading this far and giving serious consideration to becoming a supporter!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
