While there, my theatre mentors included George C. Wolf, Jerry Zaks and Brian Kulich. Television production work included various shows on NBC and VH-1 followed by a stint in commercial production at Cine International and EUE Screen Gems. Eventually, I returned to LA and took on the role of researchist and portfolio administrator for the private equity arm of a global asset management firm with ~$5bn AUM. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow integrating my finance experience and storytelling skills, I\u0027m pursuing my dearest passion -- filmmaking -- especially adaptations of the classical canon for contemporary audiences. Drawing narrative inspiration from the Ancient Greeks through the Renaissance to 20th Century American theatre, my goal is to create robust sensory and empathetic experiences through the meticulous synthesis of visceral performances, resonant imagery and immersive soundscapes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently completed shorts include: DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE, based on Shakespeare\u0027s \u003cem\u003eHamlet\u003c/em\u003e, is set in 1928 against the backdrop of the first Wall Street crisis; and DWELL TIME (Executive Produced by Liz Glotzer, \u003cem\u003eThe Shawshank Redemption\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eFracture\u003c/em\u003e; Produced by Mark Myers, \u003cem\u003eThe Experimenter, Manson Family Vacation\u003c/em\u003e), loosely based on the Japanese Noh drama \u003cem\u003eKinuta\u003c/em\u003e by Zeami. It explores the effects of undiagnosed PTSD on a soldier and his family as he prepares to redeploy. Both were screened at the Cannes Short Film Corner.
