    "summary": "Family Abuse Services of Alamance County, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit aimed at eliminating domestic violence in our community and supporting those who have experienced abuse. Our shelter provides a safe haven for survivors fleeing abuse and for their children, and our staff provide direct services to survivors, including assisting survivors in filing for protective orders, accompanying survivors to court, and providing emotional support, safety planning, and assistance securing housing. Due to the large (and growing) number of clients we serve, we are in need of financial support to ensure that we are able to meet the needs of our clients. However, you do not have to donate much to make a difference. Did you know that:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA donation of $5 can provide five one-way bus passes for clients who have fled abuse needing transportation to safe shelter, medical appointments, and jobs?\u003cbr\u003eA donation of $25 can provide a gas card for a woman needing to immediately flee an abuser?\u003cbr\u003eA donation of $50 can provide a Target card to keep the shelter stocked with clean bedding, towels, and other necessities?\u003cbr\u003eA donation of $100 can cover the shelter\u2019s water bill, and part of the electricity bill, for a month?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile our clients work incredibly hard to survive the effects of the abuse they have endured, ensuring safety and healing from domestic violence is a community effort. Every dollar donated makes a difference in the lives of our clients. Please consider signing up today to be a patron of Family Abuse Services-you only need to enroll once as a monthly donor, and everything you donate is tax deductible. We cannot overstate our gratitude!"
