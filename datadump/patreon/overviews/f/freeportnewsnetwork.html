    "summary": "\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eDear Viewers:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo years ago I had a mission. To change the landscape of news in Freeport. To get people excited once again about our city, the cool things that are here, the great people here and to celebrate again our shops, local restaurants, decade old family businesses, our unique treasures (like the holiday apple) and so many other news stories and parts of our town that just went forgotten by mainstream news. The only time people showed up was when something bad happened and with everything else going on in the world, I was frankly sick of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to light a fire again. I wanted to scream it from the top of the hill as loud as I could. I wanted attention for Freeport. I think I\u0027ve done that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have visited thousands of places in the area. I have filmed just as many segments from places all over the city and all over the region. I have talked with Mayor\u0027s, alderman, stood where shots were fired in our city, I\u0027ve stood in -25 below weather with the street department when the water main broke, I\u0027ve covered snow storms, caught unique sunrises at 4:00 a.m., helped kids and people with cancer and other local causes raise money and I\u0027ve been up until midnight and later to cover elections, editing video and preparing for the next day, week, month to come. All to show a better side, a different \"vibe\" to Freeport.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s caught on too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe positive approach to a new look into our city caught on. The newspaper changed, Rockford news stations are in Freeport more now than they have ever been. Other small positive news has popped up. When I began covering news two years ago, I was the only news outlet on the scene. Today, at least 2-4 other outlets are there with me. It worked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a lot to do this. It\u0027s a lot of work literally at all hours of the day to \"play ball\" with established local and even other big regional media. But they had forgotten about us. They forgot about Freeport. I think together, we reminded them how cool we really are (and have always been).\u003cbr\u003eI would like to continue to bring you news, all day, all night just like you have already seen for the past two years. But I would like your help. You, the viewer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want a lot though. In fact, all I ask is for you to consider giving $1.00 a month. Even just $5.00 a month. If you\u0027re a business and give $25.00 or more, I have have special bonuses for you too. I know it may sound ridiculous to only ask for $1.00 but that tiny one dollar of yours could help all of this effort in a big way. The newspaper alone costs $1.50 per day. I\u0027m asking for $1.00 a month, $5.00 a month. A small show of support and money you probably won\u0027t even miss, but a big show of support for the effort we make for Freeport.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy philosophy has always been do first. Don\u0027t ask for what you haven\u0027t done, and don\u0027t ask for what you haven\u0027t proven you can do and can do well. Give first. If 50 people gave a dollar, if 200 people gave a dollar it adds up and your name isn\u0027t visible to anyone when you do give. \u003cbr\u003eFreeport is strong. We have pride. Our city is that of a great friend, of diversity. We give, we help out, we support our town and we all want Freeport to hit a home run. All of us do. That pride in community is our strength. I\u0027d like to think that together, we have all been a part of that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though it has taken a lot of hard work to bring all of this to you, I have always and still do consider it a privilege to be able to show all of you, whoever and wherever you are, my town, my city, my little place I call home. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for being a viewer and as always, thank you for your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
