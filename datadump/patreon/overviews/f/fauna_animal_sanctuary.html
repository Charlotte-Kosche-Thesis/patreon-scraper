We provide permanent residency to abandoned, neglected and abused animals. I make sure all of the residents have proper housing, feeding, medical care and love. Some\u00a0animals also come to us because they need to be relocated by the owner due to different circumstances, such as moving house, no proper enclosure, or simply because the animal is no longer wanted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt present, Fauna Animal Sanctuary is home to over 100 animals including a bull, a cow, 32 rabbits, 15 pigeons, 2 chuckars, 5 roosters, 5 hens, a starling and lots of ducks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is nothing more fulfilling for me than rescuing and helping animals to gain self-esteem. I am not a vet nor do I have any veterinary training. However, I have learned a ton about animal behavior, medical care, and nutrition in the last 8 years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always joke about having 2 full-time jobs, my job at the sanctuary, and my job as a dental technician. I wish I could only have my full-time job at the sanctuary, but I can\u0027t. Running a non-profit animal rescue organization is expensive and as we keep growing, costs include veterinary fees, utilities, feed, housing for the animals, transport, maintenance and so on.
