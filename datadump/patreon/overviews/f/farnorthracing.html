    "summary": "Since we first formed Far North Racing in 1997, we\u0027ve been documenting what we\u0027ve learned along the way. Racing technology is filled with too many Secret Squirrels and Super Tunas, and we had to learn the truth about what works and what doesn\u0027t the hard way - cut and try, test and evaluate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur core \u003cem\u003emodus operendi\u003c/em\u003e is \"Knowledge shared is knowledge squared\". It was hard for us; it need not be hard for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve stopped actively racing, but that doesn\u0027t mean the learning has halted. We are currently resto-modding a 1993 Dodge Stealth, and we continue to document the progress of that project and reviews of tools and techniques we use along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also took up cycling, and some cycling stuff sneaks in from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016, we added a YouTube channel to augment our static website, and that has added a whole new hockey sock of challenges - now we have to learn filmmaking! Why not? Specialization is for insects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProceeds from this channel are used to directly subsidize the continuation of this project, by paying for bandwidth for the main website, or by adding capacity to our video production process or project tools.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a few ideas in the pipeline that we want to explore, including:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- The CNC conversion of a benchtop mill\u003cbr\u003e- A video series version of our e-book \"Autocross to Win\"\u003cbr\u003e- A print version of A2W\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s just to start.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support ensures that we can keep creating content and sharing what we\u0027ve learned with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
