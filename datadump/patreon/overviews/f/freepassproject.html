    "summary": "Who needs a free pass now and again? \u003cbr\u003eAlmost everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an inclusive social engagement platform, the Free Pass Project unifies and empowers individuals and communities with creative acts of spontaneous compassion and conversation. In these divisive and wearing times an observation as simple as, \u0027it looks like you\u0027re having a bad day\u2019, can go a long way towards connection. I have great gratitude to the hundreds of people who have been involved, at some level, with the Free Pass Project during the first three years. Thanks to citizen artists like you, the compassion in free pass exchanges incrementally makes the world a smaller and better place. If you\u0027re just learning about this long term, social practice, thanks for stopping by. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe What: \u003cbr\u003eCurrently hand crafted from re-purposed poker chips, Free Pass tokens are stage one, and the center of this lively, people powered, pro social platform. Citizen artists, such as yourself, give free pass tokens to friends and strangers, keep one for a jolt of self compassion or drop them randomly as a surprise gift to strangers. Folks have deemed the term/gesture, \u0027free passing\u0027. Any mix of these creative options eases distress and brightens the day for at least two people: you and a free pass recipient.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese stories are uploaded by folks who have participated in this art project. Sharing our stories is one way to nurture, nourish and extend this Free Pass Project community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Why:\u003cbr\u003eIt is science that one instance of compassionate behavior compels the next person to do the same. This is the micro level of the Free Pass Project that helps change the world. A simple conversation that might start with, \u2018it looks like you\u2019re having a bad day\u2019, crosses social and political barriers - i.e. we\u2019ve all been there. Creatively bestowing a free pass token as a small respite from struggle builds a simple bridge with, \u2018I\u2019ve been there too\u2019. The banner at the top of this page shows the inclusive diversity of free pass conversations by this creative community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Who:\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m Rachel Cyrene Blackman, a multi disciplinary artist. I originated the interactive, pro social art of the Free Pass Project in January, 2014. A tremendous amount of background work supports the surprising simplicity and clarity of the project\u0027s foundational purpose. Collaborations, research, writing, improving materials, making free pass tokens, digital media...and love...keep the Project going. Here\u0027s a \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0BDljpQKg4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eshort clip\u003c/a\u003e that introduces some of my own free passing.  After a conversation with a stranger, you are no longer strangers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese short articles introduce the FPP as it was in year one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://providenceonline.com/stories/The-Free-Pass-Project-rachel-cyrene-blackman-providence-rhode-island-community,12781\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eProvidence Monthly \u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://motifri.com/orange-interaction-its-your-turn-to-free-pass/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMotif Magazine\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Patron: a recurring monthly payment of any amount that can be adjusted at anytime.\u003cbr\u003eThis exact juncture of the Free Pass Project is about three things: a) refining and finalizing writing in order to move ahead approaching existing, and new, institutional and funding contacts; b) to collaborate on what the next, and more practical, \u0027object\u0027 might be that guides a free pass interaction - for example, a Free Pass app; c) to preserve creative time for me out in the world, free passing. Padding time for me be expressively in the project fulfills the initial creative explosion. Additionally, my stories and experience as a free passer are new content for future partners and funders.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first monthly goal with your patronage is a $600.00 a month. This amount translates into the total time of one full work week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA monthly amount that exceeds that will allow us, the Free Pass Project community, to fulfill the full vision of the Free Pass Project as a multi disciplinary platform. In additional to the optional rewards, I\u0027ll post content that is only accessible by patrons. This will include short video clips, photos, stories, and a peek into development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Patreon platform helps sustain and develop this long term art project, while at the same time making the world a better place. Let\u2019s work together.\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eRachel Cyrene Blackman"
