    "summary": "I\u0027m Kenneth Arthur and I have been putting together three podcasts simultaneously for over a year now, rarely missing a week, with Seaside Chats, 3000 NFL Mock Draft with Rob Staton, and the Instant Reaction show after Seahawks games. These shows come out for the love of the game, but they take a lot of work to do and we think we can get better. A lot better. Better microphones, better equipment, better software, better releases, and more guests that will pique your interests. We just don\u0027t make any money doing these shows. At all. In fact, we have been losing money on it from the beginning. This will allow the show to continue and with more resources the show will be better and we will have an easier time producing it, which could mean more shows in the future. That\u0027s why we are asking for your help, not just if you appreciate the show coming out every week, but if you want it to be better and bigger. Much bigger.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(NOTE: Want to just donate some money and walk away? Yeah, I hear that! We\u0027re all subbed to so many things these days, you don\u0027t want to lose track of that $5 going to me every month. Well, apparently you can donate up to $99 and then just cancel your monthly subscription and you\u0027ll be done. You can also donate over $100 and do that (woohoo!) but it won\u0027t process until the 1st, so if you cancel, it won\u0027t go to us and it will only end up as a credit for you. So if you want to donate $100 or more, awesome, but don\u0027t cancel until after the 1st, when the donations are delivered to the creators aka us.)"
