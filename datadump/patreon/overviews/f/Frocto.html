    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eUpdate as of 20/12/2017: \u003c/strong\u003eSince I get asked about this a lot, I want to clarify \u003cstrong\u003eI send stories to backers through private messages rather than posting them behind protected posts\u003c/strong\u003e. The main reason for this is that Patreon scraper bots have gotten really good at taking stuff from behind protected posts. It\u0027s a little silly - and insulting - in my case, since I release all my content eventually anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI know this is annoying for real, legitimate backers. So if you\u0027ve just signed up hoping to get a story\u003c/strong\u003e that\u0027s currently available to Patreons only, \u003cstrong\u003ejust bug me about it and I\u0027ll send it to you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027ll probably just do this the one time since, like I said, everything gets released eventually anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---\u003ca href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Frocto\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFimfiction\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.hentai-foundry.com/user/Frocto/profile\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHentai Foundry\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://hffrocto.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTumblr\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.froctopuss.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWebsite\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSkype: Frocto\u003cbr\u003eDiscord:\u00a0Frocto#5359\u003cbr\u003eNew subs can also message me for access to a Discord chat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi! My name is Frocto and I\u0027m a writer of adult content\u00a0which I\u0027ve been posting on Hentai Foundry for some time! I like writing a LOT and I want to write forever and forever.\u00a0Regardless of what the content is, I am writing every single day. There\u0027s nothing I\u0027d love more than to be able to continue doing this, for myself and for my fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Does The Money Go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe simple answer is: you\u0027ll get to see more of what I want to do, and in a larger scale than what\u0027s currently being put up. What\u0027s going up on my HF page right is almost entirely the commissioned one-shots I need to do to keep food on my plate, and if I didn\u0027t have the immediate threat of poverty lingering over my head all day, I\u0027d be able to consider personal projects more readily.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping I\u0027ll be able to please a larger number of people by having more things like Strawpolls asking which characters people want to see in the stories, longer-term stories with more fleshed-out characters and so on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I actually do make money, the truth is most of it will go towards simple things, like food, utilities and rent. For the sake of full disclosure, I am making public that my monthly rent and bills, and all fees included, comes to about $680 AUD. Doing this would mean I have more time to focus on my work, and hopefully even rise above my current level of mediocrity! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should You Pledge To Me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI would really like to continue writing stories and creating content for my fans! My commission prices currently are a tad too low to live off of, and I\u0027d really prefer not to raise them any higher if it can be avoided. Donations will ensure I can live more comfortably and continue producing content for years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBacker Incentives\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt the $3 level of backer incentive, Patrons will be able to vote periodically on what new content I work on. The options will consist of a few ideas I\u0027ve been kicking around, or a continuation of an existing story on my HF.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the $5 level of backer incentive, I\u0027ll be choosing Patreon subs to write short, 2,000 word minimum commissions for. I\u0027ll be doing one a month and everyone will get one eventually. If there\u0027s something you\u0027d like me to write about, go ahead and sign up. $10 level backers get to go twice.\u003cbr\u003e"
