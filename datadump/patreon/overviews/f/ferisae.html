My name is Feri and I love making comics and digital fanart of my favorite franchises when time permits, namely, Legend of Zelda and Miraculous Ladybug!\u00a0I have several artworks and comic projects on the pipeline, both short and multi-chaptered stories. Right now, I\u0027m working on remaking several Miraculous Ladybug comics to make them more presentable and enjoyable to read, as well as working on many new comics that I\u0027m excited to share with everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, working on commissions on the side really sets me back (but I need to take them to make ends meet), and with my day job it\u0027s become hard to juggle both things, making it difficult to make time for comics or personal art...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, where do you guys come in?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i61.tinypic.com/29b0l02.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming my Patron, your help will help me stay up to date on payments and other important expenses (so I don\u00b4t have to work overtime to pay for everything) and that in turn will let me invest more of my time and energy on new artwork. By paying me per month, it doesn\u0027t matter how much I post, you will only be charged once a month for the quantity you pledged! That way it won\u0027t cause a deep strain on your wallet.  This in turn will act as motivation for me to work on new and better stuff for you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be posting exclusive \"first look previews\" for Patreons, and who knows, maybe you will accompany me on my growth as I work on more stories! I will be delighted to share this voyage with you here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to delivering artwork/comics, I will also be offering:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e *Preview sketches\u003cbr\u003e*Step-by-step images\u003cbr\u003e*PSD files with layers\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rewards will be sent out at the end of the month (or a BIG file every 3 months which may include extra goodies) to every patron via download links.\u00a0 These files WILL ONLY BE FOR PATRONS. DO NO REDISTRIBUTE THEM and will be deleted soon after. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut \"WHAT IS PATREON FERI?\" I\u0027m glad you ask. Patreon is a platform that allows you, the patron, to support your favorite artists by giving them a set payment per month, week, or work. Unlike Kickstarter, Patreon isn\u0027t a one time donation... it is a recurrent monthly/weekly/per work payment, to help sustain your artists and help them invest more time and energy on that which they love to do:\u00a0 create new, beautiful artworks for your enjoyment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can give, $1, $3, $5, or whatever quantity you want to your favorite\n artists, and it will be automatically charged to your select payment \noption. The best part? You can set a limit so you never go over your \nbudget! If you need further explanations, just take a look at this very short, very comprehensive video about how patreon works:\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH-IDF809fQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH-IDF809fQ\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to read and for your consideration! Your support is super appreciated \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
