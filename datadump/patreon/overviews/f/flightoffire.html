    "summary": "Welcome to Flight of Fire\u0027s Patreon\npage! We have some huge plans for the future and we thank you for taking the\ntime to check out what this is all about! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo why are we doing this weird new thing? We\u0027ll tell you. First, here\u2019s what Patreon\nis:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a relatively new thing, and it was invented because the invention of\nthe internet has made music available to everyone. There\u0027s a beauty to this,\nbut there\u0027s also a dark side - it is much harder these days for artists to make\na living with their work! Patreon\u0027s solution to this problem is to create a way\nfor fans to help support the artists they love in an ongoing way - for the cost\nof a cup of coffee every month, fans can make a huge difference in the lives of\nindependent artists like us! In return, every Patron is inducted into a\nsuperfan club that allows them to connect with Flight of Fire on a much deeper\nand personal level than just social media. You collaborate with us, you see\nparts of us we don\u0027t show the world at large; you become an integral part of\nour journey and our art. This kind of relationship isn\u0027t for all our fans, but\nif you love what we do and you want to deepen your relationship with us, or if\nyou just want to help us in our daily struggle to keep Flight of Fire afloat,\nthis is an amazing way for you to get to know us, and for us to get to know\nyou!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron of Flight of Fire, you will get (not released to the public): monthly livestreamed concerts, behind-the-scenes footage, video blogs from the band, sneak peaks of new music all the way through production, in-depth and hidden meanings of our songs, isolated vocal, instrumental and FX tracks from our songs, and you\u0027ll have the opportunity to be a contributing voice to our music via polls and discussions! PLUS: Every single music video, cover video, single and album we release - you will get exclusive access to one week early! PLUS PLUS: As soon as you become a patron, we\u0027ll send you our entire discography. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOkay, and why is Patreon a good\nfit for Flight of Fire and our fans? Well, our story will make that clear.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027re an all-female hard rock band formed at Berklee College of Music. Since\nour graduation in 2014, we\u0027ve been working our asses off trying to make it all\nthe way to the top - our dreams are as big as they come, and we won\u0027t take no\nfor an answer. Generally, we don\u0027t like to talk about the negative side of\ndoing what we do, because we love it with all our hearts and we have no regrets\nat all, but it\u0027s not an easy road. None of us come from money, and we\u0027re all\nsaddled with some pretty terminal college debt, so it\u0027s no surprise that many\nof our songs are about coming from small beginnings and never letting anything\nstop you. Our most recent album, Path of the Phoenix (2016), is an allegory for\nsurviving a year of some serious challenges in the music industry and not\nletting it stop us from chasing down our dream. Shortly after our graduation,\nwe were bashed around by a few bad characters in the music industry and got\ninto a couple rough situations, financial and otherwise, but we learned a lot\nof valuable lessons from those experiences: when it comes to making a life in\nmusic, you must trust yourself, and you must trust your fans. We have the best\nfans in the world - so many people who love our music and believe in what we\u0027re\ndoing, who\u0027ve supported our Kickstarter, gotten out the vote for us countless\ntimes, helping us win many awards(*), and been there for us to share some of\nthe most amazing experiences of our lives, including opening for huge artists\nlike Bon Jovi, J. Geils Band, Lita Ford, Fitz and the Tantrums, Hunter Valentine and Alestorm, and recording with the ledgendary Cherie Currie of the Runaways. Our\nfans have supported our volunteer efforts with orgs like The Girls Rock\nCampaign (**) and charity causes, including our multi-media awareness endeavor\nabout sexual violence, the Stolen Voices Project(***). And in this day and age,\nit really comes down to a band\u0027s relationships with its fans that makes success\neven vaguely possible. We are committed to this path, this band, this message,\nthis music for life. There is no plan B. There is no other way we could live\nand be remotely satisfied with ourselves. So what do we do? We could sit around\nthinking we\u0027re the best and hope for a major record deal to pop out and yell\n\"boo!\", or we could do everything we can to make the life and the\ncareer we want happen right now! But things take money. And the cold hard truth\nis, even after all the awards we\u0027ve won, all the battles of the bands where\nwe\u0027ve been victorious, and all the amazing national and international artists\nwe\u0027ve opened for, Flight of Fire doesn\u0027t even come close to covering our costs\nof running an independent band. Getting paid for shows is nearly unheard of in\nthe American scene, and selling digital music is a rarity, even with the many\nmany hours of promotion we do every week (we recently calculated that we do\nabout 110+ hours a week of promotion and booking work for the band), and the\nONLY problem with all that is that there isn\u0027t enough time in the day! Not\nenough time to put our 110% into the band and still have time to work a full-time job. Let me be clear: we have NO problem living under the poverty line, but we\njust wish we had the money to make more music, more videos, more shows, more\nFlight of Fire! We already have enough songs for TWO more full length albums,\nand detailed, geeky plans to make music videos for every song we\u0027ve released so\nfar. But we don\u0027t have the resources to make these things a reality. Honestly,\nwe get jealous of the artists who come from rich families or can live at home\nand spend all their time on their art, but that won\u0027t stop us from bringing our\nmusic and our message of empowerment to the world. Nothing will! And so, after\nreading all this rambling, if you\u0027re nodding your head along with us, this\nmight be a good fit! It\u0027s your chance to be a real part of our journey! And we\ncould not be more touched that you believe in us! We won\u0027t let you down!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*Visit to \u003ca href=\"http://www.flightoffire.com\"\u003ewww.flightoffire.com\u003c/a\u003e to\ncheck out our awards, press and band accomplishments\u003cbr\u003e\n** More about the Girls Rock Campaign here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.girlsrockcampfoundation.org/\"\u003ehttp://www.girlsrockcampfoundation.org/\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*** More about our Stolen Voices Project here: \u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/1p92IyW\"\u003ehttp://bit.ly/1p92IyW\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
