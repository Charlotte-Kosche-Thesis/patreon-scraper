I\nused to be in academia.  I\u2019ve been\nwriting, thinking, and yelling on-line under the name FuckTheory for seven or\neight years now and in that time I\u2019ve written tens of thousands of words for\nfree and in public without any expectation or even idea of compensation.  To get a better sense of what I do and how I\nthink, you can check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/fucktheory\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy Twitter\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.fucktheory.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy Tumblr\u003c/a\u003e, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.artforum.com/slant/id=65193\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethis recent essay in Artforum\u003c/a\u003e which gives a good summary of the main topics and authors I\u2019m\ncurrently interested in and am likely to be interested in for the next few\nmonths while you support my work.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI started this little experiment for fun and out of\ncuriosity, and that\u2019s mostly why I continue to do it.  I enjoy it. \nBut in the years since I started FuckTheory my circumstances have\nchanged considerably.  During the years\nFuckTheory was most prolific, I was a full-time scholar.  Some semesters I didn\u2019t even have to\nteach.  Since then, I\u2019ve left academia\nand am no longer affiliated with any university or institution.  I currently work a couple of pretty modest gigs\nto pay the rent.  These changes were the\nreason I started raising support for my work on Patreon just over a year\nago.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Ask People For Money\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen I first started this Patreon, I was very broke and\npretty sick, without a steady income or medical insurance.  Things have changed considerably for the\nbetter over the past year, largely because of the support I have received on\nhere.  So first, thank you very very\nmuch.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe money from this Patreon pays for my health insurance every\nmonth.  Because of my current immigration\nstatus, I can\u2019t sign up for Obamacare or other local insurances; I have an\noverseas travelers\u2019 insurance which I bill by sending invoices across the\nocean.  It\u2019s pretty ridiculous but it\u2019s\nthe best option available at the moment. \nUnfortunately, because it\u2019s traveler\u2019s insurance, it doesn\u2019t cover a\nnumber of basic costs.  Those costs are\nalso covered by this Patreon, as are legal fees related to my immigration\nprocess.  So if you\u2019re wondering, those\nare the main places where this money goes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI currently have two main sources of income: 1-on-1\nteaching, mostly of high school students, which is a fairly regular gig that\ncovers my rent and basic nutrition, and freelance translation gigs.  I love translating, and there are far, far\nworse ways to earn money.  I actually\nenjoy the work, which I\u2019m very fortunate to be able to say.  BUT translation gigs are both irregular and\ntime-consuming.  Some months I can earn\nup to $1000 extra translating, some months $60-100.  I always manage to get by, but income from\nPatreon, which arrives regularly and on a predictable date, helps more than\nirregular gigs that take up the entire afternoon.  If I\u2019m on a Twitter rant for an hour then get\nan e-mail offering me a translation for $150, having this Patreon income allows\nme to make the decision to keep writing for an hour instead of stopping to make\nthe extra money.  It\u2019s a fairly petty\nmath, but that\u2019s how life works when you\u2019re trying to live in Manhattan on a\nlow income.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn short, what you are supporting with your Patreon\ncontributions is literally my ability to live and work on the things you enjoy\nreading about.  I have the time to write\nbecause I don\u2019t have to scramble to find other gigs.  I have the energy to write because I\u2019m less\nanxious about paying bills and getting sick. \nAnd I can push myself to finish something that night by letting myself\norder in instead of stopping to cook. \nThese things are small and banal, but they are the substance of\nintellectual activity, literally.  The\nmore support I have on Patreon, the more net time I can put into thinking,\ntweeting, and writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first started this Patreon a year ago, I felt very embarrassed about it. \u00a0I was raised with a strong work ethic and even though I was genuinely working and genuinely broke it felt like asking for a handout. \u00a0A year later, I\u0027m a lot less embarrassed about it, because I can honestly say that the difference these extra funds make in my life genuinely alters my ability to sit, focus, and write. \u00a0Not having to worry about health insurance or scramble for rent if a regular gig falls short is a pretty big weight off my mind. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u2019m Asking For\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn the last couple of months my work has been spurred by circumstances\nto a higher level of written, as opposed to Tweeted, output.  I\u2019ve actually assembled and finished some\nstand-alone pieces that have been either published or put on-line here on\nPatreon.  I will continue to put new\nshort texts up, and I\u2019m working on two longer texts which will be released as\ne-books in the next few months.  The\nfirst of these, \u003cem\u003eNotes on the University\u003c/em\u003e, will be available to every\nPatreon supporter for free as promised in the first version of this fundraising\neffort, way back when.  That writing is\nbeing supported by your Patreon contributions.  The draft version of that text, at roughly 16k\nwords, is now online for all supporters. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m also conducting a lecture series at Postmasters Gallery\nin Manhattan, currently open-ended, which will result in a collected product,\nwritten or otherwise, at the end of the project.  Neither I nor the gallery nor the speakers\nI\u2019m inviting to read in my place each session are profiting from the series,\nbut your donations give me time to write each lecture.  The first lecture is already available for\nall Patreon supporters; your contributions are funding the next ones.  For each lecture I\u2019m also designing a small\nbooklet, which also takes a few hours.  And\nthere are a couple of other collaborations in the works that I hope to announce\nsoon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn short, over the past year or so, this Patreon has shifted\nslightly from a \u201cHelp me get on my feet so I can write\u201d appeal to a \u201cHelp me\nstay on my feet so I can keep writing\u201d appeal. \nOn my end, that feels like pretty great news.  I\u2019m asking for is your continued support, so\nI can keep doing what I\u2019m doing.  I want\nto lecture series at Postmasters to continue for a while.  I need time for that.  I want to finish the two e-books I\u2019m working\non.  I need time for that.  I want the other collaborations I\u2019m working\non to come to fruition.  I need time for\nthat.  And once I\u2019ve checked all of those\nboxes I have other projects I want to work on, most important of which are the\nthree-volume history of philosophy I\u2019ve been talking about forever, and a\nmeatspace seminar on Spinoza that I\u2019ve been threatening to hold for almost as\nlong.  The lecture series at Postmasters\nis definitely a step in that direction as I navigate the particular\ncircumstances of being semi-anonymous. \nTime, as we know, is money. \nSupport on Patreon equals written output from me.  It\u2019s that simple.  Any support you can give will be welcome and\ngenuinely appreciated, and will go towards keeping me alive and healthy while I\nwrite.  I have cool plans in the works,\nbut for the sake of honesty I want to be clear about what I\u2019m asking for:  patronage. \nI\u2019m asking for time to sit and read and think and write.  Everything else will be a bonus, and I\u2019ll do\nmy best to make the bonuses worth your while.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m\nobviously planning to keep tweeting constantly. \nI am still hoping to get back to regularly updating my Tumblr.  I know I\u2019ve been promising to do that for a\nwhile and I\u2019m annoyed that I haven\u2019t been able to get that done, but onward and\nupward.  I plan to post a new 10-15 page\ntext once a month until the lecture series is done.  These texts won\u2019t be the same as the lecture\nseries, but they will be related, either notes in preparation, summaries of\ntexts I\u2019m reading, or leftover material from the writing.  That will counterbalance slightly the fact\nthat your Patreon money is supporting a lecture series you might not be able to\nattend.  I am committed to six lectures\nin the first set.  I would like to get to\n12, and it would be awesome to make it to 18. \nBut enthusiasm will only cover so many bills.  So I\u2019m asking for your continued help. \u00a0I am constantly thankful for the support I\u0027ve gotten through this website. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
