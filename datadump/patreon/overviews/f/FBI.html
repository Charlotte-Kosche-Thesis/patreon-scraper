Better still, either tell us about someone who helped you so we can say \"cheers!\", or advertise your offer of help for others. If you are part of the boating community already, or have skills you could offer to the community, we\u0027d be really excited to hear from you. We would love to collaborate on projects that help you continue to get out there and live the dream. See the blog for details about how we can help you support your cruising.\u003cbr\u003e"
