    "summary": "Hey, I\u0027m Vee! Thanks so much for stopping by. I\u0027m 19, a Scorpio, and very trans and queer. You probably know me from Twitter (@findmereading) where I mostly talk about LGBTQIA+ YA fiction and share way too much about my personal life! I\u0027m a writer, musician, and actor. I\u0027m also the admin and co-founder of GayYA.org \u0026amp; @trans_lit. Mostly, I\u0027m just trying my hardest to spread joy, and get through this fucking year. I use they/them pronouns. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat To Expect\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing since I was child, but I haven\u0027t shared almost any of my work publicly, besides a couple of essays. Since writing (\u0026amp; publishing!) is a major part of what I want to do with my life, I want to get in the practice of putting my work out there. Over the past two years, I\u0027ve tried to push myself to publish things. Unfortunately, my family has dealt with a massive amount of health issues these past few years, and because of that, I haven\u0027t allowed myself the freedom of focusing on writing. It\u0027s seemed frivolous and unimportant compared to what\u0027s going on at home. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided to start this now after several conversations with my therapist. She\u0027s kept repeating this idea of \"you have to put on your own oxygen mask before assisting others.\" I\u0027m at a place right now where I need to take care of myself and focus on the things I love, instead of using all my energy to support. But, I still\u00a0know that I won\u0027t start focusing on those things unless I can somehow make myself. If I don\u0027t have that pressure, the health issues will always come first. Knowing there are people who are paying (even just a dollar or two!) \u0026amp; expecting to see work from me is the push that I need.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far as I can tell, this is a fairly unorthodox way of using Patreon. It seems that most creators\u00a0have put stuff out for awhile, and set up a Patreon to secure financial support. I have put very, very little out, and am using what monetary support people are willing to offer as a kick in the pants to get me to actually put my work out there. That model might not work for all subscribers, so definitely feel free to add/drop support whenever feels right to you. This is an ongoing experiment, and it may not be what some people are looking for. There\u0027s no need to feel guilty if it\u0027s not for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who are interested in supporting me on this journey \u003cem\u003ethank you. \u003c/em\u003eThis is not just a creative journey, but a personal journey, and you are helping me to not only create art but create myself in the world, simply by making me focus on the things that I love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
