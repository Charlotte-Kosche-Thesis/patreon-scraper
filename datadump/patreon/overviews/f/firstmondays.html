    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eUPDATE\u00a0December\u00a011, 2017: \u003c/em\u003eOur Patreon campaign, originally launched in February, has been a huge success. We\u0027re stable, Melody gets paid every month, the show is sustainable going forward, and we\u0027re starting to have sponsors for some of the episodes. As a result, we\u0027ve retooled our Patreon rewards a bit in order to recognize where we stand today. Going forward, we\u0027re going to provide a lot more value at the $5 tier\u2014not just bonus episodes, but also ad-free regular episodes, live-streams of the recording sessions, access to the Slack group, and more. Basically, we want you to subscribe on Patreon if you want more First Mondays\u2014and we want to make sure it\u0027s a good value for our devoted Firsties.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBelow is our original message from when we first launched the campaign in February 2017.\u003cbr\u003e----------------\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst Mondays is a podcast covering the work of the Supreme Court\u2014sort of a weekly playbook. When we first started it,\u00a0we thought we\u0027d have a couple dozen listeners: our families, friends, co-clerks, and certainly no more than five or six of the Justices themselves. But in just a few months, the show has gotten way bigger than we\u0027d ever expected. Every week, thousands of dedicated Firsties are listening, calling the hotline, sending us their questions demented, and tweeting about how wrong we are. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to keep this train rolling, and make First Mondays your go-to source for SCOTUS news and analysis for years to come. \u00a0In fact, we\u0027ve got a lot of cool ideas in the works to make the show even better. \u00a0But thus far, it\u0027s all been a labor of love\u2014we\u0027ve financed it all on our dime. \u00a0To make this project sustainable for the long term, and to make it possible to do all the new and exciting things we have in mind, we need help from our dedicated Firsties. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main thing your patronage will help us cover is our production costs. Producing multiple high-quality episodes each month isn\u0027t cheap: for one thing, we\u0027ve got to pay our producer, Melody, who helps us sound like we aren\u0027t doing most episodes live from the Supreme Court\u0027s bathrooms. We also need to pay for web hosting, equipment, and (of course) ever-more-lavish artwork in Historic First Mondays Studios.\u00a0We also want to make \u003cstrong\u003emore\u003c/strong\u003e episodes: bonus content, a summer series, and lots more. But that\u0027s just the beginning: we want to have live tapings in cities across the country, \u00a0new intro music, and fun merchandise. (A #StayFirstie mug? A \"Questions Demented\" game that is a barely-concealed rip-off of Cards Against Humanity? Who knows!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support, in other words, is what will enable this project to keep going. We\u0027ll keep recording, keep venturing fearless predictions that inevitably turn out to be wrong, and\u2014most importantly\u2014we\u0027ll stay independent. We always call it like we see it, and we don\u0027t want to be beholden to anyone but you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re really, really excited about the future of First Mondays. We\u0027ve barely gotten started. Right now, we\u0027re basically like the early volumes of the U.S. Reports that aren\u0027t even Supreme Court decisions yet. Help us take this thing to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay Firstie, my friends.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2014The First Mondays Guys"
