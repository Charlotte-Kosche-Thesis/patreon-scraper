My the first book from my\u00a0\n\t\u003cem\u003eDiary Of A Life For Rent \u003c/em\u003etrilogy is almost fully written and will soon be going through that dreaded editing stage.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0What I would like to do is invite you along for the creative ride and get not only early access to the book before it is officially published but I would also love to get your feedback and input.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIf you would like to be a beta reader for me, then you will get to read the book chapter by chapter on this site for completely free on the lead up to it being published. All I ask is that each time you read a chapter you add a like, comment, or both. This feedback will be extremely helpful during the writing process.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tPosting schedule...\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe plan is to release the book as it is written in bite size \"mini episodes\". Feedback and comments along the way will be highly welcome and greatly appreciated.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWhy support me?\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe rewards, either that or for the love of supporting my work, that of course is for you to decide hehe. Although yes it is free to read my work, you may have noticed there is an option to donate. This is completely optional but if you would like to take a look, these donations come with various rewards. Depending on which level you choose, you will receive various rewards, including... Early access to each chapter as it is released, copies of my book once it is published, recognition for your contributions, plus merchandise. All money raised will go toward upgrading my equipment, editing costs, and other costings towards publishing the book.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0_______________________________\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAre you new to Patreon? Want to know what it\u0027s all about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a simple way for readers/fans to contribute to my work for as little as $1 per month. When deciding how to share my books, I had considered writing the conventional way of writing my book then self publishing or searching for a book deal but instead I decided to let you the reader read my book as it is being written. I thought this would not only provide a great opportunity for me to receive feedback along the way but it would also give you the readers a chance to read the unedited and raw copy of the book before it undergoes the final editing process and being officially published. Your feedback could make all the difference.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI would like to a huge thank all of my readers for all of your support and your contributions.
