I\u0027m a 21 year old, full-time student studying Fine Arts and aiming for that Bachelors degree. I\u0027m a writer and artist, often combining the two. I love drawing different characters with watercolors, acrylic paints, alcohol based markers, ink, graphite, charcoal, conte, and digital media. I\u0027m currently working on a webcomic I hope to release to Line Webtoons and I\u0027m a writer for Wattpad.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a passion for fantasy, drama, and romance, which is the main plot frame for my work. I incorporate the LGBTQ community in my work, sometimes featuring same sex couples in my stories and art pieces.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping to push myself as a writer and an artist for the new year. I love telling stories and creating art to go with it! I really hope you enjoy my work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I here: \u003c/strong\u003eI want to use Patreon to push me in the direction of my dreams to author and illustrate while sharing my passion with those who support me. I want to fund my ambitions and hopefully start my own business, maybe inspiring others to do the same. I want to create more and Patreon would be my motivation to do it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards: \u003c/strong\u003eBecoming a Patron will grant you access to doodles, prints, character profiles, and exclusive novels!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for visiting my Patreon and I hope you stick around for all that is to come!\u003c/strong\u003e"
