The stories are told to the best each guest\u0027s recollection, usually in the first person. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave a listen to get a better idea:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.fallinguphill.org/episode-1-the-chairman/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEp. 1 - \"The Chairman\"\u003c/a\u003e - All Vito wanted to do was make a little extra cash so he could move out of his mom and dad\u2019s place and take his film career to the next level. This isn\u2019t what he had in mind. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.fallinguphill.org/episode-2-smoking-is-good-for-you/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEp. 2 - \"Smoking is Good for You\"\u003c/a\u003e - A theater geek gets the callback he never wanted during the height of The Vietnam War. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.fallinguphill.org/falling-uphill-episode-3-center-of-the-universe/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEp. 3 - \"Center of the Universe\"\u003c/a\u003e - For this Godless Angeleno and his girl, nothing says romance like attending a Geocentrist convention in Indiana.\u003cbr\u003eI am seeking funding for: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEquipment Upgrades\u003c/strong\u003e - My recording equipment, audio editing software, and the laptop I use to produce the show are relatively primitive.

This is helpful, but in the future I would like to be able to be able to choose from a greater selection of songs and sounds including using material from sources that require licensing fees. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInterviewing/Recording Space\u003c/strong\u003e - I am based in New York, so I do not have room to host guests and have paid to rent rehearsal space more than once. These are usually dance studios where the acoustics are less than stellar and there is background noise. I would like to be able to rent space in an actual recording studio or at least have an operating budget other than earnings from my dayjob to continue renting out rehearsal space when I need it. I also may need to travel out of town to interview guests at some point all which would involve transportation costs. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIllustrators\u003c/strong\u003e - I would like to be able to offer illustrators more than \"exposure\" on the podcast\u0027s site. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLive Events\u003c/strong\u003e - At some point I may want to hold live tapings of the podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCourses\u003c/strong\u003e related to enhancing the show\u0027s production - i.e. audio engineering, web design\u003cbr\u003e"
