We\u0027re Missy and Merri, and we\u0027re making podcasts discussing nerdy pop culture, intersectional feminism, and the ways media can do better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor us, this has been and will always be a labor of love. We started this podcast not because we wanted to make money but because we wanted a creative outlet, and, over a year after its launch, we\u0027re still loving every minute of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut as time goes on, our dreams are getting bigger. We\u0027ve made big strides in audio quality and editing in the past year, but we can do better. To do better, we need better equipment. We want to meet more of you and interact with you on a more personal basis, but the time investment and costs of traveling to conventions are more than we can afford. We want to branch out into video and do more episodes, but that means taking time off from our paying jobs to get it done.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that\u0027s where you can help! If you like what we do, your financial contribution can help us make a bigger, better, more awesome podcast. More episodes, more guests, more convention coverage. We\u0027ll even cover your favorite media if you donate enough.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFake Geek Girls has always been free and will always be free - we have no intention of charging for our content. But for people who want to help us out and encourage us to reach even higher, we want to do a little extra - bonus episodes, personal chats, and so on, as a way of thanking you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re grateful for all the support we\u0027ve had so far. We couldn\u0027t do it without all of you emailing us and telling us your thoughts. You\u0027re the best!"
