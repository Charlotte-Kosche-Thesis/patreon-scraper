My name is Daniel Netzel, and I make video essays over at\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/filmradar\"\u003e Film Radar\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideo essays, in many ways, go against the entire status quo on YouTube. They\u0027re long form, educational videos that seek to broaden one\u0027s understanding of the arts, and often attempt to capture a level of professionalism that is largely absent on the platform. This means hundreds of hours of work on every video: between research, writing, editing, voiceover, graphic design, animation, sound mixing; and that doesn\u0027t even include everything that goes into the job once the video is finished and time for publication, like metadata and SEO and all of that fun stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe unfortunate and inherent downside to running this sort of channel means that under the current YouTube payout system, it\u0027s a lot of work for little reward. These videos don\u0027t have the same viral potential as a cat sneezing on a baby, or a drunk Russian teenager jumping off of a building. They\u0027re not filled with dank memes, clickbait news, or Jake Paul, and as such struggle to get the views necessary to make relying solely on ad revenue a possibility, and instead channels such as my own rely on sponsorship deals, freelance editing work, or donations from kindly strangers such as yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven as little as \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e$1 per month\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0can make a huge difference, as is the case in any sort of crowd funding environment. If \u003cem\u003e20% of my current subscribers\u003c/em\u003e on YouTube were to pledge $1 per month, I\u0027d have enough money to focus entirely on the craft, and spend less time worrying how I\u0027m going to keep feeding myself for the rest of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you enjoy the content that I make, if you find any value in what I\u0027m doing and would like to see me continue, then please consider becoming a Patron of my channel. I\u0027ve got some rewards if you\u0027re interested in that sort of thing, and I\u0027m always open to suggestions for other reward tiers as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
