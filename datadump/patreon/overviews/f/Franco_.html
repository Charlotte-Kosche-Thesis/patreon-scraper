I draw everyday! \u00a0Somethings are for companies that hire me, I have and continue to work for some of the biggest names like DC comics, DarkHorse comics, IDW, Archie and Valiant.\u00a0 I create artwork not only for them, sometimes I create for my sites or sketches for paintings and/or commissions and others are just doodles that I doodle for fun. But sometimes I just want to create stories and Artwork for me... stories that are created by me for you...no filter...no companies...just from me to you. I have some really cool plans for the future as I\u0027m creating a brand new comic that i will be posting right here on this page and I\u0027m hoping you would like to be a part of it all.\u00a0With your help my friend Scoot and I were able to produce the amazing comic book adventure called: SPOT on ADVENTURE! (which you can still read here if you help support our continued efforts.) We were able to do this in a unique and exciting way and is now a published work by a major comic book company: Action Lab Entertainment! \u003cbr\u003eI love stories in all their formats whether it be comic books, novels and/or movies! \u00a0Although I work for other companies and characters, it\u0027s especially meaningful when it is something creator owned which means we DON\u0027T get paid for it. This is where I turn to you comic loving people! I\u0027m creating brand new creator owned comics and I get to show you behind the scenes as work it is created and talk about all things in our pop culture world! \u00a0See the story come together, check out sketches you won\u0027t see anywhere else, I will also post content you can only see here as a member of this page!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!"
