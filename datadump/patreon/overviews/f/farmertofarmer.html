    "summary": "If you\u0027re here, you probably know all about the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.farmertofarmerpodcast.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFarmer to Farmer Podcast\u003c/a\u003e. Patreon provides a way for you to support the show, which allows us to keep the tractor running.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou pledge a certain amount for each episode I publish, and Patreon bills you monthly. Think of it like Kickstarter, except that the project is ongoing\u00a0\u2013 we need to\nkeep greasing those zerks to keep the podcast machinery operating smoothly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\u2019ve got some fundraising goals over there to the right (if\nyou\u2019re reading this on your desktop), to give you an idea of how the money we\nraise will be spent. And we\u2019ve got some fun rewards, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve spent twenty-seven years in the world of agriculture. I\nhad the good fortune early on to work for and with some really great farmers,\nand when I started my own farm, the stories and the information they had shared\nwere instrumental in my success.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI started the Farmer to Farmer Podcast because sharing\nbetween farmers is such a hallmark of the local and organic farming movement \u2013\nI can\u2019t think of another industry that is so freely giving of the tricks and\ntools of the trade, even among direct competitors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve spent most of my career engaged in that exchange \u2013 teaching\nworkshops, hosting field days, writing articles. I spent thirteen years\ncoordinating presentations and co-directing the MOSES Organic Farming\nConference, which meant I didn\u2019t go to any of the workshops \u2013 but I did get the\naudio of all of the workshops, and they kept me company while I drove the\ndelivery truck each Friday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd audio is such an amazing way to learn. Unlike reading or\nwatching a video, audio does not require your full attention. And Farmer to\nFarmer Podcast listeners have told me that they tune in on the tractor, in the\nfarmers market truck, and while they\u2019re washing carrots.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen I started the show, I had no idea that it would have\nthe impact it\u2019s had. I thought it was pretty neat, but I\u2019ve been blown away by\nthe reception it\u2019s received. It reminds me of going to farmer\u2019s market each\nweek, and having people actually buy and eat this thing that I had taken part\nin creating. It\u2019s such an honor that guests show up \u2013 even in the middle of the\nsummer! \u2013 and that you and thousands of other people tune in each week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so much for your support, whether you make a\ncontribution or just tune in and talk about the show with your friends. And I\nmean that, from the bottom of my heart.\u003cbr\u003e"
