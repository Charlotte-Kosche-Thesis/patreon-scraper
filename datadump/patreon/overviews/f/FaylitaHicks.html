(First lady champ in the city!) In 2011, I sold everything I owned and hopped a bus on my first national tour, hitting 23 cities in 3 months and covering everything from coffee shop crowds to sold-out concert venues. \u00a0In 2013, I joined up with the Hip-Hop/Boom Bap type collective, Grid Squid Entertainment, and have been touring with them as well as featuring as a solo act. \u00a0It\u0027s been exciting. And tough.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had several loved ones pass away, struggled through paying for my own college education and in 2012, became a birth mother. Every time life got rough, the writing has given me release. Bringing that writing to life--by getting on stage to express myself in a way that every day life doesn\u0027t always allow for--has helped me to become a better version of myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of that and the hardest part about doing what I love (writing, poetry, music, performance, etc.) \u00a0is that I never have enough time to focus on it, develop it and get it to my audience the way I want to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1268.photobucket.com/albums/jj578/Faylitah/df12bc61-eeb3-4cf5-b7bf-1be269c10f0d_zpspltplnyr.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I have to offer is substantial.
