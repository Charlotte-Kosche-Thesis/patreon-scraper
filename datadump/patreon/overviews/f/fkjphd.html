    "summary": "Feminist Killjoys, PhD is a podcast featuring two self-identified feminist professors, Dr. Melody Hoffmann and Dr. Raechel Anne Jolie. The podcast focuses on discussions of politics and pop culture through a feminist lens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur desire to do the podcast was born of a few dreams: first, we are dedicated to using our voices in a society that tells us that, as women, we should keep quiet. We believe that taking up space on the airwaves talking about politics and pop culture is empowering, and that it can set an inspiring example to other young women/trans/non-binary/femme folks whose opinions and thoughts on these issues has been stifled by sexism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, we are passionate about bringing our education privilege to a wider audience. Not everyone has the opportunity or access to attend college, so we want to use our podcast as a way to make college-level feminist analysis accessible to the masses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, this project reflects the beauty of lady friendship! Far too often, media and society tells us that women are pitted against each other. In reality, there are so many examples of how the bond between women can be a platform for kindness, creativity, and innovation. We love that our friendship is the catalyst for such an exciting project and we want to inspire other lady/femme friends to do the same!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat your funds will help with:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eStarting and maintaining a podcast requires a lot of time and resources! All of the money we raise will go to maintaining and then improving the podcast. We\u0027ve already invested a few hundred dollars into website and RSS hosting fees and equipment and we\u0027re excited about upgrading in the future to produce an even more polished product. The money will also provide each of us a small stipend over the summer so we can work on the podcast without having to pick up an extra job between school years, and will also ensure we can keep bringing this to you ad-free!"
