    "summary": "My name is Andrea and my husbands name is Hadar. I moved to Israel to live with Hadar eight years ago. We have decided that living in America would mean having a better and easier life for us and our kids. We have a 5-year-old boy named Rafael, and a one-year-old baby girl named Abigail. We are not in a position to move overseas on our own. It goes against our character to ask for help, but we feel very strongly about moving. We don\u0027t know what else to do, but to ask the community for help. We would like to move within two years, and we have begun the process of downsizing and selling off everything we own. I haven\u0027t seen my family in about five years, including my first born son, Zebulin, who just turned 20. We have a plan to live a certain way which would not be extravagant, and includes \"tiny house\" living, until we are able to find work in America, and get on our feet. Hadar works with F-35\u0027s in the Air Force in Israel and would love a job that offers this same experience in civilian life, in America. We will be living in a small town that is equal distance to Ocala, Daytona, and Orlando, Florida. If you can offer advice, help, or any monetary support, it would mean everything to us!"

We are working a total of three jobs right now, in order to afford to move as soon as possible. We need $4,000 for plane tickets for four people, plus one Kitty human. We also have to get a place to live and a car to drive to work. We have to start all over again, and while that is very exciting, it\u0027s also a lot of big expenses all at once.
