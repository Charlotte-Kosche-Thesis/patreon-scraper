This is all new to me, though, so there may be times I have to skip an update, you\u00a0 know, for \u003cem\u003ereasons\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that said, this is where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t do this alone,\u00a0 Patreon will allow you to help me create the stories I post by.\u00a0 Don\u0027t get me wrong, the comic will be free to read \u003ca href=\"http://walkaboutonline.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eelsewhere\u003c/a\u003e, but if you want to help keep Walkabout on it\u0027s toes, any amount would be greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e"
