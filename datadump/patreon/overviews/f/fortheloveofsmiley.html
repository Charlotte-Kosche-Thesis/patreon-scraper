Without you all, I don\u0027t know how I would have gotten through his last months and during the time after we let him go. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love for you to join me on a special journey of \u003cstrong\u003eSmiley\u0027s Legacy. \u003c/strong\u003eMy first mission is to have a bronze statue of Smiley in our town so that he is never forgotten, and can continue to teach others his life lessons. I want you to be part of this, and to feel this statue belongs to you as well, because it will. Smiley belonged to the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy joining me in this process and becoming a Patron\u00a0of\u003cstrong\u003e For the Love of Smiley\u003c/strong\u003e you will initially be able to watch behind the scenes of the sculpting and production of the statue. I want to share the experience with you and my private thoughts during the process. You\u0027ll have access to special Patron-Only content and will be able to purchase exclusive, limited edition merchandise to help us raise more funds. You will also receive a special Smiley postcard in the mail. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce the status is built, we hope you will continue to support us and we will use the monthly funds to assist with other special-needs dogs, and to fund educational projects for kids using Smiley\u0027s life-lessons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can choose to pay as much, or as little, as you wish to support us and there are special rewards for $1+ and $5+ pledges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for being part of Smiley\u0027s journey of love so far and I truly hope you will join me for this next stage to help keep Smiley\u0027s message of \u003cstrong\u003e\u0027Seeing With Your Heart\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoanne x"
