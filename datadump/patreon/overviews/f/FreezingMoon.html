A lot of games are being made with the sole purpose of generating stupid amounts of money with minimal work. Shovelware, Vaporware, Pay-to-Play and Pay-to-Win social scams everywhere. Developers \u003cdel\u003eworking\u003c/del\u003e\u00a0slaving all day long for semi-crappy wages to make games they don\u0027t like, really looking forward to check out from workplace and run home to get some sleep for a few hours, only to repeat the whole thing the next day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBig company from my country tried a lot of times to recruit me in their zombie army as well.\u003cbr\u003eI constantly refused them, I would rather fail miserably and even starve to death.\u003cbr\u003eI believe that if you don\u0027t want to make something, then you shouldn\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003eSelling your soul to buy crap that you don\u0027t need is not living, it\u0027s dying.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything is copyrighted, trademarked and owned. When you buy a game you don\u0027t actually own it, you just get a copy with tons of restrictions, nowadays it\u0027s not even something physical anymore...\u003cbr\u003eThere are a lot of games that used to be really awesome but now feel that they aged because of technological progress, we\u0027re talking graphical details, operating systems and hardware generations.\u003cbr\u003eGame franchises that used to be gems either got milked to the fullest or simply forgotten, while fans crave for a decent sequel more than one decade later now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe solution\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEven on this website, I see a lot of crap being funded.\u003cbr\u003eMoney is the tool that can be used to good use in order to improve things and change the world, but as everything, it\u0027s dual edged, so using money in a bad way can cause a lot of bad stuff to happen. Simple as that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to work full time doing what I love. I want to develop free open source games for you and everybody else, with your help of course. I want to empower others to have the same chance too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou should be the change you want to see in the world. Powerful words that I live by nowadays.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m dedicating my life to set and example and change the video game industry as we know it.\u003cbr\u003eFor me game development is all about accessibility, freedom, fairness, quality and love.\u003cbr\u003eI focus on games that can run on pretty much any device without having to install anything.\u003cbr\u003eGames that aren\u0027t under DRM or restrictive \"don\u0027t touch\" type of licenses, you should always be free to look under the hood, change stuff, experiment, learn, improve and share along and be able to pick up any part from the project and use it in your own, totally free of charge, all it takes is giving credit where it\u0027s due. When it comes to online gaming, all players should have same gameplay advantages even if they don\u0027t invest any money into the game. It\u0027s ok for a project to generate income for maintenance and development in order to sustain itself, but there\u0027s a fine line between that and abusing players, milking them of every cent possible, which is a very evil thing to do in my opinion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://AncientBeast.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ancientbeast.com/images/AncientBeast.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where the revolution in the competitive gaming industry begins. Right now, with your help!\u00a0The goal is to create one of the best strategy games ever, that you can play for free, on pretty much any device, either alone or with with your friends. Not only the game is free but it will also allow you to make money in various ways. The artwork, music and source code are under open source licenses CC-BY-SA 3.0 and AGPL), meaning you can use anything you see fit for your very own (commercial) projects, without having to pay anything at all! All we ask in that regard is crediting the project (and artist where the case) and hopefully linking to the project website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can think of it as the reverse of Super Smash Bros Brawl, but instead of having lots of existing known characters from a lot of other games, they mainly debut in this project, so if you\u0027re a fellow game developer, you can use any of the creatures in your existing game or start one from scratch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is playable right from your browser, without having to install anything. It\u0027s accessible, easy to learn, yet takes a lifetime to master, very fun to play with friends and strangers alike and doesn\u0027t rely on chances at all! It\u0027s like Kung-Fu for your brain, a way more awesome and less awkward chess game. The main goal of the game is to use your main unit, the Dark Priest and materialize and control units as you go along, just like picking the most suitable for the job, while trying to get in the mind of your opponent and anticipate his moves in order to defeat him. It\u0027s highly replayable and addictive! It can be played 1vs1 or 2vs2 in a lot of game modes, one more fun than the other :)\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://AncientBeast.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://AncientBeast.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMore projects are being developed given enough time and love:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrank\u0027n\u0027Shirt\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStatus:\u003c/strong\u003e pre-alpha prototype\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGenre:\u003c/strong\u003e Adventure\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInspiration:\u003c/strong\u003e Spike in Transylvania, The Binding of Isaac\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003ePlot\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eYou are Frank and you were just screwing around with Vampirella at her place while her husband, Dracula, was in a business trip.
