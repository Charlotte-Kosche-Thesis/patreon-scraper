I worked\u00a0with soft\u00a0plasticine models.\u00a0I remember it\u00a0being\u00a0quite a challenge....plasticine isn\u0027t the best medium to work with under a hot movie light!\u00a0I also have a great interest in astronomy. I\u00a0have been an amateur astronomer most of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e With\u00a0support from Patreon I hope\u00a0to continue\u00a0what I\u00a0love doing including\u00a0making scientific\u00a0discoveries and\u00a0creating short\u00a0entertaining films that I hope will make\u00a0people smile and laugh. Films featuring many varied subjects\u00a0including catching rare natural weather phenomena on film\u00a0and both naked eye astronomy DSLR\u00a0astrophotography and\u00a0through the telescope astronomy plus lots lots more....I am not short on ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have several\u00a0fossil projects planned\u00a0and in preparation all of which require funding. One project I have planned is to\u00a0publish my own book on fossils. Another is to\u00a0search for new discoveries in my collection of\u00a0rare Hastings \u0027firestorm\u0027\u00a0amber.\u00a0I would also like to receive proper\u00a0credit for my\u00a0discoveries, which isn\u0027t guaranteed should one decide to donate a specimen, by\u00a0bringing to light through doing\u00a0my own research other significant scientific specimens\u00a0I have discovered that are left sitting on shelves\u00a0in my private collection. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother fossil source material in which discoveries are made is in a sediment material known as Hastings bone bed - collected ex-situ\u00a0loose chunks of rock of various sizes\u00a0which can be packed with micro-fossil vertebrate fauna.\u00a0It will take me a while to process, but finding\u00a0the time to\u00a0do this\u00a0will be\u00a0difficult due to lack of funding.\u00a0I am entirely\u00a0self-funded\u00a0which means I have to concentrate most on making extra\u00a0revenue by selling off less important parts of my collection to museums and\u00a0private\u00a0collectors. But that is a good thing because the important fossils are put aside for future research. And the collection is constantly being replenished with new finds. The problem is that it takes up a lot of my time trying to\u00a0create extra revenue. If I didn\u0027t have to\u00a0spend\u00a0so much of\u00a0my\u00a0time searching for repositories and the\u00a0like, I would have so\u00a0much\u00a0more time to make discoveries and I would be in a much better position to be able to donate specimens once I have completed my research on them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would very much like to continue making discoveries. The amber has the potential to reveal a vast eco-system of new species including micro-organisms, plants and small animals - insects mostly. However, this will take time and requires proper funding.\u00a0As I have mentioned already,\u00a0I am entirely self-funded. But\u00a0your help and generous support through Patreon will allow me to focus on these projects full time and continue with my passion of searching for new scientific discoveries. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is such\u00a0an exciting\u00a0venture to be involved in, let us make this all happen together generous patrons! I value ALL your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eSome background\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome years ago following my redundancy from my full time job I was left\u00a0at a cross roads in my life. Then quite by chance during a walk along\u00a0my local beach\u00a0I happened to find a curious looking object that was\u00a0lying loose\u00a0on the surface. I\u00a0knew hardly nothing about fossils being discovered at this locality.\u00a0This find caught my attention like nothing else! I showed it to\u00a0a\u00a0guy I knew (Frank)\u00a0who happened\u00a0to be on the beach metal detecting at the time. Straight away he told me\u00a0what I had found. It was a dinosaur fossil bone, he said, without a doubt! Frank had been collecting the bones of dinosaurs for some time, and he showed me his collection\u00a0of\u00a0fossils in his garage\u00a0which\u00a0he had\u00a0found\u00a0on the\u00a0same beach.\u00a0Prior to finding this curious bone I\u00a0knew for a long time that dinosaur footprints were preserved on the\u00a0beach - many years ago I remember seeing a plaster cast of a dinosaur footprint\u00a0on display in the Bexhill De La Warr Pavilion,\u00a0but not fossils like this.\u00a0Immediately I was\u00a0hooked! Slowly I began to find\u00a0more and more fossils, not just dinosaur but a variety of animals\u00a0including fish, turtle, crocodilians, lizards, amphibians, insects,\u00a0plants and even fossils of\u00a0flying reptiles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hobby gradually turned into a small niche supply\u00a0business where I would offer\u00a0a carefully chosen selection of\u00a0my finds to museums and if they weren\u0027t interested I would\u00a0offer them to collectors instead. Over the years I became more deeply\u00a0involved,\u00a0my interest had become my avocation, my passion for fossils had completely\u00a0taken over, leaving little time to do other things. I would be\u00a0hunting for fossils, visiting the the beach three or four times a month, all year round, emulating other local fossil hunters long before I came along. Fossils aren\u0027t often\u00a0collected perfect ready to display\u00a0from the ground. Most fossils contain a natural\u00a0matrix (hard rock)\u00a0jacket. They require\u00a0a lot of preparation. Research\u00a0is also very time consuming. But it\u00a0has all been\u00a0worthwhile.\u00a0I have made some great\u00a0discoveries. The amber I collected\u00a0requires processing which\u00a0can be\u00a0extremely time consuming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCollectors\u00a0really appreciate the\u00a0fossils I\u00a0find. Pictures of\u00a0a\u00a0small selection of my best finds can be seen at the top of this page.\u00a0I have donated specimens to museums as well including a block with a partial dinosaur\u00a0skeleton inside! The best feeling I get from all of this is that I am helping to salvage fossils in all weathers from one of Britain\u0027s best dinosaur fossil localities situated on the south east coast before they are gone forever by constant erosion from the elements. I now have a fair size collection of fossils (still not comparable to other collectors collections, some of which are vast) which I would like to concentrate on getting the most\u00a0interesting ones published in a new\u00a0book \u0027Fossil Discoveries\u0027 A guide to collecting fossils (working title) Vol. I. But this is further down the line. I hope Patreon can help me get this into print....I know everyone,\u00a0not just\u00a0collectors, will\u00a0love it! A couple of years ago I announced on a public fossil forum\u00a0my ambition\u00a0to start my own museum featuring\u00a0my collection. This is a dream of many fossil collectors but I am making serious efforts to make this happen! I hope my Patreon followers can help me achieve\u00a0my dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for\u00a0stopping by and for\u00a0your generous\u00a0support!\u003cbr\u003eJamie\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://westparadefossils.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://westparadefossils.co.uk/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy one-in-a-million Perseid meteor astroshot.
