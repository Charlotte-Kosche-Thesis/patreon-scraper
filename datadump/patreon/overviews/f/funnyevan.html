    "summary": "Hello Patreonizers,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Evan Wecksell and I am a comedian, singer-songwriter and even an\u00a0SAT/ACT tutor. As a comedian I have performed in 46 states at hundreds of clubs, colleges and private parties. You may recognize me from those pop culture talking head shows such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBAlr1-WpNA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVH1\u0027s \"I Love the 80s\"\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBAlr1-WpNA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eE!\u0027s \"30 Outrageous Celebrity Feuds.\"\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had been thinking about having my own podcast for a few years, but didn\u0027t know which creative direction to take it. I am a huge fan of New York sports, WWE, comedy, TV, movies and politics, but I didn\u0027t want to back myself into one category. Then I thought about how I used to work in human resources and had a knack to interview anyone and make them feel important (or create awkward pauses). The question now was where do I find my random people to interview? The answer:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/awkwardwithevan\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFACEBOOK\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI went on a very early Facebook binge back in 2004 where I added thousands of friends, i.e. strangers, whether they went to my college (\u003ca href=\"http://www.tufts.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTufts University\u003c/a\u003e) or just had the same name as me. Even though Facebook ended up capping the friend count at 5,000\u00a0I had built a friend list that continues to evolve thanks to my frequent traveling. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know who a lot of my Facebook friends are, or I may have not talked to someone for over a decade, but it sure would be fun to reconnect and see how smart (or crazy) they got. And socially, I match up pretty well with this \"Family Guy\" clip:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U2HMxiSF5w0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother purpose of this podcast is to give someone, whose life/job does not include doing interviews, an extended opportunity to open up and voice their opinions and hot takes on anything that\u0027s on their mind. They would then have something cool to share with their friends and if they were ever searched on iTunes, their name would come up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please support this show as this is the biggest DIY project I have ever undertaken. There is a wide variety of patron perks and I would be thrilled to have you as part of \"The Awkward Army.\" It would be as epic as the intro video, which is the podcast\u0027s trailer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love,\u003cbr\u003eEvan\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.FunnyEvan.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.FunnyEvan.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.awkwardwithevan.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.AwkwardWithEvan.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
