I make videos in my spare time; as of late, its been focused on covering the Super Smash Brother\u0027s competitive community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat\u0027s the point of your Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe videos I\u0027ve been creating have become increasingly more time and resource intensive! From 2 minute videos using just game clips to player interviews, voice actor narration, attending tournaments to film, and doing the sound design in 5.1 Surround Sound (That last one was a little extra, admittedly... but hey, why not?) Up until now I did everything myself and only dragged my friend Brandon (shout outs to you, btw!) into my schemes. But the intensity of my latest project, Rivalries: ZeRo vs Ally made me realize that \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ea) The projects I want to make are getting to a size where it\u0027s too time and resource intensive to continue doing consistently\u003cbr\u003eb) The growing scope of my projects make working alone much more difficult, especially with no budget\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, after much deliberation and prodding from friends, I decided to put up a patreon to help offset some of the costs. After all, if someone could do a GoFundMe to go to Super Smash Con just to disqualify themselves... I suppose it\u0027s not debilitating to ask for support. I\u0027d love to do more projects, so any help is deeply appreciated!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy should I pledge to you instead of every other artist?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, first things first - I don\u0027t want your money if I\u0027m not making something. So I\u0027ll be setting this patreon up to only take money \u003cstrong\u003eper project\u003c/strong\u003e. I like to take breaks between projects that can go on for undetermined amounts of time, so I don\u0027t want your wallets getting siphoned while I\u0027m sitting around twiddling my thumbs. I do these videos when I have the creative spark and vision to execute. So I\u0027ll always strive to put out something of quality. I won\u0027t take your pledges if I make a low effort/meme video. Also, I only ever really put out videos once every few months, so you shouldn\u0027t be hit too hard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat would you do with the money?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, it depends. Right now, at this very moment working on ZeRo vs. Ally? Every dollar just helps offset the cost spent making it. After this project?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$0 - $200:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Pay for miscellaneous expenses: music, narration, graphics, etc.\u003cbr\u003e-McDonald\u0027s\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$200 - $500:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Buy equipment over time, when I can!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e-Computer monitor\u003cbr\u003e-Lighting pieces\u003cbr\u003e-Sound gear\u003cbr\u003e-General camera gear, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e-Be able to collab with other smash content creators and actually be able to compensate them properly for their awesome work :O\u003cbr\u003e-Go to a restaurant and have some blackened salmon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$500 - $1000\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e- Jeez, really? I mean, if it happened, that\u0027d be awesome\u003cbr\u003e- Bigger, better projects tbh. That\u0027s a flight ticket - more opportunities to go to tournaments and get the footage/interviews to cook whatever zany idea I might have.\u003cbr\u003e-Maybe Ruth\u0027s Chris Steakhouse steak every once and a while?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$1000+\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-The dream?!?\u003cbr\u003e-With a few videos I could make enough to buy a\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSony A7 S2\u003c/strong\u003e - and lemme\u0027 tell you, if I get this camera we\u0027re really cooking. I definitely have to make something awesome with that. Maybe Rivalries\u00a02, with decent B roll, good-looking interviews and an actual, real pre-production plan?!?\u003cbr\u003e-I don\u0027t know where i\u0027d go to eat after finish this, but it\u0027d definitely be at least a little bourgeoisie.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can I help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my work, want to see more (and potentially at a higher rate of release), a patreon pledge would be awesome. If you don\u0027t want to donate per project, you can hit me up for my paypal and send donation whenever you desire. And if you can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to donate, that\u0027s cool! Just keep watching and enjoying - I appreciate all the comments and thanks. At the end of the day, whether I get $0 or $5000, the mantra stays the same. I make these when I want to. The money just affects the scope and pacing of releases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat do I get in return?\u003c/h4\u003eEarly access, getting added to the credits, exclusive scenes, and complete interviews!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThanks all!\u003c/h4\u003e"
