Thanks for stopping by--if you\u0027re here for some type of female muscle or FMG story then you\u0027ve reached the right place!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing FMG stories of varying content since 2012, starting out with board posts, then doing private commissions, and finally landing here on Patreon, where I can more or less write what I want for a broader audience, or take direction, and work within my own available time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to release 2-3 works monthly on this page--the writing is exclusive and only Patrons will receive stories in full. My endgame is to reach a patronage goal where I would only have to write once or twice a month to supplement my income, but to deliver longer stories (and less overall storylines to avoid staleness) as a result.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always open to critique, or suggestions, or ideas! I\u0027m always looking to deliver a better product. To that end I\u0027ve started drawing again and I\u0027m hoping to add art as a premium tier to anyone that might be interested in receiving the stories plus a drawing. But for now, my tiers will remain as is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
