    "summary": "I am a photographer and writer specialising in providing tools, training and inspiration for other photographers. Originally, my background was that of a motion graphics designer, visual effects artist and graphics professional, but I now work primarily as a photographer, artist and writer. My Images have seen by millions of people online and in the real world, and my work has been used by clients including\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blog.thomasfitzgeraldphotography.com/blog/2014/03/photography-featured-national-campaign-marks-spencer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMarks \u0026amp; Spencer\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blog.thomasfitzgeraldphotography.com/blog/2015/12/my-work-featured-in-publications-this-year\"\u003eDublin City Council and Apple\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have also had my photography writing published including a highly regarded book on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thomasfitzgeraldbooks.com/books-1/2016/10/11/mastering-aperture\"\u003eApple\u2019s Aperture\u003c/a\u003e (before its demise), and I have also self-published several guides on post-processing your photography.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love what I do and I love sharing new ideas, tips and techniques with my readers, but keeping everything going costs money and that\u0027s where you come in! My chief goal is to be a premier source of inspiration and knowledge for other photographers and people interested in Photography. I specialise in image editing and raw processing. I already reach an audience of over 50,000 a month through my website, which provides both technical expertise in an easy and accessible way to other artists, as well as inspiration. I want to be able to keep this going grow and develop the site even more. I want it to be a great place to go for photographers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this membership option through Patreon, I hope to be able to help keep my website and writing projects funded, so that I can still offer content for free and also provide extra content and for paid subscribers. The idea is that this will be a \"directors commentary\" on my main blog and websites. You can see what each tier will give you in the descriptions in the sidebar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI aim to publish twice a week, with more when I can, but I will generally try to get at least two dedicated Patreon member only posts out a week.\u00a0"
