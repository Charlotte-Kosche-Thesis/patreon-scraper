Who are you exactly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Aloys and I am the founder and owner of Overwatch Feed, an independent blog where I curate content and write a whole bunch of articles on Overwatch. This includes news, feature articles, editorials, interviews, analysis, creators spotlights, podcasts and so on.\u003cbr\u003eI interact with the community through the Overwatch Feed\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitter.com/OverwatchFeed\"\u003eTwitter account\u003c/a\u003e, but we also have a \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/HaWpbbh\"\u003eDiscord server\u003c/a\u003e where our readers can hang out and play the game with each other. As a Patron of mine, you will have an exclusive access to a special role and private channels on the server.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere did Overwatch Feed come from?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOverwatch Feed was founded in 2016 under the name \"Overwatch Pictures Bot.\"\u003cbr\u003eIt was originally a Twitter account sharing all the latest Overwatch artworks from the community. Soon after its creation, we decided to rebrand the account as \"Overwatch Feed\" and started posting more diverse content while promoting Overwatch content creators.\u003cbr\u003eAfter reaching a substantial amount of followers, the account had a 7 months hiatus caused by personal conditions that were not up to my decision. After finally getting back on the project, I decided to launch an Overwatch news website under the same name, so that players could have someplace with every resource they need as die-hard Overwatch fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere\u0027s my patron money going?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first few dollars I get through Patreon will go directly to paying the server costs. We are temporarily hosted on a server in France, but we will need to find a permanent hosting plan.\u003cbr\u003eThe rest of the funds will go to my rent, which is my top priority after the server costs. If I manage to make a living through this Patreon, I\u0027m definitely going to recruit more helping hands, possibly branch out into making other sites like Overwatch Feed.\u003cbr\u003eWe do have a few volunteer contributors, and I wanna do my best to pay them fairly in the near future for the time and energy they put into this project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAll the work I do here is accessible for free and there is no ads displayed on the site for the comfort of our readers. Therefore, my only source of income is through this Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003eThe more funds I receive through Patreon, the more I can help pay for my livelihood, the more articles I can produce and, in the future, the more people I can hire.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery single dollar helps, and I\u0027m really thankful for all the support Overwatch Feed has received so far.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
