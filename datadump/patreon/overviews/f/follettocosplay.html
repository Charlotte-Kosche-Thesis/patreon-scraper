Advancing in the cosplay world unfortunately requires\na lot of materials, and this is a great way to help me gather them. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, \u003cstrong\u003ePLEASE\u003c/strong\u003e note that this is totally optional! Don\u0027t feel\nobliged to hand over money; I\u0027ve created this for anyone who feels comfortable\ndonating to artists.

I have bought a good number of\ncostumes, but most of the ones I wear are home made. I\u0027m entirely self taught\nin sewing (It\u0027s been about four years now. So crazy to think about!) and wig\nstyling. Those two are my favorite crafting works to tackle.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBehind the costumes and makeup I\u0027m a college student trying to get my degree in\npsychology and business.
