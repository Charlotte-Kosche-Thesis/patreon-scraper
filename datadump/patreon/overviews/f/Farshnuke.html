Any who I\u0027m begging for money, I know I am better off than many but if you have a dollar or 5 to spare every month it would be much appreciated"

     "about": "Alex is a writer, letsplayer, vlogger and all around general nerd. Vlogging and fandom was just a hobby until his written reviews of movies proved popular enough to first get a blog and then a review series on youtube. Late last year he adapted a short story into the storyline of his review series and having finished a BA in Creative and Professional Writing and Film Studies with a dissertation defining sharkploitation he plans to turn his love of script writing, shark movies and reviews into a series with storyline, comedy and clips like Atop The Fourth Wall, The Spooney Experiment and Trilbee Reviews. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs work progress on the sharkploitation review series his letsplay series of Minecraft Solar Survival, Half Life 2 and Skyrim bring in the views and subscribers, edging him ever closer to actually making money from the ad revenue on his videos. \u00a0More recently at Nine Worlds Geek Fest he negotiated with a small comic publisher, second hand dvd seller and several indie game designers to get review copy, further legitimizing his videos and bringing them ever closer to making a profit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlongside his videos and other work Alex is also a pulp scifi writer interested in exploring big issues through comedic pulpy stories featuring cyborg sharks and dragons that fly through the multiverse. You can get a taste of his writing over at farsh-nuke.deviantart.com",
