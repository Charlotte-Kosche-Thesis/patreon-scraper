If you do enjoy the content and want to support me, check out the Super Supporter pledge; you can commit as much or as little as you want (starting at $1 US), and I\u0027ll put that toward the purchase of foam for developing my skill base, testing out new ideas and techniques, and hopefully then being able to offer better and more exciting products for my supporters and customers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I was raised on the Yorkshire Coast of England with a heady mix of sea-air, good music, and sandstone. A mixed career of strange jobs including analysing chips, undressing actors, and professionally buying shoes left me poorly prepared for any one of the upcoming predicted apocalypses; unwilling to throw myself in a vat of radioactive gloop, I decided to write superhero fiction in the hope that it might one day rub off and give me superpowers. So far, it hasn\u0027t, but that might be because I write incredibly slowly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI studied High Risk Colouring-In (Geology) at university, where I discovered that academic scientists are in fact the world\u2019s first alcohol based life forms. As a result of this, I can construct a passable strata map, even when inebriated, and I know what a compass-clinometer is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a graduate I tried to train to be a ninja, but quickly discovered that I was too excitable and alerted my enemies to my presence by shouting \u201cwoop\u201d rather a lot. With my career as a stealthy warrior-assassin being a failure, I took to a life in IT, writing fiction, making LARP kit, and eating a lot of cake.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI now lives in the East Midlands... and I still say \u201cwoop\u201d too often.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not knowingly in contact with any professional ninja.\u003cbr\u003e",
