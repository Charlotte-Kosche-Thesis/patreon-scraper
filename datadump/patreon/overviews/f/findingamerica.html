    "summary": "Welcome to the official page of \u003cstrong\u003eFINDING AMERICA\u003c/strong\u003e! \u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Emma Kalff, I\u2019m 24 years young, an artist, lover of not being stressed out and all things cheese, and the creator of Finding America. So what\u0027s this all about?\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, let\u0027s face it. I believe America the great has found herself in a bit of a rut lately. We\u0027ve all felt it - whether it be anxiety over the precarious political climate, anger about the senseless violence clogging our streets and media, intense pressure from money troubles, or just an everyday disconnect from those around us. In these dark times, we could all use a little light. Since I\u2019m an artist, the light I can provide is my artwork. That\u0027s why I\u0027m embarking on a solo road trip across America, and making paintings of the various scenes I fall in love with along the way! The creation of these artworks will give me the chance to connect with this country and its people, and, hopefully, rediscover something I\u0027ve always known - that this place is filled with beauty, and we\u0027ve truly got something great to hold onto. Finding America is all about creating a bridge through which we can discover and reconnect with America. And I would love for you to come along with me! For one dollar a month (or more, if you so choose) you can witness this journey through my original on-site paintings, created all over the country.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy trip began in February 2018, and should take me through the end of the year and potentially beyond! Your donations make this trip possible, and with your help I hope to visit and document the Great Smoky Mountains, Georgia farmland, Florida beaches, parties of New Orleans, chaos in Vegas, vistas of rural and urban Texas, the deserts of New Mexico and Arizona, cities of California, mountains of Colorado, and so much more! From coast to coast, this chunk of land is full of gems waiting to be discovered.. Let\u0027s not forget it!\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease check out the \"rewards\" section for everything you can collect from my trip, from exclusive posts, to prints of artwork, and original paintings!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI appreciate everyone who visits this page, regardless of your financial contribution. If you can\u2019t afford it, I totally get it. I\u0027m a starving artist for crying out loud, how could I not sympathize? Follow me for free on Instagram at \u003cstrong\u003eartby_ek\u003c/strong\u003e. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
