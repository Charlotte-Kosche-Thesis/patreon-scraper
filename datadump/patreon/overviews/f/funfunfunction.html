    "summary": "Thank you so much for being (or considering becoming) a patron of Fun Fun Function!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have quit my job at Spotify, and I am now part-time consultant and the other part of my time will now be dedicated to Fun Fun Function. Fun Fun Function is now officially my proper part-time job, instead of something that I cram in on the weekends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo today I am asking you, if you want, to become a \u003cem\u003ePatron of Fun Fun Function\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you \u003cem\u003echip in a few bucks every month\u003c/em\u003e - whatever amount you feel is appropriate. I will use your money to \u003cem\u003ekeep the show free for everyone\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and \u003cem\u003emake the show better\u003c/em\u003e. As a patron, you also get some \u003cem\u003erewards\u003c/em\u003e - most importantly the newly opened\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.funfunforum.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFun Fun Forum\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is mpj?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho is it that you\u2019re giving your hard earned money to? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am mpj (short for Mattias Petter Johansson, it\u0027s a Swedish name, and I live in Sweden) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been a full-time developer for over 13 years. I have worked in many places, but the brands you might know are Spotify, Absolute Vodka and Blackberry. My primary language is JavaScript, but I\u2019ve coded in a lot of languages over the years, including Smalltalk (in Danish). My internet fame was built on Quora, where I found that I really enjoyed answering questions and explaining things about programming, and I ended up writing over a thousand answers there before I moved on to becoming a YouTuber.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy schooling is actually not software, it\u2019s in theatre and TV production. So, basically, I\u2019ve done a lot of programming, I\u2019ve done lot of writing and explaining programming, and I\u2019ve done a lot of acting and video production, and when you combine those skills together, out comes a  programming show. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich leads us to ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Fun Fun Function?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is the show \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e about and why is it worth your patronage? Well, two years ago, I started Fun Fun Function because I wanted there to be a \u003cem\u003eshow\u003c/em\u003e about programming. Not a database of tutorials and courses, a show. A regular show with an different topic every week, with an entertaining host that explains things well, with the purpose of keeping you curious and excited about the programming craft. Basically, the purpose of Fun Fun Function is to \u003cem\u003ekeep programming fun\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeeping the show free\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a patron, you help keep the show free for everyone. Most quality programming videos today are behind paywalls. There is nothing wrong with that, but that\u2019s not what I want to do with Fun Fun Function - I want the show to have as widespread impact as possible, so I want it to be freely available to everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk, mpj, but why Patreon, can\u2019t we fund the production with ads?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, the advertising model is problematic, because it forces the creator into a \u003cem\u003erace for views\u003c/em\u003e. Creators that win this race do so by making tons of content, with low production cost, often daily, often news, often \"clickbaity\" and as mainstream as possible. And all that is the opposite direction of where I want Fun Fun Function to go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Patreon model is so much more healthy than the ad model, because it is you, the Patrons, who fund the show, so it\u2019s only you that I will need to care about. Views, likes, algorithms, advertisers, news, clickbait - with Patreon, we don\u2019t need that anymore. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of racing for views, the business model becomes both simple and healthy: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMake patrons happy. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of making patrons happy \u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show stays free, but as a patron, you get some rewards as thanks for you support.  There is live stream stuff, code reviews, ad-free audio downloads, me sending you mail (you can see the specific rewards elsewhere on this page) but the reward I am most excited about is the \u003cem\u003eFun Fun Forum\u003c/em\u003e, which is a reward \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e Patrons get, even if you pledge just $1.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal for the forum is to create \u003cem\u003ea friendly, familiar, fun place where you can have structured discussions with me and other programmers\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhenever I show my comment field to other YouTubers, they turn green with envy. You are smart, you are polite, you are insightful and call me on my shit. But the YouTube comment system, as a piece of technology, is (CUT to screaming into a pillow) buggy and primitive. Trying to have structured discussion about programming in the YouTube comment system is like trying to poop out a rack-mounted server. You really. deserve. better. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Fun Fun Forum is powered by Discourse, that has code highlighting, real time updates, search, all the good stuff. The forum is going to be moderated by yours truly. I have a background in moderating forums so I\u2019m really looking forward to getting back into it. I\u2019m going to be very hands on, and I\u2019m going try to nurture a friendly and fun place where we can get to know one another, welcome and educate new programmers, and have interesting discussions about code and work and life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also hope to have a lot of discussions about the show itself - where you assume the role of my executive producers - giving me feedback, ideas and inspiration - having a back and forth with you before ideas turns into episodes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMake the show better\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, as a Patron, you help make the show better. Because the more patrons  we have, the more time and money I can pour into the show, and the higher production value we can go for. That means more production time and polish, but I\u2019m also hoping that we can travel, and visit interesting companies, and interview famous programmers. If we get really big, we will be able to do more elaborate shows with production teams - if we get to that point, then we need to discuss how do we take Fun Fun Function to a new level? Do we want to create the Mythbusters of Programming? Do we want to start a Fun Fun Conference? I don\u2019t know, but I would love to find out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, If you want to support the production of Fun Fun Function, get some cool rewards, and a friendly and fun place to have discussions with me and other programmers then please, do become a patron today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions or thoughts, please email them to me at patreon@funfunfunction.com.\u003cbr\u003e"
