    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT ME\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, everyone! My name is Carrie, but you might also know me as FlyingFire, a friendly rainbow cheetahess here to guide you through the land of my art. I live in Minnesota, in the U.S., and I\u0027d like to introduce you to the colorful mind behind all of this creativity. I\u0027ve always been passionate about creating and improving myself and my art in all kinds of ways, including having gone to college for detailed study in fine arts, photography and art history. I\u2019ve got a lot of experience in the furry community as an artist, including as the head of the Artists\u2019 Alley at one of the major furry conventions in the US. I\u0027ve also been creating art for income by taking commissions, and going to furry conventions ever since 2002. That\u0027s a lot of lessons learned, and I want to be able to take all I\u0027ve learned and share it with all of you.\u003cbr\u003eI specialize in real media and digital fantasy, furry, and nature art. I\u2019m best known for my dragons, my dark, romantic themes, and black paper artwork. Including but not limited to fantasy, sci-fi, nature and the wide, incredible world around, below, and yes... even above me. Ever since I was just a kid, I\u0027ve always loved to share my art and passion for creating with others. I strive to make both my commissioners\u2019 dreams come to life, and my own. Which is exactly what I want to do for all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY CHOOSE PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, that\u0027s a big question! I saw a lot of opportunity here, and I wanted to see if it would help. I\u0027ve heard so many good things about Patreon that I thought \u0027hey, it\u0027s worth a try, at least!\u0027 So, here I am. But in the long run, there\u0027s a very real reason I\u0027d want to come here. I have a cat, my boy Jupiter, to care for as well as myself. Every little bit here on Patreon helps immensely! That, and it\u2019s been my dream for many years to make a life and living as a freelance artist. It\u0027s my hope that, with Patreon and the help of my supporters, that this dream can finally come true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO I OFFER?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a prolific digital and real media artist, and I produce a steady stream of new pieces on a regular basis that I want to share with all of my patrons. I\u0027ll be sharing my work as high resolution and work-in-progress images with my higher level patrons, as well as collecting all of my web resolution work in one place for the lowest \u2018tip jar\u2019 tier. For the most part my feed will be a collection of images that can be viewed in lower resolution elsewhere, in resolutions and formats that cannot be seen outside of Patreon, and some content that is totally Patreon-exclusive, mostly sketches and other small pieces.  Please note: you will need to have access to my Patron Discord server in order to view image rewards. I also have many options for custom artwork available should you so desire!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW DO I PAY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is on a monthly payment system, which means you\u0027ll be charged at the beginning of every month for that month\u2019s content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHERE CAN I BE FOUND?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWebsite: \u003ca href=\"http://flyingfire.proboards.com/\"\u003ehttp://flyingfire.proboards.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurAffinity gallery: \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/flyingfire\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/flyingfire\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwitter: \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/flying4fire\"\u003ehttp://www.twitter.com/flying4fire\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eE-mail: silvrwingsdragon@gmail.com\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Thank You List for helping save Jupiter\u0027s life:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Teal Unicorn, Xilimyth, Arkus, Cyberwuffie, Stuard Smith, Orkekum, Mechawolf ...and countless others.
