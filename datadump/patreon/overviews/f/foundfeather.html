    "summary": "Hello, one of my names is Feather, and I write a lot.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not terribly good at self-promotion: generally, I like to leave my work to speak for itself. This is a dreadful advertisement strategy, but we all have our flaws and foibles. I\u0027ve set up this patreon at mostly the request of people who know me, and in part because at this point I can make use of any funds I can get. If people think my work is worth a few coins, I\u0027m thrilled to accept them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to fiction, I largely write speculative fiction, some of it fan, most of it original. I am embarking on several new projects. I\u0027m queer, neuroatypical, mentally ill and a handful of other things that are often not represented in fiction, and I tend to write what reflects the world I and those closest to me live in. Some of my primary focuses are trauma and illness and living with it, but I find basically everything about humans fascinating, if often infuriating.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to non-fiction, I have a few hobby-horses, ranging from child development and psychology through to mediaeval social history through to Tolkien\u0027s work in Arda. I often go off on long tangents about them, and some people find these useful and/or entertaining.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatron rewards are things I could think that I could do that people might want; people should also feel free to suggest rewards that aren\u0027t on there if you think of something.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for stopping by, and thank you for reading something definitely not the most scintillating \"About\" page ever!\u00a0"
