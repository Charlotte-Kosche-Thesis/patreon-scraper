    "summary": "Flipping Physics is\u00a0a one-employee company dedicated to providing \u003cem\u003efree\u003c/em\u003e, entertaining and real physics educational videos for anyone to use to learn physics and, more specifically, for teachers to use to flip their students\u2019 learning. In the \u201cflipped\u201d classroom, students view lectures on-line and at home so that in-class time can be devoted to hands-on, project-based, and engaged learning. Feel free to enjoy a video which shows\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.flippingphysics.com/flipping.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe differences between a flipped and a traditional class\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMost online educational videos are a PowerPoint presentation with a voice over. Flipping Physics instead has an actual teacher with three students who are learning the material with the viewer. (I play the teacher and all three students.) This creates a situation where questions are asked and answered, mistakes are made and corrected, and concepts are repeated by a different speaker in a slightly different way to help with understanding.  There are also many real world scenarios shown and analyzed.  For example, I rode my bicycle off a dock into a lake to show the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.flippingphysics.com/helmet.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eforce of impact on a helmet\u003c/a\u003e, I used a quadcopter drone for an aerial view of two cars to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.flippingphysics.com/introduction-to-relative-motion.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eintroduce relative motion\u003c/a\u003e, I used a catapult to show\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.flippingphysics.com/nerd-a-pult.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eprojectile motion\u003c/a\u003e, I did a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.flippingphysics.com/magic-trick.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emagic trick\u003c/a\u003e to help students understand inclines, I wrote a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.flippingphysics.com/energy-song.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esong about energy\u003c/a\u003e, and I rode on a skateboard to demonstrate\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.flippingphysics.com/skateboarding.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eframes of reference\u003c/a\u003e. This creates a real, immersive and entertaining experience that far exceeds a PowerPoint presentation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe truth is, because making quality videos like these takes so much time, I give up roughly three-fifths a teacher\u0027s salary annually in order to be Flipping Physics. That\u0027s right, I am in the classroom only part-time.\u00a0Your support is what pays the rest of my salary and helps me teach physics worldwide.\u003cbr\u003e"

However, if I were a full-time teacher, I would not have the time to make videos which educate the world for free. Here is where the number comes from. Because I am 40% of a full time teacher, my family has to pay for the remaining 60% of the health insurance premiums. During 2017 we paid $12,814\u00a0for our health insurance premiums. Monthly that works out to be $1,068. To be clear, my family does have health insurance, however, it is only because we pay out of pocket for it, something we would not have to do if I were a full-time teacher.",
