I\u0027m Robin, more commonly known as \u003cstrong\u003eFivda\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m a young french person trying his best to make memorable video game analysis and review videos. I\u0027ve also translated LISA : The Painful \u0026amp; Joyful in French. Though I don\u0027t have any more translation projects, I would love to do something new !\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u2019t really have any fixed video format : I also don\u2019t wish to create any kind of \u201co\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: normal;\"\u003ebjective\u201d reviews. This is why most of my videos are mostly based and forged on my own thoughts of games. Of course I do very often mention game design and basic structures, but I think talking about what emotionally moves me the most about games instead of being critical is by far way more interesting to me. Some videos can be pretty long, between 10 to 40 minutes depending on what I\u0027m talking about, since I\u0027m trying to go as deep as I can. I have already made a couple of videos on the Metroid Series on a personal level, and I have my eyes on videos about the emotional aspect of Nier, and the sexual aspect of LISA. This is why most games I will cover on my YouTube channel will be centered around story driven or niche games. If I could motivate you to play something you might love, I would be delighted !\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003eI\u2019m also writing and creating video games myself with a small team of friends of my own, known as KodamaSoft ! I\u2019m currently working on a few projects, from novels, to RPG Maker Games and Visual Novels.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOh, and I try to stream as much as I can !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCool, but why would i give my money to you ? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWell obviously, first of all, you don\u2019t have to. But for now, I do not have a job, and I\u2019m trying my best at video making and game making so I can actually make a living out of it. The issue is, it\u2019s a harsh world out here : There are millions of people with the same ambitions as I, and only a handful actually have this luxury. And everybody knows YouTube ads don\u2019t pay the bills unless you have millions of subscribers and hundreds of views on every video you make. But even if I can\u2019t live off my passions, getting money is important to improve my hardware and software both for videos and the games I plan to make. Better capture card, better computer specs, better editing software, better game engines and books\u2026 The better I\u2019m equipped, the better the content I\u2019ll be able to produce !\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFine, but what do I gain ?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eFor now, the fee is pay what you want. No matter your pledge, from $1 and beyond, you will get the same rewards. The main reason for that being that I have absolutely no idea how many people would be ready to pledge. For that reason, i\u0027ll be able to keep a certain consistency all the while giving you good rewards, whether you pay a small buck, five, or more. I do have plans for $1/$3/$5 pledges, but for now I will focus on this simple pay what you want system, and see how it goes.\u00a0Depending on your pledge, you will receive diverse and multiple content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e$1\u00a0 and more :\u003c/strong\u003e By pledging $1 and more, you will get credited at the end of all my videos ! You will get newsletters about my plans, and exclusive updates !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will get to see videos exclusively 48 hours prior the scheduled upload time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will get access to both my personal and my exclusive patreon discord, where we\u0027ll be able to discuss games and plans. You can also tell me what you think of my videos and suggest ideas for this patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen do I get to pay ?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eMonthly. I usually upload more than 2 videos in a month, and sometimes this number can go up to even more, so making you pay for every video I make sounds absolutely unreasonable to me ! At least you will know whenever you need to pay : 1st of each month. Simple as that !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything else ?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIf you\u2019re thinking of giving me a single penny,\u003cstrong\u003e thank you so much.\u003c/strong\u003e I take all this to heart, and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful that people are ready to spend money to see more of my content. You\u2019re the ones who can make my dreams possible, and I\u2019ll be glad to share them with you !\u003cbr\u003e"
