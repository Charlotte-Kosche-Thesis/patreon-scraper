    "summary": "Welcome to my world. You might know me as Fiona from Placebo, as an orchestral arranger and violinist for artists John Grant, Anna Calvi, Roy Harper, Gemma Ray and many others (or hey, maybe you went to school with me? or we\u0027re related?) \u00a0but you probably don\u0027t know much about me as a solo artist. \u00a0So, this really is my private world, free from management, other artists\u0027 rules, and tired industry protocol. \u00a0The Patreon platform gives me the freedom to share whatever I want with my patrons, and I want to give you access to unreleased songs, personal photographs, tales from the road, interviews with some of my brilliant musical friends, and the stories that led me to write my debut album \"Postcards From\". \u00a0Creating this space frees me from the restrictive genres of \u0027classical\u0027 or \u0027contemporary\u0027 or \u0027alternative\u0027. \u00a0I am sometimes all and sometimes none of these. \u00a0Think of it like a fan club or magazine page. Yes, it requests a little commitment from you, and a lot from me, but I\u0027m ready to give it a try.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have already begun writing and recording my next solo record but I need some financial assistance to finish it because it is large-scale and orchestral. \u00a0I do not have a confirmed label for this record which means I have to make it first, then sell it. \u00a0That\u0027s the way it works for most of us these days. Gone are the large advances and champagne contract signings...! \u00a0It was all a dream..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe funds I raise here will go directly to cover recording costs and musicians\u0027 fees. \u00a0I strongly believe that all musicians should be paid properly for their work and I have already tried to fund this record through arts funding in the UK, but have not been awarded the opportunity. \u00a0So, if you want to support music in the most direct way possible, come and join me and my friends on this journey. \u00a0You\u0027ll meet some of them along the way. \u00a0Launching exclusive content on 1st March, I will focus on delivering high quality music, writing and art. \u00a0And when good things happen, my Patrons will be the first to know."
