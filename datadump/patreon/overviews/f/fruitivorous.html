    "summary": "Hey there, Mees here (that is pronounced \"mace\" in English)! I am a 23 year old fella currently living close to Leiden in the Netherlands for my study. I am stuyding to be a music therapist. Music is and has always been my biggest passion. Music has always been my medium to express myself. I love to \u003cem\u003ecreate\u003c/em\u003e. I love to come up with new things. As you probably already know, given the fact that you\u0027ve come to my Patreon page, music is not the only platform in which I put in my heart and soul to reach other people and have an impact on their lives. When I became a vegan a couple years ago I found another passion of mine: creating food. When I switched to a plantbased diet I was forced to try out new things and so I began experimenting with all the different tastes and flavours that the plantworld has to offer. It didn\u0027t take long before I eventually switched to a raw vegan diet. Everybody that knows me, knows that I am always looking to be the best version of myself and when I\u0027ve felt a certain way it is hard for me to look back. When I tried eating a raw vegan diet I had never felt so alive. It felt like I was coming up on some sort of drug, and there was no coming down from it. This constant state of euphoria and everlasting energy is what kept me on the raw foods. That is why I want to share with you recipes that can help you transition to a more raw based diet. It literally has changed my life and I believe it can change yours as well. When I got into raw foods I wanted to know everything about it and I started reading and watching about any book, article, video and documentary you can think of. Next to that I got interested in other natural health practices more and more and I started learning about detoxification. In a world that is so unnatural to us I believe it is important to help our bodies get rid of accumulated waste. Detoxification is nothing more than that. As of last year I am also certified in iridology. The eyes are the window to the soul. By observing certain patterns, pigments, structures etc one can determines a person\u0027s level of health. Since I don\u0027t like asking a certain amount money for my services, because I don\u0027t think money should be something that holds you back, I have decided to give away my recipes for free. If you still feel like supporting me with money then that is fine too and greatly appreciated, but totally optional. Much love, Mees."
