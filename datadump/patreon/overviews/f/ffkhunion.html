And it\u0027s through our love for this gaming series and our podcasts (\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/final-fantasy-kingdom-hearts/id267350404?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efound here!\u003c/a\u003e), that we\u0027ve been able to speak to so many people in the community and share our passion.\u00a0It\u0027s something we hope really comes across in the show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are looking of course, to continue with the podcasts, but are looking for the community to help us support this. Even though we have been doing the podcasts for over 5 years, we have always wanted to keep them ad-free and away from the clutches of \"the man\". It means we can focus on the type of product we want to make, which hopefully means you can enjoy it to the fullest! However, we have to also be mindful of the fact that we burn through over 1TB of bandwidth when it\u0027s a quiet month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s our belief that both of these gaming series will continue to grow in the coming years and we would love to be able to replicate that growth with growth of our own. That\u0027s why we\u0027ve gone to one episode a week!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport will also help us to continue with our interviews. We\u0027ve managed to speak to Ali Hillis, Troy Baker, Laura Bailey, Quinton Flynn and more, and with your help, it makes it easier for us to reach out to these people and give you guys a voice. (we also won\u0027t charge for these as an episode, they are our treat to you!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t afford to support us in a monetary way, there are other ways to help. You can tell others about the show on social networks, give us feedback and take part in our community-based segments. However, if you can, we really hope you will consider backing us here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for helping us make a great show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
