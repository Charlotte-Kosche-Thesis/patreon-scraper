Most heroes are stripped of their\npowers, and the ones who remain are left twisted into shadows of their former\nselves -- wandering the land crazed and without purpose. Survivors must band\ntogether to build new lives in the aftermath, but the more time passes the\nharder it is to remember the difference between history and the legends that\nremain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/XCaKMPj.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver two years of planning have gone into the creation of\nFolklore and we\u2019re glad to finally be at a stage where production can move\nsmoothly.
