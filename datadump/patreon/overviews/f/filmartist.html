I got a micro lens for capturing more details of artworks, and recently we bought 360 camera for showing more fun experience. But if we want to do more 4K editing, we have to upgrade our computers. There is also constant needs for travel fees, hard drive etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- \n\u003cstrong\u003eCrew\u003c/strong\u003e - I\u2019ve been mostly filming these videos on my own.
