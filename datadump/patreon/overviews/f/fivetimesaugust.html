Whether you are an old fan or a new fan, it doesn\u0027t matter. I consider you a friend and I appreciate what we have going on here. It\u0027s the real deal. That\u0027s why I\u0027m officially inviting you to become a Patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFive Times August has been an independent music project since the very beginning. That means every song, album, or video that\u0027s been released up to now has been completely self-funded. The studio time, recording engineers, equipment, CDs and merchandise, touring costs... all that crazy stuff adds up! However, thanks to social media and the internet, this is a pretty normal thing these days for musicians and songwriters. Indie artists can \"make it\" on there own without a fancy record label because of fans like you who sincerely care about and support the music.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\"Okay, So What is a Patron and How Does This All Work?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a Patron simply means you *really* like the music of Five Times August and you want more of it more often. As\u00a0a\u00a0Patron you\u0027ll subscribe monthly (as little as just $1/month) to assist in the creation of new music and videos, which you\u0027ll then have access to before anyone else. You\u0027ll also get other exclusive content that won\u0027t be available to anyone anywhere else online, so you\u0027ll be insanely super special. You are like a \u003cem\u003enext level\u003c/em\u003e fan (i.e. \"\u003cem\u003eTHE BEST\"\u003c/em\u003e) Just consider it the cool kids club. If you join today and you\u0027ll have immediate access to \u003cstrong\u003eover 30\u003c/strong\u003e downloadable tracks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What Are We Creating?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a nutshell we\u0027ll be making new music and videos together. I have a stockpile of new and unreleased Five Times August songs that has been growing since 2010. You\u0027ll get to download and hear these songs grow and morph from early demos to finished album mixes. It\u0027ll kind of be like being in the studio with me. Other projects include recording Michael Jackson\u0027s \u003cem\u003eThriller\u003c/em\u003e album top to bottom with acoustic instruments, which is something I\u0027ve been wanting to do for a long time. There is also a kid\u0027s album in the works that has been slowly forming over the last few years since I became a dad. That\u0027ll definitely be a fun one. And then, of course, the videos that get made will be paired to a lot of this music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, in the event that you become a Patron, well, you are in store for \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eA LOT\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e of music, my friend. It\u0027s going to be a blast. Also, you\u00a0totally get it. You\u0027re allowing Five Times August to continue and grow and get better. That means the world to me and I thank you times a million.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee you on the other side!\u003cbr\u003e~ Brad w/ Five Times August"
