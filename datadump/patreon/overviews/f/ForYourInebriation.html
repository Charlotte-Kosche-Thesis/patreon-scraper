    "summary": "Friends and fans, welcome to my Patreon campaign!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been running this movie review blog called \"For Your Inebriation\" for over two years now, and have had a lot of fun doing it. However, I\u0027ve always been at a loss on how to promote the site, how to expand my fanbase, how to make this feel like a true artistic endeavor and not just a huge inside joke between me and my friends. Because I have always been working full-time jobs and tweaking other artistic projects in addition to running this site, I\u0027ve never felt like I\u0027ve had the time or energy to devote to really doing the work I need to in order to make my hopes regarding \"For Your Inebriation\" a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m starting a Patreon campaign.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve known about Patreon for a while now, and one of my favorite aspects of the system is how easy it is not just for fans to support their favorite independent artists, but for the artists in turn to give back to their fans. I truly believe that communication with the people on the receiving end of your work is an essential part of being an artist, and it\u0027s something I personally want to constantly get better at. For starters, I\u0027d like to start with the simple thing; I want to thank you for reading my reviews and essays. Just the idea that something I wrote could be interesting or fun to someone makes my heart feel fuller.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s difficult for me to know what else to do to make this blog shine, so I\u0027m asking for your help. Please take a look at my stretch goals and rewards and give me feedback, whether that\u0027s through a donation or a comment on the site. I want to know what YOU want from us, not just what I THINK you want. It\u0027s going to involve a lot of tweaking and trying things out, but with your help I feel confident that the site can be what it was always meant to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading! Please consider donating. Every dollar spent in support of my work helps me move one step closer to focusing on this kind of thing full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove and peace,\u003cbr\u003eHollis Beck (Krissy Pappau)"
