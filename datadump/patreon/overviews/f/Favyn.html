    "summary": "\u00a0 Hey everybody!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0My name\u0027s Favyn and I make analytical youtube videos. I am incredibly excited by my progress so far and hope to someday make a career for myself in the game industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e My youtube channel is an outlet for me to do what I love to do and that\u0027s make videos and discuss interactive entertainment. I am already incredibly fortunate to have the audience that I do and the connections I\u0027ve made have been invaluable and I hope I can continue to grow and produce more quality content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e As most of you are aware the videos I make take a tremendous amount of time. Because Youtube doesn\u0027t compensate me even a fraction of the time I put in to it, It\u0027s something I can only do in my spare moments.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e That\u0027s why I\u0027ve decided to make a Patreon! I would love to devote more time to creating content and I would be able to justify that more were it to bring in a form of income. If you choose to support me, you are in essence allowing me to make way more youtube videos and invest in improving the experience of my channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e My pledge to you is this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I will always give every video my all. You can have the confidence that if you see a video of me in your sub box it will contain material that is well researched, composed to the best of my ability, and honest. I read every single comment and actively engage in discussions and I will be easily approachable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e My channel will never have advertisements that interrupt the middle of a video. My style is very brisk and has very little natural pauses so I promise I won\u0027t compromise that for more ad revenue.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e The integrity of this channel will come before any sort of financial gains and you can rest assured anything I say is something I mean from the bottom of my heart. You will never be deceived.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Thank you so much for the support. This patreon campaign will be heavily influenced by the community so if you have a suggestion or comment don\u0027t hesitate to ask!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Thanks a million for all you guys have done,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFav\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
