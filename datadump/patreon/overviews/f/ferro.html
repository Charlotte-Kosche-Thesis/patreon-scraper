After discussing things with my husband and reviewing our resources, we felt that we are fortunate enough for me to focus on my creative career instead of returning to retail. This Patreon is part of that career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE ARTIST\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been a fan of comics since I was very small, mostly in part to my mother, a long-time fan of cape books and a huge inspiration throughout my life, but it hasn\u0027t been until recently that I\u0027ve begun seriously approaching sequential work as a valid option. My goal for 2017 is to get myself to a place where I can reliably create one 12-page comic set each month, whether self-contained or part of a larger piece; I have characters and plots that can last until the heat death of the universe, but the important part is making the art and finishing everything. While there may be content like coarse language, violence, or suggestive themes in my work, I do not plan to use this space to promote explicitly sexual works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy specialty is black and white analog illustration and I have been practicing digital painting for a few years. My comics work will be primarily digital.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE PATREON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am starting things off as a monthly \"tip jar\" of sorts: you receive no bonus content nor guarantee of new work, you simply are giving me a dollar because you like me and want to help me pay my rent. This may evolve in the future, especially as I have more comics to share, but I will be clear and upfront in the event I consider changing payment plans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon money will initially go towards paying for a comics mentoring program with a professional friend of mine (Iris Jay, creator of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://crossedwires.irisjay.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCrossed Wires\u003c/a\u003e and whose own Patreon is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/irisjay\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e)\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/irisjay).\"\u003e.\u003c/a\u003e Additional funds will be used for household expenses, and money after that will be earmarked for a combination of savings and investing into other Patreons."
