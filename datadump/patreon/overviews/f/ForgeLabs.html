It was terrible, both the map and the video - but to my surprise, people watched it. It motivated me to make another, and another and here we are nearly 10 years later and I\u0027m still going at it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the span of 10 years of making videos on Youtube, Forge Labs has shifted, changed and grown. I discovered that my true passion lies within creating my own video content for an online audience. Being able to directly interact and communicate with my viewers allows me to build a community and cultivate discussions that lead to the generation of new content. As a Pateron, you are at the forefront of this. You directly impact the type of content you see on Forge Labs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eForge Labs has always been a solo venture, everything: writing, researching, filming, voicing, and editing has solely been done on my own. Because of this, it takes time - and as the channel grows and I\u0027d like the production quality to as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past year, I\u0027ve shifted the focus of my channel from showcasing player created maps to critical commentaries of the gaming \u0026amp; the industry, video essays and game reviews. These types of videos require much more time to make. My goal is to be able to produce several of these videos a month, with at least a minimum of one a week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patreon, you\u0027re helping me achieve that goal with your support \u003cstrong\u003eno matter the\u00a0amount. \u003c/strong\u003eVideos will never be locked behind a paywall, and will always be available to everyone. I am incredibly grateful for all the support I\u0027ve received over the years and will always continue to try to be the best I can. My ultimate goal is to be able to do what I love full time, and your support in any capacity helps bring life to the goal. Thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
