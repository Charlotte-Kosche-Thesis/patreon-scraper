Blackspace is powered by a robust volunteer community, filled with fellow Afrofuturists, that engage youth in training, mentorship, and collaboration. The goal is to ensure that our future leaders have a seat at the table in the innovation economy, and are rooted in the daily practice of love, liberation, self-determination, confidence, and excellence.

We\u2019d like to continue to provide specialized wokeshops like Conscious Coding, Street Griot, Beat Making and Digital Storytelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis sounds amazing! How can I get involved?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eInvolve your workplace or community organization! Do you do gift exchanges at your job or community organization? Do you choose an organization to donate to for the holiday season? Choose the #FundAfroFuturism campaign! Propose foregoing the typical gift exchange this year and ask for 25% of your work place, department or community to become patrons or set a pledge goal! Compete between departments! Get your places of worship involved! We know that some places of worship ask for tithes. Would your congregation be willing donate a tithe/gift to Blackspace? Speak with the leaders of your religions/spiritual community to see if you could set up a table before and after service for the \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#FundAfroFuturism campaign! \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBecome a patron yourself! No amount is too small! Becoming a sustainer at $5 means skipping a coffee at Starbucks, once a month. The \u2018Ujamaa Shield\u2019 patreon, at $10/month, is the price of one movie ticket. An \u2018Afronaut\u2019 patreon, at $25/mo, means not eating out JUST once a month. We hope you can find something to give up in order to give the students of Blackspace the resource of our programming :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I donate to the campaign?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe link to our patreon is here---\u0026gt; \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/fundafrofuturism\"\u003ewww.patreon.com/fundafrofuturism\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are asking for patrons. This is different from one-time donors. Those that contribute to the campaign will become a sustainer. This means once a month, the amount of your choice will be drafted from your account you connect to Patreon. Just like a streaming service like Hulu takes draws money from your account so you may access television shows when you like, Blackspace would receive the amount of your choice and use it to continue to provide programming for Black and Brown youth within the Triangle and the community at large. We are asking for $5 as a starting donation, the Spaceship tier, but no amount is too small! Rewards are given once you\u2019ve reached a tier. For example, if you decide to donate $3/month, you will receive a thank you from us at Blackspace but you will not be eligible to enter the raffle to win a mini-swag bag that comes with a \u2018Spaceship\u2019 tier contribution. If you decide to donate $20/month, you will qualify for the rewards for the \u2018Ujamaa Shield\u2019 tier but not the \u2018Afronaut\u2019 tier. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs the donation tax-deductible?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes, but there\u2019s a caveat. If you pledge $5/month for 12 months, your total donation over the year will be $60. You will be able to write off the total amount you\u2019ve donated at the time you file your taxes. This applies to patrons at the $5, $10 and $25 level. For patreons that contribute at the $100 level or above, you will receive a swag bag and/or service from Blackspace. The value of the items you receive must be deducted from your taxable donation. For example, if the patron pays $1200 @ the $100 level over the course of a year, the value of the swag bag you\u2019d receive, say $75, must be deducted to the total deductible amount, leaving you with $1125 total amount that can be written off. Additionally, The African American Dance Ensemble (AADE), based in Durham, is our fiscal sponsor. When you request a letter for your tax write-off, it will be from the AADE, not Blackspace, LLC. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I receive anything else for my donation?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs briefly described in the section above, Blackspace swag bags are given out in two ways. For sustainers at the $25 level or below, once we hit 30 sustainers across these 3 tiers, we will hold a a raffle once a month to win some Blackspace paraphernalia. Winners must deduct the value of your swag bag if you plan to write off your donation for your taxes. For sustainers at the $100 or above, sustainers will receive their swag bag within 45 days of their first contribution is processed. Payments are processed on or near the 1st of each month. For example, if you become a sustainer on January 2nd, your contribution will be processed on or around February 1st. You should expect to receive your Blackspace swag bag within 45 days.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

By reaching 25k, we would be able to realistically provide sizable scholarships to the youth we serve, pay our facilitators (who currently make Blackspace their part-time, unpaid passion project - a full-time living wage salary. This will allow us to send our youth into outer-space (outside our community) and support them in expanding their knowledge. We\u0027d be engaging\u00a0in some serious space travel. We\u0027d like to provide small scholarships for our youth for simple things like paying their application fees when applying to college, coming to see their families while in college, and paying for textbooks, just to name a few. Our part-time facilitators can be full-time artists within Blackspace, providing them with the stability of pursuing their own dreams while helping their students achieve theirs. Trips across the country San Francisco to compete at Brave New Voices, an international youth poetry festival, and to the Allied Media Conference, a social justice and digital media gathering, will become definite annual pilgramages for the youth we serve. In 2018, we are planning a trip to the National Museum of African American History and Culture, and in the future hope to do annual residencies in Haiti and Africa. This is all \u003cem\u003ein addition to \u003c/em\u003eour robust local programming. \u00a0Help us manifest this reality with your monthly contribution. The only way us up!",
