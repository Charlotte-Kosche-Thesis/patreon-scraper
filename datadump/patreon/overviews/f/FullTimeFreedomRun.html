About 5 years ago we began an incredible life changing journey. I was working for an Insurance Industry, and Gale was working in the dental field. We both came to a place where we felt frustrated and thought, there\u0027s got to be more to life than this. After much debating, Gale I left our perspective careers, and went into full-time music ministry. The music has gone better than expected for us, and we are currently booked about 150 dates a year all over the U.S. \u00a0We went from traveling in a \u00a0Hyundai Elantra, and staying in hotels every night, to buying our first RV. We have since been blessed to get into a very nice 2003 Class A Newmar Mountain Aire. Because we travel so much we have been to hundreds of RV parks and have met so many wonderful full time RV folks, so we decided to start a VLOG that will allow our friends and followers to join us in our journey. I hope you will take the time to get to know us and enjoy our travels as we make our \"Freedom Run\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
