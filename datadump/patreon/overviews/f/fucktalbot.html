Only company trains can run on the tracks, yet they\u0027re never on time. Good artists copy. Whippets are like potato chips. World \u003cem\u003ewisdom\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s what you\u0027re buying into when you purchase a Talbot all access pass. Welcome to my GoFundMe page on Patreon. I am willing to work with whatever you have here. I\u0027m an optimist. I see the good in people, and animals, and animal people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027m creating? If it helps you smash that like and subscribe button, it can be whatever you want it to. I\u0027m like Luther, not in a theological way unless you can interpret my words in a sort of religious connotation. I\u0027m open to interpretation. I\u0027m art, if you will, and if you want it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been practicing my craft for more than a quarter century. If you have any doubts of the voracity I have for my vision, the eagerness to keep your radio dialed just a minute more, to sell ads, but ironically I\u0027m an ad-free network of things, so what I mean to borrow is that if you pick up the receiver: I can make you a believer. of the Talbot vision.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHave you ever seen the face of God?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow did we get back here? If the need arises, and of course, it did; you can think of Talbotism as a sort of cult of personality. The higher up the pyramid you climb, the less effect gravity has on your ability to fall or function as a rational entity on God or whomever\u0027s green Earth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIdeologies are a dime a dozen. Unfortunately, Patreon does not allow me to set a purchase level below $1 USD, so I have to bulk sell my ideologies. This creates an obvious strain of my ability to provide the ideology.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the case is also the truth.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTruth is hard to find nowadays in 24 hour television internet millennials. Delivery synergistic solutions through some approachable medium is no longer a difficult in the age of WiFi and coffee. Defensible logistical solutions to the problem that I created and will tell you about. We have near infinite coverage. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not his fault he\u0027s a cop. Consumer fraud protections are pretty good nowadays, but deliver better than banks on aspect of institution. Everything is great. The trains run on time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn Conclusion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlexa, turn on bluetooth. If you choose to support me on my monumental project, I will be eterally grateful. I will have no shortage of pretty words. I am ready. Are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew in Update 1.1\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink about it. You could get in on the ground floor. Your name would go down in history as the first person ever to fund an art project on a GoFundMe page on Patreon. This is a lucrative offer made exclusively to you internet users. Don\u0027t wait. The month is almost up, I know you\u0027ve got telephone minute to burn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew in Update 1.2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSponsored Content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew in Update 1.3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s as if those typos never existed in this exciting new version of my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://h2savecom.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/screen-shot-2015-08-18-at-10-26-03-pm.png?w=515\u0026amp;h=218\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdvertisement\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePRIVACY POLICY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"We care about your privacy\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCRITICS RAVE\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\"Five Star Service\" - ZAGAT Restaurant Guide 2014\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\"I feel like this was made as a joke, and its gonna turn into enough income you could live on it if you tried.\" - Awkraven, the\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\"I\u0027ve debated doing it.\" - Anonymous Fox\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\"The failing .@fucktalbot writes terrible covtent.
