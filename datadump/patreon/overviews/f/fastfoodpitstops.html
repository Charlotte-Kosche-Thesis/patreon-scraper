It\u0027s because of the fans, viewers and most importantly my subscribers that I continue to provide great content! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my channel after watching YouTube Food Reviews for many years, from many of the same \u0027popular\u0027 channels that exist today. I found myself constantly wanting a better description, thumbnail, accuracy, honesty, humility, host, and most of all, entertainment that kept me intrigued enough to almost taste the food they sampled through my screen. My friends got tired of my critique and convinced me to start my own YouTube channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFAST...Food Pit Stops was born!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s where you can help! You would not believe the generosity and support the YouTube community has offered me as it grows in popularity and content quality. I want to continue providing more reviews, more locations and continued comedy. John C. Reilly doesn\u0027t work for free and neither do I. But thankfully YouTube is a free community to share my work to the viewers with nothing expected in return! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI get such a thrill from the filming process of the channel from the time I click the cameras on, until I publish to the world! This channel is becoming in many ways a second job, it certainly seems to take up as much time as one! I want to continue providing great entertaining content for the channel! I would love to allow YOU, being part of my YouTube community, another way to support the channel you love so much! Thank you for your patronage...or should I say Patreonage? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Justin\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e"
