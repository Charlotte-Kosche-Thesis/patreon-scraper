A few years back I was notorious for my Pok\u00e9mon fan art under the moniker Noktowl, but nowadays I mostly talk about \u003cdel\u003esquid\u003c/del\u003e animals (disclaimer: subject to change) on twitter and tumblr. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u0027s the deal with the dinosaurs?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhile professionally speaking I\u0027m a commercial graphic designer and illustrator, on the internet I\u0027m known for my illustration and writing for the natural history/paleontology site Earth Archives and its sister site, Studio 252MYA. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo yes, I \u003cem\u003ekinda\u003c/em\u003e draw dinosaurs for a living. At least I used to until I pivoted hard to the squishier and more obscure creatures \u003cdel\u003elike squid\u003c/del\u003e. Basically, I illustrate things that photographs can\u0027t show: funny old dead things and things that are too obscure/hard to find to get good photos of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://78.media.tumblr.com/7171795291d230ce90bf8dd8e4a44f6e/tumblr_p236pvhryF1r1th3co1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFig 2.

So expect to see weird things that (I hope) you\u0027ve never heard of before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e What can I expect from Patreon? You dump basically everything on twitter anyway.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWELL yes and no. I DO dump things on twitter (and instagram story sometimes) but in general I like to keep my socmed feed clean because they\u0027re supposed to attract clients. If you\u0027re my close friend, you\u0027re subjected to at least 3.14x more WIPs and ramblings (sometimes in caps lock) whenever I find weird facts about the things I work on. Expect yourself to get this friend treatment here c:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e What are you working on?

In the long run, I\u0027m working on a series of creature plates for Earth Archives. Think of old-timey illustrations like Ernst Haeckel\u0027s, but with a contemporary twist with hipstery typography and Candy Crush-color schemes. Jk, I don\u0027t even play that game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/430006f67b9110f78cb00616217bc09f/tumblr_oyzk5qxs1r1r1th3co1_540.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e Fig 4.
