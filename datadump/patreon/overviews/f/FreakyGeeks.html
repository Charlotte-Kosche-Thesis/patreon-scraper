So far we have invested a lot of our time, money, and energy into this project and we have no regrets. However, after a year of this we want to step it up. With your financial help we can make our more ambitious podcasting goals a reality.\u00a0With just a few dollars a month we can upgrade equipment, possibly travel for episodes, do more live shows, and if possible work less and podcast more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast will always be free and we don\u0027t expect anyone to contribute. We think just listening to us is support enough. But if you do decide to help us by giving us a few dollars we promise to use that in order to make more and better content that we think you will enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you so much for your time and hail satan you idiot assholes!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Shayne and Noelle\u00a0"
