Progress will be slower than usual until I get sorted IRL again.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello everyone! I am the creator of the free to play text game Fall of Eden, as well as an artist who mainly draws adult (18+) works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFall of Eden is an erotic fantasy text adventure written in HTML5/Javascript. What started out as a one-man effort inspired by Corruption of Champions has since steadily grown into something much larger, involving multiple content creators.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uuWAU21.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWorld\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter the world of Eden and planes beyond it, interact with fantastical beings and spirits, and try to uncover the dark forces trying to destroy and corrupt it. In your arsenal, you have your weapons, magic, alchemy and your libido. Fight, trick or seduce your way through a wide variety of colorful characters and enemies, ranging from ordinary humans to elves and more fantastical creatures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInteractive relations\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/1jiUHPL.png\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eHow you treat those you meet matters. Depending on your choices, people around you will treat you differently, and more scenes will open up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/jwkKFLP.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMalleable appearance\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlter your body through the use of magic and potions, granting you new possibilities. Perhaps you want to run around with a fluffy tail? You can do that. Using the craft of alchemy, mix the spoils of battle to create new strange recipes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eParty-based combat\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/yv5YMdW.png\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEmploy the skills and spells of you and your party in dynamic encounters against a wide variety of enemies. Fight against groups of enemies in a turn-based combat system similar to old-school RPGs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/MCRuo5m.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eEpic, interactive story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDecide the ultimate fate of Eden against the menace of Uru and her demons. How you act in some encounters may have dire consequences later down the line...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to cater to all preferences, but that requires a lot of content of high quality to be produced. Since I started this, I\u0027ve realized that this can\u0027t be accomplished in any reasonable time frame at my current pace. Optimally, I would work on this project every waking moment, but with a full time job and bills to pay, this is not feasible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like for Fall of Eden to be so much more than it is today, but to do that, I need the help of other content creators, especially writers. The goal of this Patreon is to enable me to do that, gather money to pay writers and create a steady stream of new quality content for the game. It would be awesome to have my project be self-funding!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo give you an idea of how much time and effort goes into building interactive characters, I can produce perhaps 4k words of quality writing per day if I do nothing else, roughly equal to one regular in-game scene. Kia/Kai, who is one of the more fleshed out characters in the game, is pushing 50k words, despite being far from finished. Of course, all of this has to be edited and coded as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many talented writers in the community built around Corruption of Champions, Trials in Tainted Space and Fall of Eden, and with the aid of those and others like them, we could really get this game rolling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMotivation and goals with Patreon\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/P2mX0a1.png\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar I earn on Patreon will go toward improving and maintaining the game. This includes for example paying for writers, artists and hosting. This will greatly increase the pace at which I can put out quality content for the game, especially since I will be hiring people far better than me when it comes to writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I supporting?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe version of FoE currently available is to be regarded as an early alpha. Keep this in mind when pledging.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJust how much do you work on this anyways?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be pretty clear on this; right now, I consider Fall of Eden to be my hobby. I have a full time job, and plenty of other projects on the side. Pouring money on me will enable me to commission larger amount of art/writing for the game, but I can\u0027t set aside more hours in the day. While I have every intention of one day completing this game, I make no promises in which time frame this will happen. Due to the irregular nature of how I work with that sort of content, I can\u0027t make any promises to how regular sketches and illustrations will be either."
