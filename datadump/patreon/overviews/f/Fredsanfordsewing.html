    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eMy\u00a0name is David also known as Fred Sanford. I started providing vintage sewing machine parts on Ebay back in 2008. It all started with my first rusty vintage sewing machine I found in a free pile at a yard sale! From there it progressed. I also wanted to do more than just provide vintage sewing machine parts. I have been setting aside the best of the best vintage sewing machines for years and with my massive collection of beautiful vintage sewing machines I would like to create a future showroom, a place where all seamstresses and anyone that likes to sew can come visit the Munith Michigan Sewing Machine Heaven Showroom free of charge. It is scheduled to open in June 2020. Members are welcome to stay a while and try out some of the sewing machines in the sewing area. Sewing groups are welcome to use machines and to sew items for donations or showroom fundraisers. Come check out some of the very old treadles and hundreds of sewing machines that will be on display. If you are not local, plenty of videos will be supplied.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBy purchasing an historic building back in 2006, I am halfway there in creating Sewing Machine Heaven!\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank the hundreds of Facebook members that have made purchases in the past. 10% of all purchases go towards the Sewing Machine Heaven Showroom fund. With over $4,000 in the fund as of April 1st, this is a good start towards the previous $30,000 goal. Since then, the goal has now gone up to $50,000 to complete the necessary improvements needed. Also money needs to be spent to purchase some more cool vintage sewing machines.\u003cbr\u003eThank you everyone that truly supports what I do! I have enjoyed many great conversations with many members. Those that know me know I love to chat. Thank you and I hope everyone enjoys my new page!\u003c/strong\u003e"
