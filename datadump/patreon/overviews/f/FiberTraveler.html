I have an insatiable curiousioty and need to always be learning. In the midst of so many dedicated makers, I am sure I am not the only one feeling this way. This is why I am inviting you to join me on this fiber adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to nurture our fiber community; be more aware, inclusive, and appreciative of each other and all the work that goes in to get to that amazing finished piece (from \u201csheep to sock\u201d as my sister puts it).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month (at least) this much information will be created to share and talk about:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Where I have been and what all I have learned:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eIntroductions to animals, interviews with people, goodies I brought back\u003cbr\u003e\u201cTravelling studio\u201d reflection and work\u003c/div\u003e- What I am working on- spinning, natural dying, weaving, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-At least 2 videos based around my adventures to visit fiber animals and their people\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-A platform where we can discuss, ask questions and share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-As other opportunities arise, things will get added in. Such as: advise from technical spinners on how/when to use specific fibers, visits to the Natural Dye Garden associated with our Rocky Mountain Weavers Guild - I have lots of ideas! As a patron, you can help direct me to what I should be on the look out to bring to you ( I love challenges!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to learning and hopefully engaging with people introduced to our virtual caravan, some reward levels make available some of the goodness you will see on the videos, allowing you to share in the tangible side of our travels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunding on Patreon will allow me to pay for travel expenses, and getting things gathered and created both on video and on my wheel for my patrons.

     "about": "I have been hand dying, blending, spinning and weaving for a while. I always want to be learning, and pushing the boundaries of what I have learned so far. I create for joy, so am not traditional to technical in how I spin or weave. I want to relax, not worry about how close to \u201cperfection\u201d I can get. I also see fibers differently because I don\u2019t knit. This leads me to be more creative with the process and surprise out comes rather than having an end project in mind and working towards fitting my spin into specifics. My completed pieces are very textural, with no traditional patterning, more led by whimsy. Now it is time to push into a different avenue.\u003cbr\u003eMy focus for this project is emphasizing what is MOST important to me- WHERE the fiber comes from!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI have always loved being in my car and traveling, so this along with my fibershed interests and shift to natural dyeing make for a really exciting opportunity to share with and learn from others.",
