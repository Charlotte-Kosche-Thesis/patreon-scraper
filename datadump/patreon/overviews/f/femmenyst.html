    "summary": "Hello! My name is Julia and I am a queer community organizer and activist in Pittsburgh, PA. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI run a justice-centered intentional community called the Open House, which has been a primary source for femme \u0026amp; queer community building in Pittsburgh for 5 years. My community is most well known for an event called Community Dinner, which is a weekly free vegetarian meal open to all. The meal regularly feeds around 20 guests, adding up to over 4,000 meals out of my home since I started the event in 2012. My community has hosted a monthly film series called Keepin\u0027 It Reel for 3 winters, we hosted a 9-month mental health workshop series, and we host additional lectures, talks, and classes on a wide variety of topics. The Open House has helped create a thriving and connected queer community in Pittsburgh and I intend to dedicate the new several decades of my life to this project, which I run entirely for free. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also an active member in a socialist organization which is at the forefront of the leftist movement in Pittsburgh. We spend many hours meeting, having political discussion, planning actions, and executing them. Our organization has been involved in every major Pittsburgh protest since the Trump election and had been active for years before then. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI dedicate my time, energy, and skills to the people because I know my purpose in life is to build community and inspire change. Having regular monetary support would make it possible for me to live above the poverty line while making all of this happen!\u003cbr\u003e"
