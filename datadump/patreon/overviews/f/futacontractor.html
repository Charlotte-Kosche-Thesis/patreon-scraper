     "about": "Well everyone where to begin.\u003cbr\u003eI have decided to create a patreon since I am not really present anywhere else online for my followers to find me.  I haven\u2019t had a chance to really make a bigger impression than the few niche websites for Futanari fans such as reddit, fenoxo.com, futanari palace, and a couple of online story publication sites including literotica.  I have actually published my novellas online using smashwords meaning I have my books on Google Play, Apple Books, Barnes and Noble, Amazon, and a few others I forget about but they are in the mix.\u003cbr\u003eI have been writing for as long as I can remember, and started a career in writing over seven years ago, but things got a little turbulent and I had to find a new job and went through some growing pains and struggles along the way, which meant my favorite hobby of writing Futanari and Transformation themed writing went to the way side.  I recently started the flare back up and now I\u2019m feeling comfortable enough to get back into the swing of things, hence the start of a blog and newer posts on literotica.\u003cbr\u003eTo make things even more personal, I decided that I can\u2019t really do this full time and I have a hard time justifying spending 20 hours a week writing for fans when I get barely a scratch in return from book sales, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want to continue.  I am extremely interested in keeping these stories and characters I have created alive and well, and the best way I can think to do that is to turn to Patreon and try and build a follower base there and keep everyone up to date on Pateron and on my Tumblr.  I am not trying to beg for money, I really am not asking for much TBH.  I will keep posting my stories on literotica and include links from here to there as they are posted but people who subscribe to me on Patreon will get the stories first and depending on donation amounts they can also receive epubs and pdfs of my original stories or even get to push what new content I would be including in future novels I write.\u003cbr\u003eI hope that I am not coming across as a beggar but I do hope that our relationship online can flourish and we can find ourselves in a good place at the end of the day. I love you all my followers and fans who have been with me from the beginning and for fenoxo on getting my name a little more known! Hopefully you will all stick around to read more of my work and I can push this writing career even further and become the author you all deserve in this fetish genre.\u003cbr\u003eFuta Contractor\u003cbr\u003e",
