Fragnostic here. I don\u0027t want to sound like a dick or anything but I\u0027ve been your first and last line of defence against the evils of horror video games since the 1970\u0027s. It\u0027s hard to believe, I know. When that bloody mage teleported me out of Jerusalem circa 1100 AD, I was pretty bemused myself but make no mistake, these so-called \u0027games\u0027 are portals to Hell and every time one of them rears its dirty head, I have to track it down and exorcise it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ve got bloody good at doing what I do and I\u0027ve not let one beat me yet but, as I\u0027m sure you can imagine, it\u0027s expensive work. First, I\u0027ve got to buy the pissing thing because apparently I\u0027m a madman and I can\u0027t have a copy for free just because I\u0027m saving every last one of you from horrific annihilation, even if I\u0027ve come to the shop in full battle armour.
