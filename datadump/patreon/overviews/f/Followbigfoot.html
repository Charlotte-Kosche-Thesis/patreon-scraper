    "summary": "Greetings! I can\u0027t thank you enough for coming over and checking out my Patreon page. Last year I embarked on the greatest journey of my life while thru hiking the Appalachian Trail. The idea of thru hiking was born sometime within the last 10+ years when my Brother, Chad, and I started taking annual backpacking trips across the country. I will never forget our trip down the East Coast when we strolled into Harper\u0027s Ferry and walked into that white building for the first time known as the ATC. Not knowing it at the time, but that visit at the ATC gave me the inspiration to commit to thru hiking the Appalachian Trail that would change my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made the decision to document my thru hike through my channel on YouTube and my social media outlets. After successfully finishing my 100 Day AT bid, I realized how inspiring it was to share my experience to help encourage others to get out on the Trail and have a better opportunity of staying on the Trail. From this, I decided to continue my YouTube trail vlog by focusing on creating educational how-to videos, tutorials, \u00a0gear reviews and anything else related to what you would experience on a Thru-Hike. I have built a passion for creating content that not only targets critical education from the Trail, but help inspire others to motivate themselves to embark on their own journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy journey did not end on the East Coast. As a matter of fact, I will be attempting a FKT this Summer on a home trail called the Superior Hiking Trail. And in the Fall, I am heading out West to thru hike the dreamy John Muir Trail. I hope to have the opportunity to one day complete the \"Triple Crown\", starting with the PCT in the near future!"
