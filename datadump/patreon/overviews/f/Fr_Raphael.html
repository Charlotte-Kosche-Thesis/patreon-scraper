I\u0027m well known as a historian of Russia and Ukraine, but this is broader than my previous projects. The essays presented here will focus on modernism, imperialism and social-nationalism.\u003cbr\u003eMy doctorate is in international relations and social philosophy from The University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I\u0027ve taught at Nebraska, Penn State, Mount Saint Mary\u0027s University, and Penn Highlands College, but the official\u00a0academic world spit me out long ago. \u003cbr\u003eToday, the university is a parody of scholarship. It rewards incompetents and sycophants who use ignorance to protect their conscience and speech codes to protect their vapidity. These functionaries poison young minds with the most formulaic, useless liberal bromide that this institutionalized mediocrity can pretend is an \"education\" and take home six figures. \u003cbr\u003eThe tenured American professor is an intellectually sheltered, shallow and conformist bureaucrat. He\u0027s trained to indoctrinate, not teach, and few have any idea how to reach students. His role in society is to give an air of authority to official leftism.\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is an electronic Molotov cocktail thrown into his faculty meeting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePiss your professor off today -- please join me in this struggle.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

     "about": "Matthew Raphael Johnson is a scholar of Russian Orthodox history and philosophy. His research agenda centers around ethnic nationalism, Eurasianism and the Orthodox tradition as forms of rebellion against globalism. He has recently completed a lengthy book on the history of Ukrainian political thought from Mazepa to the present. Now, he is in the midst of a substantial book on nominalism and its condemnation by Patristic and Platonic authors. His doctorate is in the history of political ideas from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, which he earned in May of 1999. Since then, he has been the editor of The Barnes Review and a professor at Mount Saint Mary\u0027s University, Penn State and Penn Highlands. Presently, he is a full time writer and translator.",
