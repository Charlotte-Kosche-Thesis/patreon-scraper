Shifting footsteps alert you to a presence behind you and you spin around, ready to fight, but It\u0027s not a monster you see before you; It\u0027s me, and I\u0027m holding a game in my hand, offering it to you. I dissolve into slime and seep away into the cracks, and you are confused but thankful.\u003cbr\u003eBacking my Patreon is something like that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat do you get?\u003c/h3\u003eI\u0027ll release free games for everyone, but Patrons will get behind-the-scenes devlogs explaining how I made them, the occasional video tutorial showing how I achieved something, and maybe even source code.\u003cbr\u003e(All reward tiers also get the rewards from lower tiers unless otherwise specified)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow often will you end up paying?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nI\u0027ll only charge when I release a new game and its devlog content, which I\u0027m aiming to do every month or so. Smaller games that get released in shorter sprints either won\u0027t count, or will be combined into a larger post, to keep charges around a month apart at least.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eLong term goals\u003c/h3\u003e\n\nEventually, if this all goes well and I end up with some time and money on my hands, I hope to start making games that function more like events, and bringing in Patrons to take part in the online revelry. I also hope to make small projects that focus on individual mechanics that I can then reuse and combine into a larger, full-sized release.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
