    "summary": "Firstly, Thanks for making it this far!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFat Turtle Gaming Community started out as an idea for a FiveM Roleplay Server, it quickly gathered momentum and in what seemed like no time at all, we were the number 1 Server in Australia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Community grew rapidly and we made the decision to branch out from FiveM into a full blown Community focusing on casual Gaming and having a good time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, we have our FiveM Server, we have a Rust Server and we also have crews who play other games such as Escape From Tarkov. Our idea, is to become a Gaming Community where people can feel at home and hang out with mates. We don\u0027t need to be the biggest, but we want to be the best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to support us, know you are not only supporting our ability to play the games above, but the community as a whole.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time and we hope you join our Family!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThankyou!\u003cbr\u003e"
