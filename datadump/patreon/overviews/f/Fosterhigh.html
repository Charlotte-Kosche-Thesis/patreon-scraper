Writing takes time that you can concentrate and visual a reality and then turns those thoughts into words and that can\u0027t happen when you are working another job, trying to make ends meet or wondering if the time spent on writing is equal to the time that is being taken from something else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing, I love crafting stories and I want to do it more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow here is my problem, this really sounds like a hostage situation. If you want to see more Brad and Kyle deliver this much money to this location by this time...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want this to be like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I want though is just a little help to give myself more time to create and to get to you the stories you want. So this is not a hostage situation, you do not have to give a dime and I will gladly write more Foster books and Arcadia books and Going the Distance books. It\u0027s just going to be a while. But if you want those books faster, then I need a little help. Not a lot, just a little. And in the meantime I will try to find something to make it worth your while.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI did not mean that to sound as dirty as it came out."

     "about": "John Goode is a member of the class of \u002788 from Hogwarts school of wizardry, specializing in incantations and spoken spells. At the age of 14 he proudly represented District 13 in the 65th Panem games where he was disqualified for crying uncontrollably before the competition began. After that he moved to Forks, Washington where, against all odds, dated the hot, incredibly approachable werewolf instead of the stuck up jerk of a vampire but was crushed when he found out the werewolf was actually gayer than he was. After that he turned down the mandatory operation everyone must receive at 16 to become pretty citing that everyone pretty were just too stupid to live before moving away for greener pastures. After falling down an oddly large rabbit hole he became huge when his love for cakes combined with his inability to resist what sparsely worded notes commanded and was finally kicked out when he began playing solitaire with the Red Queen\u0027s 4th armored division. By 18 he had found the land in the back of his wardrobe but decided that thinly veiled religious allegories where not the neighbors he desired. When last seen he had become obsessed with growing a pair of wings after becoming obsessed with Fang\u0027s blog and hasn\u0027t been seen since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr he is this guy who lives in this place and writes stuff he hopes you read.",
