I have also traveled all over the world and interviewed many hall of fame frisbee players. With your help, I can continue to do more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOne of the challenges with teaching frisbee in schools is that many schools just don\u0027t have the budget. My full-day speaking rate is considerably less than other professional speakers, and still many can not afford it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrisbee is such a healthy, uplifting and powerful message, I believe everyone should have access. Getting kids to decrease their screen time will help them be more empathetic, less anxious, and more active. With your support (as low as $5/month), I can get into those schools that otherwise can not afford it, teaching more kids how to throw, catch, and play frisbee, grow the sport, and get them \u003cstrong\u003eUnplugg\u0027d\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find out more about my programs at \u003ca href=\"http://www.frisbeerob.com/speaking\"\u003ehttp://www.frisbeerob.com/speaking\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind out more about the Unplugg\u0027d Challenge: \u003ca href=\"http://www.unpluggd.ca.\"\u003ehttp://www.unpluggd.ca.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTogether, let\u0027s #growthesport and get kids #unpluggd.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BA7DU9jeam8?rel=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
