    "summary": "Hi Everyone! \u00a0Thank you for stopping by our Patreon Page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Amy (guess you got that already) and I\u0027m a writer, teacher, advocate, and speaker looking to do some good with my life. \u00a0So, what is it that I write, speak about, and advocate for? I spend my time working to raise awareness about domestic violence (DV), and all kinds of related topics, while supporting those who are healing from abuse. \u00a0In a nutshell, there are a lot of hurting people that feel alone and I want to change that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of this journey is the introduction of \u003cem\u003eForget Me Not Radio\u003c/em\u003e, a podcast that covers all things DV related. \u00a0I\u0027m about educating and screaming from rooftops, raising the hopes of those who are abused while educating the community and destroying stigma, and shining a bright spotlight on this all-encompassing issue. \u00a0To do this, I\u0027m interviewing those who are working hard to create change in our society, those who want the world to know that DV is not a \"private issue,\" and survivors who are willing to share their personal stories of pain and triumph. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut all of this writing, speaking, and creating of podcasts doesn\u0027t come for free. \u00a0So, here I am!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel it\u0027s important to give anyone supporting me the big picture so that you can know exactly who I am and what you would be supporting. \u00a0:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I do now:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a number of projects on my plate at this very moment. \u00a0In July of 2016 I left my job in corporate America to be \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eme\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e and to focus on doing not only what I love to do, but to help others as they journey toward healing. \u00a0That dream grew to not only helping others, but also advocating for a cause that is near and dear to me; domestic violence. \u00a0As a survivor of a sixteen-year abusive relationship, I\u0027m well aware of the toll abuse takes on an individual. \u00a0I won\u0027t get into the nitty-gritty, but it can be...well...hard. \u00a0But I\u0027m not about pity parties and I am a firm believer that we can choose to live as a victim or as a survivor. \u00a0I like to focus on the positive. Let\u0027s go team survivors!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll this growing and healing led me to start Forget Me Not Advocacy Group, a nonprofit that educates our youth about teen dating violence and works to give them the tools they need to recognize and avoid abuse. \u00a0We take a proactive approach. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a personal level, I write and speak. \u00a0I feel that the best way to spread awareness is to share your story. \u00a0And that is what I did. \u00a0I wrote a memoir and speak at various venues, sharing my story and educating the community on domestic violence. \u00a0I also blog, lead a peer group, and basically talk to anyone who wants to learn about DV (those trying to help others, those experiencing it, the community at large...and so on). \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can visit\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.forgetmenotgroup.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.forgetmenotgroup.org\u003c/a\u003e to learn more about Forget Me Not Advocacy Group and/or watch my TEDxNSU Talk about my journey and passion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/Y28N0BwyMEI\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/Y28N0BwyMEI\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m on Patreon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you all come in! \u00a0All of this stuff, although it means the world to me, doesn\u0027t pay a penny. \u00a0While trying to find a medium where I could reach the most people, I was hearing my boyfriend listen to a lot of podcasts. \u00a0And the idea was born. \u00a0See, I like to speak...yes, I\u0027m one of those. \u00a0I generally speak in front of crowds or through my blog, but this, this is a way that I can reach thousands (if not millions) of people with true stories of people who are out there every day working to make the world a better place. \u00a0And, I can help reach these same individuals with information about abuse, the impact it has on the community, and about survivors. \u00a0There are victims and survivors all around you, each and every day. \u00a0Podcasts give us a way to reach them, and the community, with much needed information about these taboo topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook, I\u0027m not taboo. \u00a0I am a happy, go-lucky girl (ok, not so much a girl anymore) who lived a crappy decade and a half with a guy who treated me like dirt. \u00a0I\u0027m kind of tired of people asking why I didn\u0027t leave, but that shows me how little people understand this issue. \u00a0And I know for a fact that there are many other happy, go-lucky individuals who have had terrible things done to them. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy talking about these topics, and educating people, we can seriously lower the number of individuals affected by abuse and help raise up those who are broken and struggling to a functional and vibrant level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does your money support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBy supporting this project, as a patron of \u003cem\u003eForget Me Not Radio\u003c/em\u003e, you are helping Forget Me Not Advocacy Group make a difference.\u00a0 All proceeds of this show go to supporting Forget Me Not Advocacy Group.\u00a0 This podcast is only one part of our outreach.\u00a0 Your support helps us reach more people with information and services geared at changing the statistics.\u00a0 For more information about Forget Me Not Advocacy Group, please visit\u00a0\u003ca target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.forgetmenotgroup.org\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will be forever thankful for your support!! \u00a0And, of course, you will be here with me from day one. \u00a0I\u0027m so very super excited about that. \u00a0We can grow together. \u00a0:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more information about \u003cem\u003eForget Me Not Radio\u003c/em\u003e, you can visit \u003ca href=\"http://www.amydaumit.com/podcast.\"\u003ewww.amydaumit.com/podcast.\u003c/a\u003e  There you will find upcoming release dates, topics, and other pertinent information. \u00a0I will continue to post updates to my patron\u0027s page to keep you all updated on our progress and initial release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again!\u003cbr\u003eAmy :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
