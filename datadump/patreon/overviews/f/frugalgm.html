I have but one (1!) reward level and that is $1 a month. For that $1 I plan on creating one map, one short adventure \"seed\" that I like to call a \u003cem\u003eTweak \u0026amp; Toss\u003c/em\u003e, and one extra \"thing\". That \"thing\" might be a new monster for the Tweak \u0026amp; Toss, it might be a d30 table, or it might be an unrelated RPG product altogether. That\u0027s it...all or nothing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUmmmmm, what kind of maps?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my maps fall into two main categories: dungeon maps and overland maps. I usually make a small (US Letter sized) map for the Tweak \u0026amp; Toss and provide a \"large size\" for my Patrons. I tend to go with A1 (23.2\" x 33.1\") or Arch D (36\" x 24\"), but I\u0027ve also went with smaller layered maps that let the GMs toggle features on \u0026amp; off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is a \"Tweak \u0026amp; Toss\"?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eInstead of writing a full-blown adventure for a specific game system that I already know 99% of GMs will need to change to fit their game I just went ahead and came up with my own loose format to go ahead and round the figure up to 100% for the GMs that will need to go through the adventure seed, make their own \"\u003cem\u003etweaks\u003c/em\u003e\" and then \"\u003cem\u003etoss\u003c/em\u003e\" the results into their game. In general a Tweak \u0026amp; Toss is three (\u003cem\u003etechnically four\u003c/em\u003e) pages: a cover, a one page map, a page of general encounters, and a page of background info. With the background info I try to give the GM the \"Who, What, Where, When, and Why\" as well as \"How much\", as in \"how much the party can get compensated\". A Tweak \u0026amp; Toss is deliberately vague so the GM can more easily integrate it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs That it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMostly.....I intend to keep on blogging about resource-saving GM options and doing reviews regardless of how well I do (\u003cem\u003eor don\u0027t do\u003c/em\u003e) with Patreon.
