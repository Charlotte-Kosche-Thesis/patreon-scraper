Welcome! I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003eQuetzaDrake\u003c/strong\u003e, and this is my Patreon page for my webcomic\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://furthiahigh.concessioncomic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFurthia High\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e! I\u0027ve been writing and drawing comics for around 13 years or so, including the long-finished\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://datarom.comicgenesis.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDATAROM!\u003c/a\u003e and even a silly sprite comic hosted on Bob and George called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bobandgeorge.com/comics/adams\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eValor\u003c/a\u003e over 10 years ago!\u00a0I\u0027ve been writing/drawing Furthia High itself in some form or another since 2005, though (that\u0027s about 9 years since I wrote this, wooooah!).\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://furthiahigh.concessioncomic.com/images/patreon/patreon2.png\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eFurthia High is a comic about the last human in a world where every other human has long since transformed themselves into anthropomorphic animals. It features that human kid attending high school as well as dealing with the mysteries of his past and a strange conspiracy against him. If you\u0027re unfamiliar with it or anything else I\u0027ve done, feel free to check them out, then come back here for the Patreon spiel!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAlright, cool, so what\u0027s up?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eWell, all the comics I\u0027ve ever drawn have been free for all to see, with no paid content whatsoever. And I don\u0027t plan to change that! \u003cstrong\u003eI never want to nor plan to charge anyone anything to be able to read any of my public online works\u003c/strong\u003e, because this is the internet and people try to be cool about that with their homemade content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, things aren\u0027t as simple and easy as they used to be years ago. I\u0027ve long since left the carefree days of schooling where everyone has tons of free time and have been immersed in the adult world of paying for things in order to live. Due to the time and effort that\u0027s required of that scenario, I\u0027ve found it harder and harder to be able to focus as much on something that\u0027s free for the masses. Therefore, in order to be able to dedicate the love and work that FH needs to it (as well as to not go bankrupt) I\u0027ve created this Patreon campaign.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe heck is Patreon?? I\u0027m frightened by the unknown!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://furthiahigh.concessioncomic.com/images/patreon/patreon3.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eSsh, it\u0027s okay, I\u0027m here. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, Patreon is a site that allows fans of a project to donate to creators in order to help them out. It\u0027s similar to a Kickstarter, with the donation tiers and the milestones and all that. However, instead of donating funds once in order to help a project come to fruition, you\u0027re donating on a set schedule (per month, week, update, etc.) in order to help the project continue and improve! It\u0027s more like a virtual tip jar that you continuously pop some spare change at every so often automatically. It\u0027s a way for creators to get consistent assistance from their fans to help make their projects better and also a way for fans to help out the creators of content that they like (while also getting some nifty benefits out of it!).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWait, \u003cem\u003edonations?\u003c/em\u003e I thought you said you weren\u0027t charging to read the comic!\u003cimg src=\"http://furthiahigh.concessioncomic.com/images/patreon/patreon4.png\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m not! Again, \u003cstrong\u003eI will never make anybody pay money to be able to read my comics.\u003c/strong\u003e Furthia High will be forever free for everyone to enjoy! You will not have to become a Patron in order to read the comic and it is in no way an obligation for you to become a Patron to continue being a reader and fan. Doing so would merely be helping me out big time and also maybe getting some exclusive bonuses out of it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u0027s up with this then? What\u0027s your end-game?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, like I said, the times have changed and I can\u0027t put the same amount of time and work into the comic as I used to. I\u0027m sure regular and long-time readers of the comic have noticed that updates have declined in both frequency and punctuality. This has mainly been due to further and further lacks of free time that I can dedicate to the comic, as well as many hardships and other life-related crap getting in the way. However, I want to make Furthia High reach the same lofty heights it once had, and maybe even go beyond! I also don\u0027t want to go broke and be in huge debt and all those other scary adult situations.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, in order to compensate, I\u0027ve begun this campaign thing in order to allow fans of Furthia High to come and donate on a regular basis in order to help me out if they\u0027d like, and I can give these generous fans some stuff in return for that help. As the milestone goals are reached and surpassed, I can spend more and more time creating and improving this comic while also not having to worry about eating and bills and other nonsense all the time. So it\u0027s a win-win for everybody!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAlright, I think I got the gist. So this is basically a thing where, if I wanted, I could donate a buck or more a week towards you, and you use that to simultaneously improve this webcomic thing and also not get debtors mad at you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://furthiahigh.concessioncomic.com/images/patreon/patreon5.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eYup, that\u0027s right!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeato! So how do I become a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, I think the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon FAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e explains the process better than I could, so peruse that for all your questions regarding signing up, pledge payments, and more! But the basic rundown is that you click the Become a Patron button up at the top-left, say how much you want to donate and what reward tier you want, put in some more stuff, then confirm!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso, just so you\u0027re all clear, \u003cstrong\u003ehow Patreon works is that it doesn\u0027t collect the donations per week until the end of the month!\u003c/strong\u003e So please keep that in mind when you are deciding on how much to pledge, because I don\u0027t want anyone to be surprised and angry about the fact that they got $100 taken out at the end of the month rather than $25 each week!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s cool, but it turns out I am literally broke. Like, a moth\u0027ll fly out of my wallet and everything. So what else can I do to support you?\u003cimg src=\"http://furthiahigh.concessioncomic.com/images/patreon/patreon6.png\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAw, that\u0027s okay, I know how that is. Once more,\u00a0donating is by no means a\u00a0requirement! You can\u00a0help\u00a0out by spreading the news of this Patreon around to your friends and other fans of the comic. You can also continue to read, enjoy, and support the comic, that\u0027s good, too!\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo yeah, if you\u0027re a fan of me and Furthia High and you\u0027re able, by all means become one of my Patrons and I\u0027ll be eternally grateful to you! Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

You get all the previous tiers\u0027 rewards, and you/your character gets to become a background character in Furthia High!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA character of your creation, or a character based on you, will be drawn in at least one panel of at least one comic page, forever immortalizing them as existing within the comic\u0027s universe! Said comic will also have a Notes blurb detailing the normally-randomly-generated information about the character, only YOU will get to fill it in instead!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e(NOTE: The background character portion of this tier is a one-time reward that will be fulfilled after your first pledge amount has been confirmed and received! However, since your character will officially exist within the comic\u0027s universe, further appearances are not out of the question!)\u003c/em\u003e",
