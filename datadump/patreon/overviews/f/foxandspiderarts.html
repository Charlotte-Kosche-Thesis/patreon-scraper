To that end,\n this page serves as the central source for news, announcements, \nupdates, and of course, all the newest art!\u003cbr\u003eWe are a pair of eclectic\n creatives who dabble in a variety of art forms, including but never \nlimited to: comics \u0026amp; graphic novels, ink work (tattoo designs, \nknotwork, colouring book pages, black-and-white finished sketches), \npencil sketches, chibi portraits, fiber arts (natural dyeing, spinning, \nknitting, weaving, etc.), collage, painting, and body art (currently \nmehndi/henna, tattooing in the works), to name but a few. We\u0027d like to \nshare the journey with you, as we learn and grow and make new Things!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e149/foxandspiderarts/IMG_0168_zpsbz2pzauh.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027re new to the idea of Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e, it\u0027s pretty straightforward: it\u0027s crowd-funding for creators on an ongoing basis, rather than based around a specific project (like Kickstarter). Patrons - that\u0027s you, we hope! - pledge to contribute a certain amount of money - $1, $25, whatever - each month, in exchange for some incentives from us (like access to our Patreon feed, with all the extras). This helps us cover the cost of making our art, essentially a \u003cstrong\u003ecrowd-funded artists\u0027 salary\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cstrong\u003eFinished pieces are shared here first\u003c/strong\u003e, before they\u2019re seen anywhere else, which means \u003cstrong\u003epatrons get first chance to make an offer on originals\u003c/strong\u003e. In the meantime, \u003cstrong\u003ewe\u0027ll also post updates, blogs, previews, behind-the-scenes and work-in-progress videos and photos, and all sorts of other fun stuff!\u003c/strong\u003e Some of this will be cross-posted elsewhere, such as FaceBook and Twitter, while some will only be accessible to $1+ patrons here. \u00a0Eventually, we hope this will empower us to quit our day jobs and make art full-time, perhaps even begin vending in person, making it that much easier for us to meet you wherever you may be!\u003cbr\u003eStill with us? If you think you might be interested in joining our Patreon community, check out our rewards list, browse through the open posts, and feel free to drop us a message any time with questions or feedback.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0027t forget\u003c/strong\u003e to come back often and check the activity feed on this page, and remember that YOU can post on it, too, Patrons!

Isn\u2019t that like getting paid twice?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nMoney can be kind of a complicated question for artists - we need it to survive, just like anybody, but truly inspired art comes from a place in the soul that is difficult to monetize. Commissions are great, but most of them essentially consist of someone else coming up with an idea and paying you to execute it. That can be fun, but as artists, we have a lot of our OWN ideas, too! We want to be able to produce art on an ongoing basis without worrying about whether a specific piece or project will sell. Making art also has its costs, which means some amount of resources, including time (which is then not being spent at another paying job) goes into it before we ever even have the art to sell.\u003cbr\u003e\nJust as importantly, we feel very strongly about producing content which is FREE for anyone to access - we don\u2019t believe one\u2019s income level should determine one\u2019s access to art! Most of our content will eventually end up available for free somewhere online one way or another, so participating in Patreon isn\u2019t really about getting a lot of exclusive access to major stuff that we make. There will be some of that; it\u2019s a perk. More importantly, though, Patreon gives us a virtual gathering place to curate our community. For us, the art we make isn\u2019t just a fun way to pass the time. It\u2019s how we process life and the world around us; it\u2019s our way of contributing to the global dialogue going on about what kind of humanity we\u2019re going to be collectively, about what sort of future we\u2019re building together right now. We want our art to sustain a life that allows us to feed our art - it\u2019s cyclical, and a critical part of that process involves the community who finds what we make to be relevant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u2019s with the numbers on this page?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nIf you\u2019ve started counting things up and realised that the total number of our pledges doesn\u2019t quite match the number on the upper left reflecting our earnings, that\u2019s because Patreon takes a 5% cut to pay their overhead. In the early days, the total amount of pledges was also listed as the number being earned, but Patreon has since changed that policy to more accurately reflect what creators actually receive. Crowd-funding means our crowd - our community - pays our salary, and therefore this platform aims for transparency wherever possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, enough about money. Talk about content! What can we expect?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nSeveral things! First, we\u2019re both already artists making Things all the time, and whatever we make, you\u2019ll see come through here. In most cases, you\u2019ll be able to see it here before you see it anywhere else, so if you\u2019re excited about what we make, consider at least joining the community for access to updates and ongoing work!\u003cbr\u003e\nSecond, we have Future Plans. The sooner we can get the Patreon off the ground enough to get us to a point where we\u2019re no longer locked into spending the majority of our time and effort on other jobs, the sooner we\u2019ll be able to devote all that energy to making more Things. Several comic projects, a colouring book, a podcast, a blog, novels already in the works, and a tattoo studio are just a few of the things we aim to manifest as we go forward.\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso, we\u2019re both curious people, and we love learning new things. Whenever possible, we take workshops and classes, we network with other artists, we try new techniques and materials and experiment with ideas. This means what we do is always evolving, and what we hope to do with the Patreon is take you with us for the journey.\u003cbr\u003e\nIn more concrete terms, you\u2019ll see a lot of things here. We\u2019re going to be including our patrons in the discussion of what we\u2019re doing currently and what we\u2019re taking on next; we\u2019ll share work-in-progress photos and descriptions, offer virtual hangouts, let you preview things that aren\u2019t done yet, ask for your feedback on various projects and ideas, and generally treat you as our inner circle. You\u2019ll see finished works first, and if they\u2019re available for sale, patrons will get first offer. Patrons will also see the extras that we don\u2019t necessarily share elsewhere, like character sketches and silly comics, or occasional pictures of our furry household creatures, or poems and random musings. We want to have fun with the Patreon; it\u2019s going to be an ongoing dialogue with all of you about what works and what doesn\u2019t, so be sure to share your feedback and let us know! \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Two creative souls with a shared mission: to make as much art as possible while living a full, intentional, and epic life on this planet. Anjuli and Madeline Keller-King share a passion for new experiences, foods, places, cultures, and people, so while they call a tiny cottage in the northern woods of Montana home, they alternate cultivating their cosy home-space and organic garden and snuggling their fur-children with doing charity work, making art, and travelling - ideally all at once! Along the way, they love to connect with and support other creative folks who are living their passion and helping to make the world a more beautiful, compassionate, and interconnected place.\u003cbr\u003eMadeline fell in love with comics at a young age, along with anime and manga, all of which got her through middle and high school and greatly influenced her later artistic style just as much as the time she spent at art school. Though she didn\u0027t walk away with the official paper, she does retain a love of creative endeavours and a desire to fill the world with all kinds of art. You\u0027ll rarely find her far from her web - this fiber-artist carries spare projects with her at all times, and at least two of her limbs are usually busy knitting some new wonder for someone. Aside from this, she specialises in comics, cartoons, and painting, when she\u0027s not dancing.\u003cbr\u003eAround the age of six, Anjuli\u00a0discovered the marriage of stories and pictures in two places: illustrated faerietales and ElfQuest. Ever since then, they\u0027ve had a passion for graphic novels, writing (and reading) stories, and making the world a better place through art. With a whole world to fall in love with, what young fox wouldn\u0027t dream of widening their wanderings? Along the way, mostly home schooled, Anjuli\u00a0learned to do mehndi (henna) in India and fell in love with body art altogether, then ran away to the theatre for awhile before coming back to all that art still demanding to be made, focusing on tattoo design, Celtic knots, comics, collage, and inkwork stylisations of all kinds of flora and fauna, with a bit of occasional spinning and painting to keep it interesting.\u003cbr\u003eTogether, Madeline and Anjuli hope to make the making of art a sustainable lifestyle for its own sake, and through their art and work to improve and give back to the world around them and the community that supports and believes in them, so that others may likewise be empowered to live the life they are most called to.\u003cbr\u003e",
