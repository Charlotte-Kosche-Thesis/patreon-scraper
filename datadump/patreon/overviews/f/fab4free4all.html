    "summary": "The Fab 4 Free 4 All is a talk show that focuses on the Beatles, solo Beatles, and related artists.\u003cbr\u003eAnd what, exactly, do we talk about? No topics, and no opinions, are off limits.  We tell it like it is, with an eye toward offering up accurate, and sometimes unique, facts, information, and anecdotes. And since the show is hosted by three longtime friends with VERY individual likes, dislike and perspectives, there is always respectful, but humorous conversation and debate in every episode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFab 4 Free 4 All is available as a podcast for download on iTunes and at Archive.org, and our site Fab4free4all.com. The show is hosted by three Beatle experts \u2013 radio veterans, authors, and lecturers \u2013 who have each done substantial research and reporting on the world\u2019s most famous rock band. Each has spent years either writing about, lecturing on, or broadcasting the music of the Beatles (or doing some combination of all of those things!). They first joined forces in 2009 as members of The Fab Fourum. (Episodes of that show can be heard on Archive.org.) That highly successful show eventually led to this exciting new adventure, Fab 4 Free 4 All.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Fab 4 Free 4 All crew - Mitch Axelrod\n(Beatletoons author), Rob Leonard (Beatlesongs host - WHPC 90.3 FM), and Tony\nTraguardo (4F/Beatletrax host -WCWP 88.1 FM) focuses on topics that span the Beatles\u2019 group and solo careers. Think of any song or album, any aspect of the Beatles as a group, solo artists, musicians, songwriters, or any part of their history ... and it\u0027s all here, or bound to be featured in a show some time down the road. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donation will help us keep the show going by helping us pay for studio and production time. Thanks for your consideration and we hope you like our show."
