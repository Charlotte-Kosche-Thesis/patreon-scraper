    "summary": "My name is Zack Roach. \u00a0I am the founder of Free Music ICT. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFree Music ICT is a non profit guitar-driven music education program that provides free private and group guitar lessons throughout the greater Wichita area to the students, schools, and outreach programs that need it most. \u00a0Free Music ICT was founded in September 2016 because of one student that was determined to play guitar and couldn\u0027t afford lessons due to circumstances outside of their control. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe program quickly grew to 15 students, all taking private lessons in our home studio at zero cost to them or their families. \u00a0The demand was so large, we decided to expand Free Music ICT\u0027s efforts into the local public school system and outreach programs in an effort to reach as many students as possible. This allowed us to assist and add to public school music programs without having to having to put monetary strain on those existing programs. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy February 2017, Free Music ICT was integrated into a number of elementary and middle school programs, teaching over two hundred students a week. \u00a0The majority of these students had never touched a guitar. \u00a0Free Music ICT has given them a structured environment to explore their musical interests with a fun and interesting guitar curriculum. This fall we plan on expanding our program to more middle and high schools as well as Boys and Girls Club of South-Central Kansas. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy whole life has been dedicated to music. For the past 14 years, I have built a career in the music industry working for bands and playing guitar live on the road all over the world. For the past seven years I have spent the majority of my time touring and writing in the band Senses Fail. \u00a0My vision has always been to give back to my local music community by providing lessons and teaching kids the things that I wish I knew when I started my musical journey. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFree Music ICT is funded through our Patreon, as well as public and private donations. \u00a0These funds are what make Free Music ICT operate the way that we think is the most effective: free to the students, schools, and outreach programs that need it the most. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eAll donations are one hundred percent tax deductible\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to help Free Music ICT grow and expand into more schools and in turn reach more students with the gift of music, please consider becoming a Patron. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for checking out Free Music ICT and considering helping us change kids lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eZack Roach,\u003cbr\u003eFounder and President of Free Music ICT.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
