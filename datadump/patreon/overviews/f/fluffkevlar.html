My name is Fluff-Kevlar, and I draw mostly \u003cstrong\u003eadult/NSFW\u003c/strong\u003e anthro/furry artwork, but you will see both non-adult and non-furry here too. I\u0027m not the fastest artist, and I try to put quality over quantity, so while I won\u0027t be making a TON of drawings each month, I work very hard to make a variety of high-quality art for patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoal of this Patreon-\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMost of my work in the past had been on nothing but individual \ncommissions and paysite pinups. I started this page as a means to fund \nartwork that might not otherwise ever be drawn; I\u0027d have to wait for \nsomeone to commission it, or squeeze in the time myself with no income \nfor it and hope it made money later. Things like pinups, streams, tutorials, and comics. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI dislike pay-walls, so I don\u0027t ask for money to just look at my stuff; almost everything here will be shared \n\u003cstrong\u003epublicly for free\u003c/strong\u003e later. However, patrons see this work earlier, get to vote and give feedback, see any alternate versions, in higher resolutions, and stream benefits as really my only way of saying \"thank you\" without turning my Patreon into a pay-wall. This isn\u0027t a store, you\u0027re \u003cstrong\u003emaking a pledge to support\u003c/strong\u003e my work, and I only ask you pledge what you think my work is worth!
