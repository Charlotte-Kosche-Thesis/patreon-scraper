Anyways!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, everybody! I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFatelogic\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, an independant illustrator from Argentina who began to hone his skills in the trade of drawings and occasional gaming back in the year 2012, give or take (although my fascination for drawing goes way back).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy style could be described as \"anime/manga\" oriented, and I work in both the SFW and NSFW areas of the trade (although I tend to be more NSFW than SFW usually... That\u0027s what passion does to you, kids...)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you might know me from \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"The Original Sin\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e gals, which is my personal set of OCs, while others might know me for my fanart works (the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eM.S.A.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eM.S.A. 2\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e free to play 18+ flash games being my most widespread creations, along with my last title: \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMicro-H Game: Espey!\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEither way, that\u0027s basically what I do. I create content and expose it around my sites, and luckyly enough, the fanbase in the \"Fate\" ranks has been growing for a while now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, as an unavoidable side effect of reality (cursed be thy, real life), all of this work consumes a lot of time invested in practice and planification, and since most of my work is free for everyone, my poor wallet always hinges over the edge of collapse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I come here to ask of \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e for your help: I love my trade. I gave up on a lot of things in order to be able to focus on this, and if possible, I\u0027d like to stay on this track. I\u0027d like to be able to progress and develop my skills, to become a better illustrator and game designer, and since that requires a really big ammount of time and effort, juggling this with full time jobs outside of the trade is out of the question (I tried... way too many times... but I have to pick a side eventually, and it\u0027d be really sad to give up on my dream in order to stuff my head on an accountants office once again for a couple bucks a month... *shudders*).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to, one day, find a way to make a constant, stable living out of what I love to do, but in the meantime, all I can do is keep on doing what I do best (drawing) while asking for your assistance... So, if you enjoy my works, and would like to see more of it in the future, please consider becoming a patron of mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not asking for you to get a mortage in your house to make me rich (although if you have a spare home, who knows, right...? Just kidding...), I\u0027m just asking for whatever you can spare to throw it this way. It might not make much of a difference for you individually...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e... But it means the world for me.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks in advance, and stay awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFATE OUT!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S.: By the way, I\u0027m always open to suggestions regarding this Patreon. Any ideas and whatnot that you might have about how to improve this experience both for you and for the audience in general will be greatly appreciated. I\u0027m on this thanks to you, after all ;)"
