    "summary": "Purpose: Female Film Critics (@FemaleCritics) champions women in an industry that reports on the depressing statistics (27% of Rotten Tomatoes-approved \"Top Critics\" are women), but has yet to do much to resolve the glaring gender disparity. Women are 51% of the population and 52% of moviegoers, yet cultural discourse continues to be dictated by men. We want to combat \u201cthe old boys\u0027 club\u201d with our own support network by highlighting the writing and talents of overlooked women writers and critics. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003ePatreon Goal: Right now, the account is mostly on Twitter, with a few posts on Facebook and a relatively inactive Slack. With funding, we can grow into a full-fledged resource for women writers and film fans seeking women voices. With more funds, we will create a newsletter (\u003cstrong\u003eGOAL REACHED!!\u003c/strong\u003e), start a podcast, and launch a website with paid writing and networking tools.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOrigins: Over a year ago, I (Diana Drumm) was chatting with Pacific Standard\u2019s Katie Kilkenny about the lack of women in film criticism while she was prepping her piece \"How the Internet Led to the Decline of Female Film Critics\" for The Atlantic. (If you haven\u2019t read it yet, you really should.) In the midst of venting my own pent-up frustrations, I realized that there wasn\u2019t really a hub focused on women film writers on twitter. Yes, there was \u201cFilm Twitter,\" but well, I think most of us have witnessed that it\u2019s not always the most supportive environment. After checking the web and with Katie, I decided to launch the twitter account \u2014 part motivation stream, part promotional tool for women writers, part message board.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, it\u2019s evolved and grown into something much bigger. The response has been so positive and so embracing from fellow writers, august editors, aspiring fledgling critics, film fans, and people looking for more women voices in general. The account was named one of \u201c50 Signs of Hope for Culture in 2016\u201d by Flavorwire. (Thank you, Alison Nastasi!) Female Films Critics collaborated with Women and Hollywood on \u201cThe Dudeocracy of Film Critics\" as well as guest posts and editing. (Thank you, Melissa Silverstein!!) I\u2019ve spoken about the account on podcasts including Marya E. Gates\u2019s \"Female Filmmaker Friday\" and \u201cOne Week Only\u201d with Carlos Aguilar and Conor Holt. I even attended NYFF with a badge reading \u201cDiana Drumm, Female Film Critics.\u201d (NYFF is the best of the best, and I wholly recommend young-ish film writers applying to the NYFF Critics Academy.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, I am one person manning (or womanning?) the account, and that has limited its impact and reach. With your donation, I can turn this account into something bigger than a womanned twitter bot and build more positive change towards gender parity in the film industry, onscreen and off. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of the rewards to your right and our goals to your left, here are some more patron-related perks...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eACHIEVED (!!)\u003c/strong\u003e: If we reach 25 patrons by Sunday, January 15th at 5 PM EST, we will live-tweet and live-curate the U.S. premiere of The Young Pope, as well as the rest of the season.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we reach 50 patrons, we will host a weekly live-tweet/hashtag discussion of a film directed by a woman currently streaming online as part of #52FilmsByWomen. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we reach 75 patrons, I will gather a few female film critics together and we will do dramatic readings of Max Landis tweetstorms. (Thanks for the suggestion, Dor Dotson!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
