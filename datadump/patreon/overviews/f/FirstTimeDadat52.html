I am sure that over time I\nwill bore you to death with tall tales, simple truths and pearls of wisdom\ngarnered during my first 50+ years, while sharing my life as a first-time dad\nat 52.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn September 2015, my fiance, Lynn and I were having dinner with her middle son (she\nhas three adult sons) and I shared that one of the biggest regrets of my life\nwas not having children.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGod must have been listening, because within a few weeks, Lynn leaned\nover in bed and said, \u201cGuess what?  \u2026 I\u2019m\npregnant.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis was especially shocking, because Lynn was not supposed to be able to have babies anymore. \u00a0The factory was closed, or so we thought.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShe shared this with me on October 24, 2015, the morning of her 46th birthday party and we essentially kept it a secret until Christmas Eve, when we\ntold my family.  Most of her family found\nout on Christmas Day. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen we told my mother, she told us that my grandfather was 52 when she\nwas born and that her brother Bill (my namesake) had his first and only child\nat 52.  So, it appears that I am\nfollowing a family tradition.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince then, I have been kicking around the idea of writing a blog about\nbeing a first-time dad at 52.  Of course,\nlike all bloggers, I wondered if anyone would benefit from my ramblings, find\nit a bit self-serving or even care one way or another.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nObviously, I have decided to forge ahead anyway and I hope that through\nmy joy, pain, successes, failures, sleepless nights, breathless moments,\nanxiety attacks, heartwarming tales and more that we can all learn something\ntogether.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, the goal is to spend more time with my son Daniel and share our life, in the hope that others can learn as I learn, laugh as we laugh, cry when we cry and smile as we smile."

This will be a series of educational books, which will feature photos of DJ with at least one person from every country on Earth. \u00a0Following the book series, our goal is to actually take DJ to every country in the World.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, and in partnership with First Time Dad at 52, we plan to write an advice blog, which will also become a book for young men (and women) entitled, \"Do As I Say, Not As I Did!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have made our fair share of mistakes over the years and although we know it is important for each of us to learn from our mistakes, maybe, just maybe, we can help a few avoid some of ours or at least give them some advice, which will help to make the recovery for our readers, much easier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also plan to revive our first blog and website, Stirring Up Romance, which will give step by step guides for men (or women) to create romantic evenings for their wife, girlfriend or partner. \u003cem\u003e(Preferably not all at the same time!!!) \u00a0Our plan is to publish an annual cookbook.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, since Lynn and I love to travel, we will start a travel blog in which, we will give tips for traveling to various locations around the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those in Southern California, Lynn and I will revive our blog, \"On the Town with Lynn and Bill,\" in which we review family activities, restaurants, shows, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast but not least, we are in the process of creating The Ultimate Life-Long Bucket List!!! Our goal is to publish it in book form, divided by continent, county and state with spaces for you to add bucket list items of your own!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, our current plan is to home school Daniel. We will share what we learn along the way.  The challenges, the advantages, the success and the failures. Our hope is that we will be able to make the case for the freedom and choices afforded to families who home school.",
