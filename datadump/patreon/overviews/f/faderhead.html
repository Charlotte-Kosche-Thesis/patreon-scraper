    "summary": "Hey there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Sami Mark Yahya and you may know me under my producer name Faderhead. I\u0027ve been making pop-infused darkelectro for over 10 years and have released almost as many albums. I used to be signed to different record labels but have decided to release everything myself in 2015 (under the name Not A Robot Records). For the last 2 years I\u0027ve also been writing a weekly newsletter with essays about anything related to making music, artistic motivation or creative strategies in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what is this Patreon thing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is basically a Faderhead inner circle club membership. Every month I\u0027ll release a \"song of the month\" that is exclusive to Patrons and won\u0027t be available anywhere else. Additionally every week there\u0027ll be a newsletter that discusses what has happened to me during the week and that dissects all sorts of topics that anyone who works on their own project can probably relate to: from \u003cem\u003e\"How to avoid songwriter\u0027s block\"\u003c/em\u003e to \"\u003cem\u003eHow tour booking is really done\"\u003c/em\u003e to \"\u003cem\u003eWhy creative projects usually don\u0027t work like everyone thinks they do\"\u003c/em\u003e. I\u0027ve been told many times that these essays speak to a lot of people, so maybe they can help you with getting ahead in your projects, too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons at higher levels will also get insight into the evolution of the song, because I usually save my work in different versions as I write, record and produce. So you\u0027ll be able to listen to these tracks that usually only my closest friends get to hear. And if you are interested in the full inner circle experience, you can join me via live stream while I work in the studio where I\u0027ll be available for Q\u0026amp;As on all sorts of topics. And all this for less than the cost of a single Starbucks coffee!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I get out of this? Mostly it will allow me to stay focused on making music (instead of having to expand my day job to finance the release of music) and I will use any of the additional income to upgrade the equipment in the studio. Although I\u0027m not much of a gear hound, really ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for checking out my Patreon and I look forward to welcoming you inside of my inner circle!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
