We \nare one of the earliest pioneers in the realm of immersive theatre and \nwe were founded in 1989 by John Harrigan. The stories we manifest are infamous for \nbreaking boundaries and opening the border between performer and \naudience. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor over twenty eight years we\u0027ve developed new \nmethodologies to imagine, create and manifest living dreamworlds, which \naudiences are free to investigate, explore and inhabit. Once inside a \nFoolishPeople performance, you\u2019re free to choose your own journey, with \nthe autonomy and power to alter the flow of the narrative. This \nchallenges our habitual ways of experiencing stories in a passive \nmanner.

Spectators must choose their own journey without guidance, which challenges their habitual way of watching art and entertainment in a passive manner.

We have produced our work for conventional theatres, galleries and site-specific venues.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver a number of years, FoolishPeople has developed a unique practice, \u003cem\u003eTheatre of Manifestation\u003c/em\u003e.
