But one that I feel is definately a sexy spin that I\u0027ve been dyinggg to bring you guys is the Playmate Bunny Suit Style Harley Quinn! When Playboy and Harley collide...What could be sexier than that, right?!? I\u0027ve seen it done a few times and I can\u0027t waiiiit to put my own spin on it! Unfortunately, my work schedule is so crazy hectic that I couldn\u0027t possibly try making on everything myself...not that I\u0027d be great at making one anyway. And having one custom made is pretty pricey, so I decided to make this my first goal here on patreon! Hopefully with your help I can earn enough to have this cosplay created and customized for me and bring you guys LoTs of fun \u0026amp; sexy pictures of it as well as bring it to some of you in person at upcoming cons! \u2764\ufe0f??\u2764\ufe0f?",
