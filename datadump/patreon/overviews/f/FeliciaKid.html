    "summary": "Hey now, Patrons!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Felicia Kid and I am a blogger, streetwear fashion designer and the host of my own podcast!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWho am I?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eI started writing short stories when I was in elementary school. I remember the first chapter book I ever read, it was by Judy Blume.\u00a0 I was infatuated with the way she told stories, her characters were so much like me and I was hooked. I got my hands on every book she had, and from then I knew I wanted to somehow become a writer.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003eWhere am I from?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI grew up in the whole MTV era so I was in love with Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Prince. I\u0027ve always known what was happening in the entertainment industry due to Right On! Magazine and shows like YO! MTV Raps and Rap City. As we got more involved in the generation of social media I began to blog, and that led to my supporters asking why haven\u0027t I started a t-shirt line? Well, I had never thought about it at the time, but I live for fashion, so I started my independent streetwear brand Kid Jumper in 2015. And then I wanted to start a podcast, and here I am.\u00a0 I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m 4 episodes in, and I really want to record more shows with different successful and career driven people. Doing podcasts are not free so I figured that starting a Patreon page would be a dope way for people to make donations that will go STRICTLY to my projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you see?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to step more outside of the box with my projects, being the most creative ME is so important, so I will do YouTube videos, show exclusive Kid Jumper designs, have Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s, and behind the scenes content, in other words, I\u0027m leveling up!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so excited for this and I am grateful\u00a0to everybody that is here for me and my vision!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
