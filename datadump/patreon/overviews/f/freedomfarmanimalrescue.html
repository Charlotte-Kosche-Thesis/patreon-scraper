    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eNew Jersey\u0027s Freedom Farm Animal Rescue is a 501c3 Nonprofit Organization.\u00a0Our mission is to provide food, shelter, \u0026amp; veterinary care in a safe secure healthy environment for abused abandon or otherwise homeless farm animals as well as finding new forever homes when appropriate.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Tara Seay, President and founder of New Jersey\u0027s Freedom Farm Animal Rescue Inc. and this is our story! My fianc\u00e9 and I started rescuing and working with animals in 2013 when we started fostering and volunteering for local dog rescues. At the time we had 3 large breed dogs of our own so we moved to a 5 acre farm to accommodate our growing family of adopted rescue pets. After becoming more familiar with the rescue world we did many dog rescues on our own and pulled dogs from various circumstances, made sure they received proper veterinary care, spayed or neutered them and found loving forever families for each one of them. In working with other rescues, many had found out about us having a small piece of land and in 2014 we were asked if we could take in a pair of baby male goats that were pulled from a meat auction. I remember thinking to myself \u0027\u0027goats at a meat auction? but people don\u0027t eat goats, right?\". Oh man did I have a lot to learn about the farm animal world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started researching everything we could about basic goat care, what they ate, their health needs, the type of fencing that best contains them, the list went on and on and we loved learning everything we could about them! Not long after the goats arrived, we were asked to take in a homeless potbelly pig that found herself at the local shelter. Then we were asked to take in a few chickens that no one wanted because they no longer laid eggs, then some geese, then a horse with leg issues! We quickly learned that there was a need for a sanctuary for discarded, neglected, abused and otherwise homeless farm animals. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe both worked full time, as our small rescue continued to grow, in order to be able to afford to provide feed, veterinary care, sheltering, fencing and supplies, all of which are not cheap, to all of our rescue babies. After a couple of years and a few hundreds of rescued farm animal lives later, a family member asked us why with all the work we do to save animals and educate the public were we not an actual rescue yet. Not knowing anything about the legal process of becoming a nonprofit ourselves, she donated her time and money to help us with our next big step and in September of 2016, New Jersey\u0027s Freedom Farm Animal Rescue became an official 501c3 nonprofit organization.\u003cbr\u003eWhen we first started rescuing farm animals, our mission was to save as many as possible lives and bring them to our sanctuary where they either live out their lives with us or find loving homes of their own. The more animals that came through the more of a difference we thought we were making. We had reached a point where we had probably rescued about 50 goats total over the years. That\u0027s when we went to our first livestock auction. I just remember standing there in a warehouse with THOUSANDS of goats marked for slaughter. They were crammed into these tiny holding pens with about 100 goats in each pen. An auction worker told us 50,000 animals come through auction each week before getting sent off to slaughter. 50,00 EACH WEEK. We began to question what we were doing. Sure we were making the world of difference for the lives we were able to save, but in the grand scheme of things what difference were we actually making to stop this? That very moment is when our mission evolved. Saving their lives was simply not enough. We needed to share their stories with the world. We needed to educate the public on what happens to these innocent souls. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn just our first year as a 501c3 nonprofit farm animal rescue we have grown tremendously. We currently have over 200 beautiful souls that call our sanctuary home and count on us daily. We decided creating a Patreon would give us a more reliable source of security when it comes to financially catering to all of the animals currently in our rescue while also allowing us to be able to continue to save animals in need of our care as well as being able to expand and continue to grow. Please join us as we stand up for those that can not stand up for themselves, help us by giving a voice that can never be silenced to those who go unheard and unnoticed. Be their hero. Be a Freedom Hero!"
