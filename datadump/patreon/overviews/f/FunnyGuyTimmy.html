Despite this, I really want to continue to do audio gear reviews for you all. So I would like to set monthly goals and have you guys vote on the gear you would like to see reviewed next. Then once we raise the money, I will buy it, test it,\u00a0and review it. After this point, I will hold a contest for you guys to win the mics, interfaces, etc. If you guys like my reviews and would like to support my channel, please join the team on PATREON. Thanks you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/FunnyGuyTimmy\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/FunnyGuyTimmy\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove you all.\u003cbr\u003eFunnyGuyTimmy"
