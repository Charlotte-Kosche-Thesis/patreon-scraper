We break down favorite scenes, and discuss various aspects of the movies, and sometimes get side tracked into utter nonsense, its a fun ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started this patreon with the intention of growing the show, we have ideas for large events, live shows, merch, movie festivals, etc. but right now we run the show completely out of pocket so we are limited by our personal incomes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonations to our patreon page will be used to improve equipment, purchase movie tickets, and if it grows enough, to purchase tickets to film festivals and the like. If you like hearing us babble about our passion for movies, please consider donating to the cause!\u003cbr\u003e"
