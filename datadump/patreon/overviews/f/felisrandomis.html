I\u0027ve been told my style is unique, so I hope I\u0027m able to offer that to y\u0027all~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my first time trying something like this, and I\u0027m a bit tentative.

This does not roll over. If you do not contact me with the information by the next billing cycle, then your stream is forfeit\u003cbr\u003e\n",
