    "summary": "In the year that have passed I\u0027ve decided to more intensively pursue composing/producing opportunities that will help me pay my rent and place food on my table. This basically means it\u0027s hard for me to spend much time on a project like The Elder Scrolls V: Skywind, regardless how much I love doing it. But with help from you I have a chance to actually continue.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eRight now, you\u0027ll get my entire The Elder Scrolls V: Skywind Soundtrack by pledging $1 or more.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always happy to see people enjoy what I do and sharing YouTube links to my content et.c. That being said - if you want to go that extra mile in helping me pay musicians and simply helping me to produce the most pro sounding music possible - you can consider donating and sharing this with your friends and community!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegarding new tracks you are donating per song. If you\u0027re worried about me putting out loads and loads of content, you can easily set a maximum amount to donate per month. If I have a pro mastering engineer master a track that you\u0027ve already donated for, you will not have to to so again to receive the mastered version.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t promise to have frequent hang outs or provide music that only patrons have access to and hopefully enjoy, but I do promise that I\u0027ll do my very best to continue writing and provide you and the TES community with more music. And I believe that\u0027s exactly what you want from me and actually care about, right? However feel free to give suggestions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf and when deciding to donate you\u0027ll get access to my Soundtrack from The Elder Scrolls V: Skywind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLooking forward to hear from you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAzura guide you :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNOTE: As you perhaps know the TES Renewal team is not allowed to accept payment or donations for the Skywind project per se. If you decide to be a patron, you\u0027re supporting ME, be it in my compositions of said mod or something else.\u003c/em\u003e"

While operatic singing is hugely important to me, more and more of my time is invested in my own writing, wanting to break into the game and film industry. Under 2014/2015 with my work on The Elder Scrolls V: Skywind, my desire to work professionally in the business has grown even more. I\u0027m located in Gothenburg, Sweden.",
