Truly, isn\u0027t that wonderful? Being part of a reader\u0027s journey to finding a book they truly love?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years Fantasy-Faction has published over 2000 articles, published an anthology, hosted workshops at conventions, and put on a number of signing/panel events. In the years to come we\u0027d like to start-up a podcast, launch our very own genre awards and even hold a convention. We hope you consider donating to our site so we can keep the content coming and realise some of our more ambitious ideas!\u003cbr\u003e"
