    "summary": "Forgotten Hwy has always been dedicated to making sure that the most historically important roads from around the country can be documented, uploaded and shared with people all across Southern California and Southern Arizona. However, I am now ready to expand Forgotten Hwy\u0027s reach. But in order to do so, I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a college student, most of the time I film my videos on the weekends and in my free time. However, even then, it calculates out to a lot. By my last calculations, it costs more than 10x what I make in Adsense revenue to make a Forgotten Hwy video. As you can tell, this is not a very sound business decision. During the Ad-pocolypse, I had come to a fork in the road: shut down completely, or launch a Patreon campaign. I think you know which way I went. For the first 8 months, I have only had one Patron to help me, but it still cost 3x as much to make videos then what I pull in. \u003cstrong\u003eI have never intended for Forgotten Hwy to be profitable, just sustainable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is why I need your help. Coming up on year two of Forgotten Hwy, I\u0027m coming back to basics. I just want to be able to film more roads for you. I have big ideas of scenic roads and Ride Alongs that I think you all will love (including the remainder of Route 66). But I can\u0027t do them without you. I cannot stress how important each and every donation is to me. It allows me to continue doing what I love, and I will never be able to thanks each and every one of you. \u003cstrong\u003eNo amount is too small.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
