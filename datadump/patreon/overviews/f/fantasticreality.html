I\u0027m focusing on shorter stories, that can be played over the course of a session or two (maybe three). I\u0027ll include smart hooks that allow you to slide these quirky adventures\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eright into your existing campaigns\u003c/strong\u003e. There\u0027s also advice on expanding them if your players want more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the plots you\u0027ll see include \u003cem\u003ehalflings acting badly\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003elost ghost ships\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003edemons with unusual requests\u003c/em\u003e.

I write for D\u0026amp;D 5E, but I may occasionally add some other systems into the mix - whatever strikes my fancy.

It\u0027s always quite hard to ensure that your party stays in the spotlight when armies clash, here it\u0027s done magnificently.\" [Megan R. Featured Reviewer]\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
