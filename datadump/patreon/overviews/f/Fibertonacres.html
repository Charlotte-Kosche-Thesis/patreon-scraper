    "summary": "We (Ric and Ashley) are super duper excited to see you! \u00a0Who are we, you wonder? We are two crazy peeps, doing the Full Time RVer thing with our tiny fiber farm. To put that in other terms, we packed up our RV in sunny CA, hitched the livestock trailer up to it, and traveled across the country with 3 Shetland sheep, 5 angora rabbits, 2 cats and a dog to park our menagerie in Eastern Ohio, right near the WV border for Ric to go to school. \u00a0Ashley holds down the fiber farm, while working at the farm we are parked at. \u00a0We both work on our business, Fiberton Acres, where we create heirloom gifts in the slow fiber/fashion movement, as well as goods for yarncrafters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all our crazy shenanigans, we decided it was time to start a podcast and share some of our stories, as well as some history on this under-appreciated world of horticulture and animal husbandry. \u00a0So we share our humorous takes on this world, as well as homesteading. \u00a0Actually, let\u0027s be serious for a sec. \u00a0We care deeply for our fellow man, and the environment that we live in. \u00a0And we want to share and educate around a lifestyle that has been seen as not ideal work, work that does not make money, and therefore people often think is not important. \u00a0But it is incredibly important, and we want to take a little time each week to make this tough but rewarding lifestyle slightly more accessible to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we hope you will join us in this crazy journey, incorporating our silly flair, our nerdy interests and our funny experiences with a little history on our podcast! \u00a0Your support helps us to not only continue making these podcasts to share and educate, but helps us continue on our crazy journey as well. Thanks for listening and supporting!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Ric and Ashley and the Fiberton gang"
