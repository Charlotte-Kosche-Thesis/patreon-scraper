We want to reach the point where we can pay our writers professional rates. This will bring more high-quality content our way and will improve the general level of our magazine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe work with a number of people, such as first readers, copyeditors, proofreaders, artists, programmers, and more, who all donate their time and expertise for this project. So far, we can\u0027t pay them; they do this because of their passion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut obviously, passion can only feed so many people. At some point we want the magazine to be self-sufficient, relying only on subscribers. Until then we are turning to the\u00a0community and asking for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://fantasyscrollmag.com/wp-content/uploads/images/issues/articles/bullseye2.jpg\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, we can accelerate the magazine development and attract more great stories. A steady stream of income is extremely important for that to happen, which is why we turned to a service such as Patreon, to help bridge that gap. Using this service you can select to donate as little\u00a0as $1 per issue. It doesn\u0027t sound like much, but the power of the masses is strong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat are the rewards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a supporter of Fantasy Scroll Mag comes with its own perks.
