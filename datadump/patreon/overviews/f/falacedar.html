    "summary": "Hey! Thanks for checking out my page! I\u0027m Fala Cedar and I paint articulated paper dolls of your favorite Swedish rock musicians*. I also draw lots of creepy-cute little creatures and demons, including some plump little monster things I call womberscootches. Some of these critters end up being made into 1\" pinback buttons, along with cute animals, devil stuff, witchy stuff, and whatever else strikes my fancy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/a05ea7da4f14aebb8810d951c4aab418/tumblr_oyd82cQHtH1vsa6ezo1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making art as long as I\u0027ve been able to hold a crayon, but it\u0027s only been in the past year that I finally found my true passion: paper dolls. I made my first paper doll last year, of one of the Nameless Ghouls from Ghost, just because I thought it would be funny. Well, it \u003cem\u003ewas\u003c/em\u003e funny, and I got such a nice reaction to it that I started making more. They are fussy to make, and time consuming, but I love making them! I especially enjoy the thought and engineering that goes into figuring out how to paint the pieces so that they assemble nicely and look good.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe little demons and monsters are things I\u0027ve drawn off and on for many years. They went dormant for a long time as I dabbled in other art forms, but they clamored to be set free again. I\u0027m glad they did! Since I\u0027m super-inspired by music, some of my friendly demons make their way into mini \"gig posters\". Maybe someday, a band will actually ask me to draw something for them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/fc252f6af047e6e7920457df05d6c5b9/tumblr_oyd82cQHtH1vsa6ezo2_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe short version is this: I\u0027m in my late 40\u0027s and have spent too many years trying to fit into someone else\u0027s idea of what my art should be, or what I should do with it. I\u0027m done with that. I want to do what makes me happy, and making paper dolls and weird little creatures makes me happy. I love that my art is funny and makes people smile. Patrons like you can help me afford a little time each week to paint and draw. I\u0027ve wasted way too many years worrying about all the wrong things. I don\u0027t want to worry anymore; I want to get busy and make some art!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e*I do plan on venturing outside of Sweden for paper doll inspiration at some point. It\u0027s hard, though, because all the best musicians come from Sweden.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
