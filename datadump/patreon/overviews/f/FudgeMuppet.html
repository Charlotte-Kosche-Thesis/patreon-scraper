You only have to put our channel on restricted mode to see how silly it gets. Our channel only has about 28 unharmed videos, out of the total of about 900. That\u2019s about only 3% of our channel\u2019s content untouched. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe refuse to change the kind of content we make and the way we act on the channel. We will not sacrifice the creativity that makes FudgeMuppet so unique and entertaining. Thankfully, and very heart \u2018warmingly\u2019, many of you guys have\nactually reached out to us asking if there\u2019s a way you can help us. This Patreon is our response to you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust\nwatching our content regularly is ridiculously appreciated by all of us, and we\u2019re actually going to keep pumping out all of our videos at\nthe same quality and frequency as best as we can, despite the significant\ndrawback of reduced ad revenue. If you want to help us we are forever grateful, but if you are unable to, then that is truly fine. Thank you!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0"
