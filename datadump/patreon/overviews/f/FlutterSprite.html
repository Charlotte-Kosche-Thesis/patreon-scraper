I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003eTim Ashley Jenkins\u003c/strong\u003e, and I like to make stuff, mostly relating to video games and other sorts of games!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the start of the year, my video game was picked up by a publisher, so now I\u0027m working on more stuff than ever before! Right now, there\u0027s three major projects that I\u0027m putting work into:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGrapple Force Rena \u003c/strong\u003eis a 2D platform action game where you can grapple anywhere and throw anything! In this game, you\u0027ll guide our heroine Rena through 30 courses full of all sorts of obstacles and enemies, swinging freely on any surface and throwing your foes into each other. This is my main project, and the one that occupies most of my time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also started contributing code to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://evennia.com\"\u003eEvennia\u003c/a\u003e, a, open source, Python-based engine for making your own multiplayer text games. I\u0027ve focused my contributions on creating lots of pre-made game systems that can easily be modified, letting people get up and running with their dream games faster and easier!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, I\u0027ve started my own streaming project called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/ashleysarcade\"\u003eAshley\u0027s Arcade\u003c/a\u003e, where I try my best to make it through old arcade games while tracking how much money in quarters I would have to spend to complete the game. There are lots of fun and interesting games from that era, where people were always experimenting with new kinds of gameplay, and I\u0027m excited to share them all with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve entered a stage of my life where I\u0027m creating more than ever, and it\u0027s all thanks to my patrons and supporters! Your help has gotten me where I am, and I\u0027m excited to keep trying new things and making new things to share!"
