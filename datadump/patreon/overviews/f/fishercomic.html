From 1992 to 2012, I wrote and drew more than six thousand \u201c\u003ca href=\"https://fishercomic.com\"\u003eFisher\u003c/a\u003e\u201d comic strips for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com\"\u003eThe Globe and Mail\u003c/a\u003e. The\u003cem\u003e Globe\u003c/em\u003e paid me for first-publication rights, but they gave me something more valuable: an audience, and a weekly deadline. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the deadline \u2014 and my determination to meet it over a thousand times in a row \u2014 brought the strips into being. The thought that it was being seen by hundreds of thousands of readers every day didn\u2019t hurt either.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhen the \u003cem\u003eGlobe\u003c/em\u003e dropped \u201cFisher\u201d in 2012, I lost my bearings for a while; the strip had been part of my weekly routine for so long that it felt like part of me. Many supportive emails let me know that others were affected too by the demise of the strip. From 2013 to 2015 I drew a few hundred more strips for my blog,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fishercomic.com/idiot-mittens/\"\u003eIdiot Mittens\u003c/a\u003e. But lacking the reach of Canada\u2019s national newspaper, the website felt more and more to me like a vanity project, and my interest waned. I wanted to reach an audience, but I didn\u2019t know if anyone was out there.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd that brings me to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of the folks at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.encyclomediaglobal.com\"\u003eEncycloMedia\u003c/a\u003e, I am relaunching fishercomic.com with a number of features that I hope will appeal to \u201cFisher\u201d fans old and new \u2014 including a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fishercomic.com/read-comics-online-free/\"\u003efree email subscription\u003c/a\u003e to the entire run of \u201cFisher\u201d, starting from day one. It\u2019s also my hope that, through Patreon, you will support me in bringing new life to the \u201cFisher\u201d strip. If Tom Fisher and company find an audience again, I would be happy to start writing and drawing new strips, and Patreon subscribers would see them first.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo please take a look at the reward levels and goals, and do\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fishercomic.com/read-comics-online-free/\"\u003esubscribe\u003c/a\u003e if you are moved to do so. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn any case, I hope you enjoy what is on offer at fishercomic.com.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePhilip Street\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
