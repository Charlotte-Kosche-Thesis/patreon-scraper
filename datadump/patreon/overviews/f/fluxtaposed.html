What began as just another gaming podcast, slowly became something more. Not merely a \"slice of life\" but what we have coined \"your weekly hang out\". \u00a0We are longtime friends that have always been inspired to create content together and frankly, this podcast was the first project that stuck. Pull up a seat at the bar and get an inside look at our friendship and the ridiculous\u00a0topics our conversations flow through. Look forward to a\u00a0weekly discussion on games, movies, and if you are truly lucky, the possibilities of genetic engineering\u00a0via a simple household dryer and a tube sock.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, the burning question, why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eContent should never be locked behind a paywall. We hate when that happens. This podcast will never be \"pay to play.\" By supporting Fluxtaposed on Patreon, you are ultimately helping us deliver to you, a better product. Fluxtaposed has always been a passion project and after three years of just providing a standard audio show, we wanted to do more. However, the demands of families and our own personal lives can be very limiting. Your support each month helps offset some of our production costs in order for the \u003cstrong\u003eDOCKET \u003c/strong\u003eto expand and grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCovering our costs for web hosting and other fees that make the podcast possible is our first goal. Once we meet that, we would love to start doing a live show, and so much more. Point blank, we want to grow Fluxtaposed, with you, the community right there with us. We hope you enjoy our content, think of this merely as a \"tip jar.\" Donate if you can, if you desire, and become a Patron if you like what we are doing. Join the movement and become a bigger part of the Fluxtacommunity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNone of this would be possible without YOU! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThank you so much for simply taking the time to explore our Patreon page. Regardless if you end up joining us on this journey as a patron of Fluxtaposed, we simply say thank you for your time and consideration.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
