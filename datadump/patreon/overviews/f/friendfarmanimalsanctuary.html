Registered charity number 1173318.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFRIEND is a grassroots vegan animal sanctuary in Kent, UK, we provide a forever home for the animals who find their way here and we currently have around 200 animal residents. Some are rescued from places of abuse, some arrive following the death of their guardian, some have been dumped outside. No matter how they get here, they are all welcome to live the rest of their lives as naturally as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe offer a no kill, free roaming (as far as possible and safe) home to cows, sheep, goats, chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, dogs, cats, and 40+ pigs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning an animal charity is expensive.\u00a0We are 100% volunteer based and depend solely on funding from our supporters. The animals need food, shelter, bedding, essential equipment, veterinary bills, transportation and more. With monthly donations we have a lot more financial security for the animals, they allow us to plan ahead and budget in a way that means we can provide for everyone\u0027s needs allowing us to offer our beloved animals the essential and optimum care\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeb:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.friendanimalrescue.org.uk/\"\u003ewww.friendanimalrescue.org.uk/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/friend.rescue.fanpage/\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/friend.rescue.fanpage/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInstagram:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/friendanimalrescue/\"\u003ewww.instagram.com/friendanimalrescue/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
