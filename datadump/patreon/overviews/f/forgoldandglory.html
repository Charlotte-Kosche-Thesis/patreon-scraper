    "summary": "I am Moses Wildermuth. \u00a0I write and edit old school role playing game material under the Open Game License from Wizards of the Coast. I publish my books under The Hawk Wolf Network. The Hawk Wolf Network is also intended to help other publishers who produce old school gaming materials.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started this path back in 2001 with the purchase to half the rights of the post apocalyptic game \"Mutazoids\". \u00a0With time and your support I may return to the \"Mutazoids\" Post Apocalyptic Genre and produce something that far exceeds my earlier efforts, but for now, it has taken a back seat to \"For Gold \u0026amp; Glory\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAround 2010, I was scouting for a product that was compatible with the second edition of the \"world\u0027s most popular role-playing game\". \u00a0I found \"For Gold \u0026amp; Glory\". \u00a0Little did I know at the time how big an impact this would have on the course of my life. \u00a0\"For Gold \u0026amp; Glory\" was in pre-production at that time and in need of an editor. \u00a0I stepped up and accepted the assignment. \u00a0It took a year and a half of my time and 3 proof readers to edit the material into the core rules you see now. The bestiary and artwork was added over the next 2 years by one of my proof readers, Dan Hyland. \u00a0Dan still maintains and occasionally updates the free version of this nearly 400 page rule book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have since written \"Pirates of the Fantasy Seas\" which was published in \"\u0026amp;\" magazine, published \"The Adventurers\u0027 Guide to the Practical Application of Herbalism \u0026amp; Alchemy\", and as of this writing am in the process of publishing \"Monsters from Mystical Lands Volume 1 - Humanoids \u0026amp; Undead\". \u00a0This year, I am also heavily involved with \"The Ice Kingdoms\" Campaign Setting. \u00a0I edited the yet unreleased \"Into The Mournwood\" Adventure module by James M. Ward and CS Barnhart and am working on \"The Ice Kingdoms\u0027 Bestiary\". \u00a0I also sold 3 post apocalyptic short stories to the \"77 Worlds Anthology\" by James M. Ward and Stephen Lee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust as things were going well for The Hawk Wolf Network, things took a dramatic swing for the worse. \u00a0I have been able to spend the last 5 or 6 years of my life working on \"For Gold \u0026amp; Glory\" due to government assistance. \u00a0As of September 2016, that assistance is gone. \u00a0This is where I really need the support of the community to continue my efforts to produce materials for what has been called the best old school clone ever, \"For Gold \u0026amp; Glory\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe small team I have assembled have big plans. \u00a0We want to complete the \"Monsters from Mystical Lands\" trilogy. \u00a0Volume 2 will detail extra-planar creatures and be a combination bestiary and compendium of the planes. \u00a0Volume 3 will detail hundreds of more mundane beasts, animals and vermin. \u00a0We also intend to break the nearly 400 page rule book back into 3 separate books, do a little more editing and re-illustrate it with professional artwork. \u00a0Plans also include \"The Book of Lost Spells\" which is actually about 2/3 written already. \u00a0It will bring to \"FG\u0026amp;G\" the spells that were dropped when switching from 1e to 2e. \u00a0We have many more projects to work on- books of skills, sub-classes (kits), specialty priests, etc. \u00a0Everything in the 2e catalog is fair game. \u00a0We also intend to create more campaign worlds and adventure modules as well as provide support for others creating \"FG\u0026amp;G\" materials. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout your monthly pledges, this project and all of its affiliated material will cease to exist. \u00a0I will be unable to keep the roof over my head, the lights turned on, and most importantly the internet connection open. \u00a0So please support second edition Old School Gaming with your monthly pledge of $5 or more."
