    "summary": "I believe that art in all its forms is essential to our personal growth and well being. I believe that we need to experience art in our lives in ways that reach out and bring us into the experience with the artist and help us sense our world more fully. I have been a writer and creator since I was a child. I gave up the dream of creating for a living when I was told I needed a \"respectable job\" to live. Everyone seemed so sure it was necessary and I believed them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the truth is I live to create and give back to my communities and the world. Creating on that intense level and giving back by volunteering when I can and managing my health is a full time loving vocation. I am a Lupus warrior who has other chronic illnesses but I let those strengthen my creativity these days and do not let it control my process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to invite you into my creative world to take the journeys with me and step outside your comfort zones to see the world in a free range way. Won\u0027t you join me out on the prairies of imagination?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Mags\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I\u0027m Mags, an Atlanta native who comes from a long line of strong southern folk. I am a hedonist who is tough as nails, yet tender as a magnolia blossom and shows both sides equally. I have a deep understanding of the fact that most often what others consider weakness is really the path of strength. I absolutely love to laugh, have fun, be silly and truly enjoy the simple things in life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy blog is devoted to my life  journey with posts often on OCD, PTSD, ADHD, addiction \u0026amp; recovery, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Hearing Impairment, PCOS, IBS as well as some other special guest conditions I have and treatment. Have no fear, it will be far from all doom \u0026amp; gloom health stuff! There will also be a lot of just general life, alternative lifestyle, furry kids and oddball stuff as well. Why? Because those things affect my whole life dearies!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStrengths:\u003c/strong\u003e Intelligent, loving, creative, laid back, intuitive, playful, compassionate, downright goofy at times, and honest with a strong sense of personal justice. Patient when you need it and not when you don\u0027t. I\u0027ve been told I am a good egg all around...or is that oval? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWeaknesses:\u003c/strong\u003e I can tend to over analyze things. My hedonistic nature can lead me down the path of indulging an entire day wandering out doors or napping with the furry kids when there is work to be done. I can sometimes be terrible at putting me first and showing myself the same compassion and patience I shows others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecial Skills:\u003c/strong\u003e I am excellent at weird and oddly creative solutions to both unusual and mundane problems. I am really open and I try to share my life experiences willingly...yes, even the tough stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWeapons:\u003c/strong\u003e I can use all of the following (and more) with great proficiency: large cast iron skillet, guns, knives, bo, bow \u0026amp; arrows, sai, my entire body; I prefers words and deeds to the need of any of the former. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeird facts:\u003c/strong\u003e My main life goal is to be a good person. I\u0027m an only child with 6 siblings, a wildly eclectic music addict, everyone eventually talks to me about their sex life. I adore  Heart \u0026amp; Brain (The Awkward Yeti). Sushi is the BEST but I hate cooked fish. I have a very dominant sense of space \u0026amp; what\u0027s \"mine\" (I\u0027ve threatened a spouse over a gardenia bush for heaven\u0027s sake!). I collects cheesy snow globes and love hands on projects.",
