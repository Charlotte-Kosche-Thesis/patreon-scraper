Reactions and reviews are the primary type of videos you\u0027ll find on my channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mainly started this to fund new equipment, not really to aim for the stars so to speak. I make reaction videos because I want to share my experience of watching of a show with others, not to get rich. If I do get enough support though, I\u0027ll use the funds to do this part-time or full-time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyways, thank you for visiting this page, because that means you are either supporting me or at least entertained the thought.
