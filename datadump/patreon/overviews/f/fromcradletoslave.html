    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eAbout this project\u003c/h3\u003eYou may have been hearing a lot more lately about Scientology. You may have even seen the HBO Documentary Going Clear. That movie, while brilliant and eye opening, didn\u0027t have enough time to tell all the stories. Especially the stories of the children who grew up in Scientology. Those of us who didn\u0027t choose Scientology of our own free will, but were born into it. \u003cbr\u003eI grew up as a Scientologist. I joined the Sea Organization when I was 18 years old. I left the church at 26. Some children joined when they were 8 years old. \u003cbr\u003eThis web series is going to tell our stories. What the conditions were like where we grew up. How old we were when we started working for the church, what our daily lives were like and how we got out of the church and much more.\u003cbr\u003eThe funding provided here will allow us to tell the complete story by giving us the means to travel to interview each Child Scientology Survivor, get the equipment necessary to film and produce each story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRisks and challenges\u003c/h3\u003eThis is a huge project. That is an understatement. Right now we have over a dozen people lined up to speak out and tell their stories. It is critical for us to get the funding so that we can dedicate ourselves full time to producing these stories.\u003cbr\u003eMy company is equipped for the post production end of this task. You saw a taste of what we can do in our Teaser Trailer. What we need now is ongoing support for filming and travel so we can get everyone\u0027s stories out there to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you can expect\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are SO many stories out there which people hold onto for years because of the mental state Scientology puts you in. \u00a0Many kids want to leave but can\u0027t. \u00a0Their parents are conned into believing that Scintology is the only hope for the survival of this planet and the universe and that their \"eternity\" is at stake. \u00a0Kids are brought up and heavily indoctrinated in Scientology beliefs that alienate them from any support outside of Scientology groups and members. \u00a0Leaving isn\u0027t a choice for these kids, yet, some survive and DO get out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will be telling their stories, funding or not. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunding provides us with the means to spend more time on this and do a more professional job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are hundreds of children who need to be heard. \u00a0Many are now adults. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn time, with enough support from people like you, it can be done full time, with a crew. \u00a0There are \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e many stories to tell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge of just a dollar per video will add up and help make these children\u0027s voices unstoppable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
