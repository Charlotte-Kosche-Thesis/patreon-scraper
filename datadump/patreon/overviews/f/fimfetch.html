Over the years, we\u0027ve lost countless fictions to the sands of time, but not all is lost! I have indexed and archived nearly 250,000 stories, including about 40,000 which have subsequently been deleted from where they were posted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project started in early 2015 with archiving the content that has been posted to Fimfiction.net, and has since expanded to include other online fan fiction sites, as well - but there are still more platforms out there that are not indexed, and still more ways that the web interface can be improved. The trouble is, developing for this is akin to a full-time job, and I can\u0027t always put off real-life responsibilities to work on this, especially when those other responsibilities help pay for food (and pony merch).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have considered putting advertisements on the site, but I personally despise seeing ads when I\u0027m not actually shopping, and I imagine you won\u0027t want to see random google or amazon ads while trying to read about the latest sizzling ship,\u00a0cutesy slice of life,\u00a0epic adventure, or any other fic you\u0027re into.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help and support, we can keep this ad-free and bustling with our favorite pastel technicolor equines!"
