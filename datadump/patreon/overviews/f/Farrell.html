    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eFirst off, thank you for visiting my page and don\u0027t mind the introduction video as I love to entertain people and provide as much content as possible. That was a very small example of how I entertain. I grew up in NY as a quiet boy and now I\u0027m the complete opposite. I always strive to make the most out of my life than just simply working and going home on a 9 to 5 routine. There\u0027s so much more to life than just that and I want to do the most I can to explore every opportunity I can to make the most of it and share it with the World. If you so happen to like what you see, I would most definitely appreciate you joining our community where we have fun socializing with each other and sharing other content to one another. I\u0027ve been doing this for nearly 2 years, trying to achieve what little funds I can get on the side. I play with a large community of people through Steam as much as I can. If you\u0027re a Streamer on Twitch, and want to make new friends, you\u0027re more than welcome to get connected on our Discord\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/0qkKz6A3B5wfVqGV\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cem\u003e I hope my life experience/content opens more doors for me to be involved in opportunities that allows me to freely express myself as a person. I also write stories and hope to one day get it published and turn it into something big to share for the world to see. I wrote this story a very long time ago and stopped just as I stopped drawing. But I feel that writing is more that I favor the most, so I decided to continue this story and revise the entire 500 page book. I will be sharing a bit of it here. I recently moved back with family. Mother, Sister and grandmother. My Grandmother is very ill and we honestly try to make the best we can for a better tomorrow. And even though things tend to go the wrong way, at the end of the day, I still have myself and the family that support what I do. I want to be a part of something that\u0027ll contribute to the world with more positivity and drift depression away. Even if it\u0027s just a little bit. Whatever world I create, whatever immersion, I hope to share the experience with the World and unite people that has been a survivor of Depression.\u003c/em\u003e"
