This is what I accomplish through the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Patreon Works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike\n a Kickstarter (where you donate a larger amount of money to one big \nproject), Patreon is ongoing.  It\u0027s easy to sign up.  You pick a \ndonation level- $1, $3, $10, etc, to be charged each time I upload a \nbrand new video.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re worried about affordability, it\u0027s very simple to set a monthly cap, so you never \nare charged more than your limit each month.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere The Money Goes\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work a full time job, and it\u0027s very tough to arrange guests, promote the show, produce and host the show all by myself. Pledges go towards software and equipment to get the show out there, paid ads for the show, and eventually for an assistant to help me with the tasks while I\u0027m at the day job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI highly doubt the show will ever be profitable, but I can dream and I am doing the show regardless.\u00a0 It\u0027s that important to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe rewards I\u0027ve set for pledging vary by pledge level, everything from physical \nitems (handwritten cards and letters) to exclusive online content FOR YOUR EYES \nONLY.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for your involvement, it truly means so much to me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
