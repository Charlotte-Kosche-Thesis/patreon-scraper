I plan to display and sell the work of other artists as well, but in the first instance any funds raised from patrons will go to support the making of La Chiva\u0027s \u0027talismanic\u0027 drawings and dolls; and to support their display and sale on the gallery website and in actual itinerant exhibitions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLa Chiva does not promote her work in any other way and has no other \nincome from her artwork (and very little from anything else), so any \npatronage you are willing to provide would be much appreciated. This is a DIY project with the ambition to provide a modest income and \nsome exposure for an artist who has an ambivalent relationship with \nself-promotion, but with a singular and ecstatic vision and a need to \ncreate. Fish Story Gallery is in essence the patron of the artist, La Chiva and we are asking you to be the patron of this young gallery venture.\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003edirector, Fish Story Gallery\u003cbr\u003edirector@fishstorygallery.com\u003cbr\u003e"

This surrealistic, mythological image can be interpreted\n as a sort of allegory. This work of art is not necessarily \nrepresentative of the type of art Fish Story Gallery offers, but in a \nsense, this image is itself, our story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you painted this \npicture or know who did, or if you have any other queries about the \ngallery, I would be delighted to hear from you.
