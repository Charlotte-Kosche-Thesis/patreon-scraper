Players will be able to create up to three free accounts, each with a different Pride of prehistoric big cats: the Giant Cheetah, the Cave Lion, and, of course, the Smilodon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Feranix, it is your duty to lead your Pride in battle against other Prides, Neanderthals, Dire Wolves, and a hundred other prehistoric threats to compete for territory and resources. The game will mix realistic features like a complex Genetics system, Breeding, Territory Maintenance, and Competitive Hunting, with fantasy elements like Primordial Deities and a vast array of pelt options (ranging from black to bright blue).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/383073303138402307/439180155534180373/splotch.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe owners, Chelsea and Caitlin, have decades of experience in staffing various games between the two of them. Feranix\u0027s head artist, Miss Hades, has loaned her art and experience to several SIM sites. Our other artists - Heda RedBox, Nameria, Stormblood, Kaen, Lex, Alex, Akelia, NeptuneNebula and Typhon - all have years of experience under their belts and each of them have the experience to help with all aspects of a SIM game!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeranix\u0027s exceptional development team is working hard every day to make our vision into a reality, and to include all of you in its realization, but we need your help to do it. Your support means the world to us and on top of in-game rewards, we\u0027re offering you a chance to get in on the ground floor of development and influence the direction the game takes as a whole. Patreon backers will have access to a special development feed on our Patreon page, a Discord server for suggestions and updates, and an array of polls to see what the community wants as a whole.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to make one final promise for everyone who might be interested in Feranix, even if you can\u0027t afford to back us financially. We will always be responsive, transparent, and open to suggestions. We are here to provide a service to our community. We won\u0027t always have the right answer, but we won\u0027t be afraid to ask our community what they think and what they want. We want you to love Feranix as much as we do, and we\u0027re prepared to do whatever it takes to earn that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/343978500405067776/426593754531758092/unknown.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee you on the tundra.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
