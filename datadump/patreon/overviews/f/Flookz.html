    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003eWho are you?\u003c/h4\u003e\nMy name\u0027s Harrison, but \u0027round the net I mostly go by Flookz. I\u0027m a multi-faceted artist who is passionate about Video Games. I love character design, animation, drawing, painting, comics, 3D modeling, and even game programming! You could say I spread myself a little thin, but nothing inspires me more then a challenge and the potential of learning something new.\n\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd yes, I also like to draw gay animal people.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhy do you need a Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003e\nI\u0027d like to be entirely transparent and up front with you, reality is that I\u0027m heavily financially burdened, and the future looks bleak in terms of my freedom as a creative. In order to focus on what I love to do, I\u0027m going to need some help digging myself out of this financial trench and staying afloat. More money means more time I can dedicate to my art and the communities that support me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m hoping Patreon can bring those who care about me and my work closer. I\u0027d like to provide insight into my process and create a dialogue in which my patrons can share their opinions and requests.\nWith an ultimate goal of affording the freedom to subsist off my art full time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSo, what will I get?\u003c/h4\u003eEarly access art, previews and roughs, streams, maybe even really rare things like game demos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve thoroughly outlined below what you will get access to depending on how much you give! \n\u003cem\u003eYou will not secure your reward until your payment actually goes through\u00a0at the start of the month.\u003c/em\u003e So you won\u0027t receive anything for pledging until the 1st of the following month after you pledge, which is when I\u0027ll announce who will be receiving paintings/sketches that month. ( This might change if Patreon fixes/updates their payment process. )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is safe, easy, and best of all, low commitment. You can adjust your patron level at any time, and if for any reason\u00a0you find yourself unsatisfied or disinterested with my output, feel free to bail. I pursue a wide variety of creative goals, and I can\u0027t guarantee that I\u0027ll always be producing content that interests you. If you\u0027re feeling neglected, lower your patronage and feel free to check back some other time.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
