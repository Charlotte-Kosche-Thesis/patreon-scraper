     "about": "\u003cdiv\u003eForget Me Not Animal Sanctuary of Las Vegas was founded in January of 2016. We are a 501(c)(3) organization with the heartfelt mission of providing an environment of love, care and compassion to the less fortunate animals in our city. We received our non-profit public charity status in March of 2016. Our focus is be placed on animals that are homeless, those with special needs and those that are on death row in our shelters. They are all desperate for resources, our efforts to provide a better quality of life and, most importantly, our compassion in order to receive the love that they deserve. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a true non-profit organization with a strict no-kill policy. While we focus on rescuing those that have been abandoned we pledge to also put efforts into reducing the number of euthanized animals due to overpopulation by actively participating in the spaying and neutering of strays and rescues. We have performed rescue missions with dogs in need over seas and are continuing to put our time into animals in need in other countries. We are heavily foster based as of right now but have been incredibly grateful, and humbled, by the amount of community support we\u2019ve seen since we\u0027ve begun this journey.. but we are ready to take the next step with our organization and would love the committed support from our community.\u00a0We are looking to venture into the next step of our organization - purchasing our property. This property will give us the spaces, and the biggest resource that we are currently missing, in order to help additional rescue animals.. including rescue farm animals. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only are we raising funds and looking for supporters for our property fundraising needs but we are also looking for committed and compassionate people to support our animal rescue efforts every single month. Anything and everything helps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe look forward to saving more lives together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
