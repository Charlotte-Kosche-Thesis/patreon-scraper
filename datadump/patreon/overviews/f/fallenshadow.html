I\u0027m a voice actress and a writer and YouTube is currently my sorta part time job!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why do I have this?\u00a0I see Patreon as a tip jar of sorts. My content will always be free and I will never charge for extras (NSFW or otherwise). I will however offer voice commissions here if you provide me with a script and tell me the specifics of what you want. Please bear in mind that I can deny any script I don\u0027t deem fit for any reason whatsoever!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI barely make any money off of YouTube (you may or may not know just how damn awful adsense earnings are right now) so Patreon is what I\u0027ve turned to so that anyone who wants to support the channel can. Anything I make here will be spent on one of two things; saving up towards upgrading equipment to improve the quality of my channel or paying bills and buying food so that I can stay alive and shiz.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo yeah, thanks for your time. I got scripts to record 8)\u003cbr\u003e"
