Whether to upload all of the content at once for the page to look great straight-away, or do it bit by bit? But who\u0027s gonna like it if it looks ugly at the beginning? And what if nobody wants to look at what I do? And what should I give to those who actually do want to look at what I do? And what if I promise to give something and then I get hit by a car and the person never receives my promise?\u003cbr\u003eAnd eventually I decided \u0027ta hell with those questions\u0027, if I keep thinking like that I will never do anything. So I\u0027ll try. And if I fail...oh well, I\u0027ll go backpacking.\u003cbr\u003eAnd so, pardon me if I am not as cool, social, or giving as the other creators here. I\u0027ll get there, I\u0027m still learning.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do?\u003c/strong\u003e For now mostly 2D animation, and mostly somehow related to environment (because I\u0027m a bit of a green person). But I just ordered a sound recorder and whoop whoop, will do some video with good sound stuff!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Plan.\u003c/strong\u003e Since I am a full-time corporation worker, workaholic by nature (plus i have friends, and friends have birthdays, weddings, babies), I rarely have time to create, this is why there won\u0027t be many videos here at the beginning, but I intend to change it someday. Deciding to have this page was step one. Now if I have people believing in me and expecting me to continue creating, I will feel more motivated. So hopefully one beautiful day I will be able to earn from this enough to travel and create from any place in the world! more time to create=more skills=more creations=more travel=more inspiration=yeeeeeey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou. \u003c/strong\u003eYou can help me execute The Plan. I don\u0027t expect you to do that, but if you actually liked what I do and chose to support me, I am infinitely grateful! Once I think of any other ways to say thank you, I will post them for sure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
