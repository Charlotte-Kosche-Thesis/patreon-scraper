Thank you so much for being part of it guys, it really means the world to me. You\u00a0\ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4f\u00a0\ud83e\udd19 \u270c\ufe0f !!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is \n\u003cstrong\u003eAlex\u003c/strong\u003e and I make Food videos on YouTube to help \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e become a smarter cook. \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e helps me achieving sustainable income. That, you probably know already, but it\u0027s only the tip of the iceberg...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA few years ago, I was running a small online advertising and social media\nagency here in Paris FR, and was \u2018quite\u2019 satisfied with it. \u2018Quite\u2019 is not a word I like using. I needed to be closer to what I love and to whom I am : I love \n\u003cstrong\u003eFood\u003c/strong\u003e + I am a \u003cstrong\u003eMaker\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n[Deep breath]\u00a0I decided to quit.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI told my girlfriend everything would be fine, we moved into a cheaper, smaller and darker place,\nand I started my own YouTube channel, called \u2018French Guy Cooking\u2019. My aim was\nto offer a fresh and funny perspective on food. I had no idea where I\nwas going but I knew, deep down, that I was in the right spot. Don\u2019t get me\nwrong: it was hard, uncertain and terrifying. Yet, looking back a few years\nlater, I couldn\u2019t have been more right.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nToday, 200+ videos later, it still is a massive challenge to make it work but there\u0027s a difference. \n\u003cstrong\u003eI have YOU now\u003c/strong\u003e. I have genuine people following me from all around the globe, open-minded friends in every country sharing their beautiful cultures, supportive fellows commenting each and every of my videos, real humans sending me messages and pictures of dishes they have made thanks to my videos. F*! I have YOU. I love YOU. #gettingemotional\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMoney : Let\u0027s get down to it. In order to make this whole adventure viable, and so to be able to continue in the most sustainable and durable way, I need to make a living from it. I do work with brands from time to time, but it\u0027s very unlikely for me to convince them to sponsor my next \"DIY-dry-aging-beef-in-a-small-fridge-with-silicate-gels-and-usb-fans\" video. It\u0027s a shame because I believe those contents are the most precious ones. Those are a gold bars in terms of inspiration and perspective. I want to make \n\u003cstrong\u003emore geeky series about everything\u003c/strong\u003e in the kitchen : cheap sous-vide, sourdough bread, underestimated rice, ultimate tea brewing, DIY wine making...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt took me some time to understand it, but this whole journey is not only about me any more,\u00a0\n\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s about us\u003c/strong\u003e. And, as much as I need you guys out there supporting it and spreading the love (like butter), I also need people with me here working, writing and editing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am a fool, I have always been. But I have faith. I know we can make it work, together.\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThank you,\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eAlex\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
