Until I start living that particular dream however, I\u0027ll continue to upload one new gaming video every day to my YouTube channel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy content is for everyone, I cover all sorts of games.  Mostly though I tend to play games that are simple to pick up, but can get incredibly complex the more you advance.  I love playing them, and helping people to understand particularly difficult techniques, layouts and set ups is always very rewarding for me personally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am very aware that there are very often young eyes and ears when YouTube videos are being watched.  It\u0027s a personal guarantee from myself that there will never be any content on my videos that isn\u0027t suitable for the whole family.  If I wouldn\u0027t want my own children to see or hear something, I won\u0027t publish it.  That being said, we\u0027re still talking about computer games, so I would ask any parents to make sure the games I cover come under the bracket of what YOU consider acceptable for your children.  Internet safety is always important and you should never just take a strangers word on the matter!",
