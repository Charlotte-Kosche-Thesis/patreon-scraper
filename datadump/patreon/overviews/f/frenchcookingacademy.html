I would be honoured if you would consider becoming an active member of our community and make a contribution to my ambitious campaign and video channel. I plan to build a repository of recipes and knowledge for French cuisine enthusiasts, serving as an indispensable tool for any aspiring home chef or cooking enthusiast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLearning to cook French food is one of the most rewarding\npursuits\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s fair to say French cooking has a reputation for being complex and a little out of reach. Many people think they don\u2019t have the time, the equipment or the patience to learn French cooking. It doesn\u0027t help that many of the best French Chefs also don\u0027t speak English . I want to show people that French cooking is not just delicious but also fun and rewarding.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt may surprise you but\u00a0yes, I am a French cook and I speak english:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI think there are many treasures to be found in the study of\nFrench cuisine and being able to communicate French recipes in English with my audience fills a gap out there.\u00a0 I\u2019ve dedicated\nconsiderable time to learning the intricacies of this too-often neglected\nsubject and have invested an equal amount of time and dedication to recording\nmy journey.  Even now, I realize there\nare still many things to learn and I have barely scratched the surface.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI want to share my cooking skills and and continuing journey to conquer this cuisine with my viewers.  I want to dive deep into the\nsubject and find all the little gems of knowledge that more superficial curricula overlook. I want to inspire in my viewers a passion for what I think is still one of the greatest cuisines on earth. And, as an added bonus I will reward my audience with a variety of unique and regional dishes\nthat you are unlikely to find elsewhere on YouTube or the web.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Hard Mile:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my passion and I\u0027m in for the long haul. I am committed to not only creating high quality content but inspiring an interactive space for viewers to provide suggestions, ideas and their own knowledge about French cooking. One day I might\neven get to take the camera out on location in France to showcase regional delicacies.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport the French Cooking Academy by becoming a Patron today.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
