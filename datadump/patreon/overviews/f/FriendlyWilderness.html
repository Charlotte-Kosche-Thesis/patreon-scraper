Somehow, this seems to be a little more difficult than they originally thought.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027ve been working on this comic for a little over a year, illustrating it myself and writing it collaboratively with several friends. However, managing two updates a week can be a little difficult, considering that it\u0027s being done around a full-time job. My ultimate goal with this campaign is to eventually have the freedom to make this comic into a career that I can work on full-time. In the meantime, all support from this campaign will go back into the comic itself, whether it\u0027s towards a new site and better equipment, or towards making print copies and attending cons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for what you, as a patron, will be getting for lending me your support, everyone who pledges will be given all updates at their full resolution, as well as any related art pieces, sketches, worldbuilding, or any related rambling, all available to you before they\u0027re posted to the public. In addition, all patrons will be given access to art streams while I work on comics or related pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, and I hope you get some enjoyment out of my comic, whether you decide to pledge or not!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
