    "summary": "\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat Is Firearm Rack\u0027s Mission?\u003c/h2\u003eFirearm Rack was created because there was a distinct lack of real-world reviews that take into account how a product performs over a much longer time period than you would find in your average online review. By subjecting firearms to the round counts that they might experience when owned by the average gun owner (625 rounds per year according to the NSSF) for approximately 8 to 10 years of use, we feel that we will be able to provide valuable insight into what part failures that an owner might run into over their ownership of a particular firearm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHow Are We Going To Stay Uninfluenced?\u00a0\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003e This is where you guys come in.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy keeping the channel funded through a combination\u00a0of viewers and selected partner companies that believe in our mission and not paid reviews we take the power away from the corporations that are driven to ensure that their product gets a favorable review and the YouTube video display bot that seems to enjoy hiding firearms related videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t create content for companies, we create unfiltered content for the consumers that spend their hard earned dollars on firearms and accessories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhere is your money going to go?\u003c/h2\u003eContrary to popular belief, making quality videos that people enjoy watching is extremely\u00a0costly. Since I have refused to monetize the channel with YouTube ads, we will be relying on viewers that believe that we are providing something of value to them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Ammunition - \u003c/strong\u003eAs you might expect, ammunition is going to be the largest expense on the channel. With the high round counts that we prefer to subject both firearms and accessories to we anticipate an ammunition expense of $1,200 or more monthly.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Purchasing Firearms - \u003c/strong\u003eIn order to remove the manufacturer influence, most guns and accessories will be personally owned and not loaned to the channel for testing. The only exception to this rule will be hard to find items or items that are not on the general market yet or if we flat can\u0027t afford to buy the product.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Maintaining Audio \u0026amp; Video Gear - \u003c/strong\u003eEquipment breaks, batteries need to be replaced and there will be a need to\u00a0upgrade equipment as we go on. Currently\u00a0we are making due with less than ideal equipment and will be slowly upgrading it.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Targets - \u003c/strong\u003eTargets are surprisingly\u00a0expensive! Cardboard targets are anywhere between .60 per target on up to over a dollar per target! Paint for steel targets, replacement steel and brackets for targets will also be needed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Training \u0026amp; Match Fees -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Since we are a skill building focused\u00a0channel that also performs high round count testing of guns and accessories we will be taking as many classes as we can afford. On top of the classes, we also plan on attending as many matches as we possibly can to test things in a real-world environment.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
