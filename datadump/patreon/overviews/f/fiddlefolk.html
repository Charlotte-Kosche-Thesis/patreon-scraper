The site will feature videos that can be searched by title, theme, type, author/artist, and region. The videos will have a slow and natural speed version played by an artist that we interview. The slow version enables learners to more easily pick up the song and the natural speed will show the intended rhythm. My daughter, Eme, and I have been involved in a small group of traditional fiddle players called Fiddle Heads. Please find out more about this incredible program here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youngtraditionvermont.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://youngtraditionvermont.org/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eEmerson is leading the charge; communicating with the artists and curating any video submissions(if we get to that point). Ideally, contributions would enable us to travel to locations to record regional music played by artists with quality and frequency.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is simple: to share the joy of traditional music and to preserve music that is largely transferred from teacher to learner on a one to one basis with no written notes.\u003cbr\u003e"
