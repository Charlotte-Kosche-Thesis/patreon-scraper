I\u0027ve reset the Patreon to not do this again, but it would be better to also cancel your pledge to be on the safe side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m sorry - I was trying to set up something for the future, but didn\u0027t realize it would think I wanted to charge you now!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKaren (red-faced)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re the PDX Free Store! We hold monthly free stores in Portland, Oregon - a free store is like a big multi-family rummage sale, only without the prices. Everything is free! Everybody is welcome! Anyone can bring things, and anyone can take home as much as they want. We accept and give away clothes, shoes, books, CDs, DVDs, plants, food, dishes, silverware, costumes, sports equipment, cooking pots, toys, baby stuff, chairs, and whatever else comes our way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow we\u0027d like to take it to the next level. Many of you have asked why we don\u0027t have a permanent location. We agree, a permanent location would be great! We could be open every day! We could make sure to have clothes and shoes in everybody\u0027s size!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now we have a great opportunity to take over the old Black Rose free store on NE Mississippi Ave! Portland Collective Housing owns the store, and they\u0027re interested in renting it to us for $1200 a month if we can raise the money.\u003cbr\u003eSo let\u0027s raise it! We\u0027re asking for $10 subscriptions each from 150 people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve got enough privilege to have $10 to spare every month - two cups of coffee? a burger for lunch? - please remember that there are many people in Portland who don\u0027t have it, and use your privilege to support your community - and to be able to shop for free clothes, books, CDs, and everything else you need whenever you want to!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
