    "summary": "Hey I\u0027m Fatal and I am a fountain of creative inspiration, in which art and writing are my outlets.\u00a0 While I have many projects on the go, all in the realm of action-based scifi and/or fantasy, the one I\u0027m focusing on at the moment is Defenders of Earth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Defenders of Earth?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Here\u0027s a quick synopsis: thirteen years after the shut down of the Society and its team of superheroes, the Defenders of Earth, the former leader, Fergus Demir, is contacted by his old boss.\u00a0 He\u0027s asked to come out of his forced retirement in order to collect and train the second generation of teenage heroes.\u00a0 The catch is that the Beta Generation are at risk as a rival organization known as Magics also tries to collect them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been working on Defenders of Earth for nearly five years now and I\u0027ve finally settled on a storyline that I think is best for it.\u00a0 While I do have the previous draft of this story published on Wattpad under @FatalBlow and you\u0027re free to read it in its entirety (as well as part of the second book), I should warn you that the final draft of this story varies greatly from that one\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd what exactly am I planning to do with this story?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Well, I\u0027ll be frank, comics are not my thing, though not for a lack of trying.\u00a0 Plus, I\u0027m too attached to my prose to give it up and do a comic.\u00a0 So instead I\u0027ve combined my talents in a different way and decided to do illustrations with the writing, and once I\u0027m done the final draft of the first book, I\u0027ll be posting it on Wattpad and Tumblr.\u00a0 My current, highly ambitious, plan is to do one illustration per page in the document.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what am I offering?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Well, as I said, I plan to post these updates to Wattpad and Tumblr, but until the first book is done and edited, I\u0027ll be working on character designs and studies.\u00a0 If you support me, you\u0027ll get access to my design process and studies, as well as references, notes, and excerpts depending on what tier you choose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat brings me to my future plans.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Once the first book is done and I start into the illustrations, I\u0027ll edit the tiers for early access to updates before I post them publicly, and exclusive access to WIPs of illustrations.\u00a0 For now, though, I\u0027m offering character studies, sketches, refs, notes, and excerpts as I prepare to start posting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate goal is to be able to support myself through Patreon!\u00a0 If I make enough money through Patreon, I can quit my job and dedicate my life to my personal projects, which means more cool stuff for you guys.\u00a0 For now, though, I\u0027m just starting out, so I ask you to be patient with me as I figure out what works and what doesn\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, I hope you decide to support me on this journey!\u003cbr\u003e"
