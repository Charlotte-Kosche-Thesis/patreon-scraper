I like doing these videos, but I\u0027d like to step up my game and do a ton more with it, like branching out a bit and having a more consistent and rapid update schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I don\u0027t really have the money or time right now to do some of the improvements and projects I would like to do, that\u0027s where you fine FutureFans\u00a9\u00a0come in! Each video takes me roughly 6-to-8 hours and while they\u0027re fun to make, they are a considerable time investment that I don\u0027t have too much free time to make them consistently and also approach other projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, the ultimate goal here is to do this primo ass shit as much as possible and create Higher Quality Content\u2122, and any donations from you fine folks would be appreciated."
