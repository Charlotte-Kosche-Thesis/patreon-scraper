    "summary": "Hey there! Thanks for stopping by to investigate growing with us. Your partnership promotes a united group of all writers and writing organizations in the St. Louis metro area and surrounding areas, regardless of experience or affiliation. We\u0027re so glad you\u0027re here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFLOW, St. Louis\u2019 new literary arts center, couldn\u2019t be more excited to engage the creative energy hopping in our city. We\u0027re off to a fantastic start with support from the Arts \u0026amp; Education Council of St. Louis, and we\u0027re ecstatic to share our space, knowledge, and resources with writers. We\u2019re doing that through building strong communities by fostering meaningful writing and storytelling experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat kind of experiences? We\u0027re so glad you asked! At present, we are piloting the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eLiterary/art organization support services and collaboration\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOpen studio writing days\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreative Pro Learning Sessions\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWriting Collectives\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreative Community Networking Events\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWriting Coaching and Consulting\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re proud to say that the people developing these programs are highly-credentialed educators, scholars, community builders, and business folks who know more than a few things about social enterprise. At present, all are volunteering our time to pilot FLOW\u0027s programs and initiatives. However, we do pay our program facilitators and writers who work at ticketed events. These stellar working writers and facilitators receive a rate that puts them on par with other business professionals for their level of expertise. Yes, it is possible! We hold this as central to our mission. This also means that we are looking for ways to keep our overhead costs to a minimum. Lower overhead means we can keep paying writers and facilitators their best market rate while keeping our programs at a manageable rate for participants and providing free services to the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why would you want to partner with us to provide a unified organization serving the writing community? Let\u0027s talk structure for a moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a social enterprise - an organization that champions social mission over profit. We have opted to not engage with the community as a 501(c)3 nonprofit for two specific reasons (among others):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eOur mission is to be of service to the writing community and literary organizations. Most of these organizations are historically 501(c)3 outfits. We are not helping those organizations if we jump in the already-crowded grant funding pool. Our LLC status as a for-profit allows us to arrange other partnerships and funding sources that add to instead of take away from literary groups and other nonprofit organizations.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe cost of running necessary systems and processes required of nonprofits would place another heavy expense item onto each event we create or sponsor. When we ran the cost-benefit analysis of nonprofit status against the giving trends among most folks, we found the nonprofit organizational overhead to be a financial disadvantage that eventually would affect our event cost for participants and actually restrict the free programs we can reasonably offer.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe didn\u0027t like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where our Patreon community comes in. As a Patreon partner, you are a vital part of the FLOW family and active supporter of literary arts for all in St. Louis. You secure the snazzy resources for everyone (your colleagues) at our events - things like coffee, snacks, printed materials, wifi, and so on. This allows us to spend our intake funds on creating engaging programming and representation for all writers at large while keeping our overhead low. In other words, you create the cultural capital pizzazz that is part of FLOW, Where Writing Moves and make it accessible to all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe look forward to building a more connected, supported, united writing community with you. We\u0027re excited to see what a committed group of writers can build!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGratitude always,\u003cbr\u003eThe FLOW Team\u003cbr\u003e"
