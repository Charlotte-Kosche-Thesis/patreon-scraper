I also prefer drawing original characters rather than doing the scene\u0027s \"usual\" pornofication of popular mass IP characters. That doesn\u0027t mean I won\u0027t tip my toes in drawing fanart of mass IP\u0027s, but I much more prefer drawing originals, randoms or other artist\u0027s characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I am still and forever learning, developing \u0026amp; changing, I like to experiment and try out new things time to time. This means that my content might vary drastically from drawing to drawing; e.g. from hypersized grotesque pussies to SFW headbusts. Don\u0027t worry though, I still have a big place in my heart towards ladies with weighty busts which you can clearly see from my Velika.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI try my best while putting my heart to it.

As a first step towards that direction I\u0027ve decided to launch Patreon as a \"test\" to see where I stand as an artist \u0026amp; if I can make money while doing the thing I love; art. Patreon is a great option for me to continue doing art while staying true to myself and to my ideas. Depending on the amount of your support, you can open up more ways for me to expand myself as an artist \u0026amp; to bring you even more erotic and dark themed content what the name F-Ero represents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of my fans have also requested and asked more ways to support me in monetary ways, so launching a Patreon seemed a great idea for that purpose too. \u2764\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf my Patreon doesn\u0027t work out in the longer run, don\u0027t worry, it doesn\u0027t stop me from creating art. Whatever happens, I will continue creating and providing content even if it was harder for me to do\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e The amount of support I get from you at Patreon just opens up more chances for me to expand and create even more art.
