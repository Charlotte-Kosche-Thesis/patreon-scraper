    "summary": "Hello everyone. We are a family of Artist that love to build costumes and now we really want to do some amazing Family Cosplays. We take our son Leonidas to 99 percent of the Con\u0027s we attened and he is really wanting to participate more and more he is 4 yrs old. So soon you will see some killer work from 3 of us from Star Wars, World of Warcraft, Dragon Ball Z and many more. \u00a0We really want to use this as a tool for teaching our son certain lessons in life and we think he will benefit from this experience. As you know Cosplaying can be very expensive with all the materials we use to push our cosplays over the edge, the traveling, the tickets, food and hotels. Here with your help we can share with you our work in progress to the final awesomeness. We will send Prints out and some cool swag. Come meet us and hangout with us at the con\u0027s anytime. Kitty is an incredible natural artist and so is KalaDroid both are very creative and like to do things a lil different from the norm. We wanna do some \u00a0BiG Type costumes to turn some heads and blow some minds. Also we will be shooting fun choreography light saber battle videos. One of our goals is to own and run a Saber Academy some day. KalaDroid has an extensive Martial Arts background and is a sword enthusiast. Check out our post to learn more about us and what we are up to. Thanks for stopping in and checking us out. Love Kitty ,KalaDroid and Leonidas"
