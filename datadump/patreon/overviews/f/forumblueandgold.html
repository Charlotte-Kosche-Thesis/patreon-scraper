    "summary": "Forum Blue \u0026amp; Gold was founded under the premise that there should be a place where Lakers fans could go to interact with other fans of the team and get analysis of what is actually happening on the court. The Lakers have long been a team that inspires #hottakes or a media scrutiny based on off-court drama, but we have always tried to steer clear of that in favor of talking actual basketball. We always wanted to provide the best coverage we could, win or lose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd for over a decade, we have done just that -- writing on, talking about, and analyzing the team day in and day out. But running a website takes time. It also takes resources. As a husband and father with a full time job, both are in a limited supply -- particularly when it comes to running the site I love. This is where you can come in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy the site and would consider pledging to help fund it, it would be greatly appreciated. We would love to be able to improve the site in a variety of ways, from adding contributors to redesigning the look to forging new partnerships with other people we believe can add to the site. These are the types of things financial contributions would assist with. Even if you don\u0027t pledge, thank you for your continued support of the site. We couldn\u0027t have made it this far without you.\u003cbr\u003e"
