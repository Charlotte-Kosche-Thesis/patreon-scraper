    "summary": "My name is Amanda and this is my page for the series Alternate Humanity, which is uploaded for free on WebToons every Monday. It is a crowd driven, choose-your-own-adventure, fantasy, action, romance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/alternate-humanity/list?title_no=61767\"\u003eAlternate Humanity on Webtoons\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhile I am on patreon, my intention is to provide a fun, engaging and FREE comic for everyone. Voting on a choice and reading the comic is totally free. I am simply using the platform of patreon so the framework is there for anyone who feels like throwing money my way...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an almost 30 year old mom living in Massachusetts, working at a center that provides activities to students with disabilities. I have been drawing for a long time but I am super critical of myself and often embarrassed to share my work. I hope to keep making improvements! I did also run a comic called Godot for a year or so towards the end of college.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this comic work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe world is a scary place and our\nheroes need help navigating it or they might not survive. Every 1-3\nepisodes or so there will be a choice these heroes need to make. Some\ndecisions are as mundane as as what they are eating for dinner, while\nothers could be as complicated as who lives and who dies. To help you\nout a little, choices with large ramifications will be red, while\nstandard choices will be white. Just like real life, all choices do\nhave consequences even if we don\u0027t see them right away. Keep your\neyes peeled for clues that can help with your decision. It\u0027s also\nkind of a game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo how do we win then?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEveryone reading will get a chance to\nvote on what they think is the best choice. That means you may need\nto do some discussing and convincing. The plan is to eventually do 7\ndifferent stories, each focusing on one of the races in the world.\nEach story will have one objective to be completed in order to move\nthe world towards peace. The overall ending is largely determined by\nhow many stories you manage to complete the objectives for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you vote?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may vote here or in the comments section for this comic on Webtoons. For patrons pledging $1 or more you also get access\nto a special poll where every vote counts as double.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhen do I upload?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI update on Mondays. When a poll is\ngoing however, I write up scripts for the 2-3 outcomes that you are\nvoting on. The poll then closes on the following Sunday at midnight\nand I get to work drawing. I will post the outcome that Monday, but\nexpect the actual episode the following Monday. Uploads only happen on Webtoons."
