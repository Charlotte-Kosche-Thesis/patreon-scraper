The content is 100% uncompromised, payment is more predictable, and creators don\u0027t need to stoop to clickbait content or other shady practices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon means that creators serve their viewers, not advertisers or corporate sponsors.

I also use the money to purchase equipment, software, 3D prints and stuff like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll Patrons\u00a0get to see early access screenshots and images of my work before anyone else has a chance to see it.
