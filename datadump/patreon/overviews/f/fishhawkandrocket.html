    "summary": "Billy and Tugboat Sallyforth is the dream child of Johnny Rocket Ibanez and Jimmy Fishhawk. The origin story is that Billy started showing up in Johnny\u0027s sketchbooks, and gradually more and more of his world did too. So Johnny shared these images and ideas with Jimmy, who took them and ran a verbal marathon with them. Sooner than later he had a whole backstory cooked up, and Billy\u0027s world started to come together. We decided that there could be little better than to spend our lives cooking up more adventures in this, frankly, really cool world that kept showing more of itself through Johnny\u0027s art and Jimmy\u0027s writing. Robots, pirates, floating cities...so Jimmy came up with about 20 titles and several sets of plot notes for a potential series of books, and off they went.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Right now we\u0027re in the process of creating the first book. The writing is in beta reading stage, and Johnny\u0027s putting together the illustrations. Visually, the book is a hybrid of comic/sequential art and more traditional page-sized illustrations. To support this, we\u0027re putting together an art show with pieces from the book, and eventually a website for the whole endeavor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Creators:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Johnny Rocket is an illustrator, designer and painter who focuses on the convergence of different mediums to translate pen and ink illustration. Having been primarily a performing poet for 16+ years, Johnny comes to visual art as a poet and concentrates on visual metaphors and all of the ways one can convey them. Jimmy Fishhawk is a writer and poet out of Gainesville, Fl. He is currently working on these and other books and stories for children, a couple of novels and novellas for grownups, and an ongoing parade of poems that may or may not ever find their way to publication. Jimmy grew up drawing constantly, taking art lessons from cool little old ladies, and taking every art class he could in school, including AP art in high school, and drawing, design and photography courses in college.\u00a0 He comes to the process of creative writing with a visual artist\u0027s eye for imagery and evocative detail.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We have, like so many people, day jobs. So, much like many creators here, it\u0027s hard to eke out time to work on personal projects and creative endeavors such as this book. So we\u0027re starting this patreon in hopes of being able to spend more and more time creating this work for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
