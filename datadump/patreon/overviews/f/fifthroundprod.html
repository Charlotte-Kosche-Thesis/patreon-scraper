    "summary": "Hey Internet!\u003cbr\u003eThis is Tanya, AKA Supersaiyan Magical Girl; You may know me from my instagram page, where I take training photos of world-class athletes like Vitor Belfort, Garry Tonon, and Georges St-Pierre\u2026.and proceed to make fun of them on the internet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for coming to my Patreon page! I just wanted to take a second to show you how it works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a great way for you to support creative folks like me, and get rewarded with interactions, giveaways and awesome perks! By signing up and contributing even just one dollar a month, you help me cover the costs of photography equipment, editing programs, and the money I invest in traveling to other gyms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u2019s different tiers for fighters and folks who want me to take their photos too; from as little as 3$ a month, you can get access to my photo directory and use those for anything you\u2019d like; posters, social media, you name it. I take photos nearly every night, and I have them ready usually in the same evening; you won\u2019t get much faster service than that! It\u2019s a perfect solution for anyone, from  an amateur to a pro fighter, because in the fight game, the biggest following and loudest voices gets you those money fights; having high-quality content gives you that extra edge over the others."
