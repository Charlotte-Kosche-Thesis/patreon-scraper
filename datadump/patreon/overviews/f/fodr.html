    "summary": "Mindfulness is a hot topic right now (and rightfully so!).  We live in a world where billions upon billions of dollars are spent for our attention.  We also live in a world where a common advertising tactic is to tell us that we\u2019re not complete, whole, content, or enough.  None of us will neurologically achieve joy if we live in a place of \u2018incomplete\u2019 or \u2018never enough.\u2019  In this world, mindfulness is one of our greatest tools toward wellbeing. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMEDITATIONS ENGAGING MINDFULNESS (LIKE GRATITUDE) OPEN DOORS FOR US TO COMBAT THE LIES THAT WE ARE INUNDATED WITH MINUTE-BY-MINUTE.  THESE PRACTICES CAN THEN CREATE A PATHWAY TOWARD JOY, HAPPINESS, AND CONTENTMENT, AND OPEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEEP RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DIVINE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough the FODR Mindful Collective, we make these meditations, exercises, and practices extremely accessible so that the path to contentment, feeling whole, and feeling loved is more accessible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSign up for the $20/month on Patreon and receive email alerts for your monthly description/invitation and your weekly meditation that will lead you thematically through the month into deep space within yourself and in your relationship with the Divine.  Because we\u2019re also all about creativity and creative processing, you\u2019ll also receive original artworks to use as grounding spaces during meditation and mindfulness exercises. \u00a0SO for $20/mo you get 4 meditations (1/week) and a description or invitation into the theme for that month along with a creative work for grounding your meditation or inspiration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJOIN THE JOURNEY TOWARD EXPERIENCING CONTENTMENT AND A FULLER PICTURE OF YOUR BELOVEDNESS.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout Carin Huebner, the Spiritual Director behind this collective:\u003cbr\u003eAs a Spiritual Director, I facilitate or hold space for individuals to experience the unconditional love of a communal Godhead.  I hold space for individuals to wrestle with the deepest pieces of themselves, who they\u2019ve found or experienced God to be, and how to grow in a deepening and transformational relationship with a God that is Love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up just outside of Houston, Texas where I began my journey of pursuing God in a United Methodist megachurch.  From a very early age I began wondering about relationship with God that is beyond an intellectual understanding as well as wondering around the involvement of art in the spiritual journey and practice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough attaining my BFA as a photographer and my MA as a Spiritual Director, I\u2019ve gotten to jump into a beautiful dance of connection with God that involves practices rooted in the Christian mystical tradition and creative artistic processes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me on this Mindfulness Subscription in order to collaborate on a more revolutionary, encompassing, and contemplative way of doing life with God. \u00a0Help me discern what the world needs to hear and see from an artist and spiritual director. \u00a0Help me discern what you need more of in your life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe backbone of the Mindful Collective is a deep dive into a spiritual formational theme for the month with 1 meditation delivered to your inbox every week (with opportunities to dive deeper with higher rewards).  From engaging the thematic materials and practices, you can expect to grow in self-awareness, grow toward your true self, have better communication with others, and have a deeper sense of unity/connection with God. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fodronline.com\"\u003eCheck out more about FODR and the overall FODR journey here.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.carinhuebner.com\"\u003eCheck out Carin\u2019s artist website here.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

The money raised here helps us subsidize dinner costs making it accessible without skimping on aesthetics and experience.",
