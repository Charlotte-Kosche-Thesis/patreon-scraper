Since\n the strip began, I\u0027ve been trying to figure out a way to \njustify the ridiculous amount of time I put into making it. See, most \npeople see my stuff on social media, which I\u0027m super-grateful for, but I\n don\u0027t make a penny off of it. What little ad revenue I bring in from \nvisitors to my site equals about lemonade-stand levels of income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp\n until recently, I\u0027ve been able to support myself and my family with my \nfull-time job of 18 years(!) as a greeting card artist. Unfortunately, I\n just got laid off, so I need to figure out the best way to keep the \nlights on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can afford to chip in a little every month, I\u0027ll\n be able to keep making these comics. On top of that, you\u0027ll get all \nsorts of cool rewards and even custom-made art, just for you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank\n you so much for believing in and supporting Fowl Language, and \nfor helping make this poor nerd\u0027s dream come true.
