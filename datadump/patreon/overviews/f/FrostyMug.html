    "summary": "My name is Kyle Lobner, and I\u0027m one of the longest tenured producers of Milwaukee Brewers content on the internet. Before the 2008 season I was looking for a reliable, thorough daily roundup of Brewers news. I didn\u0027t find it, so I started my own. Later that year the Frosty Mug became a daily feature at Brew Crew Ball, where I served as Managing Editor from 2008-2014, and it\u0027s followed me to several stops since. It\u0027s been a decade now but I still produce the Mug each weekday morning throughout the year on \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/BrewFrostyMug\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwitter presents a great opportunity for me to share my work with a large audience, but it\u0027s not for everyone. Even for those who do use it, Twitter is not a great format to read the Mug for a variety of reasons. Publishing a bunch of links at once on Twitter floods my readers\u0027 feeds and can be annoying. I publish first thing in the morning, when many of my readers may not be awake or online, and going back to read the Mug requires users to search for my feed and read from the bottom up. The Mug is perhaps more visible than it\u0027s ever been, but the experience of reading it could be better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Twitter version of the Mug isn\u2019t going away, but I\u2019d like to offer a better way for readers to enjoy it. If you become a Patron of this project you will receive the best daily roundup of Brewers news and analysis each weekday morning in one Patreon message you can read at your convenience. For your small pledge I\u0027ll make keeping up with your favorite baseball team easier than it\u0027s ever been before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hopeful that over the months ahead this project will generate a small income that I can use to continue to improve the Mug\u0027s reliability and consistency. Right now I write most weekday mornings, but my schedule is dependent upon the time I have available between actual paying jobs and other life commitments. The income this generates will serve as a significant incentive to prioritize the Mug in my schedule and allow me to hire other writers to ensure that quality content continues even when I\u0027m not available to produce it.\u003cbr\u003e"
