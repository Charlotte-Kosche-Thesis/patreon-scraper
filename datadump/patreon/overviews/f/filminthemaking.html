It produces video essays about what makes movies so great and the reasons filmmakers choose what they do when making their films. This Patreon is here to support the creation of these videos and make all of the time spent researching, writing, editing and producing a little more worth while. The support that I get from my audience means the world to me, even if its not monetary there is still an excitement that I get from any feedback or positive comments. Thank you for watching.\u003cbr\u003e"
