It is a passion that I\u0027d be glad to share!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\ndo you do?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith\nthe development that the 3D printing industry has gone through over\nthe last few years, I got inspired to start sculpting my own\nminiatures.

So even\nthough you may only expect sculpts from these projects, sometimes\ndifferent sculpts pop up also. These are the models from the first 5\npatrons (see printing-fan rewards) and a pick from one of the\nsuperfans!
