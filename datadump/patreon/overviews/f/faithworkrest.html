    "summary": "The Surge Network is a movement of local churches seeking to put Jesus on display in Arizona. This happens as men and women are released into every industry, neighborhood, school, and community to steward their vocation for the kingdom of God. The Faith, Work, and Rest podcast is made up of many of these men and women in conversation with one another about how to flesh out rhythms of work and rest as image bearers of God.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for being a part of the conversation and we invite you to participate even more! We are just getting going and we need your help to envision what this could be and help us carry it towards that end. Arizona has a beautiful diversity of both people and communities and we hope these conversations will introduce you to a lot of different people following Jesus in all areas of their life, in all parts of our cities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point, we have kicked off with a few things: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Faith, Work, and Rest Podcast- we are curating conversations and providing access to thought leaders and thought provoking examples of vocational faithfulness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Prayer- please join our prayer team by committing to pray for work related prayer requests in 30-minute chunks every Monday morning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Piloting vocation coaching- we are helping the individuals in this community who want to wrestle with their vocations and occupations with trained guides along their journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron, you\u0027ll get access to what we\u0027re creating before anyone else\u2013and some things unavailable to anyone other than our patrons like gatherings with our podcast guests over a meal, small group discussions, and vocation retreats.\u003cbr\u003e"
