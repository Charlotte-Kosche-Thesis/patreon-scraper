    "summary": "Front Porch with the Fitzes, is a weekly chinwag featuring author Elyse Fitzpatrick and two of her three kids, Jessica Thompson and Joel Fitzpatrick. Sometimes some unexpected folks might even drop by and sit for a spell. Every week they\u0027ll jibber about family life, things that interest them in culture or news, and what they\u0027re learning about the Lord. Imagine sitting on the front porch of your ol\u0027 Kentucky home, listening to slightly off-kilter believers talk about life, do a lot of laughing at each other and everyone else... and then, of course, there\u0027s always the bluegrass music playing in the background.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to all the Fitz-Faithfuls that support us and make this podcast happen every week."
