From character illustrations for popular roleplaying games to comic book art to book cover art, I deal mostly in bringing character ideas to life. Sci-fi? Fantasy? Modern? Multiverse? Makes no difference to me! But as a jack-of-all-trades \u0027artiste\u0027, it\u0027s hard to nail me down to just one mode of art. So by pledging to my artistic cause, you\u0027ll be seeing \u003cem\u003ea lot\u003c/em\u003e more than just axe-wielding Conan or Xena wannabe\u0027s. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSome of my current projects:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCHARACTER FOLIO\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEver wished you had a book of pre-made, stock character images you could leaf through and select from to add the perfect visual element to your latest RPG character? Well, that\u0027s what I\u0027m working on currently. The potential for the project is unlimited, just like the races, classes and games I\u0027ll be basing these illustrations on. For now, however, I will start with \n\t\u003cem\u003ecore classes \u003c/em\u003e- the traditional lineup of barbarian to wizard from popular roleplaying games such as Pathfinder and D\u0026amp;D, in ever basic race and gender combination.\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen a series is finished, the collected character illustrations will be available (initially as PDF) for download as a complete Character Folio.\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eA NEW UNIVERSE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI have always wanted to create a \u0027world\u0027. Rather, a whole universe. It\u0027s a massive undertaking. A life\u0027s work, even. My universe will be sci-fi, but also fantasy. As mad as it may seem, my universe would be a blend of the tradition fantasy themes, and propel them all into a far-flung future, where humanity is truly no longer the dominant species! Will we ever see this universe? What\u0027s the point? Who knows.. maybe there is no other point than to simply create...\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging to my Patreon page, you have the opportunity to connect with\n a long-term artist, skilled in all sorts of mediums, who isn\u0027t famous. \nIn other words, a chance to communicate on a personal level, ask \nquestions, get advice, or at the very least, a virtual beer/cookie for \nappreciating my work.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, once again, thanks for your support, and welcome to my mind...\n\u003cbr\u003e"
