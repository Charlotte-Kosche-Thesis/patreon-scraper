    "summary": "What if we lived in a world where everyone was passionate about their work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe people are the most beneficial for themselves and for others when they do what inspires them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNowadays profit is the focus - healthcare is run like a business, schools are run like a business, farms are run like a business, businesses are run solely like a business. More often than not, the monetary reward for one\u2019s efforts is considered the major driving force in choosing an occupation, sticking to it, or changing it. A lot of people today work for the money. \u003cbr\u003eHowever, satisfaction doesn\u2019t come from the figures on a pay check. Fulfilment is not measured in dollars and euros. People should be given the chance to claim their passion and inspiration back. A crack in the cycle of \u201canother pay-check - another bill\u201d should appear. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur passion is growing clean, nutrient-packed food and gifting it to others. \u003cbr\u003eWe take care of a few orchards with nut and fruit trees, a couple of vegetable gardens and a greenhouse. The way we care for our plants is beyond organic - our  land flows with fresh air from the sea, crystal clear waters from the mountains, with chemical-free soil, away from any form of pollution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only do we invest our time and energy in producing the finest quality fruits and vegetables, we also improve environmental conditions in the gardens and their surroundings - we build soil, we improve the water reserves and we increase the biodiversity. What comes out of our gardens is a gift for anyone who experiences it. It is a gift metaphorically and literally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor six years we\u2019ve been growing real, nutritious food and we give it to people, never charging anything for it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the store clean food is expensive. Not everyone can afford that. Yet we believe everyone has the right to be healthy. We don\u2019t want to become another reason for people to choose high income over high fulfilment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy providing access to free, nutritious food, we are contributing to a world where people will spend less on healthcare and more on developing their passion. This creates a crack in the cycle. It allows breathing room, a space of no worry to provide the basic human need for food, and thus a space where dreams, inspiration and courage can grow instead. The potential for change is born. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd when a person materializes this potential, makes a change and follows his inspiration, the result of his/her labor will reach others. And they, on their turn, will change their lives and the lives of others. The wheel of change will start spinning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to expand the gardens, produce more food, and reach more people with this gift. Let\u2019s do this together. Join the project - come work alongside us, distribute food, grow your passion, or simply become patrons."
