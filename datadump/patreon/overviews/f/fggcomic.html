I work really hard to provide comics about transgender issues, mental health, pop culture, and more! It\u0027s really important to me to make positive comics for the larger trans community!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy donate to Fake Gamer Girl Comics?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonating to the comic means so much to me! Having any financial support for making art I care about is really validating. It allows me to spend more time on comics and grow the content. Donations have already helped me go from doing two comics a week to doing three comics a week. The money goes into the comic and other creative productions. We now have a website, and I run a podcast with my partner, all because of donations from fans! In the future, this money will allow me to buy computer upgrades, art supplies, and potentially allow me to take time from my day job to produce even more content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMore content! The more donations I get, the more content I will produce! I\u0027m always working on comics and have a few patreon-exclusive comics a month. In April, I\u0027ll be releasing a 40-page comic only for patrons! For as low as $1 a month, you get access to early comics! I will even draw you a social media avatar, or do regular commissions for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou also get an exclusive 42-page comic, Shuffle Girl Issue #1! (and there\u0027ll be a ton more exclusives to come!) Besides that, you\u0027ll be a part of a growing community of trans/ally folks and I\u0027ll be listening and growing with y\u0027all!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan\u0027t Donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI understand some people cannot afford to donate. I still really appreciate you reading the comic! If you can\u0027t donate, it would really mean the world to me if you shared the patreon or the comic to your friends! The comic has had steady growth the past few months due to support from fans! It\u0027s been really rewarding to be a part of this community, and I\u0027m super thankful!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for your time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Ash\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/c948bc7ca64c9bc0a1f60661dc6341e5/tumblr_p77g8gzZ2R1x1qo02o1_540.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s our website: \u003ca href=\"http://fakegamergirlcomics.com\"\u003ehttp://fakegamergirlcomics.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the podcast: \u003ca href=\"http://queer4queercast.com\"\u003ehttp://queer4queercast.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the comic\u0027s tumblr: \u003ca href=\"https://fakegamergirlcomics.tumblr.com\"\u003ehttps://fakegamergirlcomics.tumblr.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
