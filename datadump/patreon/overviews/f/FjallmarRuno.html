    "summary": "So, my name is Fjallmar Runo. I am writing fantasy fiction that has a mixture of inspirations from my love for D\u0026amp;D and my passion for Norse history. I\u0027ve always been an imaginative dreamer, thinking of epic saga\u0027s and adventures my whole life. I blame Morrowind and D\u0026amp;D for this. Well finally with some encouragement from my dear family that has been so supportive of me working on my stories into a public forum and suggestions from friends to open a Patreon, here I am. My main goal is to get my Valdis Chronicles out and to you to enjoy so that is my MAIN and CHEAPEST tier. I have it set up so the first three tiers are \"Story Rewards\" and the next three are \"Extra Rewards\" and the last three are \"Interaction Rewards\" I am honored and so thankful for ANY reward you choose as everything is just a big show of support for me. So, Stay awhile, and listen to my story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e~~Fjallmar\u003c/div\u003e"
