Here is what I\u0027m up to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTLDR\u003c/strong\u003e: Each month you\u0027ll get a PbtA (Powered by the Apocalypse) roleplaying game that is stripped down and tells a specific story, called an issue. Each issue ties into a larger, meta-narrative as you play them because each story is either directly connected to the previous one or is taking part at least in the same fictional world as the other issues. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month I design a new issue after playing the previous one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor 1$\u003c/strong\u003e a month you get access to the feed and the podcast of my playtest sessions that are edited for easy listening and are available for free at my \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBjxqgHNZcI\u0026amp;list=PLdShDUcnZ1VG-2rSlc97d42kK8oY9FxtE\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYoutube channel\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor 2$\u003c/strong\u003e month you\u0027ll also get \u003cstrong\u003ethat months issue \u003c/strong\u003ein PDF format.

You also get to vote on what I review next on my \u003ca href=\"http://consumingcyberpunk.com\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor 8$\u003c/strong\u003e a month you\u0027ll also get the physical copy of the book that will be comprised of all the issues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor 14$\u003c/strong\u003e a month, on top of everything else, you\u0027ll get PDF\u0027s of any other games I release while you subscribe to this level as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the 1st of each month I post a new issue and delete the previous months issue from the feed. I also send my Patrons a DrivethruRPG code to their email for that issue being archived for their records. Back issues are available for purchase \u003ca href=\"https://www.samjokopublishing.com/shop-samjoko/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first issue of Uncanny Echo is free and available \u003ca href=\"https://www.samjokopublishing.com/free-games/uncanny-echo\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e if you want to check it out first before pledging. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLong explanation\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been fascinated with emergent mystery for a while. To satiate this desire, every month I\u0027m going to release a one-shot \"module\" that will unravel a meta-narrative revolving around an ongoing mystery you create through play. With each month comes a new chapter. With each chapter, a self-contained pickup and play stripped down and tailored PbtA experience; kind of like an adventure starter. It is \u003cstrong\u003eimportant \u003c/strong\u003eto note that \u003cem\u003eUncanny Echo \u003c/em\u003ewill \u003cem\u003enot \u003c/em\u003eteach you how to play a Powered by the Apocalypse game; it leverages your knowledge of the system in order to create this unique framework. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to be playing each Issue every month. After our play, I\u0027ll be designing the next installment for this emergent story, making the design work emergent as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEmulating a movie or TV Show, each new chapter may be directly connected to events prior, or jump to all new events that will intersect in the future. As a table you will decide how each intersects, crafting an emergent story. As more Issues release you may choose to play them in an entirely different order than my group and I.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese Issues will comprise\u003cem\u003e Uncanny Echo\u003c/em\u003e. There will be 12 issues to complete the year. Following this, I will compile all of them into one product, most likely a 6x9 book. It will feature more art and tie the Issues into one cohesive text. At a certain pledge level, you\u0027ll be able to get this finalized product for free, provided you pay the shipping. It will most likely be Print On Demand, but that will depend on the number of copies being printed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also be recording these sessions, editing them like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/pocket-sized-play\"\u003e Pocket-Sized Play\u003c/a\u003e episodes (that is, actual play episodes with very tight editing) and releasing them via this Patreon\u0027s RSS feed as well. This means you\u0027ll be able to hear our own story as well as how I run the game. Some of our Mics aren\u0027t the best but the story is something I\u0027m proud of already. The playtest videos themselves are available for free on my \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBjxqgHNZcI\u0026amp;list=PLdShDUcnZ1VG-2rSlc97d42kK8oY9FxtE\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is that here, and in a G+ community (https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/110851348644394459954) folks will share their own emergent mysteries made with \u003cem\u003eUncanny Echo\u003c/em\u003e, and see how their own game differs from my own and others!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u00a0\u003cem\u003eUncanny Echo\u003c/em\u003e will \u003cem\u003eyou \u003c/em\u003ecreate? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eConsuming Cyberpunk\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://consumingcyberpunk.com\"\u003e blog\u003c/a\u003e, where I post about what I\u0027m consuming within the genre, go figure, right?
