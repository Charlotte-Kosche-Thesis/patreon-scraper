For \"\u003ca href=\"http://micechat.com/author/eatingtourists/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStroll Through Disneyland\u003c/a\u003e\" this is the dedicated Disney fan base. For EatingTourists.net it is the more general travel and food enthusiast, though there is obviously some overlap. We\u0027ll use a single post for MiceChat to illustrate the process here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHand write a rough framework for the column.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- For MiceChat, this would include some historical reference to Disneyland, and a personal connection from my own experience with the park. Also perhaps something regarding Disneyana related to the subject matter of the column.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWrite first draft.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- This tends to be a \"stream of consciousness\" draft devoted to getting as many ideas onto \"paper\" (or computer as the case may be) as possible. NO attention is given to typos, grammar, spelling etc. It is strictly a \"spilling\" of the mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMultiple draft revisions and refining follow.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- During this phase, the flow of the column is addressed, with attention paid to informing while hopefully entertaining and touching the heart of the reader at the same time. Disneyland is an emotional topic for me, and I want the reader to feel that and hopefully be emotional as well while reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eResearch and fact checking.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I have a very large library of Disneyland reference books, and between these and online research, I check and confirm to the best of my ability all facts and information presented in the column. This is time consuming. While I might blithely refer to the opening date of a given attraction in a column, I rarely know this without research, and data often conflicts in different sources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProofreading.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I for one am horrified by the state of the English language of late, and while this may be \"old-school\" I work very hard to make sure that spelling, grammar, and punctuation are all correct. I typically default to American English due to the size of the US audience. While I don\u0027t pretend perfection, I hope to be a cut above the modern blogger that spells \"lose\" as \"loose\" because he or she doesn\u0027t actually know the difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEditing.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u0027m sorry I\u0027ve written such a long letter, but I didn\u0027t have time to write a shorter one.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- This quote (or one like it) has been attributed to so many writers over the centuries, that like many word and phrase origins, it\u0027s pretty near impossible to tell for sure who wrote it first. That said, it encapsulates a great truism about writing. Editing takes time, and shorter is often better. This is the part of the writing process in which the unnecessary is removed. It is painful for any writer and is akin to killing one\u0027s babies. (This is why editors are so useful in the publishing world. They don\u0027t love the babies (words) like the writer did, and don\u0027t mind removing them). However, it is through this \"cutting\" that a better column is finally created.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProofreading aloud.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I\u0027ve found it nearly impossible to proof my own writing by simply reading it, as my mind somehow fails to see the mistakes. My ears however can catch those same mistakes, so I do much of my final proofing by reading the column aloud.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWriting is more or less finished at this point. Now for the photos.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Fortunately, I have a very large body of photos to draw on that I (or Vicky) have taken while visiting the park. Illustrating a column using historical photos however is much more difficult and is a minefield of copyright issues. One must obtain photos from legitimate Disney sources, or obtain permission from other sources. Lining up the the pictures can take many hours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePreparing/modifying photos.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Once obtained/chosen, photos often need work to made useful. They may need exposure adjustment, cropping, color correction, etc. It is a rare photo that doesn\u0027t need some work before going into the column.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatermarking.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Final versions of the photos are nowhere near final. They must now be watermarked with a MiceChat logo as well as a photo credit or copyright watermark. Each photo requires at least two watermarks, and these will also depend upon the background of the photo as this affects the visibility of the watermarks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePosting/Assembling the column.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \"Final\" text is pasted into the WordPress site for MiceChat. Then the final watermarked photos are uploaded to the MiceChat library. Photos are then inserted in the text as appropriate, and captions are added to each.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePreview for publication.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- The column is then previewed without making it \"live\" (published for the public). This allows any formatting errors to be discovered and corrected, and often shines new light on changes that might improve the overall flow of the column for the final audience. These changes are then made and the column is previewed again. This happens over and over until (hopefully) all problems are identified and corrected.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSubmission for review and publication.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Once I\u0027m happy with all elements of the column, it is submitted for review and publication. It is out of my hands at this point, and I wait for it to appear on the site, and hope that it will be well received. I only learn of my success or failure when the comments from readers start to appear. It is my hope that each column enriches the life of each reader in some way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen it\u0027s time to start on the next column....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoes that sound like it\u0027s worth a dollar to you? Please show your support with a pledge, and I\u0027ll continue to strive to bring you the best that Disneyland has to offer :)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "Your generosity would allow me to dedicate even greater time to the work of writing and photography that brings the history of Disneyland to life. A single column takes more than 20 hours of effort, and yet is unpaid. If you feel that you have been entertained, informed, struck by beauty, or had your life enriched in any way, please pledge $1 per month (or more). Art is work, and the world is a better place for it. Thanks for your support :)",
