    "summary": "All relationships are difficult, but furry relationships even more so. In the fandom, many relationships start online or long distance, and they are often between people who are young, new to romantic relationships, or otherwise inexperienced with socializing. As if these practical issues were not enough, the fandom is also uniquely enriched with people who practice non-traditional relationship styles, including non-monogamous or power exchange relationships. Most furries figure out how to navigate these unfamiliar relationship styles and relate to each other ethically over a period of years, making many painful mistakes along the way. At Feral Attraction, it is our goal to save you time and heartache, by allowing you to learn from our own mistakes and our own experiences. Hopefully, by listening to our podcasts and reading our advice column, you will learn how to better relate to others ethically and make your relationships stronger, healthier, and happier as a result.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn January 2016 we launched our podcast and advice column. Who are we? We\u2019re Viro and Metriko, two furries who have been both part of the fandom and participants in non-traditional relationships for over a decade. We want to help you in your relationships by pointing out our faults and addressing potential pitfalls that you might encounter along the way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince our launch we\u2019ve grown to become the most liked Furry podcast on Facebook. We\u2019ve also been invited to appear on other relationship and sex advice podcasts including one of the world\u2019s most popular, Dan Savage\u2019s \u201cSavage Lovecast.\u201d While we\u2019ve been entirely self-funded so far, and we aren\u2019t going away any time soon, we could use your help to continue to grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting us on Patreon, you enable us to improve the production values and overall quality of our content and allow us to devote more of our time to helping you with your relationship problems and becoming the definitive source for relationship, dating, and sex advice within the furry fandom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe never expected to receive the outpouring of support for our podcast and advice column that we have so far, and we are entirely grateful to all of our fans and supporters \u2014 without your questions, comments, feedback, and support, we would not be where we are today, or have the opportunities to help others (both inside the fandom and beyond) that we currently enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for everything and, as always, be well."
