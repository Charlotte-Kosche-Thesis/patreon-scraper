    "summary": "The 3 of us - Roland, Csermely and Cheryl - are here to inspire you to take in a deep breath of fresh mountain air, to encourage you to walk barefoot and get grounded, and to forage for the essential nutrients that are lacking in a modern diet, in a physical and spiritual sense alike.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know how a traditional CSA works: you sign up, pay a fee for a monthly subscription and receive your vegetables on a weekly/biweekly basis, picking them up directly from the farm or having them delivered straight to you. This ensures the livelihood of the family/workers, so that they can fulfill a purpose and meaning in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur modern take on the CSA, \u003cstrong\u003eForestCreekMeadows\u003c/strong\u003e, is that we will deliver your weekly ration of nature online, with essentials that you need to \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003egrow your ecological consciousness\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. From the sky to the trees, from herbs to hands-on work experience, these rations will satiate your craving for nature, inspired by imagery and words in a very practical sense. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease share and spread the word of our digital CSA, so that we can find like-minded community members the world over!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRoland is the Forest\u003c/strong\u003e. He is the meritorious tree planter who spaded more than 14,000 saplings into the rocky soil of the Scottish Borders, he is the strength when life gets stormy, and the fire to keep us warm. He is devoted to recreating wilderness among native trees and restoring wildlife habitat wherever we may roam.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCsermely is the Creek\u003c/strong\u003e. Literally and figuratively, Csermely means \"creek\" in Hungarian, a tribute to the language of the place where she was born. And she rushes through life with a never-ending energy, collecting the knowledge of nature along the way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCheryl is the Meadow\u003c/strong\u003e. She is the propagator of fertile seeds, which (sometimes) become clever ideas and spread like weeds. She is the nurturer of animals big and small, in tune with her intuition and the plants that grow from the land. She represents our softest side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether, we live in an out-of-the-way land (more specifically Breb, Maramure\u0219, Romania) covered by forests, creeks and meadows - and we want, more than anything, to share the joys of living simply with you! Because even if you live in a city, or a busy suburb, we all need access to a facet of the environment that promotes peace, calm and understanding. Nature is something that we all require in a certain form, whether that be through real life pictures, videos, drawings, or reflections of one living close to nature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy would one want to do this? Because nature, like the whole of the universe, is benevolent. It should be a pleasure for all to \u003cstrong\u003elive in benevolence\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are doers and craftspeople - taking pride in the work that our hands can do when they step away from the keyboard. For the sake of making a living and a larger influence further afield, we also write essays, poetry and blog posts about living an ecological life, surrounded with all aspects of a\u00a0 holistic wellbeing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will we add memorable value to your support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor starters, your investment in us, is an investment in a healthier future, no matter where you live in the world, and that is because with each and every act of ours, we strive to benefit Earth\u0027s society, including the other than human beings as well, all the way to air, water, rocks - and fire. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen our creativity is fed and nurtured, \u003cstrong\u003ewe are able to give more\u003c/strong\u003e, and to give more mindfully. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt first, we strive to raise our sponsorship level to $1,500/month. Within this amount we can live more than comfortably in Romania - so that creativity blooms freely on all fronts. In the coming months, we will bring some small animals to the land (ducks, chickens and geese, perhaps a pig or two...), our no-dig garden will be able to flourish on this fertile land with leafy greens, and a macro lens will enhance nature\u0027s perspective. The more we can inspire you with life in the countryside, the happier - and healthier - we all will be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we are not stopping there! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe desire to make a much larger impact, and at a future benchmark of $3000 a month we are suddenly able to truly inhabit the land in the sensitive way that we desire, bringing and inviting many more beating hearts upon it, while stepping back, and letting it thrive to its fullest potential. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMultisensory glimpses of undisturbed calm, free from the distractions of urban life. A smile or two, perhaps a laugh, or a tear somewhere in between, along with some insights into a life lived closer to nature. You\u0027ll find out what it is like to live without running water, how to cook over a wood fire, how to invite nature into your home and how to enjoy a slower, simpler life with less technology. For this is indeed our unfolding common future and, hereby, you can contribute to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhether your aim is to homestead, get rid of the conventional excesses in your life, or to transition to a handmade environment all the whole living closer to nature, we are here to help, inspire and share all of our real life experiences along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe thank you in advance for your tremendous support!\u003cbr\u003eWith love from Romania,\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://forestcreekmeadows.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eForestCreekMeadows\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStep away from the corporate table and start supporting creative artisans today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAn after note: in respect to equal sharing, 1/3 of all our sponsorship funds go directly to Csermely to save for the future - after all, our children will carry on the responsibility of taking care of the Earth long after we are able to walk these hills, plant native trees, harvest healing roots and keep the flowing waters clean. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://forestcreekmeadows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/the-forest-the-creek-the-meadow.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
