Starting in Spain where events would regularly supersede 150 players I was able to develop a strong following in my home community.\u003cbr\u003eI have personally developed several innovations that make my videos unique to others, such as coloured bases and customised damage decks to aid in visual recognition and the development of custom software to be able to update game information in real-time as well as import rankings and other information.\u003cbr\u003eIt was these features that have lead me to be the number one choice for streaming some of the largest X-wing events in the world.\u003cbr\u003eRecent life events have made me realise that I can no longer continue to do this on my own. And this is where the Patreon system comes in.\u003cbr\u003eAny contribution is greatly appreciated Depending on how far we go with this I can look into arranging rewards and other benefits.\u003cbr\u003e"

Europe has many fervent X-Wing communities and the cost of a weekend to travel to one of those events can typically reach $250.\u003cbr\u003eI cant afford that myself now but with your help this can be possible. National events, Regional Events, System Open Series and European Championships help complete nearly a full calendar year. Then there are also extra official events such as the European team championship.\u003cbr\u003eIf you have an event that is going to be over 100 players then let me know and if it fits into the calendar then there\u0027s a good chance we could make it.",
