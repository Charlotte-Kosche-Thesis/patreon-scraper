     "about": "Free Birth Society is about understanding how our patriarchal culture has crafted birth into a singular default system that is based on many out of date practices, gender oppression, high volume care, and pathology. Sadly, there is little room for autonomy, informed consent is rarely practiced, and individualized care is hard to achieve in obstetrics today. It\u0027s often a battle to be treated low risk and it can be deeply traumatizing to the parents to feel so out of control. While we do respect obstetric\u0027s important place in society, particularly for high risk pregnancies, we also see the shadow side of a system having an almost complete dictatorship and monopoly on childbirth in our country. We are aiming to not only legitimize and normalize other ways of birthing, but also help women and parents who are birthing inside the obstetrical model learn how to optimize their experience and bring with them an understanding of their legal rights and appropriate expectations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether, we claim the power that is rightfully ours. Women own birth. We birth on our terms. We are learning what it means to take responsibility for our pregnancies and birthing experiences. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFree Birth Society is a virtual space of exploration into the unspoken side of everything pregnancy and birth related. A person\u0027s journey into parenthood is a highly individual experience and there is no one way to do it. In fact, the more variety we can honor as a community, the easier it is for a parent to find their most intuitive path of where to birth and how to parent. We know families thrive when supported. Here, we celebrate choice. Together, we are Freeing Birth and reclaiming it as ours once again. This, is a Free Birth Society. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e.....and lucky for us, we have nature \u0026amp; science on our side.",
