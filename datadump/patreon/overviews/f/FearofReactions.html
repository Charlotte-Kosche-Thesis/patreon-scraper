    "summary": "(One of my first ever Youtube videos and I\u0027ve grown so much in confidence since this.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi everyone. My name is Day Day and I have 2 small YouTube channels. The first one is called Fear Of Reactions (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBM2D1-e3DhStnDypyP4FKw\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBM2D1-e3DhStnDypyP4FKw\u003c/a\u003e) where I react to your favorite musicians and various acts. From dancing and singing to funny and emotional. Whatever you request I will react to. The other channel is called Fear Of ReactionsTV 2.0 (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHSHVVVPK1tpuAHoRh7RUyg\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHSHVVVPK1tpuAHoRh7RUyg\u003c/a\u003e) where I react to your favorite television shows. I don\u0027t watch a lot of tv\u00a0so that can be a very good thing. It leaves my options open to start reacting to any series that\u0027s requested for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to start YouTube to break out of my shyness I guess, lol. I always felt a little awkward and wanted to feel comfortable around other people. Even those that I was close to the most. I loved watching YouTube videos and always wondered if I would ever be brave enough to be able to do something like that. One day I just said I am going to do it, and I did. It was the day before my birthday (June 1) this year.\u00a0 No matter what people had to say or think. I was doing this for me. I thought, if I can make a video to be viewed around the world then it should be easy for me to be myself around others. I was so nervous at first but with the response, I received back from viewers I was pleased and shocked. The one issue I had with myself was the way I talk and people liked it. People saw me and I felt all the positivity they were giving me. So it pushed me to continue not just because I wanted to do it for me but I had people requesting things for ME to react to. People telling me they liked my voice, my smile, they liked ME. That gave me confidence. I recently watched my first couple videos and I see huge improvements today\u00a0in everything. All the thanks go to God, my family and you. Thank you so much for your encouraging words on every video. It\u0027s the reason why I do it. So if you would like to support the channel, please contribute whatever you can. Thank you and the journey still\u00a0continue....."
