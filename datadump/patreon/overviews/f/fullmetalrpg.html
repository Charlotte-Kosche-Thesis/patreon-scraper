    "summary": "Welcome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFull Metal RPG is a podcast that focuses on covering the roleplaying underground. We got started in 2015 and since then have made friends all over the world. We delve deep into OSR, narrative games, story games, independent games, third-rail publishers and self-published content. We go hard into horror, grimdark and cyberpunk. If you\u0027ve listened to other roleplaying podcasts, we want the FMRPG experience to be completely different. Our goal is to have our podcast feel more like hanging out at a record store in the mid 90s than a game store today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is our hope that if you are reading this, then you have followed Full Metal RPG over the last two years and will be familiar with our brand of roleplaying discussion, upfront takes and honest exchanges. If we endorse a product or a creator it is because with believe in the work. We\u0027re here to share our love of grimdark gaming and we are lucky to consider our listeners to be our personal friends, and not simply faceless numbers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have found your way here and you\u0027re not familiar with us, please take a second and check us out. \u003ca href=\"http://fullmetalrpg.com/\"\u003eOur website\u003c/a\u003e has links to a large catalogue of our back-episodes and transcribed reviews of some of the books we\u0027ve covered on the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the thing: Adam and I want to do more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to create more podcast episodes than we ever have and cover a range of experiences that have thus far been beyond our reach. We want give our listeners what they\u0027ve been asking for (literally for years) and to break into the realm of Actual Plays. We want to create video content to really immerse you in the style of RPG gaming that we do on a level that we have never been able to achieve.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also want to share with you our talents that cannot be transmuted via the realm of downloaded audio. To this end we\u0027ve created a wide array of reward levels that will allow us to share with you:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e - written thoughts on our favorite subjects especially horror and post apocalyptic gaming\u003cbr\u003e- drawings of your fantastic creations seen through our eyes\u003cbr\u003e- one on one advice for running your games, with personalized feedback to address the specific challenges you are facing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order for FMRPG to move forward, we need you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe won\u0027t be paying for any hookers or blow with the proceeds from this Patreon. We won\u0027t be furnishing our collections with rare, hard to find tomes. Every. Single. Penny. Of this crowdsourcing campaign will go back into the podcast, giving us the means to bring you new, fresh, honest, dark and brutal content, and to create the kind of rewards for our fans that we believe deeply that you deserve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for coming with us on this weird, strange adventure. We\u0027ve made unbelievable friends and forged alliances that we didn\u0027t know were possible.
