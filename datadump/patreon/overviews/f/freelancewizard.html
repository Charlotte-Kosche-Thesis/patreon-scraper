Do you enjoy being part of a living world set in one of the world\u0027s most popular MMORPGs? If so, welcome home. The Hydaelyn Roleplayers Coalition (also known as the RPC) is your hub for meeting new people, creating new stories, getting feedback, and announcing events.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe RPC offers a wealth of services for role-players, including a forum that supports both unofficial RP servers (Balmung and Gilgamesh), a wiki for uploading character images and profiles, a character development section with prompts to help you build and enhance your character, an artists\u0027 forum for fan art and commissions, and a calendar system for promoting events. We have a friendly community of over 4000 role-players and over 15,000 hits per day.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eSo what\u0027s this about?\u003c/h4\u003e\nAlmost a year ago, with the incredible popularity of FFXIV, we outgrew our original web hosting provider; our page load times were in the 5-10 second range, and our provider was constantly throttling the site.\u00a0To improve performance and to give us the ability to customize the site to meet our needs, we moved to Amazon Web Services. Unfortunately, this also significantly increased our hosting costs. We\u0027d like to continue growing and adding new functionality, but we can\u0027t do that without your help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eHow can I help?\u003c/h4\u003e\nBy pledging through Patreon, you can support the RPC and enable us to add new features, such as:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eReal-time chat\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVoice chat server\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSemantic wiki markup\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRedundant database storage (to reduce AWS downtime)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA larger instance (to improve performance)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat do I get in return?\u003c/h4\u003e\nBesides warm fuzzies, a better site,\u00a0and the undying gratitude of your fellow role-players? To start, those who pledge will receive a special color for their username on the forum. They\u0027ll also have\u00a0early access to test new features and access to patrons only updates on the site (including notifications and status updates for maintenance). That\u0027s just the beginning, though. We\u0027re also working with some of our talented artists to arrange special commissions just for patrons, and as we reach higher and higher funding goals, we\u0027ll be able to add additional features such as private voice chat rooms for our backers.\n\u003cbr\u003eThe rewards tiers you see below can change over time. If you\u0027ve got an idea for a reward, or if you want to help the RPC by offering something as a reward, just let me know! Be sure to check back on this page regularly for any new reward offerings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eAbout the RPC\u003c/h4\u003e\nThe RPC has been in operation since the announcement of version 1.0 of Final Fantasy XIV. Run for most of its existence by Kylin, the reins were passed to Freelance Wizard in February 2014. Freelance Wizard passed administration to Melkire in 2015, and the site is currently run and administered by a team of dedicated moderators, with Freelance Wizard providing hosting services and patron management.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e(FINAL FANTASY XIV \u00a9 2010-2015 SQUARE ENIX CO., LTD.
