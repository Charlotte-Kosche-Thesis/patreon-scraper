Each issue typically contains new creatures, locations, ships, and equipment as well as material related to running games and improving your campaign.  We also often have sci-fi short stories as well. If you\u0027re not familiar with the magazines, head over to their websites and check out all the awesome content we\u0027ve published already.  Go ahead, I\u0027ll wait...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://frontierexplorer.org/images/combinedLogos.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003ePatronage and Releases\u003c/h1\u003eThis is your chance to help support the production of these great magazines.  While we love Star Frontiers and producing the magazines and would love \nto do so continuously, it\u0027s not a small endeavor and requires quite a \nbit of time and effort.  By supporting this Patreon campaign, you can \ntell us that all that effort is worth it and help us defray some of the \ncosts associated with the project.  Plus your support will allow us to \nproduce better and possibly more content and improve the quality of the \nmagazines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Frontier Explorer is produced quarterly with issues coming out in January, April, July, and October.  This Patreon campaign is primarily designed to support those releases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile our primary efforts are going into the Frontier Explorer, we also maintain the Star Frontiersman, an older Star Frontiers magazine I just recently was given ownership of.  There currently is no set schedule for releases of new issues of that magazine but we will do so as content becomes available.  However, unless we start receiving a lot of new content, the Star Frontiersman will be at best a bi-annual publication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the regular issues, both magazines have special issues produced completely on an ad hoc basis.  In the case of the Frontier Explorer, these could be on any topic.  So far we have only done one and it was the complete deck plans (25 decks) of an alien ship.  In the case of the Star Frontiersman, we are slowly in the process of \"remastering\" (with permission from Wizards of the Coast) all of the original modules and Dragon, Polyhedron, Imagine, and Ares articles.  These special issues are not part of the Patreon campaign, only the regular magazine issues will be included.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus by supporting this Patreon, you are looking at at least four but no more than six issues being released each year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThe Magazines are Free\u003c/h1\u003eThe magazines are posted for free on their respective websites, you don\u0027t need to back me here in order to access the content.  You can grab them from the websites or from \u003ca href=\"http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/browse/pub/4586/Frontier-Explorer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eour distribution channel at DriveThruRPG\u003c/a\u003e.  You should think of your patronage as a regular donation to the project rather than any type of subscription.\u00a0 Of course, that also means that you don\u0027t have to stick to any specific funding level.  If you only want to donate say, $0.50 or $2.50 per issue, that\u0027s great too.  Pledge whatever you\u0027d like and you\u0027ll get the benefits of whichever funding bar you clear along with our heart-felt thanks. (Of course it has to be at least $1 for the thanks to be public.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I said before, we love this game and will continue to do this for as long as we can regardless of whether or not you become a patron.  And you can continue to enjoy the material we produce whether you become a patron or not.  Patronage exists simply as a means for you to say thanks by donating financial \nassistance, which makes it easier for us to continue producing and publishing new material.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHow This Will Work\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://frontierexplorer.org/sites/default/files/issue3-cover-400h.png\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e1) The goal is for the magazines to be released near the middle of their publication month (although recently life has gotten in the way and they\u0027ve been coming out at the end of the month, something I hope to fix starting with issue 12).  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) As soon as it is ready, I\u0027ll post the issue here to trigger the billing cycle (which will occur at the beginning of the next month).  This is when I\u0027ll e-mail all patrons at the Frontiersman ($1) level with a copy of the magazine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) Once the billing completes, all patron\u0027s names will be collected and added to (or removed from) the website and the supporter page will be generated for the next issue.\u00a0 (The exception to this will be the first Patreon supported issue, issue 12.\u00a0 For this issue, I\u0027ll pull all the registered patrons just before release even though no money has yet been contributed.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4) If you are supporting us at the Station Master level ($25 per issue), you\u0027ll receive your print copy about 1-2 weeks after billing occurs.  It takes about 1 week to get the issue through the pre-production process (which should happen between release and billing) and then another 1-2 weeks to get it actually printed and shipped which I\u0027ll do as soon as the funds have cleared.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eKeep Exploring!\u003c/h1\u003eHopefully, you will become a patron and help keep the magazines going.  If not, that\u0027s fine too.  And if you want to contribute art, articles, or stories to the magazines, we\u0027d love to publish your material.  Just jump over to either of the magazines\u0027 websites hit the big gold \"\u003cem\u003eSubmit New Content\u003c/em\u003e\" button.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd as always, keep exploring!\u003cbr\u003e"
