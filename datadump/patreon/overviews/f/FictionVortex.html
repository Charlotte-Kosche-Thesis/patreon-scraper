But the hex of the great demon Hosting Costs and the mech-suited zombie army of the evil General Return on Investment have been hitting us hard.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe need your help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the past, a generous and benevolent patron has helped us cover costs, but those days are coming to a close, and it was never a good strategy for growth, anyway. You see, we\u0027re doing this all for the love of writers. We love their stories, of course, but the real joy comes from giving great writers a chance to see their prose out in the wild digital yonder. With that joy comes a great desire to pay those writers what they deserve, and it has been one of our greatest regrets that we haven\u0027t been able to pay more than token rates so far.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u0027s where you come in. We know you love great writers and great stories as much as we do, and we know you would love to see those writers get their due. So, with your monthly subscription, you can help us pay authors more for their work. The goals on the side explain exactly how much we need to reach that stage, including the goal to pay $0.06/word, which is the industry standard for professional short fiction sales.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe want to emphasize that none of this money goes in the pockets of FV staff, only the writers we publish. We\u0027ve always put blood, sweat, tears, and (occasionally) our own money into this, and that won\u0027t change. Unless our generous subscribers donate in excess of $1 million, at which point we promise to abscond with the money at our earliest convenience and blow it all on Star Trek memorabilia and illegal sabacc gambling. Until such time, though, the money all goes to authors and (infrequent) site maintenance costs.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nGo check out some of\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.fictionvortex.com/tag/best-of-2014/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe amazing stories\u003c/a\u003e that have taken up residence on our site, and then subscribe here to help us pay awesome authors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat We Provide\u003c/h2\u003e\nWe publish a new short story every Tuesday, and publish book reviews and related articles on a monthly basis. All stories are available for free on our site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat You Get\u003c/h2\u003e\nThe satisfaction of knowing you helped an author feel awesome, as well as the intangible but not insignificant long-distance high five of said authors. We know, it sounds cheesy, but it\u0027s honestly why we\u0027re doing it and we know you want to support great authors and great stories, too.\u003cbr\u003e"

And the patron god of writers, the insecure, the depressed, and the mentally ill regarded Fiction Vortex in his magic mirror of self-loathing and declared it good, insofar as something that gives writer\u2019s undue hope can be declared good. Thereafter, he charged the Rear Admiral of the Galactic 5th Fleet to defend Fiction Vortex down to the last robot warrior.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow we\u2019re talking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake your pick.
