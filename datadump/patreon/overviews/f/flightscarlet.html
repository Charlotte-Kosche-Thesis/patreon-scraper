It was also the year I graduated from university to become a teacher.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI wrote about personal struggles, and then discovered the amazing community of bloggers that I had no idea existed. I started writing pretty much every day about anything and everything that came to mind. Soon I realized I was really passionate about gender equality, but felt kind of intimidated by it. So, I began to write solely about feminism, in an accessible and non-judgmental way, so that I could create a community of people who wanted to learn more but also felt a little too intimidated to ask questions.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe blog grew a bit, and I discovered the possibility to make money blogging. And I soon discovered that I really don\u0027t want to teach. Don\u0027t get me wrong \u2014 I LOVE teaching, I love working with kids, I have mad respect for teachers, and I am good at it. I just don\u0027t have the passion for teaching that you need to get through the crazy workload and the stress that comes with teaching.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I do have the passion to help others. (I mean, I did try to become a teacher!)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo as my blog grew, I realized that my story of really not feeling fulfilled by my job is something a lot of people relate to.\u00a0I zeroed in on my real focus: helping others take back their life.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI write to help millennial women be kickass heroes of their time, energy, and money in order to take back their life and work towards one they like, whether because they don\u0027t like their job, they got the wrong degree, they don\u0027t have a degree \n\u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e they hate their job, they\u0027ve been fired.... whatever it may be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy hope is that while I am learning and trying to take back my life by choosing to follow a dream I didn\u0027t exactly study for, I can use my teaching abilities to help others do the same while doing what I love: blogging and inspiring women!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe plan had been to be working full-time as a blogger last summer (2017), so that I could work during the summer months when there is no school (I currently work as a substitute teacher, so I have no work in the summer.) Then I could be set to only substitute when I feel like it or when I need/want some extra cash.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately, that didn\u0027t quite happen. I worked full-time, but didn\u0027t make full-time income.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNow, I don\u0027t want to give up. BUT I do have a problem.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy partner just got laid off, so now it\u0027s up to me to make up for that income loss for a few months. He\u0027s looking for a job, but it means that instead of working only 3 days a week at schools and 2 at home, I need to work at schools every day... so I lose a lot of time to work on the blog. In 2015-2016, before I took 2 days off from teaching per week, I used to work on it for 4 or 5 hours every day after work, but it resulted in anxiety and serious stress... it\u0027s not something I can go back to doing anymore.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been building an emergency fund for two years but then had to pull from it each summer, because I wanted to work on my blog instead of finding a job. Since I am the only employee, I don\u0027t need an office (or pretty much anything your average company needs) so it was reasonable to work the way I was, just pulling from savings and only hiring a little extra help, mostly tech support.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNot working full-time as a substitute by only doing 3 days a week was a sacrifice I was willing to make to get this blog going. But it\u0027s not something I can afford anymore.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s been such a great experience. I\u0027ve written over 200 posts, I have a wonderful, engaged audience, and I absolutely love doing it because the email replies and comments I get tell me I really am helping others.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo here\u0027s what I know from the past two and a half years of doing this:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e1. I want Flight \u0026amp; Scarlet to go on for a long time. \u003c/strong\u003eI started this for myself and it became just for fun, but now I know it\u0027s what I want to do. And it\u0027s working! People like what I have to say, so I have readers. I\u0027m helping people. I\u0027m still having so much fun \u2014 it\u0027s all what I want to do, all day, every day, so I don\u0027t want to give up.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e2. I need to make Flight \u0026amp; Scarlet self-sustaining by the end of 2018 if I want this to work. \u003c/strong\u003eThe plan of just using savings and working only 3 days a week as a substitute teacher was fine for a while, but it\u0027s not sustainable. I have pretty much no savings, especially since now I\u0027m going to have to use it because my partner is being laid off. If F\u0026amp;S is going to last, it needs to start supporting itself this year, because otherwise I\u0027m losing a lot of time and I could be using it for another job... and like I\u0027ve explained, I\u0027m pretty desperate right now. If F\u0026amp;S doesn\u0027t start generating good income by the end of the year, I\u0027m going to have to leave it.... as much as that breaks my heart. :(\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s what my income plan is for now:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n1. The Flight \u0026amp; Scarlet Shop\u003c/strong\u003e. I just launched it this week (January 11th), and having products I\u0027ve created and which I know are perfect for my readers is, I think, the BEST way to try and bring income. I don\u0027t have much in the shop right now, but it\u0027s enough to just do the job on its own for now. My hope is it will bring it at least some extra income over the next few months.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n2. Virtual assistant work.\u003c/strong\u003e I currently work with a few fellow bloggers and product creators and provide them with services like graphic design and proofreading. That brings in just barely enough to cover business expenses each month. The problem with this is it varies each month: last year I only had two months where it covered ALL expenses. Most of the time it\u0027ll cover about half. Which is great, but not enough.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n3. Sharing products and services I already use.\u003c/strong\u003e There are some products I absolutely love to use to help me manage my time, energy, and money, and some of them have affiliate programs where I can make a small commission if people sign up for them as well. I never recommend anything I don\u0027t use myself, and so far people have liked hearing what I use personally. This does bring in some income, but again, it\u0027s hardly anything. And usually these programs don\u0027t pay until you\u0027ve hit a certain amount, and I haven\u0027t reached that amount yet on any. (But hopefully soon.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n4.\u00a0Ads.\u003c/strong\u003e I know, they suck, but I don\u0027t have too many. I thought about removing them, but I don\u0027t think I can until later in the game. I promise you I will never overwhelm the site with them. They are definitely not my main income source. They don\u0027t bring me a ton of money at the low traffic level I\u0027m at right now, but it\u0027ll only go up. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nThe way Patreon works is a reader can contribute whatever they want per month and the contribution is recurring each month after that\u003c/strong\u003e. So anything, from $1/month up, is really amazing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027ll Use the Money For\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy stretch goal is $2,000/month. That money plus the virtual assistant income, plus substituting, will be enough to keep Flight \u0026amp; Scarlet going, indefinitely. Here are my business costs:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHosting. \u003c/strong\u003eI need a solid enough hosting plan to support the the traffic I get so I don\u0027t crash during spikes, especially because I\u0027m trying to grow.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eConvertKit.\u003c/strong\u003e The service I use to email newsletters to subscribers.
