Now I\u0027ve changed how I do things and folded all of my shows under the umbrella of \u003cstrong\u003eThe Fortress of Baileytude Podcasting Network\u003c/strong\u003e!\u00a0 All of my current shows (which include \u003cstrong\u003eThe Overlooked Dark Knight\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eIt All Comes Back To Superman\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eFrom Crisis to Crisis: A Superman Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e, the occasional \u003cstrong\u003eFortress of Baileytude Showcase Presents\u003c/strong\u003e and the even more occasional \u003cstrong\u003eViews From The Longbox\u003c/strong\u003e) can be found at the Fortress of Baileytude main page for convenience and to keep me from having to jump from site to site to update them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make paying for things like equipment (computers, microphones and other things that I never thought would wear out like my office chair) I have this Patreon in case you wanted to support my efforts. This is totally not a hard sell and I am not using this money to live the high life. It\u0027s simply to help me with the costs of producing the shows. To sweeten the pot I\u0027ve broken the rewards down thusly:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTier One: \u00a0I Like Mike \u00a0Cost: $1 a month\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the most basic but it is more than appreciated. \u00a0This tier gets your name on the list of patrons at The Fortress and my eternal thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTier Two: I Really Like Mike \u00a0Cost: $5 a month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis tier gets your name up over at the main page plus the monthly Patreon Only podcast \u003cstrong\u003eFortress Commentaries\u003c/strong\u003e. On the second Friday of every month you will receive a link to download a commentary I\u0027ve recorded for something comic book related.\u00a0 To start things off I will be going through every episode of \u003cstrong\u003eSUPERMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTier Three: I Really, Really Like Mike \u00a0Cost: $10 a month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis tier gets your name listed over at the \u003cstrong\u003eFortress\u003c/strong\u003e, the \u003cstrong\u003eFortress Commentaries\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon-Only podcast plus another show called \u003cstrong\u003eBailey\u0027s Bookshelf\u003c/strong\u003e. This will sent to you on the last Friday of the month and consists of an overview of one of the many trade paperbacks, hardcovers or Omnibuses I currently own. I did something similar years ago over on the Superman Homepage monthly podcast but this will be longer and more involved. It won\u0027t be a simple story overview. Oh no. I will dig into the collection and talk about the cover, the contents, the format and everything. Also Patrons at this level will get to choose the books I talk about!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTier Four: I Freaking Love Mike \u00a0Cost: $20 a month\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo you get your name on all of the sites, access to \u003cstrong\u003eFortress Commentaries\u003c/strong\u003e, access to \u003cstrong\u003eBailey\u0027s Bookshelf\u003c/strong\u003e and your name will be read at the top of every episode of \u003cstrong\u003eIt All Comes Back To Superman\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eViews\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eFortress of Baileytude Showcase Presents\u003c/strong\u003e as part of a, \"This episode of \u003cstrong\u003e(insert podcast name here)\u003c/strong\u003e is brought to you by (fill in names here),\" stinger at the beginning of the episode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, there is no pressure in how much to give.
