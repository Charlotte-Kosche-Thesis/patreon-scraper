    "summary": "At the top of every episode, we say that \u201cFriends at the Table is an Actual Play podcast about critical worldbuilding, smart characterization, and fun interaction between good friends.\u201d But what\u2019s that mean, and why do we need your help to do it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, just about every week for the last three years, we\u2019ve been using tabletop roleplaying games to tell the sorts of stories that we wanted to see in the world. Over 120 episodes, we\u2019ve explored a fantasy post-post-apocalypse, fought over (and against) the stars, and uncovered the heartbreaking truth behind a war of the gods.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve done all of this in our limited free time and with whatever spare change we can scrape together to buy recording and producing equipment, pay for instrument repairs, renew web services, and purchase RPG books. A lot of you know this, and for a long time, you\u2019ve been asking us for a way to support us in doing this. Now you can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd the thing is, we don\u2019t just want to keep doing what we\u2019ve already done: We want to do all of it better, and we want to do even more. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve figured out a ton of stuff we\u2019d love to do if you want to help us do it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find out more about what our major stretch goals are over to the right, but I wanted to lay out some of the bigger ones in detail below:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonthly Clapcasts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eA lot of you have told us that you miss the much looser vibe of the first season. Well, once a month, every Patreon subscriber will get access to a special \u201cclapcast\u201d that includes some of our pre- and post-recording banter, any long digressions that need to be cut from the episodes, and yes, of course, our claps. Maybe you\u2019ll be able to tell if we\u2019re getting any better at them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTips at the Table\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eOnce we hit our $3,000 stretch goal, we\u2019re going to be launching another bonus podcast: Tips at the Table, a monthly show that answers your questions about playing and running tabletop games! Some of our favorite interactions with you have been answering questions about how we prepare for and play the game, and we want to expand this into something where you can ask us even more specific questions. Let us help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cSeason 4\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eDuring the post-mortem for COUNTER/Weight, Austin mentioned that the next Friends at the Table season was going to be inspired by Bruce Springsteen. Well, in the time since then, that idea has blossomed into something much bigger than a single \u201cseason.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eWelcome to Bluff City: A seaside casino town lost in time, where amateur wrestlers dream of making it big and leaving the city behind; where a drama club puts on one last play before leaving for college; where a group of taggers and skaters get into a summer-long prank war with casino security; where small time crooks go on \u201cone last heist\u201d before leaving this rotten city for good; where a group of amateur detectives discovers that there may be some truth to the supernatural myths of this little corner of the mid-Atlantic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eBluff City is a new setting that we want to explore and build out month by month across numerous games and characters who all share the same world and setting. We\u2019ve always wanted to tell stories in a modern-ish setting, and now we\u2019ve figured out where to do it. Think \u201cBorn to Run\u201d meets \u201cDark City\u201d meets \u201cThe Wrestler\u201d meets \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d meets \u201cFargo\u201d meets\u2026 okay, these are a lot of really dope things to be inspired by, I know, but we are very excited about possibly doing this show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonthly One Shot Live Stream\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eLong time listeners of the show know that we\u2019ve bounced between tons of different game systems\u2014we\u2019ve even used ones that members of the crew have developed ourselves! We love trying out new stuff, and as fans, you\u2019ve often sent us games to see if we\u2019d consider playing them. Now, there\u2019s really a way to make that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eIf you really dig deep and raise $10,000 a month, we\u2019ll be able to dedicate the time needed to do a monthly, subscriber-only one shot live stream. And on top of that, subscribers will vote on what the game we play is! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThere\u2019s even more, which you can check out over in our Goals section to the right.

Your kindness, curiosity, and excitement has kept us going over three years, and we can\u2019t wait to do even more with you in the future!\u003cbr\u003e"
