In my mid teens, I became a victim of sexual assault which has since left me with a Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Which basically means that I worry about things a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e more than most people do. To the point where it can make living life kinda hard and really stressful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to make a comic about my experiences and the healing process I\u0027ve been going through from my trauma, but I didn\u0027t want to make it an autobiography- that\u0027d just be too sad to work on! I wanted to make something to express myself, but have an adventure while doing so. I also wanted to give others who\u0027d gone through similar experiences characters that they could relate to, but a story that would offer them a much needed escape. Thus- FriendQuest was born!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is your comic about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFriendQuest is set in a fantasy world where reality has collapsed, and as the inhabitants of earth are flung into the void their dreamscapes take hold! Everyone has their own new world to explore, filled with their hopes and fears, and characters that they\u0027ve created.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt takes place from the point of view of my character- Kenzie, her ghostly companion Gaiihl, and a host of other friends as they learn to use their new powers and abilities, and journey off into their new world to find Kenzie\u0027s family and discover what this new reality has to offer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGenerally, FriendQuest revolves around themes of friendship and support, and discovering things about yourself that you thought you couldn\u0027t do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you have any other Comics?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from fancomics?
