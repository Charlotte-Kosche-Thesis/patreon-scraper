    "summary": "Hi everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve decided to finally sign up for Patreon after talking it over for about a year, and after many loyal listeners and friends told us that they would support us if we did... so here we are!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, the Forever Midnight Podcast will always be free. We will never charge listeners for regular episodes and everyone will still be able to listen to our show for free at our website (ForeverMidnight.net), on iTunes, Stitcher and the new Bloody Disgusting Mobile App. We have been making the podcast, as well as building the horror merch side of Forever Midnight for a few years now, and it has been one of the most rewarding things any of us have ever been a part of. We love to entertain and create, and we love horror movies! This past year has been monumental with the opening of our Scary Movie Research Center in Santa Rosa - a small space that serves as our recording studio, clubhouse and weekly pop-up-shop. However, at the end of the day, everything we do, we do for free and out of our own pockets. We strive to record and release a consistent, steady stream of Forever Midnight episodes, and we have so many wild and exciting ideas for new limited horror merch! If anything is holding us back, it\u0027s the lack of capital to act on our ideas quickly, and the lack of time to create episodes of the podcast as frequently as we\u0027d like to. We (like all of you) work multiple jobs to make ends meet, and since we currently have to treat Forever Midnight as our elaborate, collective hobby, our time to dedicate to the show becomes limited. We hope that through Patreon, if listeners who enjoy the show and the stuff we\u0027re making are willing to pitch in a little bit and give what they can, we will be able to dedicate more time and energy to make Forever Midnight the creative monster it wants to be!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace, Love and Scary Movies - Jef, Josh and Brian"

We appreciate each and every one of you helping to support us here on Patreon. Right now we are looking to reach this goal to keep the rent paid on our studio as well as the Electric bill too, so we can still give you free regular episodes and extra special Patreon only episodes. With your help we hope to reach this goal and hopefully surpass it so we can do even more fun stuff like attending other conventions out of state and making more fun horror merchandise. We thank you all from the bottom of our hearts. PEACE, LOVE \u0026amp; SCARY MOVIES!",
