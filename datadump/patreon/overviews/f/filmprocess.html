    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eHey there filmmaking friends. Robert Hardy here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to the Filmmaker\u0027s Process Patreon page\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust in case you\u0027re unfamiliar with Patreon, it\u0027s kinda like Kickstarter but for ongoing creative projects. It\u0027s a way for fans to show continuing support for the creators and artists they dig. Plus, like Kickstarter, you can give away some cool rewards, which I totally am (take a look over there on the right).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyhow, the reason we\u0027re here is that I want to build Filmmaker\u0027s Process in a way that\u0027s 100% focused on providing value to you, not random companies. So through this campaign, hopefully we\u0027ll be able to rid this site of advertising and sponsorships and affiliate marketing and all that tacky stuff. \u00a0But I need your help to make that possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDown below you\u0027ll find a quick rundown of why I think Filmmaker\u0027s Process is worth supporting. I\u0027ll show you why it isn\u0027t like all the other filmmaking sites, what I plan on doing with the site in the future (it\u0027s pretty ambitious and cool), and why I need your help to make it all happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if any of this resonates with your own philosophy about filmmaking, or you just want to support a site that shares great content and ditches advertising, please consider chipping a few bucks. It\u0027d mean the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhy Filmmaker\u0027s Process Is Different\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u2019t talk about gear. Ever.\u003c/strong\u003e Having the right tools and knowing how to use them is an essential part of making films, but there are plenty of sites covering every new camera, lens, shoulder rig, light, or microphone that hits the market. Instead, Filmmaker\u2019s Process is all about a different approach\u2026\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI focus on teaching people how to make films they genuinely care about.\u003c/strong\u003eThere\u2019s a lot to be said for making projects with broad appeal in the marketplace, but I believe the strongest films (and the ones that ultimately find their home with a particular audience) are the ones made by people who have something unique to say and the courage to actually say it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have an intense focus on mindset and philosophy.\u003c/strong\u003e Whereas many other sites are deeply technical and craft-driven (again, this kind of stuff is very useful), Filmmaker\u2019s Process is about getting your mindset right so that you can tackle your projects confidently and overcome obstacles creatively. And as far as I know, I\u2019m the only person who\u2019s consistently talking about not just making films, but how to live a good, fulfilled life as a filmmaker.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe micro-budget/no-budget approach is the one that appeals to me the most.\u003c/strong\u003e Based on all of those previous points, this probably doesn\u2019t come as a shocker. The more money that\u2019s spent on a film, the more it has to be crafted to appeal to a generic mass audience. Yet with inexpensive digital production and distribution technology, people from all walks of life now have the ability to make and share films on their own terms. And this enables some much-needed diversity in the types of stories being told, helping to reach under-served audiences. So this site is about the new wave of completely democratized low-budget filmmaking, done by the people, for the people. For that reason\u2026\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u2019t cover massive Hollywood filmmakers.\u003c/strong\u003e Sure, Christopher Nolan and Quentin Tarantino and the Coen Brothers are great, but they\u2019re playing a different game entirely. I believe the best way for truly independent filmmakers to learn the craft is to hear it directly from other indies. I even have an \u003ca href=\"http://www.filmmakersprocess.com/submit\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eopen submissions process\u003c/a\u003e so that any filmmaker, regardless of experience, age, or nationality, can share their filmmaking experience with our audience and promote their work.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u2019t have any ads on the site. \u003c/strong\u003eI don\u2019t know a single person who likes web ads. Across the board, they make the experience of consuming content worse. So I don\u2019t have them and never will.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u2019t peddle clickbait, cheap listicles, or articles that just summarize a YouTube video.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u2019ve been guilty of writing like this in the past (especially during my No Film School days), and a few early articles on this site walked that line a little too closely, but no longer. Instead, all of the articles published on Filmmaker\u2019s Process are substantive and well thought out. And they\u2019ll never be given a hyperbolic or misleading headline. I pinky promise.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat Filmmaker\u0027s Process Creates Now\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn-depth articles about the filmmaking process, creativity, and mindset. \u003c/strong\u003eMy\u00a0content is designed to help filmmakers not only tackle the process, but tackle obstacles more creatively, make more informed and intentional aesthetic decisions, and create work that leads to more fulfilled lives.

Then there\u0027s the 31 Days to Better Filmmaking Challenge, a book about the entire philosophy of Filmmaker\u0027s Process, and a course that helps more creative filmmakers become producers (ie. become logistical ninjas and actually get films made instead of just talking about it).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in any of these projects, or any of the ones I\u0027ll create in the future, any patronage level of $5 and above gets you some steep discounts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhy Filmmaker\u0027s Process Needs Your Help\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRunning a website and producing high-quality content costs a considerable amount (both in money and the time invested into it) every single month.

Don\u0027t worry though. My lifestyle is pretty sparse and inexpensive (I\u0027m a young guy in a 350 sq ft. apartment in a cheap city).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eBuilding the Next Version of Filmmaker\u0027s Process:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027ve got some big plans for Filmmaker\u0027s Process (which you can read about above), and I\u0027m already starting to work with a talented web designer and developer to make the next version of the site far more beautiful, useful, and most importantly, community-focused.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s the pitch.
