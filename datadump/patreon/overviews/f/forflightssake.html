    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eFlying is one of the sweetest things that life has to offer and I\u0027m here to share my experiences and inspire others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far back as I can remember. Possibly 4 or 5 years old, I\u2019ve enjoyed watching airplanes fly overhead as they flew into Los Angeles International Airport. The speed and sound of them always fascinated me. Also having an interest in fans and how they turned intrigued me as well. \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first flight took place when I was 8 years old. It was on a Delta MD-11. During that flight instead of being afraid I was hooked. At school I couldn\u2019t stop talking about airplanes nor watching them fly overhead. Even my friends knew that someday I would be flying for a living because I wouldn\u0027t stop talking about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cdiv\u003eThat changed around 9/11/2001. The aviation industry changed drastically and flying just did not seem like much of a pleasure anymore. But it was still in the back of my head. One day before I graduated high school I was able to take a field trip to the Compton airport. There I was taken up on a helicopter flight for about 15 minutes. Once we landed I once again realized that my childhood dream could still become a reality and that I shouldn\u0027t give up. Although it was a helicopter flight, it re-energized my ambition for learning to fly airplanes.\u00a0I was the only person from my class to come back to the Compton airport on a regular basis after school in order to work and earn my pilot license. It was a rough two-year journey but I got it done. This was only the beginning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003cdiv\u003eMy YouTube channel was started in 2012 with an entirely different purpose. I wanted to make short cinematic action movies. Although I still want to pursue that someday I currently spend my YouTube time making educational and funny aviation videos. Little did I know that so many people would respond so positively and appreciate what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cdiv\u003eCurrently I desire to be the person that I wish I knew back when I started flying. I wish to inspire people to go out and learn how to fly because having a pilot license is one of the greatest things in the world. The freedom of flying is something that not much else can top.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever with all of the expenses that comes with film making it gets very challenging to do this on a regular basis. Better camera gear, editing software, faster computers are just some of the things that are necessary to make videos. I wish to improve the quality of my videos and be able to produce them more frequently with faster equipment. Eventually I would love to develop a team.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cdiv\u003eBy pledging to the \u201cFor Flights Sake\u201c channel, you are enabling me to continue making more content for young inspiring viewers to show them the lifestyle and journey of a pilot. I believe that it will encourage them to do the same. Pay it forward.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
