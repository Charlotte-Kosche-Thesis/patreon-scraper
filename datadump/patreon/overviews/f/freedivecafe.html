Long-form interviews with some of the deepest humans on Earth get into the backstories, the training, the challenges, the passions and fears and personal philosophies of the world\u0027s freedivers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI built the Freedive Caf\u00e9 because I love podcast interviews, I love freediving, and nothing existed yet that brought the two together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn June of 2017 I compiled a list of almost 100 top freedivers and freediving personalities and sent out the call to action. The response I received was overwhelming! Within a week, I had enough guests signing up to do the podcast for a whole year! So the Freedive Caf\u00e9 is here to stay, and I sincerely hope a community will grow up around it that loves freediving as much as I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Freedive Caf\u00e9 is a labour of love. I work a full-time teaching job among other responsibilities on top of keeping the caf\u00e9 open.The interviews are recorded and edited on the most basic equipment, and a tremendous amount of time is invested in putting together just one episode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy sponsoring the podcast, you will enable me to improve the quality of the podcast, and focus my attention more on creating great freediving content. \u003cbr\u003eUPDATE: Not only that, but I have recently found a physical location in a great diving spot I am going to rent with my friends and create a little school. Patreon pledges at this moment basically cover the rent for this place! Words cannot express enough how grateful I am that The Freedive Caf\u00e9 provides so much value to it\u0027s listeners...let\u0027s dive!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you value the podcast enough to help me on this journey? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
