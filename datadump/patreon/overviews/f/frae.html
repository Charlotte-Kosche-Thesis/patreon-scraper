I HOPE I CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE WORK FOR YOU THAT YOU ENJOY!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Jeffrey Duvall also known as Frae. Ever since middle school, I dreamed of making comics and cartoons for a living. I had a passion for story telling and developed many stories while I was younger. Through the encouragement of my friends and family, I went to college to study graphic design. I wanted to improve my skill and build a company where I could provide wonderful stories with artwork that would appeal to many more people. I focused my art style to look closer to manga/anime because I had grown a great interest in Japanese culture. Yes, I am definitely an Otaku! I will debate you to why Death Note and Dragon Ball Z are the greatest animes of all time and I average at least 4 conventions every year; even dressing in a kimono!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027m not at my 9-5, I\u0027m working hard providing numerous content around the net including comics and animated videos. Even though I will continue to offer plenty of free content in the future, that 9-5 job is doing a serious Kamehameha to my production time!\u00a0This is where you, the wonderful patrons come in! I want to up the skits, comic pages, and overall content to turn this into a full time service for you all. I want to return that Kamehameha with my own special attack and finally make my passion for creating a full time reality! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what is patreon anyway? Well, it\u0027s similar to a kickstarter only you give a certain amount on a month to month basis for all the content I provide including comic pages, videos, and anything else that I unleash creatively to you all. There are also some wonderful perks to this! I will return your contributions with things such as chats directly with me, behind the scenes videos, bonus exclusive comic pages to expand the stories, exclusive character art and bios,  you see it first videos, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uJZEk0L2_LE\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003eTHANKS IN ADVANCE FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I had a passion for story telling and developed many stories while I was younger. I can remember the days when I took copy paper and drew single issue comics to sell for 50 cents. Through the encouragement of my friends and family, I went to college to study graphic design. I wanted to improve my skill and build a company where I could provide wonderful stories with artwork that would appeal to many more people. I focused my art style to look closer to manga/anime because I had grown a great interest in Japanese culture especially after watching shows like Dragon Ball Z, Outlaw Star, and Sailor Moon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I\u0027ve been working hard with my friends to build our company, Moderately Subliminal. Our goal is to take our work beyond just comics and expand into more media such as animated shorts, skits, podcasts, and more media. I always felt that my fans deserved access to my work and to talk to me personally. I do sell physical copies of my work, but most of my work is free and can be found on my website.\u00a0http://fraescanvas.squarespace.com/",
