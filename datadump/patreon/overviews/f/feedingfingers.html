    "summary": "Hello,\u003cbr\u003eJustin Curfman here. I am the frontman for Feeding Fingers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI simply want to devote my life full-time without distraction to writing, recording and releasing new music, producing concert tours more consistently, making music videos more often and to share it all with you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you are a long-time Feeding Fingers listener or a new fan that we just met during our 3rd concert tour of the USA and Europe that we just completed, we want to say \"thank you\" for being there during these 12 years and 6 albums. We could not have done any of this without you. So, let\u0027s keep doing it. It starts here with your help via Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI compose, perform and engineer all of the music that you hear on all of the Feeding Fingers releases myself - with a few minor exceptions from some of the more exotic Oriental instruments (erhu, pipa, etc.) heard on the triple vinyl album, \u0027Attend\u0027 (2016). I am also the booking manager, PR manager, logistical supervisor and more for this project. This leaves me with very little to no time at all to devote to much anything else other than administration and wondering where my next meal will come from. I would rather spend my time writing and playing concerts for YOU.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are the 3 things that I want to do right now:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBegin work on the 7th Feeding Fingers album in May, 2018 in various locations around the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. This means that I will need software and hardware updates and upgrades, gear and instrument upgrades and maintenance, purchases and rentals, ability to pay collaborative artists for their contributions and most of all, time to study, think and write without interruption. I will not give away too many details about what I have in mind for the next album, but for those of you who have been following this project at least since 2013 or so, you should expect that I will be working with a whole new set of timbres and compositional approaches. I will be sharing the progress of the album with all of you patrons right here on Patreon.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eStart pre-production, booking and promotion for a series of solo acoustic / electronic concerts that I would like to play. I will show you what I have in mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBegin organizing for the next proper Feeding Fingers concert tour. Yes... already. These things are done 6 to 12 months in advance. It\u0027s a lot of work. We can do it together.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for listening and supporting this project through the years and thank you for helping me to make it possible to devote my life full-time to my craft. Let\u00b4s keep moving and see where we can go from here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest Wishes,\u003cbr\u003eJustin\u003cbr\u003eFeeding Fingers\u003cbr\u003e"
