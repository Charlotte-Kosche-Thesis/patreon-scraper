The studio was set-up to produce high quality and ambitious independent PC games with quality storytelling, creative gameplay, and intelligent design, whilst remaining true to the principles of transparency and honesty. We are currently working on our flagship title, \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDark Storm: Ascension\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, which we hope to release by the end of 2016. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is Fenrir Studios on Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince beginning work on \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDark Storm: Ascension\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e in 2012 we have made tremendous progress on the game. A great number of assets, character designs, and levels have already been created with Epic\u0027s Unreal Engine 4, and we have a dedicated crew of artists, audio designers, level designers, and other creative talents donating their time and energy to see the game completed. We have also already released a stand-alone test module entitled \u003cem\u003eDark Storm: VR Missions\u003c/em\u003e on Steam Early Access, designed to garner feedback from gamers and improve the final \u003cem\u003eDark Storm: Ascension\u003c/em\u003e build. Whilst as a team we have already achieved so much, in order to fulfil all our aims and ambitions for the Dark Storm project we require one final financial boost. This is why we need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery pledge to support \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDark Storm: Ascension\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e will help us immensely in the final development stages of the game. We have a number of goals that we\u0027re pushing towards in order to make this game as good as it can be. These include paying more team members so they can spend more time working on the game,\u00a0improving our motion capture equipment,\u00a0and increasing our marketing budget to ensure wider coverage of the game upon release.\u00a0In independent game development every little really does help, and everyone at Fenrir Studios would be very grateful for any assistance you can provide. The last four years have been a real journey for us; starting out as indie game novices with an excitingly complex dream and travelling to the cusp of that dream being realised. We would be delighted for you to join us on the final steps of our journey. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo What is Dark Storm: Ascension? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDark Storm: Ascension\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a single-player stealth/action title inspired by classic games such as \u003cem\u003eMetal Gear Solid\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eDeus Ex\u003c/em\u003e where you can be as covert or as gung-ho as you desire. You play the role of Amber Kingsley, a former Army Special Forces soldier that was dishonorably discharged after a failed mission in North Korea which resulted in the deaths of several members of her squad. Now riddled with guilt, Amber has joined Ancile, a private military corporation charged with protecting the Irving Apex Research Facility in Alaska. Hoping to recover from past ordeals and find a new purpose in life, she is reluctantly forced back into action when the base is assaulted by an unknown enemy. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eGame Features \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSingle Player Campaign\u003c/strong\u003e - The core of the game is its lengthy campaign, in which the player has freedom to choose their preferred play-style, be it stealth, action, or something in between.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrue First-Person\u003c/strong\u003e - The game features an immersive first-person perspective that pulls you into the action in a believable way.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDynamic Third-Person Camera\u003c/strong\u003e - If first-person isn\u2019t your thing then you can also experience Dark Storm in an equally immersive third-person perspective, featuring a shoulder-switching camera.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePowered by Unreal Engine 4\u003c/strong\u003e - Need we say more?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Cover System\u003c/strong\u003e - For those \u0027oh s#*% better get down\u0027 moments.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFull Voice-Over\u003c/strong\u003e - Featuring professional voice acting for cutscenes, AI and characters to create an immersive experience within the Dark Storm world.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBecause we want \u003cem\u003eDark Storm: Ascension\u003c/em\u003e to go above and beyond what other indie games aim for we are also working on these other exciting features: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDynamic A.I.\u003c/strong\u003e - Play how you want and the AI will match it.
