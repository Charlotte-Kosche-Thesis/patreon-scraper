The challenges we\u0027re most interested are climate change, disruptive technology, and economic and social justice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur episodes often come in the form of (i) interviews with smart/interesting people (ii) critical takes on pop culture presentations of important issues, (iii) \"deep dives\" on issues we think are important, (iv) \"shoot-the-shit\" episodes in which we discuss a recent grab bag of news that we haven\u0027t gotten a chance to mention yet, or (v) some combination of the above.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast is currently hosted by Adam Simpson and Casey Rogers.
