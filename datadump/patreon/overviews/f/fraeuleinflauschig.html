    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Fr\u00e4ulein Flauschig - a burlesque performer from Stuttgart, Germany who loves to create new costumes, acts and shows. I\u0027m not only performing burlesque - i\u0027m also producing my own burlesque show called Man\u00e8ge Rustique and Stuttgart Burlesque Festival. This year I\u0027ll also start with a completely new show called Mausefalle.\u003cbr\u003eWith my shows i create a constantly cultural exchange with performers from all over Europe.\u003cbr\u003eI also try to travel as often as possible with my acts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you need to know about burlesque:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBurlesque is the game with expectations and the secret wishes of the audience. The magic of eroticism paired with the art of acting and dancing. The artists enter into roles that enchant and give shape to secret nightly desires and dreams. Burlesque is not simply a striptease, but a performing art, in which the artist skillfully puts herself in the limelight.\u003cbr\u003eFr\u00e4ulein Flauschig does exactly that \u2013 she is fluffy and gentle like a purring kitten, while she expands her claws in the next moment. In Stuttgart, Fr\u00e4ulein Flauschig has long been a concept and the fans are willing to travel a long way to visit her burlesque shows. The Burlesque artist has a rich reportoire \u2013 whether as a forest nymph in pointe shoes, as a Greek goddess between purity and secular lust, or as Miss Shabby. The ironic handling about herself and the \u0027\u0027innocence of the country\u0027\u0027 coupled with the glamor of Paris and New York.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you need to know about Fr\u00e4ulein Flauschig:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is rumored that she was the illegitiate child of a Nordic deity and a dwarf girl. Nobody really knows if it was Loki or Odin. Everyone was very drunk. Thus she was rejected by both folks and had to get through life by herself. When she was little, she had a successful career as a \u0027Schoolrowdy\u0027. She beat up everyone she didn\u0027t like and stole their lunch boxes and pocket money. With this attitude, she was not allowed to go to the \u0027\u0027secondary school for charming young ladies\u0027\u0027 and was henceforth excluded from all social events. So she was banished again from her usual environment. Lonely and deserted she traveled through the country and decided to leave her criminal past behind. She changed her last name and decided to give the artistry a chance and from then on painting, dancing and singing were a big part of her life (that still does not work so well though).\u003cbr\u003eLadies and Gentlemen, here she is: The Dwarven Goddess, Bare Knuckle Champion, Homewrecker: Fr\u00e4ulein Flauschig.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you need to know about Man\u00e8ge Rustique:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMan\u00e8ge Rustique is a burlesque show with a unique concept in germany.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe serve substantial jokes, unsuitable songs at the right time, lots of naked skin, nonsense and odds and ends. We are more \u0027\u0027Peaky Blinders\u0027\u0027 than \u0027\u0027Broadwalk Empire\u0027\u0027 for those who like senseless comparisons. Gin, Korn \u0026amp; Beer are on the menue, and so are our bad guys and dubious girls on the stage: Honest, direct and the audience can\u0027t get enough. They let us forget the big world full of softies outisde from here, like the opium caves of Fu Manchu. Only with fewer side effects. Come to the dark side, sailor. Enjoy life today, pay tomorrow. But despite all these jokes and horrors, we do not want to forget that these performances contain a lot of serious and practical information. Firstly, women must always complain. Second, that chinese are brilliant, but evil. And third that Laudanum enjoyed in a moderate dose sharpens the view and prevents kidney stones. Because of these reasons we\u0027d like to offer everyone funny hours of entertainment on stage but in return we are allowed to expect an open purse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
