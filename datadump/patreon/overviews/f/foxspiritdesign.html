Living in the woodlands of Montana with the wilderness at my doorstep, the rhythms of seasonal changes are ever in my awareness, and my art is heavily influenced by mythological traditions from around the world. Whether working on paper or skin, I enjoy the tactile intimacy of low-impact tools that allow me to work closely on the precise details. Each one-of-a-kind piece I create is meant to be a coded mnemonic, a reminder of the story embedded within its tiniest details: if a picture is worth a thousand words, then narrative art is layering each of those thousand words into the details of a single image. If something speaks to your curiosity, please listen, and take a closer look.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA platform like Patreon allows a group of people (like you) to crowdfund, or collectively pay a salary to, an artist whose artistic journey you\u0027ve taken an interest in (like me). This frees up more of my time for producing new work by giving me an income I can rely on instead of worrying about how to pay my rent and replenish my art supplies, so the more patronage I have, the more new artwork you get to enjoy from me - making it a win-win situation for all of us! \u003cbr\u003ePatreon charges a small fee for handling the transactions and running the site, but they don\u0027t have any say in what kind of work I do or what I choose to publish, which means \u003cstrong\u003ethe only people influencing what I decide to spend my studio time making are me, which seems fair, and you, the patrons\u003c/strong\u003e who enjoy my work enough to put your own hard-earned dollars toward ensuring there\u0027s more of it to go around. It also allows me to exist within a network of other artists and creators, and I believe building that kind of mutually empowering community is essential to success in life and art alike. \u003cbr\u003eAs a fun incentive to participate here on Patreon, I offer various rewards for different pledge levels, such as downloadable colouring pages or extra behind-the-scenes content so that you get a little something back as a token of how much I appreciate your patronage! \u003cbr\u003eCheck out \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/foxspiritdesign/posts?public=true\"\u003ethe public posts here\u003c/a\u003e to get an idea of the sort of content I share on this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNot seeing what you were hoping for, but still want to support my work somehow?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.foxspiritdesign.com\"\u003eMy website\u003c/a\u003e \nhas collections of my work as well as information about who I am, my \nartistic process, and current and future events, and is a great place to\n get started if we\u0027re just getting acquainted or you\u0027re looking for \nsomething particular.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can purchase my work directly; contact me with inquiries: \u003ca href=\"mailto:foxspiritdesign@gmail.com\"\u003efoxspiritdesign@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake a one-time donation to \u003ca href=\"http://ko-fi.com/foxspiritdesign\"\u003emy account on Ko-Fi\u003c/a\u003e,\n which is basically an online tip-jar, in the amount you choose, with my\n gratitude.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.foxspiritdesign.com/connect\"\u003eJoin my free email list\u003c/a\u003e for monthly studio updates on what I\u0027m doing and where to find my work currently.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOr, simply follow me on social media (@foxspiritdesign on \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/foxspiritdesign\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/foxspiritdesign\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e), and \u003cstrong\u003eshare my art with your friends\u003c/strong\u003e to support me without spending a dollar!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.foxspiritdesign.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArt is a communal effort, so whether you\u0027ve watched me grow from a \ntiny scribbling sprout or are seeing my work for the first time, thank you \nfor the part you\u0027re playing in making mine.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re still interested in joining my community of direct patrons, keep reading for more information about how it works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT KIND OF CONTENT CAN WE EXPECT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on the level of your pledge, there are a few options.
