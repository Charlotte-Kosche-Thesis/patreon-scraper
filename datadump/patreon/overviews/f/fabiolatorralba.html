     "about": "I am a cultural worker and dance maker. I was born in Acapulco, Guerrero and was raised in the U.S. as an undocumented immigrant. My identity is always shifting. My way of understanding the world is through the experiences of others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithin our family, we didnt acknowledge our undocumented status. I learned to be scared and to remain silent. I fight these fears everyday. Art making and social activism has been my way of finding a voice. I am still finding this voice.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a young girl, I did not know anyone who was like me. So I learned to relate to the experiences of other marginalized communities. I developed an affinity to the experience of African Americans and to the Black experience. Later, I began to question my privileged as a U.S. based person. Especially, once I obtained documentation status and as I advanced in my academic studies. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe worlds that I now have access to are very different from where I come from. They are very different from who I am. I fight to stay grounded. As a result of this, I resist writing. I am terrified of documentation. I am terrified of being known.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to continue to hold myself accountable. I want to be a better non-technical writer so that I remain accessible and honest to \"those who cannot out\". I want to learn to be more honest. So, I invite you to be part of this journey where I will embark on a month long venture back to the motherland. I will be traveling through the Costa Chica towards the border of Mexico and Chiapas. My research will be on Afro-Mestizo identity and Black diasporic migrant identities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI seek a reading audience. I seek feedback and critique. Most of all, I seek your support as this will be a very emotionally difficult journey. I am still learning. I plan to share some of my personal writings from this fieldwork. I hope that you will be inspired to invest in this study. The proceeds of this initiative will be used to reinvest in the communities that I encounter. Please join me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLearn more about my previous work at:\u00a0https://fabiolatorralba.wordpress.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
