This is what I\u0027m good at and what I\u0027ve been formally trained in (although formal training should not be a prerequisite for being an artist or being able to call oneself an artist). Ultimately, I would like to do this for a living, or, for starters, half a living, but for now... I\u0027m just looking to keep myself as healthy as possible and as alive as possible, perhaps in spite of the wishes of half of the American electorate...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of late, I have been focusing very heavily on analog game design: mostly in the tabletop role-playing\u00a0and storytelling space. While I will still continue to make, well, whatever the heck I feel like making at any given moment, including digital games, podcasts, articles, and visual art, analog game design is currently what gets me out of bed in the morning, and a large portion of my upcoming output is probably going to be in that vein.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlay\u00a0and Read My Stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYou can find some of my recent, and not so recent, work at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://thealeks.itch.io\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethealeks.itch.io\u003c/a\u003e, including several art games (all free to play) and a couple of small, free, experimental tabletop games. I add new stuff comparatively often.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find some of my favorite writing clips\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@aleks_s\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e, including\u00a0a piece I wrote on choice and consequence in Pyrodactyl\u0027s \"Unrest\" and a piece on the intersection of process and interactive poetry in James Hostetler\u0027s \"Reverie,\" published not to long ago by the excellent\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://deorbital.media/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeorbital.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Support Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve seen my work (a lot of which is available free of charge), and want me to make more work, both similar and dissimilar to that which you\u0027ve already seen, consider helping that happen by pledging a small amount. In return, you will have my gratitude, plus the satisfaction that comes from directly supporting the arts and marginalized artists, thereby opposing the wholesale corporatization and homogenization of culture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are backer rewards as well, but I\u0027ve had to simplify that aspect of things as much as possible, for mental health and maintenance reasons. As of February of 2018, all backers are eligible to get digital copies of any commercial product that I release for free. There are a few commercial products coming up fairly soon, especially in the tabletop game design department. You will be eligible for this reward regardless of your backer level. I am just going to trust that people who back me are genuine about it and conduct this based on the honor system. If you choose to subscribe for one month, pledge 1 dollar, download everything you possibly can without buying it via the proper channels, and then immediately peace out...well, I\u0027m not going to stop you. That\u0027s a profoundly crappy thing to do to someone who is often struggling just to stay afloat, but I will trust that the folks who are actually interested in my work also share my values and are generally good, kind, awesome people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this...thing? (What Is Patreon and How Does it Work?)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a subscription based crowdfunding platform designed to help independent creators make something resembling a steady living. Unlike Kickstarter and similar services, which are designed to raise funds for specific, larger scale, projects, Patreon support is ongoing and is focused on sustaining (long term) a specific creator as opposed to a single product.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIn this particular case, Patrons contribute a (usually) small amount per month. That small amount is securely withdrawn from the patron\u0027s accounts at the start of every month. This goes on until either the creator or patron die, or until the patron decides that they no longer can or wish to support the creator, which sucks, but hey, it happens, and I totally understand if it does.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eNot unlike Kickstarter, patronage through this service comes with some rewards, and there are goals and milestones that, when reached, will allow the creator to do a little something special (that part is on the left).\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIs This Communism?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSadly, no. It\u0027s not even socialism. Under true, thoughtfully implemented communism, Artists, and people in general, would not need to worry about funding, because everyone would be guaranteed a decent standard of living regardless of their health, profession, or the circumstances of their birth. As the name of the website implies, this thing is simply an evolution of the age old institution of patronage. Like many things, patronage has become democratized, to an extent, due to the advent of the internet. It is no longer solely the province of massive institutions (governments, churches, wealthy merchants and bankers, and corporations) as it has been for many centuries. Which is good, I guess.\u003c/div\u003e"
