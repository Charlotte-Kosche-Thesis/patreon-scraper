    "summary": "Hey guys! I\u0027m Frozen OJ, real name Tasha, and I\u0027m a huge nerd. Back in middle school I would stay up far later than any child should so I could get the best deals on Neopets (because all the normal competition were wimps with enforced bedtimes). I fell in love with gaming, simulation/sandbox games in particular, and in that regard not much has changed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey say if you choose a job you love, you\u0027ll never work a day in your life. That could be because there are no current positions open for Senior Nap Executive, and listing having read Harry Potter 10 times on your resume is frowned upon. Thankfully on the\u00a0eleventy billionth day God created YouTube, and watching other people play video games became A Thing! Now with your help I can become a genuine professional and finally be able to fill out the work section on my Facebook profile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll kidding aside, I have been living with several chronic illnesses my entire adult life. This has made holding a traditional job impossible, yet I\u0027ve been denied Disability four times as of this writing. Being able to immerse myself in a video game has been vital to my sanity. Your donations will help me feel like I can still be a productive member of society, and along with buying new games and equipment will go towards my rising healthcare costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment I am using the \"per month\" model as I anticipate putting out several videos per month. Should I be unable to put out more than 4 videos a month (which is what I\u0027ve gathered Patreon suggests) a few months in a row I will switch to the \"per creation\" model. At that time you will be able to set a limit for how much you are willing to pay per month, so even if I post more than expected you will never be charged more than you desire. Unfortunately given my health there will be times where creating videos will be impossible, and I want to let you know up front that I do not want to take money without providing something in return. I only put the \"a few months in a row\" stipulation as should I have a rocky year I wouldn\u0027t want to switch back and forth several times in a short period.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support, whether by donating, watching my videos, or simply reading my story. May the force be with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0"
