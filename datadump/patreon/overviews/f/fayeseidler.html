In pursuit of that goal I\u0027ve help create a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/%E2%80%8Bwww.tristatetrans.org\"\u003ecommunity resource wiki\u003c/a\u003e, I provide\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://prezi.com/jc5cxkbnxuzg/the-gender-maze-business-edition/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003etransgender cultural competency presentations\u003c/a\u003e to organizations, and I run a transgender mentor program every Saturday for anyone interesting in learning more about transgender issues for themselves or someone they know. Finally, I have\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uyNe1kzgZgTen2dzScDQ4ue9KkH6vO_dO1TyRT6Jx50/edit?usp=sharing\"\u003eweekly column\u003c/a\u003e with the High Plains Reader where I publish articles relating to the LGBTQ+ community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI often provide these services for free, because they\u0027re so incredibly important and needed for my community. Basically, I never want money to be a factor that will stop an individual or organization from getting training that\u0027d help the trans community. That is why I created a Patreon, I wanted to allow people to support this work and allow me the most time possible to work on it. Donations are also used to directly impact the trans community in this area and my dream is to one day be able to offer scholarships based on donations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, please consider donating a dollar my way and help me fight for the dream of a better tomorrow. Regardless, if you ever have any trans related questions for yourself or someone you know. please don\u0027t hesitate to email me at Fayeseidler@gmail.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the love,\u003cbr\u003eFaye\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
