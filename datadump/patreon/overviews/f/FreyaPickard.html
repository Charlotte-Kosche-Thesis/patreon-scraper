This can only be done effectively if I pay established companies to promote my novels etc. Therefore, I am seeking to promote my books on a weekly basis and to do that properly, I need at least $30 per month. Without promotion I cannot sell my work and, as I am currently unemployed, I have no means of funding myself. If I can sell a certain amount of books per month, I can then fulfil my dream of being a full time writer!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI am using my short\nstories and poems as rewards because I want people who support me to\nget a glimpse into the worlds I have created. For just\u00a0$1 or more month, you will be able to read an unpublished poem. For just\u00a0$5 or more a month, you will be able to read an unpublished short story of at\nleast 2,000 words. Other rewards include sneak previews of book covers and launch videos as well free sample chapters of forthcoming books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like the sound\nof me and my writing, please consider supporting me.

She does not promote escapism; instead she takes her readers into a refreshing place so that they return to their normal lives feeling strengthened and renewed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA cancer survivor, Freya is inspired by her garden, a variety of music and beautifully written books. Her first novel is \u003ca href=\"https://dragonscaleclippings.wordpress.com/dragonscale-leggings/\"\u003eDragonscale Leggings\u003c/a\u003e and her quarterly newsletter features serialised short stories about her heroine, Dracomagan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFreya runs two blogs at https://dragonscaleclippings.wordpress.com and http://purehaiku.wordpress.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFreya likes to hear from people who have bought her book and want to buy her forthcoming novels and collections. She likes to hear that people have enjoyed her work so much that they\u2019ve bought her books for all their family members and friends. She also loves to hear from people who sign up to her newsletter to get a sneak preview of as yet unpublished stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFreya dislikes people who constantly ask her when her next book will appear or want to know what she\u2019s working on right now. She finds that kills her creativity dead. Freya loathes people who offer her an \u201chonest review\u201d in exchange for a free copy of one of her books. Freya hates agents, editors and publishers who don\u2019t bother even acknowledging they\u2019ve received her work, let alone actually get back to her with a result.

This can only be done effectively if I pay established companies to promote my novels etc. Therefore, I am seeking to promote my books on a weekly basis and to do that properly, I need at least $30 per month. Without promotion I cannot sell my work and, as I am currently unemployed, I have no means of funding myself. If I can sell a certain amount of books per month, I can then fulfil my dream of being a full time writer!",
