I\u0027m also a full time care taker living with and taking care of my mother.\u00a0My mother is a veteran who has served in both the army and navy. She suffers from PTSD and early onset dementia, as well as other mental and physical health problems.\u003cbr\u003eI live with her in a one bedroom apartment tending to her daily needs including cooking, cleaning and other house hold duties. I administer insulin four times a day as prescribed and manage her finances.\u003cbr\u003eWe have been living on her VA disability for a few years now. Its not much and each month after bills and groceries we are left broke.\u003cbr\u003eYour support also helps pay for my medical expenses. I was recently diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and severe\u00a0depression. The cost of my therapy and medications have become even more of a drain on us financially.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo in a effort to bring in some extra income I have decide to start streaming more regularly. To do this I need your help. Taking care of mom full time leaves me unable to work outside the home so this might be a way to help support not only myself but mom as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
