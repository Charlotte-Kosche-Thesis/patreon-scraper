    "summary": "We want to create a graphic novel, that could eventually turn into a printed book. We plan to release several pages on a monthly basis using Patreon. Our first goal will be to get this comic hosted as a permanent ongoing project. It would allow us to share the comic as pages became available. Our ultimate goal will be to produce all works in print. We\u0027ll need your help along the way, and we hope you enjoy what we create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I say \"we\", I mean Vincent and I. Here\u0027s a hort bio about who we are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.fateofthenorns.com/img/ME-5_x480.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAndrew Valkauskas is at the helm of Pendelhaven publishing. He is the \nauthor of the Illuminated Edda, a contemporary translation of the \noriginal Viking myths, direct from the Eddas written in Old Norse. \nThrough blood, sweat and tears, the Viking myths have finally been \nreorganized into an overarching story that spans all of creation. Andrew \nis also the game designer behind the Fate of the Norns line of games. \nRagnarok is an RPG that uses runes instead of dice as well as Gulveig a\nquick trick-taking card game involving bidding and bluffing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVincent Pompetti is an\nItalian comic artist. He was born in 1977 in Liege, Belgium, where he studied\nart, illustration and comics (bande dessin\u00e9e) at the St Luc Fine art school.\nAfter his studies ended in 1998, he began a career in comics, mainly in France.\nHis passions go for writing science fiction stories and also historic period,\nmainly the middle age and the Antique world. Vincent likes working on subject matter as the knights of the Round Table,\nthe Middle Ages, the charm of the 1950\u0027s \u0026amp; 60\u0027s, or suggestive myths such as Atlantis. He has developed an illustrator career, working for\nroleplay projects as \u201cNephilim\u201d by Mnemos Editions, and doing exhibitions in\nmany countries in Europe.\u00a0Since\n2017, his last books have been translated in English by Black Panel Press, who is publishing \u201cConstellation\u201d, \u201cAncient\nAstronauts\u201d, or \u201cConquest : Julius Caesar\u2019s Gallic War\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.fateofthenorns.com/img/FOTNR-beheading_x640.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow a little about our comic:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to tell the tale of some historical as well as Fate of the Norns characters during the Viking age (circa 10th century). All of the stories will be woven together using the Edda, Fate of the Norns, the Heimskringla, Gesta Danorum and many Viking Sagas. Among the Fate of the Norns roster, you will see Vargeisa the Fire Wolf along with the cast from Fafnir\u0027s Treasure. From history, you\u0027ll get to experience Erik Bloodaxe, Hakon the Good, Egil Skallagr\u00edmsson, Grettir the Strong and many other memorable folks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve ever read the Northlanders graphic novels, we aim for a similar style and feel. Patreon backers will make this project possible, and as a thank you, we will share content with you on a regular basis. Our goals are on the left of this page, and with your help I hope we can realize them. We will work hard to earn your patronage through quality and diligence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and interest,\u003cbr\u003eAndrew \u0026amp; Vincent\u003cbr\u003e"
