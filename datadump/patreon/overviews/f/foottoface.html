    "summary": "Hey, thanks for checking out my Patreon page. I\u0027m Julianne and I\u0027m a multimedia/multidisciplinary artist based in Toronto, ON, Canada. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently working with \u003cstrong\u003ecollage\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003estop-motion animation\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003ezines\u003c/strong\u003e to tell a cyclical apocalyptic story. I approach my art practice as a way of documenting processes of transformation and am interested in its power to expose and heal our fears around change, the unknown, and our capacity for intimacy. Save for a fundamentals of drawing course in 3rd year of uni, plus some really great evening workshops and YouTube tutorials,\nI am self-taught and I root my work \nin a holistic, anti-oppressive approach. I am currently based in \nToronto, and have previously lived and created work in Winnipeg (where I grew up), Freiburg, Brussels, Ghent, and Edinburgh. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther than collage, animation, and zines, I\u0027m also finding creative joy in and learning as much as I can about \u003cstrong\u003eDJing\u003c/strong\u003e and making \u003cstrong\u003edocumentaries\u003c/strong\u003e. So you might come across some music mentions and mixtape links and probably some strange bits of audio once in a while.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got a day-job at an organic food delivery company that allows me to juuust get by living in Toronto--but support from Patrons allows me to \u003cstrong\u003erent a studio space\u003c/strong\u003e, have the chance to \u003cstrong\u003etake workshops\u003c/strong\u003e, cover \u003cstrong\u003esubmission fees\u003c/strong\u003e, devote \u003cstrong\u003etime\u003c/strong\u003e to applying for grants and calls for submissions, afford \u003cstrong\u003elaptop repairs\u003c/strong\u003e or upgrades (cross my heart, knock on wood, pray to Jesus fucking Christ), and, obviously, \u003cstrong\u003emake all the art happen\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo I sell my artwork? Yes--or at least, when folks offer to buy it, I do. But as you\u0027ll discover, a lot of my work isn\u0027t exactly a tangible buy-able product, which kind of inhibits me from accepting \u003cstrong\u003etangible and practical forms of support and appreciation\u003c/strong\u003e in that respect. However, that\u0027s exactly why something like Patreon is really amazing for someone like me. It\u0027s totally possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Artists need to create on the same scale that society has the capacity to destroy.\" \u003c/strong\u003eare the words from a light installation by Lauren Bon (2005), and these words drive me\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eto prioritise my responsibilities as a creator and story-teller.\u003cstrong\u003e Your support helps me to fulfill this mission by GETTING MORE ART OUT THERE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e, and for this I am deeply grateful.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really hope you\u0027ll enjoy Patreon as much as I do. For \u003cstrong\u003eone time donations,\u003c/strong\u003e if you like, you can select a pledge and then select \u0027no reward\u0027. You can cancel after the first payment --or anytime. Regardless of what you choose to pledge, I sincerely appreciate you all just the same. Thank you so much.

In her work, Ess seeks to tell an apocalyptic story, or a story of eternal transformation: where one is constantly asking questions in order to digest the past and present; challenge our collective histories and social paradigms; and ultimately expose our fears around change, the unknown, and the unfamiliar. Ess is self-taught and roots her work in a holistic, anti-oppressive approach.
