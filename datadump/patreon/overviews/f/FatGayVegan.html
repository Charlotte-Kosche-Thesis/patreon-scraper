And for me, that time is now! The majority of work I\u2019ve been doing as FGV since 2010 has given little or no financial return. I work hard to promote independent vegan business and improve outcomes for non-human animals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u2019re a reader of my blog and appreciate the content I create and share, Patreon is a way for you to personally support what I already do as well as help me develop and create new ideas by committing to a small monthly contribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a Patron of FGV, you can commit to giving from as little as US$1 a month which is about 70p in the UK, 90 euro cents or $1.40 or so in Australia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhile $1 per month is the entry level of support you can commit to, I have rewards for people able to support me with a larger monthly contribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat exactly will your contribution help me to do/has helped me to do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eContinue to post daily (yes, DAILY!) blog posts on fatgayvegan.com where I share vegan news, reviews and personal opinion. My blog started in 2010 and you can help me keep it going strong. I use my blog to help promote independent vegan business, spread news of fundraising, alert readers of special events and do my best to improve outcomes for animals.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eCreate weekly mini podcasts in which I talk about the news items featured on fatgayvegan.com over the previous seven days. This feature gives those who are too busy to read every day a chance to catch up with all the news. It is also designed for readers who need/prefer news served in an audio format.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003ePatrons helped me develop the \u2018Sean y Julio\u2019 section of fatgayvegan.com where vegan Mexican food videos and recipes are shared starring me and my chef friend, Julio Alcantara. This collection of recipes showcases vegan versions of Mexican staple dishes and we have the longterm goal of creating our very own \u2018Sean y Julio\u2019 cookbook!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnswer YOUR questions about vegan living, travel and general enquiries via Q\u0026amp;A podcasts. My monthly \u2018Ask FGV\u2019 podcast will be available via my Patron stream only.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eContinue to build vegan community and support vegan business. Your support will help me fund and expand my large scale parties such as the UK Vegan Beer Fest events, as well as allow me to support vegan business owners with discounted rates for my services related to social media coaching and marketing.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eSubsidise the first and best vegan market in London, Hackney Downs Vegan Market. This market is now weekly and is a place where we give preference to businesses owned or co-owned by women, people of colour, disabled people, and/or members of LGBT communities. The support of Patrons is crucial in keeping Hackney Downs Vegan Market fiercely independent.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
