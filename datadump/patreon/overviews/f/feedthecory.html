I\u2019m also a content creator for the YouTube channel \u201c\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/feedthecory\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFeed The Cory\u003c/a\u003e.\u201d I\u2019m a U.S. Navy brat who was born and raised in Japan. I\u2019ve lived in a number of places, mainly Japan, but also Hawaii, Washington DC, and Seoul. I currently live and work in Hanoi, Vietnam.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eDuring my time in South Korea, I fell in love with making content about food, culture, and travel. I LOVE exploring non-touristy stuff: alleyways, hidden side streets, old neighborhoods, temples, and traditional markets are some of my favorite places to make videos about.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI also LOVE to eat food, especially street food. My YouTube videos aim to share these amazing things and places with you and the rest of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is \u201cFeed The Cory\u201d ???\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe expression \u201cFeed The Cory\u201d was created by subscribers who would watch my weekly Livestream tours of Korea. After walking around neighborhoods in Seoul, subscribers would let me know that they wanted to see me eat some street food, so they\u2019d type #feedthecory in the Livestream chat.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis was created by Kang Seung-Jung, a long-time subscriber to my channel. His hashtag idea quickly caught on, and many people were using it during every Livestream! It was catchy and kind of funny, so when I decided to change my channel name, \u201cFeed The Cory\u201d was a no-brainer for me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cFeed The Cory\u201d is my project to share food, culture, and travel around Asia using social media. Besides YouTube videos, I post heavily on Instagram (@feedthecory), as well as my Facebook page for \u201cFeed The Cory.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you haven\u2019t seen my videos yet, please visit my channel:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/feedthecory\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u27a4 Feed The Cory YouTube Channel\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did I open a Patreon account?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eCreative people spend a lot of time and energy doing what they love for little or no cost. We don\u2019t make much money at all, which is a shame. Through our videos and other projects, we sometimes barely make enough money to pay for a cell phone bill or pay for some groceries. Most of the time, it never covers rent, so we have to work a regular job to help cover those costs. That\u2019s life, right?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what, I will always create videos and content for FREE. I love what I do and have been doing it for more than 5 years now. But I just wish I had more free time to focus on creative projects. This is where Patrons like you can help me make my projects come to life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar you pledge lessens the burden of me having to work X number of hours at a random job that I prefer not to be at. Filming, editing, recording voice-overs, creating social media posts, following up with questions and comments all take time. Sometimes it can range between 12 to 60 hours per week! It can be tough to spend that many hours making content while also working a regular job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t feel like pledging a monthly amount, you can also make a one-time donation through PayPal here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/corymay81\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u27a4 Donate via PayPal\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m very thankful for all of you who have been supporting me over the years, and I look forward to gaining new supporters for the many projects I\u2019ll be creating. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eRemember, pledging is completely voluntary! You do NOT have to pledge money at all. Take care of your family and yourself before thinking about pledging any money.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou can always show support for what I do by subscribing to my channel, sharing my videos, giving them a Thumbs Up, and follow me on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. It\u2019s FREE and takes just a few extra seconds to click a button or two. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this! Please leave comments, questions, and suggestions on any of my videos. I reply to everyone!!!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMuch love from Vietnam,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eCory\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
