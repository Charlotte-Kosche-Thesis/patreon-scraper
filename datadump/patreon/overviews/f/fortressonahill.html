Why is the war in Afghanistan still going on 17 years after 9/11?  Are the budget increases proposed by President Trump needed for military readiness?  Which MRE tastes the most like human food and which tastes like the inside of a rusted battery?  These are simply a a few of the questions we aim to ask.  Please join our hosts, Chris \u0027Henri\u0027 Henrikson and Danny Sjursen, as they discuss the state of our military, a deep look at its history, and the principles that have pushed our country into unending war.",
