It\u0027s embarrassing for me to talk about this family abuse story, because I don\u0027t tell people in my life about this... And probably after this, they all will know about it... But whatever... So far in my life, I have not met anyone who\u0027s in my predicament and even though you all don\u0027t know 100% of my story, I hope you all can empathize with me. Thank you for your time. \u003cstrong\u003eI love you all\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePersonal Life - The Truth About Me [This is all said in the video...]\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t really like talking about such personal things in my life, but I feel like I have to tell you guys a part of my life that is significant and why I need this help. For those of you who watched me stream on Twitch about 3-4 years ago, I was popular and I was on top... But behind closed doors, I was having extremely bad and excruciating moments with my family. They were very abusive and if you guys remember my DEPRESSION video that I uploaded on my YouTube channel [which I will link below], you guys probably wondered why I felt depressed and it was mostly due to my family, my ex just broke up with me and the people in my life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from the major problems at home, I found something happy and I enjoyed which was streaming on Twitch and I found a lot of new friends there who were my \"viewers\" at the time that I still talk to these days and some became my best friends. A lot of female streamers hated that I was on top so they collaborated and worked together to get me banned since they had connections and they did... In 3 months I had 3k subs and I was on top beating the pros certain days where I streamed... I had hundreds of viewers streaming everyday... Everyday was so fun being able to stream and communicate with my viewers and then in a day, I was permabanned and lost my happiness... I was depressed from that too... I felt like, I couldn\u0027t have a good family relationship or friends... and even this had to be taken away too? Why does the universe hate me so much? And I tried so hard to get unbanned by contacting the Twitch Admins and Mods and nothing worked... The one good thing in my life was taken away from me in a second... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then in the background, I had to put up with their abuse for over 20 years that eventually I decided to run away from home and went to another state, because I literally didn\u0027t have anyone in New York that I could rely on, even though I had cousins/family who were basically not on my side either. Ever since then, bad things happened to me like bad things happening in the bus going there and a guy basically was abusing me everyday after that for months. For the past 3 years, I\u0027ve been living without my family\u0027s help and I live in a state where I can\u0027t go anywhere without driving and I didn\u0027t learn how to drive, because I didn\u0027t need to in New York... Now things were starting to settle 3 years ago and that was when I started making channel on YouTube... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwitch decided to unban me without notice 1 year later because I constantly checked...  But at that point even when I tried to stream, it wasn\u0027t the same anymore. People weren\u0027t talking and there were barely any viewers... It wasn\u0027t the same and it wasn\u0027t fun... So that\u0027s when I tried going on YouTube.. and it\u0027s still hard going from being on top on Twitch with hundreds of viewers everyday to what I have now... I do see other people, especially girls who are doing similar things to what I\u0027m doing and being much more successful than I am. I know it\u0027s bad, but it\u0027s hard not to feel like... there\u0027s something wrong with me... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, my family abandoned me (they still have not apologized to me to this day after what they did to me) and then me getting banned on Twitch, and now no matter how hard I try, sometimes it just doesn\u0027t feel like I\u0027m a \"girl gamer\" like the others... If you guys don\u0027t believe me, you can google me being on Twitch and look at any of my pages like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram... I never have any pictures of my family and it\u0027s not by choice... I hope you guys can find it in your heart to help and support me as everything I\u0027ve been doing in my channel is literally all from me and my work alone. I do the editing, the thumbnails and the videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this and I hope you guys don\u0027t judge me for letting my heart and my story out. I hope you guys can empathize and even if you guys can\u0027t pledge to be my Patron or donate, I will still love you all the same \u0026lt;3. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003exoxo FantasyGodiva\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
