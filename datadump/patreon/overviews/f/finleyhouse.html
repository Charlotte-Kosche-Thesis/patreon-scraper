    "summary": "Hi, my name is Austin Killian and this is Finley House. What I hope Finley House can be for you is a safe haven filled with fresh new music that breaks you free from the bondage of the radio. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I flipped through all of the popular stations in my car and heard Maroon 5 on every single one. It seems obvious to me that there needs to be more variety. And that\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to accomplish here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u2019t want you to have to wait 2 to 3 years before you get a new batch of 10, 3 minute songs that just sound the same as the last album that band put out. I\u2019m shooting to give you a new song and music video every single month that sounds different and fresh from the regular top 50 overplayed songs we hear on the daily. And with some support on patreon.com/finleyhouse, even more could come your way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, creating music is just a hobby. But with your help, it can become a career. With one of my first songs, Downfall of Man, I got an amazing amount of support on finleyhouse.bandcamp.com with people downloading my song for much more money than they should have. I mean, I\u2019m very grateful and honored that you thought this song was good enough to require that much money be paid for it. But I couldn\u2019t possibly expect you to pay that much for each of my songs, nor do I think that you should. That\u2019s just too much money for one song. So let me tell you about an alternative way to support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can go over to patreon.com/finleyhouse and donate anywhere from 1-3 dollars per MP3 \u0026amp; Music Video to support this music. But instead of just getting the song and that\u2019s it, you get rewards from any donation amount you give me as well. $1 gets you my newest song a whole 24 hours earlier than anybody else. And $3 gets you bonus exclusive songs that only you get to hear as they roll out of production. All these rewards are the least I can do to repay you for your wonderful support. You deserve it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd with that support, it could mean growth for Finley House in the future. It could mean Live Concerts both streamed and held at popular venues. Big budget music videos to perfectly convey the story that each song is trying to tell. And hopefully one day, even more unique and well thought out music by different artists in various genres that I could bring into the fold of Finley House. The possibilities are endless. So be a part of this musical movement and get some sweet rewards in the process. And thank you for listening my friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinley House, it\u2019s about time we got some new music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
