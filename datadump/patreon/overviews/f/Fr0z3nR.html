It\u0027s like a Lets Play stream, but with an educational flare.The goal of the stream is show how level designers build levels, and why certain things are done, breaking down the magic of game design.

Streaming allows me to do that. When I\u0027m not doing Level of Detail, I stream development of whatever Unreal Engine 4 project (pending NDA\u0027s and what not) I\u0027m working on. This could be a full-fledged project, or a game development doodle/prototype of sorts. These prototypes allow me to explore different types of design styles, and could be a VR or traditional (or both!) game. While doing this, I\u0027m explaining the game development process to folks like you! Additionally, these project could later become bigger, full projects! Most prototypes I make, once in a stable state, will be uploaded and playable to tier specific patrons via itch.io. \u003cem\u003e(See Rewards)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGame Development Blogs (and mini dev blogs)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes, I can\u0027t make a video, or talk about something on a stream - thats when I write about it.

Blogs topics could be a more indepth analysis of a games design, a how-to guide, a post-mortem or whatever topic patrons suggest!

All of these things - the streams, blogs, prototyping - would all still happen, but they wouldn\u0027t happen as regularly. I have normal day-to-day work, and Patreon will let me do less of that and more of the stuff listed in here. Basically what I\u0027m saying is - the streams, the prototypes, the articles won\u0027t stop happening - but with Patreon support, they will happen more often and reach more people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e... and yes, every reward tier is a quote from one of my favourite films, \u003cem\u003eCasablanca\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
