    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m sort of a jane-of-all-trades and undertaker-of-questionable-adventures...but mostly I\u0027m a traveling model, a builder of installation art, and a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way for you to support me in my creative work and other adventures via a monthly pledge of an amount you set. In return you receive perks that allow you to come along for the ride!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e0. Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor starters, I aim to continually surprise, terrify, and one-up myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far in 2017, I wrapped up a trip to Cuba [where I featured in an Amanda Palmer music video shot in an abandoned palace full of bats, rode around on horseback visiting tobacco farms, and practiced Spanish by deliberately getting lost and kicking it with locals], went on a Florida/Georgia modeling tour [where I found some time to canoe around the Everglades and managed to almost fall off a building], and begun yoga teacher training in northern California [and managed to squeeze in a couple incredibly fun shoots]. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s just January. I\u0027ve got schemes up my sleeve for Puerto Rico and South Africa in the coming months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an older example, I spent four months in 2015 on a \u003cstrong\u003esolo bicycle tour\u003c/strong\u003e up the entire US east coast from Key West, FL to Bar Harbor, ME. I documented the journey [both in the form of a blog, and more detailed private-for-now notes] and even modeled along the way [for the record, you probably couldn\u0027t find two more incompatible activities than freelance modeling and long-distance cycling: riding eighty miles and figuring out where to camp is tough enough without having to worry about tan lines, saddle sores, and emails]. I was pretty doubtful, even panicked, for much of the before-and-during. But that was kind of the point, I guess.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also worked as a stable hand at a ranch in Utah, a Thai massage therapist at an upscale spa, a certified ski instructor around Tahoe and Mammoth, a research assistant at NASA Ames, a heavy machinery operator in North Dakota, a backcountry trail builder for the national parks, and so on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve squatted in torn-up houses while being hired to remodel them. I\u0027ve washed dishes at permaculture conferences and other special-interest conventions that I couldn\u0027t otherwise afford to attend. I\u0027ve stealth-camped behind run-down churches on the rough side of town by necessity, but I\u0027ve also had thirteen-bedroom mansions and lakeside cabins all to myself thanks to the random kindness of those I\u0027ve met on the road. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that\u0027s me. As for the things I do that might be of interest to a patron:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Modeling\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mainstay is freelance art modeling; that is my ongoing passion, corruption, livelihood, vice, and glory. If you\u0027re here, then you\u0027ve likely seen me nude on the Internet, pulling shapes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to being a mode of expression that\u0027s helped me develop a healthier relationship with my identity and pitted me with people from all walks of life, modeling has also unexpectedly given me a platform through which I can talk about what matters on a grander scale, educate myself about the world so that I can navigate it conscientiously and use my efforts to improve it and promote worthy causes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Large-scale art\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have devoted much of the last four years to building art installations for Burning Man and developing my skills [primarily in carpentry and pyrotechnics\u2014though I\u0027ve run the gamut from plumbing to lighting to painting to metalwork]: Pier 2/La Llorona in 2012, Control Tower in 2013, Embrace in 2014, and Mazu Goddess of the Empty Sea in 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese projects left me physically, emotionally, and financially exhausted [they were all unpaid labors of love], but force-fed me invaluable lessons about connection, teamwork, heartbreak, corruption, and impossible deadlines [not to mention valuable trades].\u00a0After all I\u0027ve learned, I\u0027d like to now apply my energy and skills on projects that will have more permanence and that will reach beyond the Burning Man demographic: whether that\u0027s building permanent art installations for a city, or helping develop efficient and sustainable infrastructure for a struggling community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA big reason I am on Patreon is because I would like the mobility to devote myself\u2014based on ideological rather than financial principles\u2014to projects, non-profits, and start-ups where I can put my skills to good use!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Writing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my entropic lifestyle approaches something even vaguely resembling dialectical synthesis\u2014and because modeling is nothing if not only ephemerally viable\u2014I plan to focus more on my writing which, for now, is an ongoing secondary pursuit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI share my travel blog with patrons and have worked primarily as a ghostwriter and copywriter, but a few of my commissioned pieces and personal essays are scattered online.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.rebellesociety.com/2015/03/06/open-letter-from-an-allegedly-doomed-woman/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHere\u003c/a\u003e are a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/12/14/6-ways-to-go-beyond-conditioning/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ecouple\u003c/a\u003e examples, and older blog posts can be found at my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.debonairdirtbag.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSummarily,\u00a0I know nothing, but I have a lot of ideas and a knack for learning. Beginner\u0027s Mind. And I\u0027d have it no other way. I hope you\u0027ll join me on my journey.\u003cbr\u003e"

Essays are a particular favorite, but I love most brands of prose and poetry. While I\u0027ve twiddled in private with creative writing throughout my life and have thrown an article or two onto the Internet, the time I\u0027d need to see a personal piece through to a level of completion that I could excitedly bear to the world has eluded me as an adult. I write best when my surroundings are slow-paced and consistent\u2026which is the opposite of most of my life.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve dreamed for years of running off to a quiet place, unfettered by imminent financial pressures, and taking a few months to write a manuscript.",
