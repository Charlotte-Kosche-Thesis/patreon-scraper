So I opened my phone and\nlaunched the Kindle app to find something to read.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always downloading books (I love books) and had plenty of choices. It\u2019s a great way to\nfind new authors, but I was still in the middle of a committed relationship with another book (I always feel like I\u0027m cheating on a book if I start another one before I finish with the first one).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I really wanted was to go on a \"speed date\" with a new author. Not start a long-term relationship and commit to reading 400+ pages before I even knew them. That\u0027s like asking someone to marry you before that crucial first date.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere I was, sitting alone in the waiting room with only a few minutes to kill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat was I to do?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat\nI needed was a complete story that took only a few minutes to read.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\nreally didn\u2019t want to start another book, so I exited the Kindle app and instead\nscrolled through facebook to pass the time when I would rather be entertained\nby a complete story.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI thought\nto myself, \u201cSomebody should create books filled with short stories in the genre I love\nso I can discover new authors and be fully entertained for short bursts while I\u2019m\nwaiting for something else.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\nquickly realized that somebody might as well be me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo\nhere we are at FICTION Silicon Valley\u2019s Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the Editor-in-Chief, I am determined to create dedicated journals\nbased on your specific interests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll you have to do is ask.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHow do you ask?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt couldn\u0027t be simpler.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecome a Happy Family Member and cast your\n\"vote\" (i.e. select that specific genre tier) for the Genre Quarterly\nyou would like brought to life because you want it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBecause you need it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter that, spread the word to like-minded readers\nand help grow your Happy Family.
