FullMag consists of, well, me. My name is Richard Ryan and I am a YouTube creator, licensed manufacturer of explosives, firearms, destructive devices, with a SOT letter of clearance to manufacture machine guns, suppressors as well as being a pistol, rifle, shotgun, California Handgun Safety instructor, range safety officer and so on.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eWhy I Need Your Help:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been creating videos on YouTube since 2007. During that time I have worked 2 full time jobs and 3 part time to support my YouTube \"habit\". I realize at this point I am my biggest hurdle. I can\u0027t do all the things I need to do give my viewers all the amazing stuff they\u0027d like to see. \u00a0Unfortunately I do not have the sufficient income from other jobs or through YouTube ad revenue to expand the way I\u0027d like to nor am I or have I been sponsored by firearm or ammunition manufacturers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBetween YouTube subscription issues to mobile views and ad blockers, it\u0027s increasingly more difficult to even cover the smallest parts of my budgets. Time is another obstacle that really affects the amount of stuff I get accomplished in a week so I\u0027d like to be able to hire someone to help out with everything, along with getting better film equipment, more exotic guns, ammo for shoots and locations to film at.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eWhat You Get:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of Patreon as way of giving me a tip for the videos you like. As a Patron you\u0027ll receive many exclusive bonuses PER MONDAY VIDEO unavailable to the public. See below for details! I upload scheduled videos on Monday\u0027s. Any other videos that week are on house!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eVideo Milestones:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI genuinely love making YouTube videos. Every penny of your contributions will go to resources to create higher quality and more frequent content. If funding gets to certain milestones I will be able to implement certain things that have been on the back burner for a while because I haven\u0027t had the income or time to create them. From a community website, better equipment to bigger and more ambitious projects like a dedicated slow motion channel to larger budget scientific productions with the United States and foreign militaries."
