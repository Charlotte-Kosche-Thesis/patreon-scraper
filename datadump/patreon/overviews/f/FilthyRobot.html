    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m FilthyRobot and I create quality gaming content and gaming guides on both Twitch and YouTube. I originally started streaming as a leisure activity while working towards my PhD. \u00a0Amazingly, what started as a passion in my free time has, with the support of my incredible viewers, turned into a full time career. I have the privilege of doing what I love as my profession and I\u0027d like to keep it that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Twitch and YouTube channels are not only about providing entertaining game play, but also about acquiring a deep understanding of a game to be able to turn around and repackage that knowledge into game guides and tips-and-tricks videos for my viewers. I love hearing about the impact my guide and game play videos have had on my viewers\u0027 gaming experiences, and I want nothing more than to be able to continue doing so as long as I possibly can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is the best service I\u0027ve encountered that allows someone (like you!) to support a content creator (like me!) on a continuing basis. Patreon allows supporters to set up a recurring monthly subscription of an amount that you\u0027re willing to donate\u00a0(you specify how much and you can cancel that at anytime) that goes directly to the content creator. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to address the elephant in the room here: money. I\u0027m certainly not in this profession for wealth and I\u0027m not a money driven guy, but in order to make quality content and provide regular entertainment I have to have a consistent income. I\u0027ve got to be able to take care of the basic needs of life. Hardware needs to be upgraded, bills need to be paid, family needs to be visited, and long term life planning needs to be accounted for. As of April 2017, if each of my Twitch followers and YouTube subscribers pledged 50 cents per month, I\u0027d make slightly less than the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/acsbr15-02.pdf\"\u003emedian household income\u003c/a\u003e in the United States. But, of course, that isn\u0027t happening, things like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility\"\u003ediffusion of responsibility\u003c/a\u003e and expectations about free content (check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/reality-and-the-imagination\"\u003e6:55-8:32\u003c/a\u003e of one of Sam Harris\u0027s podcasts for a great verbal summation of this) mean that a much smaller percentage of viewers actually provide this kind of support. To steal an oft quoted example, is the entertainment and enjoyment my content provides worth the monthly cost of a single coffee or movie? If the answer is yes, please consider pledging your support\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?c=882085\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo.. ahem... How good is Patreon? Patreon is the modern, crowd-sourced equivalent of a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage\"\u003ePatron of the Arts\u003c/a\u003e. Do you like my content? Do you wish to see me be able to continue to do this? Patreon is the best option I\u0027ve seen for someone wanting to reliably help finance me. Patreon is a 95%/5% split favoring the content provider (Twitch is a 50%/50%). And, unlike historical patronage, you\u0027re not supporting a content creator all by yourself. Patreon is based around many patrons each financing a small percent of the total funding for a content creator. Each person who pledges pays what they\u0027re comfortable donating and the combined value of everyone\u0027s contributions allow me to survive, while creating and improving the content you all enjoy. Best of all, Patreon is a recurring monthly service which means it is fire and forget. You only have to motivate once to set it up, no messing with Twitch Prime each month, no wondering when the last time you donated was, it\u0027s setup and done. It\u0027s\u00a0reliable, consistent support for a content creator producing reliable, consistent product and that\u0027s pretty awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon Rewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here and considering pledging at any level it\u0027s because you want me to be able to continue to create and improve\u00a0my content, and I \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e appreciate that support. I\u0027m not interested in restricting access to the core content of my channels based on pledge tier, so I\u0027ve instead tried\u00a0to sweeten the pot by adding unique offerings that get better the larger your pledge. These are subject to change as inspiration strikes me or feedback trickles in, but the goal is to thank those of you who choose to help support me, so I hope they\u0027re fun. Please let me know if there are other things you all would love to see here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to emphasize that in no way is pledging on Patreon mandatory, my content isn\u0027t suddenly going to disappear behind a paywall. The purpose is to offer you all a method of supporting me that\u0027s easy and consistent while leaving me less vulnerable to platform- or advertiser- related issues and every single pledge helps with this, regardless of tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContent creation has been an incredible experience that I never saw coming and I want to take a moment to thank those of you who have supported, continue to support, or are considering supporting me. Thank you so much for your patronage, I couldn\u0027t do this without you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003e-Filthy\u003cbr\u003e"
