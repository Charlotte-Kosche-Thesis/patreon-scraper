It would help fund In-Depth review videos!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s an example of an In-Depth Motorcycle Review:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xrdZUHYglW4\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecoming a Crew Member means pledging at least $1 per In-Depth Motorcycle Review.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0These are huge projects that take about 2 weeks to 6 months each to create, so \u003cstrong\u003ethat means a $1 pledge will never cost a Crew Member more than $2 per month. \u003c/strong\u003eIf desired, a Crew Member could even cap that to a maximum of one or two pledges per month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what can you get in return?\u003cbr\u003e-Access to exclusive playlists\u003c/strong\u003e like the \"BTSEU vlog,\" the Behind The Scenes Exclusive Update vlog. Here\u0027s a demo reel of the BTSEU vlog so you can see if this is something you\u0027d care to watch!\u00a0\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLRolwfDYpw5HSDqnmI3-s2G3frVh39bf2\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-First grab at parts that come off of bikes\u003c/strong\u003e when I am working on them, at an ULTRA discounted price! When I decide I don\u0027t need a part anymore, I\u0027ll list it on here for two weeks before attempting to sell it on eBay. For example, I\u0027ve sold a performance shock on here, an exhaust pipe, a fuel tank and more, all at ridiculously low prices.\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cstrong\u003ePriority Commenting/Message Reply!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I thoroughly enjoy interacting with viewers, but the comment section, at this point, is just swamped. I spend the time to delete/block harassment/trolling (which is, no joke, 50+% of the comments now) so that regular viewers can have an intelligent conversation in the comment section, but after I\u0027ve sifted through the litter every day, I\u0027ve \"had it\" with the YouTube comment section. So, here on Patreon you\u0027ll be able to see all my videos and comment via Patreon\u0027s comment section, completely separate from the YouTube comment section. I\u0027ll receive an email when you comment or message, and I\u0027ll be able to reply easily!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-Get your questions ANSWERED! \u003c/strong\u003eHave a rather complex question? Qualifying Crew Members can message me on here and I\u0027ll put it on the Moto Q\u0026amp;A list to make an episode of Moto Q\u0026amp;A out of it!\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cstrong\u003eControl the course of a project!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0When I have a decision to make, I\u0027ll post a poll on Patreon where qualifying Crew Members can vote and voice their opinion. Usually something like \"should I go the DIY method on this mod, or would you like to see how well a paid product/service works?\"\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cstrong\u003eGet listed as a major contributor in the video description of each project you fund! \u003c/strong\u003eQualifying Crew Members can be listed as contributors in the video description of projects they fund.\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cstrong\u003eReceive a little random something after each project you fund\u003c/strong\u003e. Qualifying Crew Members will always receive something in the mail after each project they fund. It could be a post card, it could be a crazy tri-fold spec-sheet comparing before and after a project (a great bathroom read or coffee table addition haha!), or it could be something else. Whatever I think would be cool or funny at the time.\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cstrong\u003eMAJOR APPRECIATION. \u003c/strong\u003eBecause $1 has the equivalent worth of 500-2000 views on YouTube, it means that each and every Crew Member is as helpful to this channel as an unthinkable amount of ordinary viewers, and that is just... wow. Just, \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e-\u003cstrong\u003eAnd more in the future! \u003c/strong\u003eI am always looking for ways to better serve the Crew Members. Any perks that I can realistically add, I will try to add!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will these funds be used for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJUST THE CHANNEL. \u003c/strong\u003eI have no intention of using the funds to purchase a big fancy house, or fancy car, or fancy anything for myself. This is all for you... for the channel and for the viewers. Unless it would benefit the Crew Members and the channel, I won\u0027t spend Crew Member funds on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I asking you for support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to better serve you. That is my passion, and that\u0027s all there is to it.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "Reaching this goal would really mean the channel is set for success. This would be incredible. $200 is enough for a budget bike build for sure! This is about the highest \"realistic\" goal I can see the channel actually achieving. $200 at the beginning of a project is equivalent to already having 100,000 to 400,000 views on the project!! That\u0027s \"professional YouTuber\" status!",

I don\u0027t know, and I don\u0027t even care, because this isn\u0027t like other channels. This is Frickin Jim\u0027s Frickin Adventures, and you better believe we\u0027d build the world\u0027s fastest Craigslist/Junkyard Special, or something like that LOL! Oooo and definitely rebuild the CRF230F! That thing was so much fun fully built but it was $1500 down the drain :( Haha, yes, rebuild the CRF230F and make it even more cool!",

Don\u0027t start thinking this is an actual goal! \u003cstrong\u003eThis is just here as a daydream!\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m sitting here daydreaming about what we could do to the channel with this level of support. Hmmmmm..... I\u0027ve got some ideas.\u003cbr\u003e-A private test track for builds/reviews...\u003cbr\u003e-Maybe Crew Members could be invited to ride the test track!!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Some custom built bikes always ready at the test track for Crew Members to ride?!\u003cbr\u003e-There could be a tent setup there! Haha! So Crew Members don\u0027t need to pay for a place to stay! Or that really big shed I just saw at Lowe\u0027s which was basically a small house. Well heck, I\u0027d need that anyway for the bikes. DONE.\u003cbr\u003e-I could do bike MELTDOWN tests during reviews! Really, REALLY test bikes like nobody has before.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Heck, there better be a DYNO at this test track! Everyone keeps begging for Dyno charts on the builds. Well, with this it could be done! Heck yeah!\u003cbr\u003e-Employ some of my favorite people to work on the channel? MAYBE! The old days where I made videos with my buddies were the best, IMO. Haha $3000 a month might not employ multiple people... Oh well. Anything is possible in a daydream.\u003cbr\u003e-Get Big Man Tyrone to narrate the videos? LOL. Nahhhhh. Maybe once or twice but nahh.. haha\u003cbr\u003e-Holy crap this would mean we could review and build expensive bikes like KTMs and stuff... wow.\u003cbr\u003e-Sidecar for the QT50? I think yes.\u003cbr\u003e-Turbocharged CBR500R? I think yes.\u003cbr\u003e-OHHHH start building Crew Members\u0027 bikes! Like pimp my ride, but actually cool haha.\u003cbr\u003e-An editing computer that can handle more advanced editing. Heck yeah.\u003cbr\u003e-Oh wow, duh, a company truck to be able to pick up bikes would be GREAT. That would help the channel. The Kia with Harbor Freight Trailer is great and all, but a truck would save time for creating content!\u003cbr\u003e-MORE NITROUS OXIDE.\u003cbr\u003e",
