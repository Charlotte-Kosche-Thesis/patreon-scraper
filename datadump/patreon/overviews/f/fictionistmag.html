We\u0027re forever grateful for you all.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, we think we should highlight a longer-term goal here: \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fictionistmag.com/the-fictionist-box/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe print magazine\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur plan is to provide subscribers with a monthly print magazine with exclusive content, excerpts, interviews and more!

Our box is designed to make you want to sit down with a new book. It\u0027s designed to relax you, to invite you to take time our of your day to focus on reading. Sit down on your couch with a new pair of soft socks, a hot cup of tea on us, and our book-themed goods meant to be used or worn, not to decorate your bookshelf.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd if the promise of a relaxing reading experience wasn\u0027t enough, we are also gong to be producing a print magazine for our subscribers \u2014 full of print-exclusive content like signed notes of encouragement from our featured authors, letters from book editors about why they chose to publish the month\u0027s featured book, quizzes, book-inspired recipes, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRight now, we are planning to launch with three versions: A box that ships with a new YA book, a box that ships with an e-book redemption code, and a box that only includes the magazine and box contents. We may also add a version which includes an e-book and physical book bundle!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo sit back.

But the best part is, each package would include goodies! There are a few bookish subscription boxes gaining plenty of traction right now (just look at boxes like Owlcrate or Fairyloot) and we\u0027d love to make a magazine subscription that has it all: A well-designed, well-written magazine and a monthly surprise of bookish goodies. If our boxes gained enough traction, we could even create versions that shipped along with a monthly featured book! That would be the triple threat: Magazine, goodies and a great book to read. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e",
