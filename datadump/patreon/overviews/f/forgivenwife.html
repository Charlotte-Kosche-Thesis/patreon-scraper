    "summary": "I\u2019m a Christian marriage blogger who writes to women about\nsexual intimacy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSex can be such a source of tension in marriage, as I know\nfrom personal experience. I spent nearly twenty years resisting sex. This hurt\nmy husband deeply\u2014and although I didn\u2019t realize it at the time, it hurt me\ndeeply, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn my writing, I share my journey from a woman who resists\nsex to a woman who embraces sexuality and sexual intimacy. My writing is\ntransparent. I don\u2019t pull any punches about my thoughts, feelings, and\nstruggles about sex over the years. Many women have told me, \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re\nin my head when you write!\u201d Knowing that we aren\u2019t alone is often the thing\nthat gives us courage to step out of our comfort zones and do the hard things.\nI hope I help women do this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGod has been keeping me busy. I have several books outlined,\nand I\u2019ve sketched out ideas for speaking engagements. God has been showing me\nways to reach women one-on-one or in small groups. It takes time to write blog\nposts, work on books, speak with small groups of women, respond to emails, and support individual women who have shared their hearts with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI want to be able to have the time to dedicate to my writing to support women trying to grow in the sexual intimacy in their\nmarriages. My goal is to be able to leave my part-time job to focus on writing.\nAt the very least, I want to be able to remove all ads from my site except for\nthose that are from Christian businesses and that support marriage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPlease pray about whether you can become a monthly patron\nand support me as I support other women in their marriages.\u003cbr\u003e"
