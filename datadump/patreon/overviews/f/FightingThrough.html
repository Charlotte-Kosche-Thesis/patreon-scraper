    "summary": "Hello\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m Paul Cheall, the son and editor of my late father\nBill Cheall\u2019s WW2\u00a0memoirs, Fighting Through From Dunkirk to\nHamburg and I\u0027d like to ask for your support in producing the Fighting Through Podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince Dad\u0027s memoirs were published by Pen and Sword, many former comrades and families have come forward with stories and diaries of their own, all forming part of the jigsaw of Dad\u0027s war.\u00a0The aim of my show is to bring all these memories to life and honour the soldiers and civilians who were connected to Dad\u0027s story in some way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDad fought at Dunkirk, North Africa and Sicily and was in the first wave landing on Gold Beach on D-Day. He ended his war in Germany, having won seven medals and a wounded-in-action stripe\u00a0 for injuries during the Normandy campaign.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got letters home, anecdotes, memoirs, battles, photographs, interviews with veterans ... the lot.\u00a0There\u0027s comedy, drama, poignancy and\ntragedy in abundance.\u00a0I have enough material and ideas for many more episodes.\nThere are some staggeringly good tales to tell, about flying Lancasters,\nwinning a military medal on D-Day, captaining a ship during Dunkirk and many\nmore - all true and far more intriguing than any fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Mum, Anne, who features occasionally in my show, has a degenerative eye disease and can no longer read - but she delights in\nlistening to my podcasts which I download onto a disc for her and which she\nlistens to again and again. So I hope I am playing some small part in bringing\nthis rare history to an audience who would otherwise so often be the last to\nhear it. Some 10% of my listeners use special audio devices to listen to the show, indicating some sort of sight impairment.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nProducing my podcasts takes a massive amount of time and effort, not to mention the\ncosts of music, equipment, hosting, software and now sometimes travel and typing services.\u00a0 Your contribution will be gratefully received and will help me continue to offer even more \u0027great unpublished history\u0027. In addition to the rewards I offer for your support, I\u00a0will be releasing other exclusive benefits occasionally in recognition of your ongoing contributions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy sincere thanks for your support and interest in my podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nKind\nregards\u003cbr\u003ePaul\nCheall\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Bye, bye now!\u0027\u003cbr\u003e"
