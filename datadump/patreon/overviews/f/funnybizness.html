Lol I\u0027m just an ex-military nerd with lots of time on his hands. I was always an artist since I was born but last year I realized my true passion. Animating was just so much fun. And creating things that others would use really made me want to keep going. I just try to make great content. Stay Brutal!!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"

After four years they kind of screwed me over so I dropped out. Its a long story. Lets just say the college was sketchy towards veterans. Anyways I always loved video games and art since 1985 ( I was 5 years old when I picked up my first Atari controller lol) I now create animations. Whatever someone suggests I try and create it. With the money (if I am able to earn it lol) I will be paying off VA bills and other debt. Stay Brutal!!\u003cbr\u003e",
