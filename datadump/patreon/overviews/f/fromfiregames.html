    "summary": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hi! I\u0027m Jennifer! I love making games and have wanted to be a game developer since I was a little kid. Now I\u0027m finally able to make that dream a reality thanks to your help. My favorite types of games are ones that push the boundaries of conventional design and those are the kinds of games I plan to make. Games are capable of some amazing things, allowing us to step into worlds we\u0027ve never imagined. To experience things never before possible, and from perspectives we\u0027ve never seen before. I\u0027m especially interested in creating games centered around my experiences as a queer trans woman, a perspective that\u0027s incredibly rare in all media but especially in games. So if you\u0027d like to join me on this wild adventure I\u0027d love to have you on board!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent Project:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGone Fishing:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gone Fishing is a narrative adventure that explores how gender identity affects the close personal relationships we have with others, especially family. The player controls Emma, a trans woman who met her wife in high school but has only recently come to terms with her gender identity and come out to her wife Bethany. Bethany has tried to be understanding of Emma\u2019s identity but still struggles which is putting a strain on their relationship. With their anniversary around the corner they decide to take a camping trip to try and work out their issues. The player makes decisions on what to say, when to say it or even if they should say anything at all.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 You can watch the watch the reveal trailer bellow and check out the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/developer-update-8074573\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eannouncement post here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NuIBLMs2e0c\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrevious Projects:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eT-Runner:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My most recent project is T-Runner, an endless runner about a trans woman trying to avoid the painful memories of past and present.

Your friend Megan has suddenly disappeared leaving only a note to her parents. Did she simply run away? Or did something worse happen? You\u2019ll discover the answer after searching around her home for pages from her journal. I don\u2019t have an exact release date for the game as it\u0027s currently sitting on the back burner, but I do have some work in progress demo videos which you can \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhmaMANc85fWzFHxpp2N7G3-nqItrSNR3\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003echeck out here\u003c/a\u003e if you\u2019re interested.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStop N\u2019 Shred\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stop N\u2019 Shred is a mobile game unlike anything you\u2019ve seen before. The basic idea that spawned this game was simple, turn based skateboarding mixed with an endless runner. Your character will automatically move through the randomly generated level but stop just before each jump. At which point you\u2019ll select which trick you want to perform. Each trick will have a chance of success based on the difficulty of the jump, trick and your player\u2019s skill level. I ended development after completing a basic prototype because the game simply wasn\u0027t very fun.
