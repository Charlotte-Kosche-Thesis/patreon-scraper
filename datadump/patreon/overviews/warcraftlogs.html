    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHistory\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarcraft Logs and WildStar Logs have been providing users with detailed combat analysis since 2013. These sites are the result of thousands of man-hours of work by me, Kihra. I have been a raider in World of Warcraft since the game launched and have always been interested in log analysis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first time I thought about making a log site for World of Warcraft was back in Throne of Thunder. There was a fight in that instance, Dark Animus, where each player was responsible for \"tanking\" Anima Golems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo log site could tell you what went wrong back then. In order to understand what was going wrong you needed the capability to analyze a specific instance of a mob, e.g., Anima Golem #5. It wasn\u0027t enough to see data for all Anima Golems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI set about building a new log site that had the features I wanted to see, motivated by years of pent-up frustration at not being able to get at data that was essential for defeating encounters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to today, and WCL is still the only log site that can provide data regarding individual mob instances. This feature is just one of many that were added in order to solve real-world problems encountered while actually progressing on these bosses at the highest level of difficulty.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWCL is designed by a Mythic raider who continues to play the game at the highest level. I will always know what is needed for a given fight, because I put in the time to defeat that boss myself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTraffic\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe traffic for WCL has grown by a factor of 10x over what it used to be back in Mists of Pandaria. I am thrilled that the site has been so successful. With this increase in traffic, however, the server costs have become too high to continue operating the site without help. That is why I have created this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOperating Costs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe server costs for Warcraft Logs are now in excess of $5000 per month and continuing to climb. \u00a0There are also large server costs incurred once per year in order to reserve instances with AWS (reducing the monthly cost for the remainder of that one year term). I am actively working to reduce these server costs with optimizations, and I will keep this page updated as I find ways to bring that number down. The recent rankings queue changes are an example of this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring peak raid hours, WCL scales up to approximately 40 servers. The reason why the site is so expensive is that the logs have to be operated on in memory by back end servers in order to handle arbitrary zoomable time ranges, support advanced queries that filter the combat log data, and to handle features like combat replay, which can play back the entire fight in real time. I don\u0027t just show you canned pre-processed views. The data is yours to filter and manipulate, but that comes at a cost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to keep these advanced features available for everyone, rather than limiting combat replay or expressions/queries to patrons only. That\u0027s why I am looking for help to cover these costs, so that these features that you have grown to depend on over the last two years can remain available to all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCovering server costs entails both ad revenue and sponsorships through Patreon. I am now projecting that the server costs can be covered completely through ads + Patreon if the Patreon sponsorships reach $2000.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals and Milestones\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt $4000 per month through Patreon, the server costs (when combined with ad revenue) will be more than covered (both the monthly costs and the costs to reserve instances). At the moment, there is a 40-server cap, and the site is now starting to bump up against that cap at peak times. With an extra $2000 per month, I can raise the server cap to 64, and double the minimum number of back end servers running at all times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo thank you for sponsoring the site, there are some rewards available to patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are three reward levels available: silver, gold and platinum. You can read more about them below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI pull the list from Patreon once per day, so please allow up to 24 hours for the reward to take effect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMake sure your e-mail address that you use in Patreon exactly matches the e-mail address for your Warcraft/WildStar/FF Logs accounts in order to receive your Reward.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
