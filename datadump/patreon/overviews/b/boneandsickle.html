    "summary": "Bone and Sickle celebrates horror and folklore \u2014 their fertile intertwining and the strange fruit of their embrace \u2013 the genus sometimes known as \u201cfolk horror.\u201d Every episode offers a bounty of frightful tales, fantastic legends, and macabre histories harvested by me, Al Ridenour.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe pace of the show, no less than pace of the production is manic. Each episode is a sort of overstuffed grotesquely ornate bricolage of topics that have obsessed me in the last weeks. It\u2019s full of witches, werewolves, blood, blood-drinkers, murder, wonderworkers, secret cabals, omens in the skies, weird things buried deep below, and strange superstitions that just might have some truth in them. All the sorts of things people like us find delightful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNotes for future shows, new ideas, new audio, images, keep piling up as I try to stay on schedule producing the show at hand. I hate to lose any of it. It\u2019s all part of a magnificent story that should be shared. All the bits are needed to make the storytelling just the way it should be, more vivid, more absurd, and just a tiny bit creepier. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u2019t want to make a podcast like any other. I want it to be transportive, immersive, and glutted with all the ghoulish detail it deserves, and that\u2019s what your equally lavish generosity accomplishes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the long, isolating process of writing\u003cem\u003eThe Krampus and the Old, Dark Christmas\u003c/em\u003e, I realized, how difficult it can be just to sit on all this gold. It\u2019s like holding a secret you\u2019re bursting to tell, and then there are those tragic lost gems, the bits that don\u2019t quite fit the constrained flow a written book.This (clearly less constrained) show was conceived as a sort of remedy to all this. It\u2019s a way for me to record and share some of that content with all the giddy excitement intact.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m currently working on a new book that embraces the themes of Bone and Sickle, and I\u2019d love to take you along for the ride, share what I can, tease a bit more of what\u2019s to come and pick up all those lost threads that inevitably weave themselves into some other sort of creepy self-weaving monster of a tapestry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donations help keep me on track. Practically, of course, they keep me from losing too many hours to work that is strictly about money, but more importantly, they tell me that \u2013 odd as it may seem -- people genuinely appreciate the work I\u2019m doing and that they want more of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd for god\u2019s sake, I need to pay Wilkinson! Or was it Mr. Galiher? In any case, there lies some great debt that must be undone. He has such a lovely voice and is so generous with this time. Lord knows, the poor fellow has suffered enough. If not for me, please, please, think of Wilkinson.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for support and enthusiasm!!\u003cbr\u003e"

Beginning with a folkloric topic (say, \u201cthe cuckoo bird\u201d \u201cMay Eve,\u201d or \u201clost heads\u201d), Ridenour takes us on a wildly discursive tour of the subject, using authentic sourcebooks pulled from the imaginary shelves of an imaginary manor house library. He is attended in his imaginary study by \nthe impeccable Wilkinson (Rick Galiher), mononymous manservant and unflinching participant in their deeply passive-aggressive relationship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRidenour\u2019s feverish narrative bounces between the scholarly-antiquarian and the campy world of cult films and horror fandom. Folk tales spill into grisly murder ballads, crossing paths with ecclesiastic treatises on witchcraft, strange bits of Victoriana, and superstitions from the European hinterlands. The whole unfolds within an immersive ever-shifting audio landscape of original music, brooding tones, intricately layered effects, sound bites, and film clips.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEpisodes are generally 30 minutes long and released every 2 weeks on Mondays.  The show premieres on Walpurgis Night (May Eve), April 30, 2018.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e",
