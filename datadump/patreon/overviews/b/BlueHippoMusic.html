The vocals are lounge singer chanteuse style by Caitlin Jaene. Her voice is often compared to k.d. lang and Karen Carpenter. Caitlin is also the bassist of the band, trained classically on the upright bass. Chris Mercer creates an ocean of sound with his guitar and pedals taking the band into the shoe-gazer rock sound. Friends refer to his pedal collection as \"pedal-topia\". Everything dances on the beats made by drummers Rob Durham, Rich Breazzano, or John Mousseau depending on the show. Their sound has been described as Portishead and Garbage meets The Police, with a little Sigur Ros.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlue Hippopotamus was started in 2005 by Caitlin Jaene and Rob Durham who played small clubs in NYC. Now based near Philadelphia, the band has traveled far playing clubs in LA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Portland, Detroit, Buffalo and North Carolina. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen Caitlin and Rob started the band they wanted to use the name of an animal with a big bottom like Caitlin\u0027s upright bass. When they learned about the ancient Egyptian blue hippopotamus artifact used to protect the dead on their way to the afterlife, they found their name. Caitlin became vegan soon after starting the band so now the name is also fitting because the hippopotamus is one of the fiercest vegans in the animal kingdom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlue Hippopotamus is an animal-rights supporting band. Caitlin, Chris and Rob are vegan and Rich is vegetarian. Anyone interested in literature on animal kindness can find it for free at their merch table at every show. The band often plays rescue and veg events. More info can be found on the \"B Hipp to Animals\" page of their website. \u003ca href=\"http://www.bluehippomusic.com/\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.bluehippomusic.com/\"\u003ewww.BlueHippoMusic.com/bhipptoanimals\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlue Hippopotamus has a large repertoire of original music as a full band and Caitlin also likes to cover jazz standards and popular songs solo on her upright bass. Caitlin has a Patreon page (you\u0027re looking at it) where you can access digital recordings of All of the music made by Blue Hippopotamus for one price as well as older recordings, extra live videos and sensual photographs made by Caitlin. Blue Hippopotamus CDs and other merch can be purchased at \u003ca href=\"http://www.BlueHippoMusic.com.\u00a0\"\u003ewww.BlueHippoMusic.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCaitlin gets a lot of joy from learning about energy and tapping into her clairvoyance. Cindy Eyler helps her grow and open her energy more and more every day to channel inspiration and light. Blue Hippopotamus is very honored to be featured as the theme music for Cindy Eyler\u0027s life-changing eCourse \"Manifesting Breakthroughs Level 2: Self-Mastery \u0026amp; Manifesting\"! \u003ca href=\"http://www.CindyEyler.com\u00a0\"\u003ewww.CindyEyler.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eFor the newest Blue Hippopotamus album, \"Crazy Love\", the band has collaborated with Caitlin\u0027s childhood friend, Laura Petersen, for a sensual visual experience of photos that match the mood of the intimate collection of songs. The CD contains a 16 page booklet featuring photos of Laura taken by the talented Nate Griffin (\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/laurapetersen_lp\"\u003ewww.instagram.com/laurapetersen_lp\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.nategriffinphoto.com/\"\u003ewww.NateGriffinPhoto.com\u003c/a\u003e). Caitlin and Laura have been close friends since elementary school in the 80s when they used to do talent shows together (yes, there is embarrassing video of this). As young as they can remember, Caitlin wanted to be a singer and Laura wanted to be a model. Now that they are both moms, they are making it a priority to remember that women can still be serious about their art during motherhood. They are two women supporting and encouraging each other\u0027s creativity. They do not need to be 20 or childless to be beautiful, express their sexuality and celebrate who they are. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to check out the music of Blue Hippopotamus. Enjoy! \u003cbr\u003eCopyright 2005-2015 Blue Hippopotamus /Publishing BluHippSongs(BMI)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
