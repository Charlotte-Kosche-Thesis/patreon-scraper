    "summary": "I am an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat statement alone took me countless years to muster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBetween my mother who would pay her life savings on my chasing the \u0027higher education dragon\u0027 sooner than risk my likelier failure, my own fear of failure, all the charlatans being lauded and geniuses on the street - I have always been [(an artist)] between.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBetween one thing or another - never getting paid for it - so it couldn\u0027t be a job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDidn\u0027t go to school for it - so it must\u0027ve been a hobby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt doesn\u0027t buy me nutrients today or anything more than occasional validation in random bursts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStill, it\u0027s crucial for me to make art - it feels like my purpose.\u00a0So... I am an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs, oft, I do, I cite Van Gogh and ask if he earned praise enough -\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eof countless Art History 101 pages suffered not unlike his existence -\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003edespite his art... yet his art never suffered... despite his existence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVan Gogh was an artist and truth be told I have no idea what his mother thought on his hopes but I pray she wept in joy at what her lineage produced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ambitions are about six hundred feet deeper than my wallet and I want to prove my mom wrong while she\u0027s here. Despite my moping, she\u0027s been there for me through years of staving off attempt... and I want to attempt to make her happy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePast 80k, money can\u0027t buy happiness. But it can buy salvation in that attempt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd knowing your son can provide for his own outweighs his principle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDesign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeature... whatever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything above - was around five minutes - it just pours out of me - in pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever ADD is - if it exists - I\u0027m prescribed - I have it - I\u0027m spastic - but when I\u0027m focused it\u0027s pure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll I ask of the world is that I am allowed to provide for myself by providing art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want your help too - not just money - your minds and faith in my dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore info (process, motives, inspiration, unnecessary rambly poetry) from an online interview:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ehttp://enigmalife.com/stories/artist-profile-billy-blumberg\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy soon-to-be-updated website: \u003cbr\u003ewww.billyblumberg.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e@billy_is_so_serious\u003cbr\u003e@billy_is_so_silly\u003cbr\u003e@billy_is_so_anal (coming soon - the perfectionist in me needs to fix the former)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1 year plan - by 10/18 - monetize visual art enough to stay afloat: organize/print backlogged body of digital work, hit up galleries, try selling prints etc on the street in full force, link to online shops, etc - get writing published further - get all social media back on track - do whatever it takes...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2 year plan - by 10/19 - more premier galleries, larger following/s - take that jab at standup - tackle vocals - enough money to work without looming stress and with pride in what i do - not enough to save yet maybe - but enough to pay my own way - by expressing myself and hopefully what others have felt\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3 year plan - by 10/20 - put out at least a demo - continue to adapt selling methods - work on your short story/film concept - earn enough to think about where to settle down a bit longer term or conversely travel while you can with \u0027relatively tremendous\u0027 ease (you are now 30)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4 year plan - by 10/21 - assitants and gallery in place - my gallery is extremely chill, everything is split 50/50 between me and as-underrepresented-as-possible artists who i do all the backend work for, there is a pool table people can gamble me for pieces on depending on their offer... there is a space for musical equipment and subsequent jams, ideally a liquor license, it\u0027s an idea in motion hah... but a goal of mine nonetheless... i know what it feels like to be full of self doubt as an artist and i want to bring as many talented people as possible towards the light\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5 year plan - by 10/22 - i am comfortable going abroad etc with savings in place for any emergency/retirement - my gallery can function on its own devices even though i would never let it while i am able - i am thinking about investing, opening a restaurant, other ideas, going back to school for graphic design etc - might be in a long term relationship i\u0027d hopefully approve of by now, hah\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6 year plan - by 10/23 - i have a couple successful business ventures under my belt or at least staying on their feet - some money put aside for emergency - some for growth/leisure - i am a much better artist - i have curated/networked with hundreds of artists and helped them grow - i have a pending side gig as a designer or consultant\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7 year plan - by 10/24 - i have established several rituals and branched out in the artistic community - i challenge myself constantly with the financial freedom to do so - without fearing a panic attack at the loss or \u0027sunk cost\u0027 involved - i own a trusted and successful gallery that up-and-coming artists seek for its exposure - i still actively seek out shy talent as well - i begin to think about other ways of giving back - charitable venues - studies that could be done with funding from my gains - though i doubt i would be loaded at this stage, and even if my optimistic hopes transpire i will still save most of my excess earnings for my most ludicrous of goals\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8 year plan - by 10/25 - i have put some more time into expanding my income and ROI in diversified areas - i have continued to put most of my spare time toward expanding my artistic talent and network - though now i have the freedom to take large swathes of time for individual pieces knowing they will find a home etc\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e9 year plan - by 10/26 - many of my ideas have been actualized or at least attempted to their max, all have them have been inspected, i have discovered a large amount about myself through travels and networking, i have now been comfortable calling myself an artist and practiced some forms continually but continuously in general for more than a decade... i am not just an artist but a respected artistic force - this will help tremendously with my 10 year plan\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e10 year plan - by 10/27 - achieve as much as possible of Billy\u0027s Awesome Place\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCrowdfunding for Billy\u2019s Awesome Place!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBilly\u2019s Awesome Place will be pretty cool y\u2019all - open - to ideas and idea-changing and the ever-changing-manifestations of those ideas born of groups freed of groupthink - collaboration - barring the most limiting and contrived of societal expectations but borrowing from the rest of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOtherwise, Billy\u2019s Awesome Place will be complete artistic-ego-anarchy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s important to note that the name is ironic (and subtly so) and not in any way intended to be \u201cmy\u201d awesome legacy. Dot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019ll be kind\u2019ve like Burning Man - not as corporate though or cough\u2026 burned out...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd not ephemeral - not an installation in and of itself - a place - a home. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere opinions are free to differ relentlessly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough I doubt anyone would want to work against the grain in such a place - they couldn\u2019t sway much truth or kind - as it will grow in all directions simultaneously - a think tank of exploratory minds. Looking for the answer, not the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eList of starter ideas: \u003cbr\u003eghetto-bumper-cars, a man paid to be dressed as a minotaur, a roller-coaster attached to a monorail system, gigantic balls of yarn, drums of paint, top-of-the-line printers and camera lenses and a water-rapids-lazy-river-subway-system.. attached to the aforementioned monorail and a gigantic spider web trampoline structure.... near a gigantic system of treehouses and hammocks\u2026 solar panel sculptures\u2026. organically grown yams\u2026 orally held fairytales.. a rundown soviet-era-themed merry-go-round with individual characters and stories for every horse\u2026 campgrounds suitable for refugees in the event of a local emergency of several sorts\u2026 bunks/cabins/teepees for festival-goer types and guests\u2026 modified off road vehicles\u2026 vending machines full of doodads\u2026 tens or perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars of musical equipment depending on scaling\u2026 dedicated farmland with a greenhouse, a chicken coop, hydroponic facilities and renewable energy\u2026 literal beer gardens, literal easter eggs, figurative parades, slightly higher than average kazooing rates, a complete and utter absence of citable policies and mandates, just talking\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003evast swathes of canvas, varied blades and blowtorches\u2019 fire and a BB gun firing range but nothing sketchier\u2026 nothing in the plans at least. some fireworks like 5 times a year max to keep them special\u2026 a cinemax made with sheets and a run-of-the-mill projector\u2026 and the backs of three pickup trucks\u2026 a certified badge-wielding chillness inspector\u2026 who only gives out hugs and massages and whispers nearly silent prayers for you that never seem redundant - they don\u2019t praise or ask of god but simply your time\u2026 unspoken rules that develop your time in time but always conscious of ego... reaching superego by never seeking to be above it, realizing nothing is counter \u2018intuitive\u2019 - we are but a smorgasbord of what we\u2019ve seen\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBilly\u2019s Awesome Place will be Everland. Where everything is possible - if the idea is good enough for traction. If it moves. If it floats. Where someone that just showed up has a voice equal to my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBilly\u2019s Awesome Place may be overrun by freeloading hobos, burnouts, litigious battles, corporate sponsorship after I -too- sell out, horrible work ruined by schizotypal nomads\u2026 but for a moment -at least one- a place will exist that is pure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat remembers we are monkeys while trying to get its hands on the best 3D printers\u2026 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat blows its own glass and grows its own herbs so the earth may be used to inhale itself - and alter the minds of inhabitants made of the same cosmic gas as obsidian - soothing their souls for just long enough to fashion what life means in a day of fired clay - of soylent and water - an ashtray for 5 dollars.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll we need in a spearhead...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor at least one moment\u2026 attach yourself to the thought of a place where one can lose their lower self at home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be a spot for everyone, artists mainly, musicians, sound engineers, roller coaster engineers, class action lawyers, convincing maidens, people tired of editing the obituary section - scanning for small grammatical mistakes that their pupils made for a pittance more than minimum wage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ask you all to come with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo Billy\u2019s Awesome Place - amen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
