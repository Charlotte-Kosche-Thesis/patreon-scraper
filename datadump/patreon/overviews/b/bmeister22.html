    "summary": "We all remember \u003cem\u003eThe Brady\nBunch\u003c/em\u003e as one of the cleanest, most wholesome shows on television. Well, that\u0027s\nno fun right? For the past 6 years, I\u0027ve been giving this iconic\nsitcom a much needed \u201csinister\u201d makeover on my BMeister22 YouTube channel.\u00a0 Through some careful (and somewhat seamless) editing of the visuals and dialogue, these unique webisodes feature the Brady family in a twisted alternative universe where Bobby is addicted to cigarettes, Greg is in love with goats,\u00a0Mr. Brady curses and tells everybody to shut up\u00a0while Alice creates havoc around the Brady household offering up pot cookies, hot dogs and sexual advances to anybody she comes across. It\u0027s\namazing what a little re-editing can do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month, I take a real episode from this \"groovy\" series and create my own webisode, broken down into\n6 or 7 parts \u2013 each running about 1-3 minutes long.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy extremely loyal and supportive fans have been requesting my videos to both come\nout more frequently and be longer in length\u2026.but being that I already work two jobs, my\nfree time is rather limited.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, in order to give the\npeople what they want, I have created this Patreon page as a way for my fans to\nhelp out. The hope is to be able to\ngenerate enough funds to enable me to cut back the hours of my one of my jobs and devote more time to create BMeister22 Brady magic. Goal would be to premiere a new video every week on a set day \u2013 with each one\nrunning approximately 2-4 minutes in length.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs\na thank you to my fans for their support, I will allow them the opportunity to contribute and participate in the creation of these videos.\u00a0 Whether it\u0027s selecting which Brady episode I give the \"BMeister22 treatment\" to or which sound byte(s) they\u0027d like included/repeated or which character they\u0027d like to see more of...I\u0027m opening up the forum to the community.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
