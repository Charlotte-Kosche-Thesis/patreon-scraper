    "summary": "First I want to thank everyone who has been a support for me ministry with different events and for the relationships that came from it. Now In \u003cstrong\u003e2018\u003c/strong\u003e Im moving \u003cstrong\u003eforward in ministry.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e1.I will be creating more \u003cstrong\u003esongs and albums \u003c/strong\u003eand they will be available here on patreon and on your favorite digital outlet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2.With creating all of this music: I would like to have \u003cstrong\u003evideo\u003c/strong\u003es that go with most of the\u003cbr\u003esongs so that you can also have a visual that will tell the story.The videos will be done professionally and on some occasions I will have a \u003cstrong\u003ecastings call\u003c/strong\u003e for those that wish to take part in an opportunity to be in a video. As growth takes place and expansion starts then I would like to\u003cbr\u003ehave \u003cstrong\u003eincentives \u003c/strong\u003efor those who partner with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3.\u003cstrong\u003eCreating more Outreach events\u003c/strong\u003e: I intend on bringing more concerts, resource events, going into the jail/prisons, homeless shelters detention/ juvenile centers ,Outreach events locally and expanding farther out into other cities in Michigan and other states. From the relationships and people the I have build with I will be partnering with them and other agencies to provide an extensive platform of resources that will be beneficial to all. In doing so I will be building a team that will help with these ministry events from artist, ministry leaders, etc..those who Ive teamed up with in the past and currently.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next thing I want to have at these events in something that people can take away with them. Since the majority of the people that these events will be for those who have a lack of resources\u003cbr\u003eand finances I want to have \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eCds, DvDs Appare\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003el ,available at every \u003cstrong\u003eevent and reading material such as, Bibles,Tracts, awareness of the dangers of drugs, Suicide, depression etc..\u003c/strong\u003e..\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will create volunteer opportunities, ministry opportunities\u00a0 with Incentives and potentially some former offenders can do community service work depending on the event and location.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePlease keep sowing into the ministry if you have not yet consider sowing a seed to further the\u003cbr\u003eministry that I may continue bringing Hope Faith and Love to the city of Jackson and abroad.\u003cbr\u003eCheck out this Good read Its a true story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFood For Thought true story\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink about how you just created something that was so in touch and engaging with another person. So much that it brought them to tears and stirred something up in them. That person is a million miles away and they email you and say I wanna let you know I started my day with your song your music is always with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine having that happen to you in person and someone says you created exactly what I needed and says thank you as they are crying and just hugs you. It has all happened to me and I was literally in shock and awe. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt makes me think of what that person was or is going through and how this openhearted, transparent local musician had a personal encounter with them. I will put my heart on the table and tell about my divorce,addiction, depression the attempts to take myself out or any struggle that I had in my life and how it was only by Gods grace that I made the transition and didn\u0027t give up. That Ive made it Ive changed and that anyone can make it as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne person and one community at a time Im able to reach someone and make an impact on there life and actually break the barriers to begin building friendship with plenty people, to be an example and change lives. This is why your contribution is so important, this is why I must keep going, this is what I was created to do. Help me to continue to create life changing music not just to put it on the internet but to share it everywhere live and in person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for all your support blessings.\u003cbr\u003e"

Also an active leader in the church and a volunteer peer supporter at a substance abuse recovery center called the Home Of New Vision. Im also a part of the Jackson area recovery community to assist in ways to create awareness about the substance use disorder in our state and beyond. \u003cbr\u003eMusic style is cinematic or theatrical like a film score with words.  The inspiration behind the music is a big part of my life.  Its a story of how times will be tough, you will feel like you want to give in and give up on everything. Ive went through times when It was hard for me to provide for my family I talk about that. Times when I thought that all was lost all my flaws, faults, failures and rough times in marriage and divorce I talk about that.  I know that I went through some of these trials for a reason. Someone else may have went through the same or had a similar situation and I want to be transparent in my music.\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to take a look into my life and in my heart listen to my music and let me engage with you on a level where I can speak hope and love into you life.\u003cbr\u003e",
