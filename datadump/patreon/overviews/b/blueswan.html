Staying informed while knowing what to respond to, and how to respond, is so overwhelming that disengagement, distraction, and exhaustion are now as great a barrier to change as any corrupt politician or exploitative corporation.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePolitical news coverage has become increasingly muddied by the need for publications and outlets to generate ad revenue while also chasing the over-simplified hot-take culture favored by social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. This has led to stories with sensationalist headlines that emphasize drama over fact and news analysis written by people with a dozen other stories on their plate.\u00a0And now, with Donald Trump wreaking havoc on the norms and standards of traditional news reporting, all of these problems have become amplified tenfold. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBut it doesn\u0027t have to be this way. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI believe we can do better and so I have created\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://blueswan.net\"\u003eBlue Swan\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Scroll down to the FAQ for an explanation of the name)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBlue Swan is about bringing greater scrutiny, rigor, and utility to news reporting and political education. The mission is make it as easy as possible to prioritize the day\u0027s news while giving you the option to delve deeper if a story resonates with you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTo do this right also means to refuse to participate in the \"BREAKING NEWS\"-style reporting that dominates the news cycle. Rather than update throughout the day before any real information has come to light or any real analysis is possible, I will bring you the top stores from across the globe at the end of the workday, allowing time for proper analysis and context to develop.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eOnce Blue Swan is fully up and running these news posts will happen five days a week. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy goal as a reporter and analyst is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e to keep you locked into reading articles on Blue Swan, nor is it to generate clicks or to stir up controversy. My goal is to get you to the information you want as simply as possible and then let YOU decide your level of engagement.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDo you just want to know if a story is actually worth panicking over?\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ll make that clear before you even read the first paragraph.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDo you want a detailed assessment of a story\u0027s threat level with potential follow-up actions to address it?\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ll have you covered. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDo you want a holistic approach to political analysis where the reality of climate change, the demands for global justice, and the needs for economic stability are all considered in the story\u0027s breakdown? \u003c/strong\u003eThat is what I will be bringing to every news item covered on Blue Swan.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re wondering what this will look like in practice, Blue Swan is now up and running.

I believe this funding model to be essential for ensuring ongoing accountability and trust between myself (and any others who may join the site) and the readers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs different funding goals are met I will be able to expand the functionality and content provided by Blue Swan. This can mean additional content like features outside of news reporting, such as guides or events coverage, to bringing on new writers or adding tech support. All of these decisions - how Blue Swan grows and what changes get prioritized - will be directed by feedback from Patreon supporters. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat this site becomes, and what needs it serves, is to up to you. My commitment to every reader and supporter going forward is that Blue Swan will prioritize accountability, transparency, and journalistic integrity above all else. \u003cstrong\u003eYour support will mean that this site can exist and grow in a way that does justice to the mission of bringing a more productive, more responsible, and more adaptive news platform to the political landscape.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eIn solidarity and service,\u003cbr\u003eBen Sayler \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eFAQ\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eWhy\u0027s it called Blue Swan?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eThe name Blue Swan is adapted from the theory of Black Swan events put forth by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. The theory says that many of the pivotal moments in history were high-impact events that history couldn\u0027t predict and that were later rationalized as explainable and predictable. Climate change would seem to be just such an event, only of a scale and impact unlike anything humans have faced before. Because the scope of climate change encompasses all news and human affairs, and because of the ecological nature of this crisis, I have chosen the name Blue Swan. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I just want to donate a single amount?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eI may allow for one time donations at some point in the future, but for now there are a couple reasons I\u0027ve chosen to allow for support exclusively through Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFor one, the site\u0027s expenses will be relatively consistent from month to month. There\u0027s no physical product being sold and there\u0027s never any shortage of news to cover. The budgetary demands of the site are tied directly to my living costs and the costs of maintaining the necessary subscriptions/maintenance costs for managing a website. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving a consistent, reliable source of monthly donations helps me to determine how much money I\u0027ll need to earn from outside work. By relying exclusively on recurring donations I can plan further in advance and budget for site maintenance and future additions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe other reason I\u0027m not allowing for one-time donations at this time is that funding the site entirely through Patreon makes financial transparency simple and clean. At any time, any reader can visit this page and see exactly how much money the site is generating. While there are certainly ways of providing this information, having Blue Swan\u0027s financial support happen entirely through Patreon makes keeping transparency a breeze.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf at some point down the line this policy changes it will be reflected on this page.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is a lot of work for just one person, how are you going to keep up?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eIt\u0027s true that running the technical side of Blue Swan while also editing and producing all of the content will be a lot of work. At the same time, this project has been in development for a while and I\u0027ve had plenty of opportunities to hone my process for keeping it up and running.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, the initial idea for Blue Swan came about a little over three years ago. Since then it\u0027s gone through many unpublished iterations as I worked what I wanted the site to become and how I would approach writing for it. Throughout Blue Swan\u0027s development, I have received, and continue to receive, a great deal of support and assistance from friends and colleagues who have donated their time and skills as editors, coding experts, and artistic consultants. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis launch is a culmination of all those years of effort and countless generous contributions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePutting out content on this site five days a week will be a full-time 40-50 hour (or more) a week job, but at this point, the process behind that work is a well-oiled machine. I\u0027m fully prepared to maintain Blue Swan at that level for the foreseeable future while also continuing to expand the site with new and exciting features!\u003cbr\u003e"
