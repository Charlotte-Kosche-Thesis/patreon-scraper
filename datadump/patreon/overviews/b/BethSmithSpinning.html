    "summary": "Textiles seem to be in my blood. I\u0027m the granddaughter of a dress factory pattern maker and daughter of a woman who sewed professionally my entire life. I remember going to Philadelphia to buy fabric for some wedding or other that my mother was going to outfit and touching all of the gorgeous silks, satins, laces, cottons and wools. They felt so good on my hands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI followed in their footsteps for a little while as a dressmaker and a quiltmaker. I was also an avid cross stitcher and tried my hand at hardanger for a while, I knit and tried my hand at a bit of Irish Crochet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpinning is my true love. I always have questions. I have notebooks filled with questions and goals about my spinning.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years after I learned to spin I did a bit of weaving. These two began to come together for me when I began to ask questions like, \"I wonder how different fabrics would compare if they were made from different sheep breeds with everything else being equal.\" I started working on what became known as the Great Skirt Project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, I have spun, woven and sewn 3 skirts and a dress over the last 3 years. But I have a ton more questions and so many more things to try.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping that with this Patreon I can take you with me on this journey to discover some things about spinning for weaving that I can\u0027t seem to find in books. I\u0027d like to share what I\u0027m learning and also have you help me ask the questions that will guide my study in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour help in all of this will help me write my next book and continue what I love to do which is learning about and teaching about spinning and weaving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so thankful for people who have hired me or taken my classes, shopped at the Spinning Loft when I owned it,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bethsmithspinning.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eread my blog\u003c/a\u003e and follow me everywhere on social media. You all have given me the courage to move forward with this thing that has been in my mind for so long."
