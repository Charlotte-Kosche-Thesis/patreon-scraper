Much of my platform is dedicated to encouraging black women to feel free to pursue quality men and relationships irrespective of race. Character over color is our mantra!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe business of empowering black women has never been more important. Beyond Black \u0026amp;White\u0027s blog and You Tube channel has been instrumental in changing the lives of countless black girls and women who have needed to hear there was a better way to navigate through life. We\u0027ve even been responsible for quite a few engagements and marriages!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe need you help more than ever before. We the advertising debacle happening on You Tube, ad sales have gone way down.

If you love what you do, and you provide a service to people who need and enjoy it, shouldn\u0027t the people be supported?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBeing a patron for Beyond Black \u0026amp; White gets you tons of perks!
