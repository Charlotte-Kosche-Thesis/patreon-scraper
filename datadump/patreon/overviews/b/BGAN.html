Not to say you won\u0027t get anything out of it, as I do have some perks if you\u0027re willing to drop the right amount.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, for the uninitiated or the new visitors to my particular brand of nonsense, let me lay it out plainly. I\u0027m a movie critic who takes most things with the largest grain of salt imaginable. Like, so large it could crush us all to death. Imagine the horrified screams as salty death comes down upon the hopeless masses. They all look up, wishing for some kind of hero to save them. Isn\u0027t that lovely? Anyway, I talk about movies. Bad movies, mostly, but I generally cover whichever films spark my fancy or are required for me to cover by obligation. In truth though, I see myself mostly as an entertainer. I\u0027m here to make you smile, snicker, guffaw, bwahahaha, and generally chuckle so hard that you toss your unguarded young into a wood-chipper due to a lack of being able to control your body from said laughter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also talk about other things in the geek purview such as comics, games, and toys. At the behest of others, I have even started recording myself playing games for my YouTube channel. Some people hate me for my views, some love me for them, and others just love watching me poke at angry bears until they blindly maul themselves.\u003cbr\u003e"
