    "summary": "BristolFurs Management is a group of local furs who currently run the monthly Bristol Furmeets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started out in 2016 as a small group of like-minded individuals who rekindled the local meet and a few months later grew to become the BristolFurs as it is now known. We have since been growing into something more and more wonderful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started out in the Knights Templar, a small Wetherspoons next to Temple Meads station, and quickly our numbers grew. Towards the end of 2016 we found a new venue, The King William Ale House. It was a nice little pub which also offered us an exclusive space, with good drinks and food.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever our numbers have kept on rising fast, and we are now regularly hosting over 70 attendees and completely filling out our space. This means that we\u0027ve had to find a new, larger venue. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur search has ended with us moving to Bordeaux Quay, next to Millenium Square. A much bigger and brighter space, with better access. More room for mingling and a larger fursuit changing area. (Plus, WiFi too!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this larger venue also comes a large cost. The King William was kind enough to provide their space to us at no extra cost, but the new venue asks for payment to rent their space. While the cost isn\u0027t much, running the meets every month would still add up to an amount too much for us to handle without support. We\u0027re afraid that if we can\u0027t get support from our attendee base, then we may have to move back into a smaller venue and have to start limiting the number of people who can attend. And that\u0027s something we would like to completely avoid if possible.\u003cbr\u003eWe as the organisers may plan these events, but it is the attendees who give us a reason to put them on in the first place. And we want to be able to keep providing them for everyone to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003eWe are all very thankful of our attendees for your continued support and hope we can provide you all with events worth returning too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePLEASE NOTE:\u003cbr\u003eThis does not mean we are charging anyone for entry to our monthly meets. We have never asked anyone for any fee to attend them, and we certainly don\u0027t intend on starting too either.\u003cbr\u003eWe want the meets to stay free for everyone, forever.\u003cbr\u003eThe Patreon is just a means for anyone who wishes to regularly help us out with funding the events we run while also getting some kick back while doing so. If you don\u0027t want to support us on Patreon but still wish to donate to our costs you may do so in person or via the PayPal Donate link on our website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny rewards will only be issued once a payment has been charged by Patreon. (The Regular Sponsorship rewards are an exception.)\u003cbr\u003e"
