I\u0027m a YouTuber from Poland, currently living in the UK. Inspired by the likes of Jim Sterling and Danny O\u0027Dwyer, my long time dream was to become a creator specialising in video essays and gaming content, without having to rely on advertisements or sponsorship from shady corporations, while retaining full creative freedom over my work. Now I set out to make this dream a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy vision is to continue doing what I currently do, but on a much larger scale with plenty of room to expand: informative videos that analyse games I\u0027m interested in, podcasts on various topics, occasional video skits and other comedy, perhaps even some interviews with people from the gaming industry (if I can establish the connections required to get in contact with more of them). Think of it as a very laid back form of independent games journalism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut in order to accomplish even a fraction of these plans, I will need your help. My life has taken some unexpected turns recently, which I talk about in the video on my channel, leaving me unable to cover many expenses at this moment. Moreover, the more of my vision I want to achieve, the greater these expenses will become.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current computer has been crashing for ages; I should think about buying a PlayStation 4 console to diversify my content; new game releases are priced ridiculously highly these days; there is the problem of costly recording equipment; travel expenses to cover any ambitious documentary-style videos with interviews I would like to create at some point; the costs of starting and continuing new series; paying for any assistance from professionals and other collaborators; and so on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s where you come in. If you like my videos and want to express more gratitude than a thumbs up, a comment, a share, or a subscription - then I would really appreciate you becoming my patron. I don\u0027t want to split my viewers up too much, but you will gain access to some bonus content as outlined on the right and will also be helping me greatly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether we can turn these plans into reality... so let\u0027s do this! :D"
