Welcome \u0026amp; deepest gratitude for visiting Beth Quist\u0027s new patreon site. I\u0027ll be taking baby steps to get this up \u0026amp; running, but I\u0027m hopeful \u0026amp; excited about how this platform is working. Intro video will come shortly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided on this platform for many reasons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOne is that I don\u0027t want to be limited to a one time project such as an album. I love to constantly create, \u0026amp; like the enticement of the journey rather than just a single goal. Just like a piece of music, it\u0027s about every note \u0026amp; expression along the way, not just about getting to the end. Patreon is all inclusive. The songs along the way that will fill an album to share with everyone.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnother is that as a permaculture designer \u0026amp; deep lover of the Natural world, I\u0027d like to lessen my footprint \u0026amp; find ways to make a living closer to home with music that also allows me to put energy into my own surroundings with regenerative agriculture \u0026amp; local environmental protection.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI would like to utilize the videos \u0026amp; this community to network \u0026amp; plan so that when I do tour it is both efficient, fun, \u0026amp; supported. I will include patreon perks when I am in your region\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eYour pledges will help in many ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchase \u0026amp; maintenance of musical instruments.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchase \u0026amp; upkeep of video \u0026amp; audio recording gear \u0026amp; software\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelping to keep food in my system \u0026amp; shelter over my head which helps to maintain my most important musical instrument, the body, which includes my voice.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHiring videographers \u0026amp; audio engineers with far better equipment, knowledge, \u0026amp; skill than I have.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHiring other musicians, dancers, animators, film makers, artists to collaborate with.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFunding education that I can expand my own skills with which I will be able to share even more with you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpkeep of my website.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGiving me more time to practice \u0026amp; rehearse in order to give you the highest quality musical experience.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe music itself is always free. It is all these other technical items that go into releasing it out into the world that require money in the current paradigm.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIf you\u0027d like to know more about me, here\u0027s my short bio:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeth Quist is a multi-instrumentalist, vocalist, and composer, who began playing piano at age 2. She was lead soprano and instrumentalist for the creation band in Cirque du Soleil\u0027s \"KA\", and currently performs solo, with Sherefe which specializes in Balkan and Middle Eastern music. She has sung \u0026amp; toured with Bobby McFerrin\u0027s Voicestra since 1997, and appears on his albums \"Circlesongs\", \"Mouth Music\", and \"VOCAbuLarieS\". Beth has also composed over 50 scores for dance, theater, television, \u0026amp; film, including musical contributions to the Emmy nominated documentary \"The Two Escobars\". Other notable musical collaborations include Roger Fisher (Heart) \u0026amp; Scott Cossu (Windham Hill).\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHer early musical influences were \"Batman,\" \"Star Trek,\" and \"Dr. Zhivago.\" \"I\u0027m a Little Leopard Prowling Around in Sneakers\" was her first musical composition at age 8.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShe has a 4-octave soprano voice, and plays piano, keyboards, santour (hammered dulcimer), dumbek, daff, guitar, flute, and various other toys that she can get her hands on. Her music combines influences from the Balkans, the Middle East, and India with her Western upbringing. \u003ca href=\"http://www.bethquist.com\"\u003ewww.bethquist.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the days, months, years to come I am psyched at the potential for growth \u0026amp; creativity. Thank you all so much who are helping me get this started, \u0026amp; may we laugh together on the way as I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll have plenty of goof up moments. Thank you for your patience \u0026amp; understanding as I learn \u0026amp; work my way through this curve. It\u0027s both exciting \u0026amp; a little daunting, but I\u0027m determined.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCZDuqKOyWM\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCZDuqKOyWM\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
