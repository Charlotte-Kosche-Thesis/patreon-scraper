I\u0027m Jess, a sculptural illustrator and writer from sunny SoCal living in Hotlanta, Georgia.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter growing up watching my mother create carpet to ceiling fairytale-themed murals in my childhood bedroom and later combing through the pages of her sketchbooks, watercolor and sculpture feel like coming home to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last year or so, I\u0027ve shared a bit of my process with you all, let you peek in on a painting or two, and your encouragement and kind words have been so motivating and inspirational that I wanted to share another way you can help support me while I give you an even greater look into my art making process and final pieces. I\u0027m currently collaborating on several illustrated children\u0027s books and have a bunch of personal projects I want to work on, and I\u0027m going to share that journey with every single one of you that want to join in. I will post development sketches, sneak peeks, works in progress, and at least one exclusive Patreon illustration or sculptural illustration per month. I\u0027ll also host biweekly Periscope sessions to answer any questions you may have or to do a live-painting episode. For those who are able and willing to pledge a little bit extra, I will do a drawing so that one of you per month gets a painting of your choice (which I will ship to your address).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo those who\u0027ve already been supporting me and my art, thank you thank you thank you. I\u0027ll never be able to say it enough. Your support means the world to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo those who want to support and encourage or want to continue to support and encourage via Patreon, thank you thank you thank you! Hope you enjoy this journey with me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s time for some art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eXoxo, \u003cem\u003eJess\u003c/em\u003e"
