    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhen I first started my YouTube channel, the goal was to grow to a point where I would be able to travel the world and complete every sporting event possible, whilst taking those who are less fortunate along with me to provide happiness\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support on my video uploads, we can accomplish that goal together!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSome of you may know this, others may not, but I have previously suffered depression and continuously struggle with mental health. Through this, the only thing in my life that makes me happy, and puts a smile on my face, is to watch sport and feel the raw passion, energy and atmosphere of live sporting events. With that being said, creating Game Day Experience vlogs make me happy! I see all the comments saying how much they love the videos, fans asking me to travel to different games in different places, and to know you put a smile on someone else\u0027s face, when they could potentially be going through a rough time behind the computer, is the main focus that continues to drive my channel.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSport is all about loyalty and family, and each team along with their supporters have a different story that needs to be told. Yes, my videos majority of the time involve a specific game, however, there\u0027s always different stories to be told, different feelings around the club, different locations to see and an unlimited amount of moments to experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m ready to take the next step with my content, but I can\u0027t do it without your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs you will have been able to see, in 2018, i\u0027ve already begun travelling for different games along with improving the general quality with a brand new style of content. Rather than just attending the game, i\u0027ve slowly included scenic shots of the City/Suburb in which the game is being played, so that it represents the club itself, the fans get a better idea of what they would experience if they were to travel there, and it ultimately dramatically improves the quality of viewing.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI desire to travel more, I desire to show experiences from unseen places, I desire to take the channel to a new level by providing quality content throughout multiple countries showcasing different sports, no matter how big or small they can be. The style of content I want to produce is becoming a much larger production project than what I can currently financially sustain, this is where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBy becoming a Patron, your contribution will directly provide you with higher quality production on BKRsport YouTube. The help you provide will allow me to showcase world sport, in ways that have not been done before, and with your help, I can travel the world telling the stories of each club, each league, each sport and each supporter!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNot only will their be higher quality production, but there are multiple rewards you can unlock with your monthly pledge!\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese include behind-the-scenes footage from Game Day Experience vlogs, blooper reels, shout out videos, detailed schedule of BKRsport for which games are going to be attended and the ability to send me to a game of your choice!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTake a look at the sidebar to see a full list of rewards!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBKRsport is \u003cstrong\u003eNOTHING \u003c/strong\u003ewithout the fans!
