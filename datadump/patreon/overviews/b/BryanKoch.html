    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Bryan Koch. I create card and board games, and I do everything from the initial concept to the final art. It is a one man show, slow-going at times because of all the little details that go into making a game, but I love every minute of it. I do all of it on my own free time and I publish with a print-on-demand company. My costs are minimal for what I do now, but there are some big dreams I have that I would like to share with all of you.\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, I would like to get my games into the hands of more game reviewers. The costs here can vary wildly based on the cost of producing and shipping the game, and whether or not a particular reviewer charges for their services. Some are happy just to get a free game, while others have a stack of games they will never have time to play, and review exclusively as their vocation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, I would like to see one of my games in a retail store. Speaking with multiple game store owners, it is pretty standard that the store would pay me half of what they end up charging people for my game. To keep prices reasonable for the end consumer, I need to be able to buy my games at lower prices, which is achieved through bulk orders. The more copies I can buy at one time, the less each copy costs me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAll of my games can be found at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.thegamecrafter.com/designers/bryan-koch\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTheGameCrafter.com/designers/bryan-koch\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
