Without the tyrannical rule of giant, power-hungry monsters, mortalkind has built a modern, magitek society full of technological wonders.  However, all is not well.  Magic is starting to fail with increasing frequently, even in the major city of Aslan.  To top it off, strange new storms that create massive clouds of black dust are appearing over the countryside, and there are rumors that these dust clouds hide monsters.  While the citizens struggle, the government seems more concerned with building newer, bigger weapons- a paranoid response to already tense international relations.  \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e  Into this mess falls Karl, a man with too many of his own problems to care about the world\u2019s, and his friend J, a man convinced he has what it takes to save the world.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"\"\u003eHuman Skin\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e is the story of two men who try to fix the world, and wind up making it much worse.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/275ceb07d86c0aa14cc86e00842d51ed/tumblr_o904klOjye1sjkeulo1_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
