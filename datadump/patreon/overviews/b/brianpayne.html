    "summary": "Brian Payne is a cartoonist from beneath the underground and the creator of Zinc Comics. Zinc Comics is a unique style like Cool Jazz, Pop Art, and/or Gonzo Journalism. The Zinc Comics Group includes numerous \u201cnetcomix\u201d as well as a series of periodicals self-published under Payne\u2019s own Darshan Studios imprint. Brian was born in Ottumwa, Iowa (just like \u201cRadar O\u2019Reilly\u201d) but currently lives with his wife, Skywalker, in Homer, Alaska, \u201cthe Cosmic Hamlet by the Sea.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nArtists have always had their patrons and there have always been patrons of the arts. Brian is now asking those who have enjoyed his \u201cZinc Comics\u201d for free in the past for their patronage at this time. For just a few dollars per month you can make a great difference in the creative life of this comic artist. Only a few dollars per month would make Brian Payne \"your cartoonist.\u201d Your sponsorship dollars will help put food on the table, keep a roof over his head, provide necessary medical care, purchase art supplies, and further subsidize his meager existence. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile every act of kindness is in itself its own reward, those who offer their support to Payne\u2019s current creative endeavors on an ongoing monthly basis will also receive special bonuses based upon their pledge amount. You can choose from our $1, $5, $10, or $20 pledge options. Please choose whichever suits your monthly budget and hearts desire.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for your consideration and patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll Zinc Comics \u00a9 2017 - 2018 Brian Payne\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e"
