    "summary": "Hello. My name is Mark Davian\u00a0from BeyondIntimacy.com\u00a0and if you\u2019re reading this then you\u2019ve likely reached the end of one of my articles. I\u2019m a pleasure activist,  relationship coach and sex educator who writes about sex positive approaches to relationships, dating, erotic fulfillment and wellbeing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEach month I publish indepth articles that address how different aspects of having a pleasurable, sex positive life marked by meaningful intimacy. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhether you\u0027re single, partnered, monogamous or having casual sex, and whatever your sexual orientation, my articles and resources will help you increase your happiness, intimacy, pleasure, confidence and self-esteem.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also produce other in depth materials and classes aimed to be economical and affordable. While many of my colleagues charge $500, $1,000 and more for similar programs, I believe that even those who don\u0027t have a lot of money deserve opportunities and support for learning and growth, too. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOn top of this - with only rare exceptions - Patreon members will always get these either free or for a generous discount not available elsewhere. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo pay for spending so much of my time on writing and publishing material that\u0027s freely available, I\u2019m using a platform called Patreon that allows readers to subscribe to my content. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile I plan to publish most of my indepth articles for free, it\u0027s the support of readers like you who will make this ongoingly possible. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have no current plans to overwhelm my articles with advertising. That means if you want to keep reading the articles I\u2019m writing, please help me pay for it the many hours it takes to do this. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs part of the Patreon team, you\u0027ll also have direct access to me at any time.  While sometimes I have a lot of incoming messages, I will prioritize communication with you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo subscribe today. If you end up not being satisfied with my writing, then it\u2019s incredibly easy to log back into Patreon and cancel your subscription. Thank you for reading, and I look forward to sending my first article to your email inbox.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThanks for your Support! You\u0027re Helping Make a Difference for Others\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is your invitation to be part of something that makes a difference\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCan you afford the cost of a cup of coffee each month?  That would make a difference. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMaybe you\u0027ve been blessed and you\u0027d like to joyfully contribute the cost of a lunch or dinner, or more.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMaybe you\u0027d like to be a part of a movement that inspires people toward more pleasure, joy, intimacy, connection and fulfillment.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can have a part in making this sustainable and to help those who cannot afford one on one help, whether due to limited funds, disability, retirement, or being from a poor or developing country. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u0027s an ancient spiritual teaching that a vision as big as this requires a team, a band of people who will put their loving intention, their positive energy, and some resources behind it. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA shared intention around a vision multiplies the power of it. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAre You a Pleasure Activist?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWould you like for our world, for people to be happier, more connected in their relationships, to have more sexual pleasure and to love themselves more, then this is for you.\u00a0\nIt\u0027s a way to stand up and be counted for something that matters. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPause and check in your heart\u2026.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDoes this vision speak to you as something you want to be part of?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIs that worth the cost of a cup of coffee to you?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf so, then please sign up here and help at a level that you feel good about. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003eThanks for joining the Beyond Intimacy Patreon Team and making a difference!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAbout Patreon\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPattreon is a crowdfunding site, sort of like Kickstarter. They blend the ancient concept of patronage that supports the arts with modern technology via bite size monthly donations. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon works on a monthly system because the bills for doing this work (web hosting, sending emails, backups, other technology) and the time to manage it have to be paid monthly, in addition to investing large amoungs of time into the writing and creating resources.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis model makes things possible that would never be funded by a big corporation with deep pockets.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s your way to vote for something you like and find helpful. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt would make a real difference in my ability to continue doing this ongoingly. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n Whether you \"buy Mark a coffee,\" or contribute $1 a month or $10,000, every person who joins the Beyond Intimacy Patreon team makes a real difference.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eOther Questions and Answers\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat expenses does this go toward?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOngoing monthly expenses for Beyond Intimacy include hosting, technology, graphic design, email \u0026amp; social media management, publishing costs and other fees in addition to lots of focused time and energy spent writing and creating.   \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat about book royalties?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou may or may not know that in recent years the publsihing industry has changed radically. It is going in a direciton similar to the music industry.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThese days the author needs to pay out of pocket all the costs of book publishing, editing and design, artwork and printing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso, royalties are much lower than ever in the past.  The advent of subscription based services like Kindle Unlimited is pushing them even lower. This is the  same thing that streaming music has done to musicians royalities\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe good news here is that in our modern era it\u0027s easier to find and connect with likeminded people, create community and develop resources together.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt was not that long ago that finding sex positive resources for erotic explorers was extremely difficult.   Much of the material I write is so highly specialized that a traditional book publisher would not be interested. But now it\u0027s possible to share it with many people including you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat about coaching income?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe more time I spend coaching the less time and energy I have for writing and creating resources.  While the topics, material and approach are similar, the energy is very different. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOne of the reasons most practitioners only offer sessions is they don\u0027t have to plan ahead, they only need to show up and interact with a client. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWriting something that helps people grow and improve their relationships and erotic life is very different. It requires a deeper understanding of people\u0027s concerns. Then comes the process of creating structured material that guides through through a learning a change process.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile I will continue to offer limited slots for coaching, because I believe it is one of the most effective means of change, healing and growth, it is also true that many people cannot afford it. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe those who cannot afford one on one help still deserve help and guidance.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat about Youtube monetization\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s true that some people start Youtube channels and are able to monetize them through advertising.  Since this is like music royalties it usually requires years of building up an extremely large audience. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo get any noticeable income with this method usually requires extremely short videos and a focus on entertainment rather than helpful education.\u00a0 On top of this, Youtube forbids monetization of adult content, even  sex positive educational material.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThank you! :)\u003c/h3\u003e"
