     "about": "\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;Singer-songwriter, visual artist, poet, and activist, Brittney Chantele aspires for her music and poetry to inspire people emotionally, mentally, and physically. Drawing inspiration from artists such as Nahko and Medicine for the People, Rising Appalachia, Dead Prez, Kendrick Lamar, Chance The Rapper, Mick Jenkins, and Luka Lesson, she describes her style as \"movement music\" or \"movement poetry\", meaning that it can begin or carry a social movement.\u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003eBorn in Staten Island, NY, and raised in Pittsburgh, PA, Brittney developed an early admiration for several different styles of music, looking up to artists such as Michael Jackson, Nas, Amy Winehouse, Bob Marley, and Destiny\u0027s Child. Growing up, Brittney was always involved in musical endeavors, participating in band, chorus, ensemble, and playing a number of instruments such as the trumpet and the shakers, and dabbling in wooden flute, ukulele, piano, and hand percussion. Although she began writing lyrics and poems around the age of 10, Brittney didn\u0027t officially start recording until February 2016. The first original song she recorded was \"R.I.S.E\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can easily find social and environmental justice movements as well as making a change/difference as recurring themes in her work. Speaking on issues such as these is what separates her from other hip hop artists, which is demonstrated by her hit single \"Frack You.\" When she performs this song, she wants people to understand that fracking is not just an issue for a few places. Instead, it\u0027s an issue for everyone. Brittney wrote this song because she wants people to start taking action and questioning their local government leaders on what is really going on in their cities and towns when it comes to fracking. She wants them to demand answers. Brittney enlisted in the military in order to serve her country; however, she now realizes the impact of military \"brainwashing\" and uses her experience to inform her art and activism. Furthermore, having earned a degree in criminal justice from Edinboro University has provided Brittney with an insight into police brutality, which is another common theme in her music and other art forms. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBrittney has performed at numerous venues in Pittsburgh such as The Smiling Moose, The Mr. Roboto Project, Glitterbox Theater, Studio AM, James Street Gastropub, Ace Hotel, Cattivo, BOOM Concepts, Spirit, and LOCAL 412. She has also graced the stage at Nelson Ledges Quarry Park in Ohio, as well as The Vic Theater in Chicago. Past projects include the \"Peace, Love, \u0026amp; Hope\" Issue 1 poetry zine/chapbook, \"Bittersweet Symphony\" poetry EP, \"Faith in Humanity\" EP, and the single, \"Operator.\" Working and performing with artists like Chase Makai, Gipsy Moon Band, Princess Jafar, and Avi Diamond. Brittney continues to grow her fan base across regional and demographic boundaries.\u003cbr\u003e",
