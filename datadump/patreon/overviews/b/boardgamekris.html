Several of my games have been considered by board game publishers (the latest, \u003cem\u003eJarl\u003c/em\u003e, seen in the picture above, has recently won a prize in Polish publisher\u0027s\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eGalakta\u0027s\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0contest). I also have three years of experience in the video game industry, having designed and co-designed games such as \u003cem\u003eAbyss: The Wraiths of Eden\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eTime Mysteries: The Final Enigma\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eDeadly Puzzles: Toymaker\u003c/em\u003e.

You can see their work on the picture above (the art for\u00a0\u003cem\u003eJarl\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0was created by two artists and a third prepared the entire thing for printing).\u00a0One of my long-term goals is to get them on board as my collaborators, so by supporting me, you\u0027ll also have the chance to support a few other people!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS: all the Design Diaries are published to this channel: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/BoardGameKris\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/BoardGameKris\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
