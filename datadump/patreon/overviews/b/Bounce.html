    "summary": "Hey Everyone! My name is Chuck Collins and I\u0027m a Cartoonist/Illustrator based in NYC. Its been a life long dream of mine to make comics and animation for a living. I\u0027ve worked professionally for various animation studios throughout the city over the past decade or so. But my real passion and goal is to put out my own work at the best quality i can produce. For years i\u0027ve worked as a bouncer in the city and it\u0027s had its good times and head aches.... lots of head aches. Most of those head aches turned into stories and I slapped some comedy on to it and made my webcomic BOUNCE! I\u0027ve been doing it for two years and i\u0027ve never been happier producing art. But the kicker is that i still have to earn a living. I still work as a bouncer but I would love nothing more to keep making the BOUNCE webcomic and earn a living doing so. That\u0027s where you come into play. With your support i\u0027ll be able to cover simple costs that provide supplies, printing, and the occasional bottle of whiskey to get my creative juices flowing.\u00a0As great as it is to work on this webcomic, it\u0027s been a lot of work. I\u0027ve put it out consistently with close to no financing for almost 2 years. The more you donate, the more i can work on BOUNCE full time. My ultimate goal is to create animated episodes for BOUNCE! Here are some samples of what you\u0027ll be supporting:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.bouncethecomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bounce-03.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.bouncethecomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bounce-OSW-1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.bouncethecomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BOUNCE-OSWW-093.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.bouncethecomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Bounce-27.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.bouncethecomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Bounce-32.jpg\"\u003e"

From 1999 till 2008 I worked in animation for places like Augenblick Studios, Viacom, and Animation Collective. I\u0027ve self published a few comics and one graphic novel under my company RatRonin studios. Though, even before that time and up until the present, I\u0027ve worked as a bouncer. I\u0027ve seen and experienced a lot working the most grungy dive bars in the NYC nightlife, which is how BOUNCE! was created. Often when I went out drinking with friends, I tell them about the insane customers I\u0027ve dealt with, so I decided to tell the stories and share them with the world in the form of a webcomic",
