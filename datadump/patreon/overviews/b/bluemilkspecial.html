Leanne is an artist (\u003ca href=\"http://www.leannehannah.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.leannehannah.com\u003c/a\u003e) and part time writer. Together we form Voltron... No wait... Together we are a husband and wife comic creating duo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLeanne and I love storytelling, which is why we have wanted to work together for so long. Since 2009 we have produced the popular webcomic\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.bluemilkspecial.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBlue Milk Special\u003c/a\u003e, a sci-fi parody focusing on following the original Star Wars trilogy and expanded universe material. We have always produced the project for free to fellow fans and continue to do so while trying to fit it into our busy lives. \u00a0We are about to begin a brand new webcomic.\u00a0However, Blue Milk Special remains dear to us and many of our readers, which is where Patreon comes in...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY USE PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon offers readers a way to support the artists they love with a regular subscription to their work. It\u0027s basically like an ongoing Kickstarter campaign, where you can pledge to give us an amount which you specify every time we release a new piece of content (a webcomic strip). \u00a0Don\u0027t worry, you can set a maximum amount in case you\u0027re worried about spending too much in a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust so you all know, WE ARE NOT SUDDENLY CHARGING YOU FOR BLUE MILK SPECIAL CONTENT, IT IS STILL FREE.  We are just asking for help and Patreon offers a way for those of you who can afford to support us to do so. \u00a0At the same time, you\u0027ll have a much closer connection to us and receive a lot of exclusive Patreon only Blue Milk Special content and perks to show our appreciation. \u00a0Want to see Boba Fett beyond the Sarlacc pit? \u00a0Support us and let us know what you want more or less of. \u00a0We will listen and we want be able to chat with fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we can get some extra help financially, then it makes the project easier and provides an additional incentive for Leanne and myself to create new strips more frequently.  That means more content for you guys. \u00a0All readers will benefit, but Patreon supporters will get extra good stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u0027s\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars?\u003cbr\u003eNO - Pay in any currency! As this is US based website, everything is written in Dollars, but you can use any currency and it will be automatically converted. And PAYPAL is now accepted!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow many BLUE MILK SPECIAL strips do you create a month?\u003cbr\u003eAround 7 or 8, depending on the amount of weeks in that month. We post every Monday and Friday on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.bluemilkspecial.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.bluemilkspecial.com\u003c/a\u003e but we will also put them here to view in the \"ACTIVITY\" section, which is where you will also see all the \"PATREON Supporters only\" content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have much money, can I still become a Patron? \u003cbr\u003eYes, please only sign up to donate what you can easily afford. Even $1 per month will make a huge difference and would be greatly appreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan I stop donating , increase, or decrease my donation?\u003cbr\u003eYes of course! If you can\u0027t afford to donate in the future, or you want to move up or down to a higher or lower support tier, that\u0027s absolutely fine. You can just log in to change or cancel the account whenever you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen will I get my monthly sketch cards?\u003cbr\u003eTo save on shipping and give you a bigger thrill, we will deliver these quarterly to our $20 dollar subscribers. If you decide to change your sub level or cancel, we will send you whant sketch cards we owe you immediately.\u003cbr\u003e"
