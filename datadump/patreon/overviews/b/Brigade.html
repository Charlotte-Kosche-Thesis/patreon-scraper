    "summary": "Hello! My name is Alex - or you can use my pen name, if you\u0027d prefer, Brigade - and for nearly three years now, I\u0027ve been writing a series of fanfiction. The first story, Enveloped in the Darkness, totaled nearly 150,000 words. I am currently in the process of writing the second story, Embraced by the Darkness. Unfortunately for me (and all of you who have read my story,) update times have been getting slower and slower. Putting yourself through college with a part-time job is not exactly easy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that is why I have decided to set up this Patreon page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of this page like a tip jar - I would never put my content behind a pay wall. But considering the amount of popularity that Embraced by the Darkness has garnered, if you would be willing to support me financially, it could mean giving me the means to quit my part-time job entirely.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat would mean much quicker updates on my stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also open to the idea of doing commissioned work. If you have a short story idea and would like me to write that story, feel free to message me and we can work out a price for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn closing, you should support me only if you decide that that\u0027s something you\u0027d like to do. You can pledge as little or as much as you\u0027d like. I could never fully express the amount of enjoyment that I have gotten from writing these stories. And if you\u0027re here reading this page, if you\u0027ve read my stories and enjoyed them, you already mean the world to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time.\u00a0"
