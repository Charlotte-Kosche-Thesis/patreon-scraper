It is decided to build colony ships, and spread humanity\u2019s influence into the stars. After a (rigged) vote, it is determined that different classes of colony ship shall be built. The \u003cem\u003eA Class\u003c/em\u003e colonies will be comprised of humanity\u2019s best and brightest: scientists, engineers, the best farmers \u2013 the people who actually do something useful. The \u003cem\u003eB Class\u003c/em\u003e colonies will transport the people who don\u2019t have anything to contribute to society: the insurance adjusters, telephone sanitizers and atmosphere coordinators of the world. \u003cem\u003eC Class\u003c/em\u003e colonies will be comprised of the petty criminals who don\u2019t pose an immediate danger to society (dangerous criminals will be left behind), and the \u003cem\u003eD Class\u003c/em\u003e vessels will be stocked with anyone who didn\u2019t fit in the previous categories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRealizing that the \u003cem\u003eA Class\u003c/em\u003e vessels are far too important for the future of humanity to take big risks, it is decided to perform the final beta testing on \u003cem\u003eB Class\u003c/em\u003e colony ships. Hair dressers, feng-shui consultants and bloggers are loaded onto their ships, fed mimosa\u2019s, and told great stories of their future in the stars. Then, they are put into deep-sleep, and the colony ships jump to hyperspace \u2013 under the guidance of a very advanced, and thoroughly untested, artificial intelligence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are Cordex, the artificial intelligence in charge of Beta 1 of the colony program. Take off goes smoothly, and everyone is settled in hyper-sleep while you lead your settlers to their new home. Then, of course, something goes wrong. Sensors register an impact, damage control reports that the damage control sensors are damaged, and navigation goes haywire. In the blink of an eye, Cordex drops the stricken ship from hyperspace, and searches the knowledge-base for further instructions. \u201cTODO: Write emergency protocols\u201d is the only guidance the beta software has to offer, so Cordex improvises. Scanners detect a habitable \u2013 but uncharted \u2013 planet not too far away, and Cordex limps towards it. Damage control sensors come online for long enough to indicate that the ship is too damaged to land, so Cordex has the ship\u2019s systems load the computer and six randomly selected settlers (the ones nearest to the door) into the primary escape pod \u2013 and launches towards the planet. The ship should remain in orbit for years to come, and hopefully the remaining settlers can be rescued.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLeaving a trail of devastation, the escape pod comes to rest on the newly discovered planet. Communications and defense systems are offline, power is scarce \u2013 but six settlers are waking up from hyper-sleep, the food replicator and water condensers are online. There is still hope! As the ship\u2019s AI \u2013 and honestly, the only competent being here \u2013 it is your duty to keep the settlers alive, help them rebuild, and use them as your eyes, ears and limbs to either thrive here or escape the planet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
