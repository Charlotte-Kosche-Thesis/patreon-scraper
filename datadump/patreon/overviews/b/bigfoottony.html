Although I have a full time job, that supports myself and my family, we are still only just managing financially.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI absolutely do not enjoy asking for money from anybody. But the reality is; YouTube has been demonetising most of my videos. As soon as I publish a video on YouTube, it is automatically demonetised, saying it\u0027s unsuitable for monetising, but when I submit a request to say that I believe it\u0027s OK for monetising, it takes days to be put back up, and by that time (Yes it was fine after all) I have lost thousands of views and potential revenue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI am currently getting only around $150 per month, which is a nice surprise sometimes, but the work I am doing takes a very big toll on my PC, and also takes a lot of my personal time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYou may notice sometimes that when I am scrubbing back and forth on a video, it sometimes lags, and is jerky, well that\u0027s because my PC is basically getting old and needs upgrading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI use my PC for my photography business, but I am mostly using it these days for Bigfoot videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI don\u0027t know how it will work, but I just want to use my Patreon account as a means for people to donate the odd pound/dollar whenever they feel it\u0027s possible to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThis will simply allow me to make more and more videos, and maybe one day upgrade my PC.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003ePlease don\u0027t think you HAVE to donate, you really don\u0027t. It\u0027s just a place for those who were asking where they could donate,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThank you so much, BT.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
