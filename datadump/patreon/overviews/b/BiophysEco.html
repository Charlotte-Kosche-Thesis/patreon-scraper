It builds upon a wide and growing decentralized network of contributors and researchers from various backgrounds and geographies to produce and promote high-quality and balanced public policy analysis and advice. It has multiple leaders and participants, interacting at various levels on a voluntary basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to fulfill its mission and make an impact in the public policy conversation, BiophysEco relies on the support of those who understand that economics\nmust rest on a biophysical framework that acknowledges energy and resource\nconstraints. If you are one of those lucky few, you may consider becoming a BiophysEco patron by making a small, monthly donation here on Patreon! Your contribution will help support startup and development expenses and ensure that\u00a0BiophysEco can make the voice of biophysical economics heard in the policy arena.
