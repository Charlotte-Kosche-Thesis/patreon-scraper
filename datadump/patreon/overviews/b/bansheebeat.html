My name is Dylan Browne, better known by my electronic music project \u003cstrong\u003ebansheebeat\u003c/strong\u003e. I have a Soundcloud page,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/bansheebeatmusic\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, where you can check out my work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live in a dusty little desert hub down in Tucson, Arizona. I\u0027m a music producer, sound engineer, multi-instrumentalist, composer, and performer and I\u0027ve been doing music for nearly fifteen years. Aside from making music, I also help run the record label \u003cstrong\u003eGalaxy Swim Team\u003c/strong\u003e! When I\u0027m not locked in my bedroom at 2:00 am on a Tuesday working on new material, I\u0027m pursuing my third academic music related degree, playing in various groups and ensembles throughout my city, composing, arranging, or obnoxiously beatboxing in public. I breathe music; it\u0027s honestly more valuable to me than oxygen at this point!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut Dylan, you\u0027d make music anyway, so why Patreon now??!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs much as I enjoy releasing music for free, it\u2019s becoming\nharder and harder for me to do. Up until now, I\u2019ve been lucky to keep making\nmusic and not have to worry about financially supporting myself, but as my life\ngoes on that luxury gets less and less feasible. The work that pays me or goes\ntoward my graduation ends up taking priority, and thus, more and more of my\nenergy and time. I\u2019ve had to turn down most offers to play shows over the last\nseveral years because of school and work, and I\u2019m afraid my opportunities to\nperform in the future dwindle more and more every day. If you consider\npledging, know that you\u2019re helping me to continue to devote time to producing\nthe music I love and allowing me to pursue new and exciting opportunities I\u2019d\notherwise have to pass on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut, what is it that you\u0027re offering?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest, I just want to make the best music I can, that touches people\u0027s hearts, makes you want to sometimes dance and other times look at the stars and be awed by our place in the galaxy, and bring people together. I want to give you that \u003cem\u003ealong with\u003c/em\u003e giving you the inside scoop into my studio and even into my brain, and showing you neat pieces of my creative process. I want to have you smile, laugh, maybe even cry a little, who knows? I\u0027m offering to keep making music that I hope that you\u0027ll love and, in return, what I ask for is the support to have this be what I do every day, from dusk \u0027til dawn, for the rest of my life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s cute and all, but really, what do I get out of this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, I\u0027m offering some neat stuff over in the rewards list too. Maybe stuff like access to my entire discography, works in progress and demos, and exclusive updates and news might do it for you. If not, maybe a personal thank you card every few months? These rewards will evolve over time as I\u0027m able to afford to add more exciting things. What about a monthly Q\u0026amp;A session, a production stream, or maybe even a live performance broadcast? This is gonna be an experimental, ongoing net-gain for everyone though, surely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless, every little bit helps immensely, and I want to thank you for considering becoming a patron. I\u0027ll work to make the very best of this both for you and for myself, and I hope to see you on the other end of the finish line towards the big goal. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you so, so much.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EzL3YZZbgdM\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e"

While I\u0027ve been performing for years, I\u0027m not financially stable enough to travel for shows, outside of very infrequently driving to Phoenix and LA. Help me to perform outside my isolated oasis in the desert, get me on the coast, and help me go on tour!! I\u0027ll bring some of my friends too~",
