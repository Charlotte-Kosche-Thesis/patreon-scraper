    "summary": "The study of Medicine is difficult enough to master, but teaching it should not add to the difficulty.

It is from this scaffolding that one can build a solid foundation in clinical medicine. My podcasts do just that- they\u0027re entertaining, informative, and best of all, no longer than 30 minutes, so you have time to grab a workout or Netflix episode before heading back to the hospital for work. \u003cbr\u003eI ask not only for your listening, but\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0for your support!\u003cbr\u003eI ask for funds simply to support me during these projects because to be honest, being a resident physician during the day and podcasting at night makes me really hungry.
