We don\u0027t just create games in the Unity engine, we also do comedy podcasts and game streams. While our operating costs are not high, we do need help to keep this up. Every little bit counts and lets us provide more and more content. Some of us are patrons of fellow creators on the site and we love the community aspect that Patreon is aiming for. We want to be a community driven game developer. We want your input on what we are making and doing. So some of the stuff that we are planning to do are as follows:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Create and release games, such as Cosmos Crusher, our first commercial release.\u003cbr\u003e2. Provide as much entertainment via the web as possible: streams, recordings, podcasts etc.\u003cbr\u003e3. Tutorials on Unity, Maya, Photoshop and other programs that can get other aspiring game developers going.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e4. Fan interaction: Patrons will be the first voices we listen to and will off course receive all of our games for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cannot stress this enough that every dollar counts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck us out at these locations:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://betwixtgames.wix.com/betwixt\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://betwixtgames.wix.com/betwixt\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.indiedb.com/company/betwixt-games\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.indiedb.com/company/betwixt-games\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BetwixtGames\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/BetwixtGames\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/BetwixtGames\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/BetwixtGames\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtube.com/BetwixtGames\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://youtube.com/BetwixtGames\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
