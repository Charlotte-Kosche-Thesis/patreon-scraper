We are so very delighted that you stopped by. Please be sure to watch your step for pools of blood and errant hellmouths. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat is Buffering the Vampire Slayer?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://bufferingthevampireslayer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuffering the Vampire Slayer\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is a weekly podcast in which your hosts\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.jennyowenyoungs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJenny Owen Youngs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (professional musician and recreational Whedonverse aficionado) and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.kristinnoeline.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKristin Russo\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (professional writer and former goth teen) discuss Buffy the Vampire Slayer, one episode at a time. Every installment of the podcast also includes a new original song recapping each glorious Buffy episode! *spooky wolf howl*\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMaking this podcast is a dream come true, but it\u2019s the kind of dream that takes up oodles and oodles of time. We spend hours and hours each week on preparation, recording and producing the episodes, writing and recording a complete recap song(!), and fine-tuning the audio mix in order to make each episode as great as possible for our amazing listeners. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are also a number of expenses related to running the show: website hosting, podcast distribution, recording equipment and software, and any number of other incidentals. Patreon support helps offset those costs.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon also gives us a space to share all of regular our content - which is and shall remain free to all - in combination with extras and bonus material for our incredible supporters.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eFang You, Fang You Very Much!\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you SO much for listening to our podcast! We love Buffy, and it\u2019s SO fun to dig into the episodes and characters with all of you. If you like what we do, please tell your friends, family, and any ensouled vampires with whom you may be acquainted. And if you are able to support us here on Patreon, we\u0027d truly and deeply appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all our love and custom fangs,\u003cbr\u003eJenny \u0026amp; Kristin\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS: After joining, you should get a welcome email that includes the link to our secret Facebook page!
