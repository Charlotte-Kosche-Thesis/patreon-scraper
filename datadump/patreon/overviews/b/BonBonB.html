    "summary": "Hi, you are probably here because of What Map, the Cities Skylines map review show. I hope you\u0027re finding the series both helpful and fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking What Map is my hobby. I spend three to four hours a day recording, editing, voicing, creating thumbnails etc. And I enjoy every minute. I wouldn\u0027t do it if I didn\u0027t enjoy it. But as a hobby it is hugely time consuming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I\u0027m lucky that life allows me the time to invest in all this, for which I am thankful. But life has a habit of stirring things up every now and then. If and when that happens What Map will likely be the first casualty.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I have a day job; I have been continuously self-employed for over two decades. But ask me what I\u0027d really like to do... I\u0027d like to do this. But even more so. I\u0027ve just started doing the Theme Review, but imagine a What City, or regular tutorials. Right now these are impossible, there simply isn\u0027t the time. But were this my full time job... well I can dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I ask you, if you enjoy, or even find What Map useful, could you please sign up as a patron. At $1 a month, that is less than four pennies a show. And if enough of you can join the party then maybe just maybe we can turn this channel into a monster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t worry if you can\u0027t. What Map will remain free for as long as I can continue investing the time. I can\u0027t believe it\u0027s been a year already.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, and for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
