At my prime, I was streaming 7 days a week and averaging a few hundred viewers. As life happened, my stream took the backseat.(moving, no internet, job change, etc) I have tried multiple times to pick back where I left off, but due to internet struggles, it always just seemed to never work. This time around, my wonderful comcast seems \u0026lt;stable\u0026gt; and I really want to dive into the community where I feel the most comfortable. I created this Patreon in hopes that I can shift some of my work related focus into this direction without feeling the financial burden of doing so. Any and all pledges are very much appreciated, thank you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards are given after the start of the next month due to the way Patreon pays/charges.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook.com/biiotch\u003cbr\u003eTwitch.tv/biiotchtv\u003cbr\u003eTwitter.com/biiotchtv\u003cbr\u003eInstagram.com/biiotchtv\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWishlist\u00a0http://a.co/fMSGDt0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;under construction\u0026gt;"
