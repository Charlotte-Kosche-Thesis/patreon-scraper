    "summary": "Poetry isn\u0027t published very often in the public sphere - publishers don\u0027t really want to back it because poetry is such an individual experience and doesn\u0027t really sell widely unless the author is already well-known as a writer of prose works. My work is very individual, and I know that it connects with a lot of people, but getting it published via a publishing house is probably something that won\u0027t happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople relate to my work - whether I write poetry or prose - and they tend to want more, and I really want to provide that, but (as with most things in life) there are a few things that get in the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is hard for most writers to get the recognition that they deserve and need to keep on writing, and money is certainly a huge factor in my ability to keep producing my work. I have multiple chronic illnesses, and I have been unable to work for a few years now. My husband and the rest of my support network are basically the only reason that I am able to get through my day-to-day life, and I would love to be able to have my work help others and help me at the same time. Any amount would help at the moment, because it would also help remind me that my work deserves to be out there (you know, in the wild)."
