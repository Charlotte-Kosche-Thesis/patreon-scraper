    "summary": "\"Beyond Valley Street\" is a collection of tools, schedules, and essays written to assist racial justice activists who are seeking to begin or expand their work. I am a White transgender woman of a Middle-class background who has focused her research and schedules on Asheville, NC, and it is also my hope that the information and tools can be applied throughout the U.S. and cross-culturally when appropriate - and that this site can be of true benefit to those most impacted by White Supremacy.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am creating this Patreon in order to continue providing 13-25 hours per week to the work of dismantling White Supremacy in Asheville (and hopefully beyond), and once I meet my first goal, I plan to raise funds for local Black or People of Color-led organizations, projects, and initiatives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a queer transgender woman, I have encountered cultural, health, and workplace discrimination, and it has endeared me to the causes of Black and Brown Liberation. Members of these communities have been some of my staunchest allies in my process of coming out and existing, and it is my strong desire to continue working in conjunction with their efforts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince December of 2016, I have been facilitating my own own SURJ meeting, the Do!scussion, and have expanded the meeting to include a work session, attending up to six additional meetings per week, and compiling a weekly calendar. I also served as Letter to the Editor Coordinator for the Green Party campaign to elect Dee Williams, a local Black, living wage activist. Through these experiences, I have connected to and worked with many individuals and groups, shared and learned many new skills, and am excited to take this work to the Patreon platform.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* * * * *\u003cbr\u003eAnd finally, here\u0027s a little about Patreon. Becoming a contributor is easy, and all of my contributors help me to shift my focus away from cleaning and pet sitting gigs, and towards this crucial allied liberation work. Just sign up to contribute any amount whatsoever, and as I meet certain goals, I will be able to do such things as expand my schedules to include weeks and months instead of days, give a significant cut of what I make to Black and Brown community members and organizations (once I get to $500 per month, I will contribute half of all additional funds), give myself a library day, write well-researched essays, collect community members\u0027s stories, supply myself with additional training, and coordinate with community leaders to launch additional and effective campaigns, for public office and otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll is possible with a little bit of help, and Thank You!\u003cbr\u003eBeyond Valley Street is an Asheville we can \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e find livable. Let\u0027s go there."
