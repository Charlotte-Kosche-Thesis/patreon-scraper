I was tired of the misrepresentation of black people worldwide on the media and the constant lying to all of humanity about the health, spirituality, history, and many more things. I started on the streets of Brooklyn, Ny and when social media came about it was an opportunity to spread vital information that was once reserved to secret societies by the gatekeepers. My youtube channel, blackmagik363, became a \"go to\" channel for info you couldn\u0027t get anywhere else. It was cool because youtube became a way for me to make a couple of dollars doing what i love to do. Over the years, many videos on youtube have changed the perception of the world. PERCEPTION IS EVERYTHING. A lot of the old gatekeepers in corporate America knows this change of perception is not good for business, so recently the Wallstreet journal and advertisers have pressured youtube to pull ads from videos claiming that their ads were on \"extremist\" and \"terrorist\" videos. Many youtubers have expressed concerns that this is merely an attempt at censorship. People are running from mainstream media and running to independent outlets because everyone is tired of being lied to. Because of the pressure from corporations and mainstream media,Youtube have created new rules, banned certain words, banned certain topics, taken away revenue from content creators, taken down channels, and have generally left us in the dark as to what is the future of Youtube. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am truly blessed to have access to all this information that our ancestors would have dreamt of having access to.
