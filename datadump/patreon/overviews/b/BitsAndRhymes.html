Random began the transformation into Mega Ran, his alter-ego, an ode to the classic video game character Mega Man. After creating a tribute album and receiving an unprecedented level of support and blessing from Capcom to continue, Ran was reborn and became a trailblazer in the budding \u201cnerdcore\u201d and chiptune subgenres, while coining his own term to describe what he had done, \u003cem\u003e\u201cChip-Hop.\u201d \u003c/em\u003eCollaborations with esteemed producer K-Murdock have added legitimacy and hip-hop credibility, leading to a perfect storm unlike any other in the nerdy music world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"199\" src=\"http://megaran.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/nashi3-300x199.png\" style=\"margin: 7px auto;\" width=\"300\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that\u2019s Random.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
