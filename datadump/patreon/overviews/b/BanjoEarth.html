    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eMission:\u003c/div\u003ePEACE THROUGH MUSIC. COMMUNITY THROUGH CREATION: That is our heart and soul here at Banjo Earth. With each song, each hug, each smile, this project demonstrates the power that music has to bring us together as humans. On the most basic human level, I believe love and kindness are our true nature. So let\u0027s celebrate each other\u0027s culture, humanity, and the universe around us! A tremendous THANK YOU to all who support Banjo Earth creations, from simply the likes, comments, and positive vibes, all the way to the highest levels of patronage. It means the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAbout the Project:\u003c/div\u003eWith banjo in hand, we traverse the Earth, collaborating with musicians and artists from all walks of life. We bring our creative minds together for a project, and most often end up with a record \u00a0and an accompanying music video (though not always). The work runs the gamut, from North Carolina murder ballads to collaborations with Mongolian throat singers, deep in the mountains of China. We aim for creations that makes you THINK, INSPIRE you, MOVE you, ENTERTAIN you, and STIR in you the FIRE to see the world and experience more...Creating art, playing music, sharing food, communicating, understanding...LIFE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow Does This Work?\u003cbr\u003eThe music business has changed drastically in the internet era. Not as many people buy records as they previously did. But, everyone still loves music! And we still are willing to pay for what we enjoy. These days, it seems people are more interested in helping create the music and art from the beginning, rather than just purchasing it once it\u0027s made and released. THAT IS WHY I HAVE STARTED THIS PATREON PAGE. It is simply a way to allow you, the amazing people who love Banjo Earth, to contribute to it\u0027s creation and become an agent of change in the world. With your support, we are able to pay fairly the wonderful and talented musicians, videographers, engineers, bus drivers, interpreters, etc. All while bringing a message of peace and understanding to the people of our planet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are 2 main ways to pledge your support for Banjo Earth projects.\u003cbr\u003e 1) \"SUPPORT BY CREATION\" - meaning you subscribe at anywhere from 1$ to $1000 per creation. Perhaps, for example, you want to pledge support by buying me a beer ($5) for each song I publish. Whenever I release a \"creation\", (which is usually 1-2 times per month), five dollars will be transferred to Banjo Earth. If you want to support this way, but you\u0027re afraid I\u0027ll publish 20 songs in one month, (I won\u0027t, but that would be awesome!), you can put a cap on how much you pledge per month. Pretty cool! Each increasing level of patronage comes with increasingly awesome happenings and rewards. All of the \"Support By Creation\" interactions take place here the Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) \"SUPPORT BY DONATION\" - you can help fund Banjo Earth projects by simply making a one-time donation, or purchase of a reward package. Any and all financial support that comes though Patreon is vital to our ability to continue to produce high quality works. With each donation, we are able to make even more exciting creations and bring you the best that we have. For example, say you really want to help make the Banjo Earth: India project happen this year (which is planned for April of 2018), so you pledge a one-time donation of $100, which will then include all of the products (cd/dvd/shirts,etc) from that particular project, plus other relevant perks. All of these pledges take place on my personal website at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.andyeversole.com/store\"\u003ewww.andyeversole.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEither way you go, I\u0027m so grateful for your support. The fact that you even pay attention to my music and stories, let alone share your hard-earned money to help create it, means so much. It is truly the driving force behind everything we do. Of course Banjo Earth is my love and my passion, and I have to do it regardless, but having you here on the journey with me makes it so much more meaningful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the Love, \u003cbr\u003eAndy Eversole, Banjo Earth\u00a0\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
