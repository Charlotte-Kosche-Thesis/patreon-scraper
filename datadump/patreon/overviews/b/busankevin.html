    "summary": "I\u0027ve been making videos for YouTube since 2006. People from around the world have watched my videos about travel, life in Japan, education and food. Now I have created the Just Japan Podcast; a podcast that covers a wide variety of aspects about life in Japan. Each week I interview a fascinating person about something that makes living, working and traveling in Japan awesome. I\u0027m looking for your support to keep these wonderful projects going and help develop them into something bigger and better. The staggering popularity of the Just Japan Podcast has very quickly shown me that bandwidth and hosting fees for a popular podcast are very expensive. By helping just a little each month you can ensure that I can meet the bandwidth needs of this awesome show. I want to continue to upload Just Japan on a weekly basis (ad free if possible), but that may be difficult with the sheer number of downloads I\u0027m currently dealing with. \u00a0You can also help make the audio and video production of both the podcast and video channels grow with the addition of new equipment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love producing content and I know many of you enjoy the content I create. If you feel that the content I make gives you something, if you feel it makes you happy in any way and you look forward to it, please feel free, but not obligated to help. Just a small amount each month can help me invest in making both my YouTube channels and the Just Japan podcast better than ever!"
