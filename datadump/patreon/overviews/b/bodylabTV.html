Welcome!! I developed a passion for sports and fitness and for living a healthy lifestyle very early on in my life.I was an athlete throughout my school years. I have been training and coaching for over fifteen years. I previously taught boot camps in the park and studio, however with the many life changes including having two children and relocating most of my clients were an hour drive. I started online coaching via google hangout however that was limited, and I wanted to reach a wider audience because so many others wanted to join. I then transitioned to Periscope (no longer use), Instagram (http://bit.ly/fitdastruggle) and Facebook (http://bit.ly/thebodylabFB). I then leaped YouTube to create a more structured platform to provide better quality and more organized way of navigating to previous videos. Which gave birth to \u201cThe BodyLab.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created the BodyLab to share my passion and to help everyone along their fitness journey. As a working mom, I know how hard life can be and how difficult it is to find time for you. I want to show you that it is possible to stay fit. I want the BodyLabTV to be a positive atmosphere that offers a variety of FREE workouts videos for beginners to advanced. My primary focus is workouts that you can do anywhere, with or without equipment, from quickie five mins workouts to 1 hr full body ultimate exercises. You can choose which works best with your time constraints and fitness level.We do fitness challenges, particular training exercise routines, meal plans and health and nutrition tips.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy passion is fitness, and I love helping others by being an inspiration and changing lives! I look forward to being you trainer and coach through that journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy weight story after having two kids: \u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/2hrQKGT\"\u003ehttp://bit.ly/2hrQKGT\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore about me: \u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/bodylabWEB\"\u003ehttp://bit.ly/bodylabWEB\u003c/a\u003e"
