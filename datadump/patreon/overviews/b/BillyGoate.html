    "summary": "You may not have noticed, but right under our noses a movement is afoot. \u00a0Bloggers and music journalists have dubbed it \u0027The New Wave of Traditional Heavy Rock \u0026amp; Metal.\u0027 \u00a0Young bands inspired by the legacy of the 70\u0027s are creating new classics, not merely paying homage to the past, but creating something entirely their own for a new century and a new generation. We\u0027re talking heavy underground doom metal in the style of Black Sabbath and Deep Purple; wicked riffing stoner/psychedelic rock in the style of Blue Cheer and Hawkwind. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re as passionate as I am about discovering these bands and giving them exposure through high quality film, podcasts, album reviews, and band interviews, please support the work that I\u0027m doing! \u00a0I work on a very low budget and aim to give hard-gigging bands and local music festivals here and around the world quality coverage they deserve. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I need help starting a fund to purchase a high quality 4k camera (currently, I don\u0027t own the cameras I use), with a tripod and microphone best suited for recording heavy music. \u00a0Eventually, \u00a0I\u0027d like to get mixing software and a decent laptop, but for now, that will have to wait. \u00a0It\u0027s down to brass tacks. \u00a0The bare essentials. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s the underground covering the underground, working on a shoestring budget, and looking to get better and better at it every day. \u00a0Watch, listen, and read what I\u0027m doing now at \u003ca href=\"http://www.DoomedandStoned.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.DoomedandStoned.com\u003c/a\u003e (reviews, interviews),\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/user/crazispeedemon\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0(live shows), and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/doomedandstonedofficial \"\u003eMixcloud\u003c/a\u003e (weekly podcasts, featuring over 2 hours of new music from killer bands the world \u0027round).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith you\u0027re help, I can take a good thing and make it great, and we can all celebrate in knowing that we helped champion bands who are truly putting forth their creative best to contribute to this style of heavy music we love so much! \u00a0 Even a few dollars helps to keep me on the road, paying video camera rental fees, cover charges at shows, gas for the car, and a cup of coffee for my journey. \u00a0 Thank you so much for helping me to keep local music alive!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Thank you to Alyssa Herrman of Foto Phortress for the cover pic of me at Hoverfest 2014)"

Bands do not get charged a dime.  I focus on talented up-and-coming bands, because they truly appreciate the coverage.\u00a0Check out what I\u0027ve been doing on YouTube and see if you think this is worth supporting (http://tinyurl.com/DoomedandStoned2). \u00a0The more support I get, the more I film and the better the quality of the productions! \u00a0 Thank you in advance for your consideration and generous donations. \u00a0:)",
