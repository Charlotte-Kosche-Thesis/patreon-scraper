    "summary": "Thank you so much for stopping by the BenderFitness Patreon page! We love bringing you free workouts, recipes, and healthy lifestyle tips. Your support is what makes that possible! It allows us to spend more time focusing on the workouts that we can bring to you, and helps offset the cost of equipment, web hosting, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting people in maintaining a healthy lifestyle is our goal and our passion. With your support we can focus on bringing you more and more content, upgrading our equipment and video quality, and spend more time interacting with the BenderFitness community. Our long term goal is to be able to make our passion for fitness our full time career, while keeping our workouts free. Thank you for helping us to make our dreams a reality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp to this point, BenderFitness.com has been a side project, while Jesse and I (Melissa) both work full time jobs. With the birth of our son, the amount of time we have to commit to BenderFitness with both of us working full time would have been significantly limited. We weren\u0027t willing to give up on BenderFitness, so I am making the leap into committing myself to BenderFitness full time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHitting our first support goal of $5000 per month would allow us to upgrade equipment. If our support continues to grow beyond that, we will look to hire someone to help with filming new workouts \u0026amp; having an in home baby sitter for our son while we film new videos. That would allow us to bring you workouts much more consistently, and on a better schedule. Thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we are able to hit our long term goal of $15,000 per month we will be able to do things to help BenderFitness grow and become even more self-sustaining. Some of the hidden costs of blogging that your donation would help us to offset would include:\u003cbr\u003e-Equipment Upgrades: Cameras, Computer, Editing Software, Hard Drives, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Web Hosting\u003cbr\u003e-Creating an E-mail List\u003cbr\u003e-Developing a BenderFitness App\u003cbr\u003e-Web Development\u003cbr\u003e-Boosted Posts on Facebook (Currently our posts are shown to only a minuscule number of the people who have liked our page. We can increase this by paying for Boosted Posts).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Developing T-Shirts/Tanks and Fitness Products\u003cbr\u003e-Hiring a Baby-sitter/Nanny so we can have a set filming schedule to bring you more consistent workouts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Creating a sustainable income so Jesse and I could focus on BenderFitness full time and still pay our Mortgage and Bills\u003cbr\u003e-We would love to grow enough to hire someone to film some of our videos so that Jesse and I could do some workout videos together\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read all of this, and for supporting us as we pursue our dream.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Melissa, Jesse \u0026amp; Maverick\u003cbr\u003e"
