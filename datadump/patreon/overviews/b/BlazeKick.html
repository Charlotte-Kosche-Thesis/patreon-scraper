    "summary": "Hello, everyone. My name is Tyler Busler, and I\u2019m a writer and video editor on an independent reviewing website called \u201cBlazeKick.com.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlazeKick.com is owned and ran by a group of devoted fans to their medium; every article and video is done by people who truly care about their work.\u00a0For the past 2 years, we\u2019ve focused on making fair, unbiased reviews and making entertaining content for fans of video games, movies, and anime from all around to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs our website stands, we have to pay out of pocket in order to keep the site sustained. The biggest hitch is that most of our members are just out of high school or just starting college.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to keep the website going with hosting and server costs, we need to pay roughly $100 in order to keep our name and site public. On that note, we\u2019re also continually expanding our content horizons to more entertainment mediums, along with improving the quality standards for all content, whether it\u2019s video or text.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why should you become a patron? If we get even $1, that still helps with server costs. As a thank you, you\u0027ll have access to the BlazeKick Podcast, which is currently planned out as monthly Patreon exclusive podcast. On top of that you\u0027ll also get early access to our other podcasts like Nintendo Unleashed Podcast and The PlayStation Point. You\u0027ll also be able to participate in any Patreon exclusive tournaments or events we host. At $5 you\u0027ll get early access to video series like Flash Fire. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur milestones are focusing on improving content flow and improving the overall quality of the site. This focuses on the video game-related content we\u2019re releasing, but rest assured, this will carry over to other mediums, like for movie and anime reviews as we see fit. This will not be for personal gain; all money we get will go straight into the website and that\u2019s final.\u003cbr\u003e"
