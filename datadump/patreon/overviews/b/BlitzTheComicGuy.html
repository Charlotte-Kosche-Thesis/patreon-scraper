Well of COURSE you do!\u00a0 Pledge 10 dollars a month, and here\u0027s how you can:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBump An Anime To The TOP Of The Queue\u003c/strong\u003e -want to see me do comics based on your favorite anime, but don\u0027t want to wait until I work my way through however many other shows are on that list?\u00a0 Well, pledging at this level gives you the VIP treatment, and your request gets to cut right to the front of the line!\u00a0 All the same rules as before apply, plus a few extra things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eI RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THIS SYSTEM -Obviously, this reward assumes that there won\u0027t be too many people pledging at this level.\u00a0 If that changes, awesome!\u00a0 But \"cutting to the front\" just won\u0027t be a viable option if there\u0027s too many people trying to do it all at once.\u00a0 Actually, that\u0027s true for most of these rewards, but this seems like the one that break down the fastest, so be forewarned.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\"BUMP\" DOES NOT EQUAL \"PIN TO THE TOP\" -that is, if you bump your request up to the top this week, someone else can do the same next week, knocking yours down to spot number two.\u00a0 That\u0027s still a lot better than the bottom of the list, but nobody\u0027s \"guaranteed\" the top spot. (See what\u00a0 meant about this breaking down?)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYOU CAN BUMP SOMEONE ELSE\u0027S REQUEST -If you\u0027re feeling generous, or someone else just beat you to your request, you can always use this reward to bump an anime that\u0027s already on the queue to the top.\u00a0 Even if somebody else already bumped it up once, and it got knocked back down! (you can\u0027t bring back a show I\u0027ve already done, though)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eONLY ONE BUMPED ANIME PER PERSON (AT A TIME) -I can\u0027t think of a short way to say that without being confusing. This reward allows you to bump an anime up the queue once. That privilege is then used up so long as that anime is still listed. Only when that anime is over with and off the list will you have the option of adding to the list again.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTHIS DOES NOT EQUAL A SECOND ANIME -if you already pledged 5 dollars and added an anime to the queue then, you don\u0027t get to pick a second one after increasing the pledge.\u00a0 You can only bump up the request you previously made.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\"TOP\" ISN\u0027T REALLY THE TOP -that is, even an anime that\u0027s been bumped up to the top of the queue will still have to wait for the current series of comics to end, no matter how many weeks that takes.\u00a0 Once a series starts, it can\u0027t be interrupted.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eONLY ACTIVE SUPPORTERS (AT THIS LEVEL) -I\u0027m not suggesting that any of you would be unscrupulous enough to sign up for a ten dollar pledge just long enough to bump their show up to the top, then cancel before any payments went through.\u00a0 But in the event that someone tried, the show would revert back to its previous spot as soon as I saw that the money didn\u0027t arrive.\u00a0 Let\u0027s hope that never happens, \u0027kay? \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWrite a Far Out There Comic\u003c/strong\u003e -don\u0027t want to put up with that whole Mad-Lib gimmick?\u00a0 Well, you\u0027re in luck!\u00a0 The 10 Dollar A month club has the option of submitting a two-to-three sentence plot summary that they made up from scratch.\u00a0 You\u0027ll have COMPLETE CONTROL! ...provided you abide by all the rules of the Mad-Lib comics, plus these additional ones:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eTHERE\u0027S NO TELLING HOW LONG THESE WILL TAKE -Remember, this is on top of all the regular comics and all the other Patreon comics, and it\u0027s without the structure of the Mad-Lib format to keep it under what I know I can do.\u00a0 These could take a while, there\u0027s just no way around it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eONLY ONE AT A TIME -I\u0027ll make a blog post announcing that I\u0027m taking ideas, the first valid reply I get will be the one I do. No more ideas will be accepted until that one is finished and a new blog post is made.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNO HOGGING THIS REWARD -I mentioned this before, but it goes double here.\u00a0 If one person consistently beats everyone else to the punch, I reserve the right to ask that person to sit the next round out.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNO EPIC FANFICS -Another one that bears repeating.\u00a0 These can\u0027t be more than two or three sentences, can\u0027t be something that\u0027d require more than five pages, and can\u0027t be an idea I couldn\u0027t put my own unique spin on.\u00a0 If you\u0027ve got a big sprawling story you want told a certain way, I look forward to reading your fanfic, but I can\u0027t write it for you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eONLY ACTIVE SUPPORTERS -Again, I\u0027m sure you have no intention of pledging just long enough to submit an idea, but I still need to state for the record that it\u0027s not allowed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e",
