Well by casting as much as I can which will keep me sharp and make me better at what I do. I also kind of need a bit of help getting some better equipment to be able to cast games in 1080p and well....not lose 30k frames too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY JOIN!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell not only by joining would you be helping me get more experience and get better at casting but also you can have your games cast. That\u0027s right rewards(while they will be different) will mostly all feature an opportunity to get your game cast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver have a game where you stomped all over the enemy, came back from 20k down, landed a 5 man black hole, or done something amazing that you just wanted to remember forever.

Something in the low 0k MMR range to something top tier I will cast it (please try to be reasonable with the match time)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso each month I will pick one patron to win an upcoming compendium from me (If they are still a thing if not I\u0027ll change this)\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHelp me help you remember your greatest Dota moments which in turn will make me a better caster and one day reach my personal goal of casting at TI!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelp thats about all I\u0027ve got right now and thanks so much for your support whether or not you join thanks so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Bkop\u003c/strong\u003e"
