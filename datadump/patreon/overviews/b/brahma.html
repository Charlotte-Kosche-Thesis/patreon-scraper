Patreon allows you to pledge an amount that you feel comfortable giving per \u201ccreation\u201d that an artist releases. This means the artist gets paid regularly without the need for a middle-person, and you become a direct patron of their art, while receiving rewards based on your pledge level. It\u0027s a really powerful and direct way for fans to support their favorite artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease don\u0027t feel pressured to become a patron if you\u0027re on a tight budget. All music is eventually viewable on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe_6g5hUe6IXA-OR01XCICw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e, and also attainable through\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/brahmamatt\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSoundcloud\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://brahmamatt.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBandcamp\u003c/a\u003e. Just keep in mind that the biggest perk of being a patron is that you will hear all songs 1-2 months before they\u0027re released to the general public, and you will also get access to the patron-only stream where you will experience content that no one else will see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe majority of the funds that are pledged to Brahma will be put right back into the project. Whether investments are made through better audio equipment or new instrument libraries, the focus will always be to provide fans with a meaningful and impacting experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, please take a look at the \u003cstrong\u003eGoals\u003c/strong\u003e section to see some of the bigger plans that are in store for Brahma. Most notably, there are plans for some animated short films and possibly a live tour. If you like what you see, and are excited to see where this project can go, please assist me in spreading the word about Brahma so that these goals can become a reality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/mdK3lvd.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.

Can you elaborate on the size and quality of the art prints?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe art will generally be printed at 13\" x 19\" in full color (when applicable) on high quality 110 lb. acid-free/lignin-free paper. The size of the print could be subject to change dependent upon the dimensions and ratios of the art itself. Each print will be signed and identified by number (*/*). The identifying number of the print that you receive will be randomized. They will be shipped within 2-3 days after the most recent song release. There is no extra cost for shipping.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNOTE: I cannot make any promises to how archival these prints will be since many factors can be out of my control. But rest assured, due to the paper being acid-free/lignin free, and proper handling on my end, they should last for a very, very long time. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e8.

Can I stop donating in the future if I can\u0027t afford it?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes. If you would like to stop donating, you simply log in to your account and make the changes there. Also, a great method for controlling how much you spend is to set a monthly maximum amount in your account settings when you sign up so that you never donate more than you can afford.\u003cbr\u003e"
