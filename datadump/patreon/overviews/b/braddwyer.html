    "summary": "Hey there! My name is Brad Dwyer, and I\u0027ve been writing and drawing comics for the past 15-yrs. This illustration is a pretty accurate representation of me, after my kids have gone to bed...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://d111vui60acwyt.cloudfront.net/product_photos/52309577/cover_20image_original.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNowadays, I\u0027m known (in some circles) for writing, drawing, and self-publishing weird science fiction/genre comics, like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://apemen-apocalypse.blogspot.com/2013/08/title.html\"\u003eAPE-MEN OF THE APOCALYPSE\u003c/a\u003e. That\u0027s my bag now, but I\u0027ve been doing comics for most of my adult life, and I began in a very different headspace.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started drawing comics in my early 20\u0027s, back when I was still childless, wifeless, slightly drunk, and playing in punk rock bands. I was heavily influenced by the work of Jeffrey Brown, James Kochalka, and a variety of other indie comics artists, and started drawing my own autobiographical mini-comics. Once I met Shannon, my eventual-wife-to-be, making music sorta fell to the wayside and I became more and more steeped in creating comics ( mostly autobio, many of which are archived online,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://epictalesofthemundane.blogspot.com/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, ). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter doing that for a few years, I was hired by the Phoenix New Times to write and draw an autobiographical comic strip about my relationship with music that was published both in print, and on the web ( see\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/search?type=article\u0026amp;keyword=brad%20dwyer\"\u003e\"Record Heat\"\u003c/a\u003e strips ). I also contributed similarly themed comics to the online arm of Razorcake fanzine, as one of the rotating artists on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://razorcake.org/?s=webcomic+wednesday\"\u003eWebcomic Wednesday\u003c/a\u003e feature. But for the most part, I\u0027ve always been a self-publisher.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore recently, my comics have veered away from autobiography and into the realm of science fiction/escapist fantasy, with an \"underground comix\"-kinda sensibility (I\u0027m a big fan of Jack Kirby\u0027s 70\u0027s work, Bronze Age- Marvel, comics produced during the black \u0027n white explosion of the 80\u0027s, Spain Rodriguez, Vaughn Bode, \"Fist of the North Star\", Shotaro Ishinomori, etc., etc... throw it all in a bag, and that\u0027s me). I guess it\u0027d be easier to just post a smattering of images rather than try to explain:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HVyXjm_njhM/Vp_TVelUuvI/AAAAAAAALVI/5Umkj4Y97gk/s1600/apemen_pg6_pg7_vol2_web.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/9470a893fbe3d1ccb48b51713d59c0b1/tumblr_oexq06d9Lt1rcxl23o1_500.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/ab2a3e64c4d04fa1270314bcd62d8f6e/tumblr_ob20unAhKQ1rcxl23o7_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that more or less brings us up to date with my life and work. And, it also brings us to where you, the potential patron, come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook, the truth is, I\u0027m going to keep drawing comics, regardless of whatever life throws at me. Just have a look at my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bradagenda/\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e, and you\u0027ll get an idea of how dedicated I am to keeping this thing going. But, I want to do even \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e, and by becoming a backer, \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e will enable me to do so!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you, the patron, get out of this deal? Well, \u003cstrong\u003eEXCLUSIVE CONTENT\u003c/strong\u003e, or course:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e-You\u0027ll have access to \u003cem\u003enew\u003c/em\u003e comics and art (strips, short stories, illustrations, etc) that appear online only for backers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e-You\u0027ll see posts* with sketches, thumbnails, previews, and anything else pertinent to my process regarding the Patreon-exclusive work I\u0027m producing; I\u0027ll give you as comprehensive a look inside my head as I can ( without splitting my skull open, of course ) as the projects progress. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 *\u003ci style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eA minimum of 2-posts a week should be expected .\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ci style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e-You\u0027ll be able to download and view my previous work digitally, as well as any future work yet-to-be completed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e-At the \u003cstrong\u003e$10 and above subscription-level\u003c/strong\u003e, you\u0027ll receive actual mini-comics/zines containing the completed Patreon-exclusive comics/art, as well as hard-copies of any other self-published work that are finished (\u003ci style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003ee.g. \"Ape-Men of the Apocalypse\" #3, etc\u003c/i\u003e) after the time your sub is placed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eSo, that\u0027s the gist of it; you kick in whatever you want to MONTHLY, and at a minimum, I\u0027ll give you as much as what is detailed in the \u0027rewards\u0027 section. To be honest, I\u0027ve never tried anything like this before, but let\u0027s give it a (head)shot!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C11AAa8VQAAqjv9.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
