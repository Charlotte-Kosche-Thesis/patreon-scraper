    "summary": "Use mind games to push your opponents off of cliffs and don\u0027t get pushed off yourself. It takes 10 seconds to learn and a lifetime to master. For 2 or more players.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBattlement will be initially released on all the major desktop platforms and available on Steam. It is best played with gamepads. To have more than 2 players also happens to require gamepads at the moment. There is no known upper limit to the number of players that can participate. During testing, I ran out of hardware after having 9 players in one lobby. On top of that, as of recently Battlement supports network play. Because of this, whenever someone asks me how many players Battlement supports, I say, \"All of them.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe current version includes only the sumo mode. Though I plan to bring back the other game modes in the future, I have discovered that one polished game mode is better than several half-baked ones. The sumo mode has an interesting story behind it. It started when I ran a beta testing session where everyone wielded swords and bows and magic and stuff like that. After most people had played enough for the time being and dispersed, I watched as two players stuck around and tried to push each other into chasms. They played as the archers, who don\u0027t attack as part of their pushing, so the only thing they were doing was baiting each other close to a chasm and then pushing each other off. It looked like they were having so much fun that I had to make a game mode just for that gameplay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSign up as a patron and you\u0027ll get your own copy. $1 gets you whatever the latest released build is and if you want updates, stay subscribed.
