Three different futures are coming to an end, and each one has pin-pointed the cause to a single person in time: a young catgirl named Tussel, also known as the Distortion.  Each one is sending their own representative back in time to deal with her and save their respective timelines.  Will it all go to plan?  Of course not!  And that\u0027s where it gets interesting...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving completed Wayfarer I\u0027ve now started on a new comic: Waypoint T Zero-2, which is also published at wayfarer1805.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the first page of it:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.wayfarer1805.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/waypoint01.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s also a slice-of-life story where a mechanic named Xani must venture out into deep space and fight a monster. Well, she doesn\u0027t know there\u0027s a monster when she heads out. Obviously, if she did she probably wouldn\u0027t have taken the job, but if that was the case there we wouldn\u0027t have a story! \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s well underway, but it doesn\u0027t hurt to have more help with this endeavor! Like anything, it takes time, and I have precious little of that to spend on things that don\u0027t pay the bills. So that\u0027s where you come in."
