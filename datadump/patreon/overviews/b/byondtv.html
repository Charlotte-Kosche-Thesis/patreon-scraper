We uncover it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.b-yond.tv/stories/\"\u003eb-yond tv\u003c/a\u003e, we take you to places that make the headlines, and present stories that don\u2019t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tHow are young women in Afghanistan battling gender barriers? Where are Panama hats actually made? (hint: not in Panama.) How is Mozambique getting guns off its streets?\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003eIn other words, our story-telling focus is where most of the planet lives most of the time. We believe that familiarity helps chip away at stereotypes, and we hope that our library of video content will encourage dialogue and foster cross-cultural understanding.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMODEL:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIn an innovative production model, we mentor and work with aspiring journalists from under-resourced communities around the world. Each story is a collaborative process with a local voice on the ground.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIMPACT:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tOur model has allowed us to add value to the lives of our journalists: a young woman in Afghanistan, traveling the country doing stories for us, has broken gender barriers and bought the first laptop her family had ever seen. A young woman in Armenia cried after receiving payment for her first story, the equivalent of one month\u2019s salary in a town starved for work. A young Palestinian woman, reporting for us, entered Israeli territory and interviewed an Israeli Jew for the first time in her life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003eWe have a multilingual team, often allowing for collaborations with journalists who otherwise would not be able to work with publishers in the West. With each story being a co-production, we offer an ongoing mentoring model.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTRACTION:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have produced from 30 countries, and hope to train people in, and report from, 100 more this year. Curious about our stories? Check them out here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.b-yond.tv/stories/\"\u003ehttp://www.b-yond.tv/stories/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you have asked for a podcast; we\u0027d like to launch one. Some of you have asked for longer, more in-depth documentaries. We\u0027d like to do those, too. Some of you have asked for an app. Down the road, we\u0027d like to have one, too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003eBut we need YOU to get there. Like any good journalism (and especially video), ours takes time, money and dedication. You have loved our stories so far. We\u0027d like to give you more. We\u0027d like to go broader, deeper, further. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we want to avoid a model that relies primarily on advertising (and hence on chasing views/clickbait content) because we don\u0027t want to compromise quality. We want to continue bringing you stories you won\u0027t see elsewhere. We want to collapse stereotypes, and build a niche, sustainable business model not only for you, but also for our journalists on the ground.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003eTo that end, we hope to build a community of patrons. \u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s make a difference, together! \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEven $1 a month from you would go a long way in keeping our lights on. \u003cstrong\u003eWe have some really fun rewards for patrons. We hope you\u0027ll check out the various tiers and perks and consider supporting us!\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
