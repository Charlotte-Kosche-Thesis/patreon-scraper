    "summary": "Since 2009 my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cycle-space.com/publications/\"\u003eessays\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cycle-space.com/blog/\"\u003eblog posts\u003c/a\u003e have amused and empowered the bicycle advocacy community. I have been motivated by the fact that there simply hasn\u0027t been anyone else with a PhD in architecture and urbanism (let alone anyone with my good breeding and literary flare), who shares my conviction that cities should not be designed for enormous machines. Cars and trams in cities, I hope you appreciate, are like chocolate fountains and electric bread knives in kitchens: more trouble than they are worth. In the same way that our kitchens work better when designed around tight rations of tools\u2014our chopping boards and knives, for example\u2014so too our cities would be more efficient if they were designed around bicycles... and not a lot more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut as a species we have never done that, you see. We have given drive-throughs and roller doors as gifts to the car and received what in return? Road deaths. Ill health. Workers caught in traffic, thus not performing their duties. We have flattered train lines with \"TODs\" (what ghastly terms these are we must use) only to find ourselves in cities with building stock that is inconvenient for those with young children; consider a mother pushing a pram, with her arms filled with groceries, as she struggles with elevator doors, or, if she is poor, then with stairs. This is not what our fathers fought for!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI put it to you that if only we were as prolific when it came to inventing new building-types that revolved around cycling, as we have been at inventing building types to enhance car and train travel, then, quite aside from making cycling attractive (which would be good for our health and our planet\u0027s) we would be having more \u003cem\u003ecomfortable\u003c/em\u003e lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can that be, you ask, when cycling lacks the comfort of driving? My thesis rests upon two axiomatic attributes of bicycle transport: \u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003ehow it is fast enough for trips at the scale of the city, yet nimble enough to avoid all congestion, and,\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ehow it could give people a tool for carrying things such as shopping and children to every level and corner of new kinds of purpose-built buildings. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eConsider these axiomatic attributes of bicycle transport with an open mind to the future shape of our buildings and cities, and you will be ready to jettison carriage makers from the halls of town planning. You will be angry that they use their great profits to foist more buses, trams, trains and cars on the city than the city requires. What the city requires, my friends, is for the roofs that go with those carriages\u2014roofs that only keep the carriage makers\u0027 customers dry\u2014to be taken and made into stationary porticos over our streets. It is cycling and walking that ought to have that all-weather protection. (Please don\u0027t tell me that you have gore-tex, so like being rained on when you cycle or walk. I doubt you would drive a convertible car with the top down in bad weather, because you\u0027re so in love with your jacket, and we are talking here about \u003cem\u003etransport\u003c/em\u003e, for our dainty wives and our little girls dressed as pink fairies).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage will give you access to essays written from a town planning mindset dating back to ancient Rome. It\u0027s a mindset we lost in the industrial era. Modern planning paradigms\u2014Garden Cities, Broad Acre, Radiant City, Transit Oriented Development\u2014all favour the carriage makers\u0027 enterprises over the citizens\u0027 needs. The only alternative, it would seem, is the \"urban village\" position, according to which we just walk; funny how its exponents all seem to live in the neighbourhoods with the good jobs, not the ghettos where opportunities are more than walking distance away.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome a patron and I\u0027ll bring you snobs\u0027 heads on a plate. I\u0027ll bring you thought constructs to cut through the bullshit objections you hear to bike transport in the course of your professional and volunteer work. I\u0027ll help you outgrow some bullshit assumptions you carry as well. You will even correct some of mine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho am I that you would value my radical and uncompromising positions? Here\u0027s the blurb I send to my clients:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003eDr. Steven Fleming is the director of Cycle Space International\nP/L, a consultancy bringing built environment expertise to the challenge of\nbuilding bicycling cities. As an academic he has published over 40 articles and\nbooks including \u003cem\u003eCycle\nSpace, Architecture and Urban Design in the Age of the Bicycle\u003c/em\u003e\n(NAi010, 2012) and \u003cem\u003eVelotopia\u003c/em\u003e: \u003cem\u003eThe Production of CycleSpace in Our Minds\nand Our Cities\u003c/em\u003e (NAi010, 2017). From 2015 to 2017 Cycle Space was the\npublic/private partner of the municipality of Amsterdam representing that\ncity\u2019s bicycling expertise to the world. In Amsterdam too, he curated the world\u0027s first Bicycle Architecture Biennale. His design propositions for\nbike-centric cities and buildings have been exhibited in museums and published\nin CityLab, FastCompany, ArchDaily, The Guardian, etc.. As the pioneer of urban\ncycling as an architectural endeavour he is frequently engaged as a draw-card\nspeaker to institutes of Architecture (New York, Rotterdam, Vancouver,\nSingapore, Sydney etc.) and major events (the launch of Europe by People,\nVeloCity, etc.). Clients include cities (eg. Singapore, Amsterdam, Bogota,\nNittedal and Ryde), agencies (eg. FutureBuilt Norway, the Property Council of\nAustralia, the International New Town Institute, the Shenzhen Centre for Design\nand the Architectural Institute of British Columbia), corporations (eg. Shimano,\nUniva America, Bykko) and property developers (eg. Boston Global Investors, Art\nGroup and Mavid Group). Since 2001 he has held academic positions at the\nUniversities of Canberra, Tasmania and Newcastle in Australia and Harvard and\nColumbia universities in the US and is a regular guest lecturer at the Harvard\nSchool of Public Health. As a government architect in Singapore he designed and\nproject managed 4 major developments including a total of 1810 dwelling units\nand designed a 2.4 hectare park, an early example of his life mission to design\nactive environments.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003eYou can verify all that with some web searching, or look for links on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cycle-space.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCycle Space website\u003c/a\u003e. Bottom line, is I am the world\u0027s leading expert at the nexus of bicycle transport and architectural and urban design theory and I will personally strangle Jan Gehl if he dares to contradict me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey say information wants to be free, but the person they\u0027re misquoting,\u00a0Stuart Brand, also said: \"\u003cem\u003eInformation wants to be expensive, because it\u0027s so valuable. The right information in the right place just changes your life.\" \u003c/em\u003eMy top price for information, is 6000 Euro per presentation, but that\u0027s a service that can change companies\u0027 fortunes. Since 2009 I have also written well over one thousand\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cycle-space.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog posts\u003c/a\u003e, that you can read free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomewhere in between are the essays and lessons you will pay a bit for, because they are sufficiently polished and developed to raise the level of all of our thinking. You will have already bought my two books (\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cycle-Space-Architecture-Design-Bicycle/dp/9462080046/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCycle Space\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Velotopia-Production-Cyclespace-Minds-Cities/dp/9462083525/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1519112254\u0026amp;sr=8-1\u0026amp;keywords=steven+fleming+velotopia\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVelotopia\u003c/a\u003e) but there are topics I can cover, and wrongdoings I can expose, on a Patreon site that I can\u0027t in a book. I mean, hell, on the other side of that paywall, I\u0027ll commit murder!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I can\u0027t promise Brits is that there will be no typos, or Dutchmen that I won\u0027t lampoon you as pillocks, or minorities that I won\u0027t offend you for sport.
