    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am a queer, nerdy, semi-professional archer living in the Los Angeles area and trying to make it to the Olympic Games. I started archery in college, fell in love with it, and put the rest of my life on hold to pursue shooting full time. I have been consistently in the top 10 US Women for the last three years, two of them as a college student and one as a Resident Athlete. When I am not training or working to pay the rent, I am an avid reader and writer of all things fiction and many things not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGetting to the Olympic Games is indirectly surprisingly expensive, and this is doubly true for Archery, where sponsorships come in the form of free or discounted equipment and extra $$ for medals won rather than support training for or traveling to tournaments. I find myself training independently, which comes with some incredible benefits but does not come with any kind of travel funding. It is especially difficult as an independent athlete to choose between working enough hours to afford competition and training enough hours to compete well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunds raised through Patreon will help me get to the five Team USA qualifying tournaments which take place throughout the year. These tournaments are vital for adding to sheer competition experience, which I will need in order to face the Olympic Trials with a level head in 2019. If I can shoot enough of them, they will also allow me to maintain - and hopefully improve upon - my national ranking, which is important for getting new sponsorships and eventually securing funding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get out of it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst of all, you get to be a part of this super cool Olympic quest. There is a lot more that goes on along the incredibly non-linear road to the Olympics than you will ever see on NBC. If you are the kind of person who, like me, spends the Games reading about all the athletes and their backstories, this Patreon is for you. You can expect regular behind-the-scenes updates about all the ridiculousness that goes into training, preparation, competition, and more. If things really get rolling, I will also be able to post some video content for y\u0027all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, you get to feel good about supporting the idea that the Olympics belong to all those who are willing to do the work, not just the ones who can afford to. Too often, talented athletes fall by the wayside because they or their families cannot keep up with training and competition costs. A community can do what an individual Olympic hopeful cannot by counterbalancing those costs. It takes a village to make an Olympian, which the USOC has known since the early 1900s when they invited regular folks to participate in the Games by sponsoring athletes. Turns out crowdfunding the Olympics is a tradition that goes back more than 100 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNitty Gritty - Budget, Goals, Overflow\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhy does it cost so much to shoot? A typical tournament can involve up to 5 days of travel, and is broken roughly down as follows:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAirfare - $500\u003cbr\u003eRegistration - $180\u003cbr\u003eHotel - $180\u003cbr\u003eRental Car - $250\u003cbr\u003eGas - $50\u003cbr\u003eFood - $200\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is without factoring in the cost of wages lost during travel, so as you can see, the expenses add up fast! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goals for this Patreon were calculated by taking the total projected cost for tournaments, working out how much I need to have in the bank by the month before the tournament, and then dividing that by the number of months between now and that deadline. For this reason, goals that have not yet been met will be adjusted as the season progresses according to what it would take to still get to additional tournaments. I will reassess the goals at the end of the season for the following year\u0027s needs\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the event that I accidentally raise more money than I needed to, the extra $$ will go towards shooting local tournaments for additional experience, and towards an emergency fund for replacing any equipment which may break unexpectedly during the season.\u003cbr\u003e"
