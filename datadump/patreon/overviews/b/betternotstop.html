I now wear a permanent back brace and do 90 minutes physio every day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI try not to let my condition affect my travels, For me, experiencing different countries and culture is a way to discover more about myself and how to make the world a better place. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eYour Support will help me continue to bring new content to my readers and listeners weekly, and ensure that I can earn a living doing this work.
