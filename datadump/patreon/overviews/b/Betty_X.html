    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m embarking on new terrain with Patreon. Hopefully this will be a perfect means for me to interact on a more dynamic level with everyone that has supported my work over the years, allowing them to get more involved and participate in my artistic endeavors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst on the agenda, I\u0027ll be writing, recording and releasing a series of secret singles throughout the year and you can be the first to experience it via advanced listening parties at VIP online events. I will also cover a few of my absolute favorite songs from various musicians throughout the eras.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, I\u0027d love to bring you visual content. But to do so, I must invest in new camera equipment so I can produce art vignettes, music videos, and short films. This has been a passion of mine for some time and your support will help facilitate this so that I can bring higher quality content to you. This will also make it possible for me to livestream performances worldwide.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThirdly, I\u0027ll be exploring the medium of podcasts. I\u0027ve always loved the strange and wondrous world of art, cinema and music via the lens of the paranormal. We can discuss, dissect and analyze  the  metaphysical, mystical, and the occult on my new podcast \u003cem\u003eTransmissions From An Unknown Source\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.bettyx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/BX_Sig_01.jpg\" style=\"width: 215px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Video coming soon!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBIOGRAPHY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBetty\u00a0X is an American artist, singer, and songwriter from Seattle, WA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough she considers herself to be more of a conceptual artist and a performer rather than a singer, her sardonic wit and unapologetic temperament is mirrored in both her music and her powerful vocal performances. Her music has been described as everything from enigmatic and surreal to aggressive and hostile, with lyrics that are often cleverly disguised social commentary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a background in fine art, she got her start in music back in the 90\u2019s when she formed the sleazy and provocative art rock band Salon Betty.  As the years progressed, her music steadily grew darker, heavier and more politically-charged. She eventually disbanded Salon Betty to focus on a solo career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the years that followed, she went on to become one of the most recognized female names in underground performance art and genre-bending rock music, having performed on stage with iconic legends like Pigface and Ministry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, it\u0027s all come full circle with her latest studio EP, \u003cem\u003eBad Juju \u2014\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ea surreal and paranormal Lynchian head-trip set against a dark and sultry \u003cem\u003eblues noir\u003c/em\u003e backdrop. While not as abrasive and hard as her earlier solo work, it\u0027s a perfect melding of the swanky and lighthearted art rock of Salon Betty and her hard-hitting dark experimental metal material.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe is currently busy recording a new full-length album with long time partner-in-crime Nate (El Fucxer) and the talents of Brian Tomlin (I Love You But I\u0027ve Chosen Darkness) and Sean Haezebrouck (The Dry Season). The new album will delve even deeper into a darkly surreal world unlike anything else she\u0027s worked on. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
