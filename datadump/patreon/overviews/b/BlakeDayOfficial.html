So I create Art in the form of music, music videos, poetry\nand novels. Art costs money like everything else, and this makes its creation\ntricky sometimes, impossible other times; but I want to make as much of my and\nour Art available to you as possible. And with that, I\u2019m asking for your help\non Patreon, which is like an ongoing crowdfunding campaign and a very important\nand convenient tool enabling the creation of Art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eAnd this is where you come in:\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\nall need each other\u0027s help sometimes. And now, I am asking for yours: Starting\nfrom only 1 Dollar, you can become a Patron and show your support on Patreon on\na monthly basis with an amount that you specify. In return, I\u0027ll share my and\nour creations with you. Here on Patreon, you\u0027ll be the first ones to get them,\nand sometimes the only ones. You\u0027ll immediately and directly get my songs, my\nvideos, my poems, my books when I publish them. No matter the amount of support\nthat you wish to give. Even if it\u0027s 1 Dollar. And you can cancel at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDepending\non the level of your support, you\u0027ll also get some extras \u2013 such as special versions, merchandise, personalised gifts, or you can meet me in Berlin and even participate in one of our recording sessions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eEverybody\u2018s support\nis deeply appreciated. If everybody contributes a small amount, then together\nwe can make meaningful Art and achieve a great thing \u2013 something that otherwise would never exist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis life is too short to waste my time and other people\u0027s time writing \nabout something unimportant, something mundane, something boring. All my\n artistic efforts aim at shaking bones, putting hearts to the test, and \nreinforcing souls. And with that, I\u2019m asking for your help, because our \ndays are numbered. I ask you to support me here on Patreon and help to bring my Art alive. I will be proud to share it with you and say:\u003cbr\u003eThank you for\ncreating something meaningful together with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove and Thanks,\u003cbr\u003eBlake Day\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find out more about me here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/BlakeDayOfficial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlake Day on Facebook\u003c/a\u003e or here: \u003ca href=\"http://soundcloud.com/blake-day-official\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlake Day on Soundcloud\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.blake-day.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
