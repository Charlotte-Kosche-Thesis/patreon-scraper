    "summary": "Greetings fellow adventurer! My name is Bjornsworkshop, and by making your way to this page, you have guaranteed yourself a spot in my story. I will tell you a little about myself so that you may more easily determine that I am deserving of your patronage.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy story begins a very long time ago. From a very young age, I have always loved fantasy adventure stories. I grew up reading LOTR, The Shannara books, Pern, and many other swords \u0026amp; horses or swords \u0026amp; sorcery types of books. Medieval fantasy stories run in my blood... I don\u0027t really know how else to put it. Medieval history too, was a passion of mine. As a child, any time I saw a set of armor or swords or anything else of the like... my eyes would grow to be as big as dinner plates, and my heart would race. I knew that magic was real.... The people who were able to make something as incredible as armor.... they had real magic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI start my story at this point so that you can understand why this journey is so important to me. As I grew up, I became a bit of a skill collector. I have learned how to make chainmaille armor, crack a bullwhip, juggle, whistle several different ways, and many other things.... Every hobby or skill I collected ended up losing my interest in a relatively short period of time. I would gain what i considered to be passing proficiency, and the rest of the activity lost its luster. Leathercraft has not been that way for me. After much reflection I have come to a couple of reasons why Leathercraft does not lose its ability to pique my interest: 1. \u00a0It is impossible to learn it all, 2. \u00a0Every piece of leather has slightly different properties and reacts slightly differently than every other piece, causing the entire process to gain a whole new level of dynamics. 3. \u00a0This is a dying art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my hope that I can advance my own skill and understanding of this ancient craft while simultaneously teaching a new generation of craftspeople how to get started. Leathercraft is an art that many are interested in trying, but nearly everyone who considers it doesn\u0027t ever take that first step because they feel that the art of leathercraft is inaccesible. It\u0027s too hard to get started, so they never try. As someone who took that leap and is now walking down life\u0027s path away from neophytism and seeking mastery, I can tell you that it is much easier to get into it than most people realize.... All you have to do is start. It doesn\u0027t matter if you use re-purposed general tools you already have laying around the house or if you spend $1000 buying all of the neatest newest best tools you can find. If it is important to you, and is something that you feel will genuinely improve your life, I think that you should take that leap and give it a go. I am here to share any and all knowledge I have acquired on my journey so far,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is 6:00 AM and I need sleep. I will be checking on this tomorrow to finish my thought and correct any incoherencies I have left behind. :P\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

The vast majority of what I do is leathercraft, but I also dabble in metalworking and a few other things here and there. My passions are creating things and teaching, so if you ever have any questions, never hesitate to ask. I have been leatherworking for about two years now, and most of what I do is medieval fantasy in nature. Check out my instagram ( www.instagram.com/bjornsworkshop ) . In those two years, I have come farther than I ever would have imagined, and can\u0027t wait to see where this crazy adventure takes me!",
