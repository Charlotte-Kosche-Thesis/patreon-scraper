That is, when I\u0027m not doing my day job, which is working at a library.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m a busy man, but I\u0027m doing what I love, so I can\u0027t complain. I started this Patreon account as a way to support the blog. (Writing a post each weekday takes time and attention, and sometimes that\u0027s hard to justify. The support I get on Patreon has shown me it\u0027s worth my while.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I\u0027m at it, I\u0027ve added ways for fans of my writing to get more of it. Check out the reward tiers and sign up for whatever strikes your fancy. And thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo read my latest blog posts, head on over to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://brycemoore.com/blog/\"\u003ebrycemoore.com\u003c/a\u003e"
