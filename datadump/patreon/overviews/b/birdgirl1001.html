I love \nlove love having sex, playing with my standard poodle, and writing \nletters to my college roommate on Wonder Woman stationary. I worship \nunicorns, collect throw pillows, play candy crush to fall asleep at \nnight, and fantasize about 3 month long hiking retreats on the daily. I \nwant to get paid $500,000 to speak on stage and start a non profit\n that utilizes the military decision making model to solve the greatest \nproblems in America. I am a professor, I am a mother, I am the producer \nof blogs that are meant to knock your socks off (\u003ca href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.birdgirlindustries.com%2F\u0026amp;h=ATNSXA9_uSTfv1ehWyGiZLk5mQMiaivXH31DjWVdnp5eWr3qUdSD7Ikl1REgu82Rd6KbzQIVUJ4XxUc0YTejDnzWk9IwbR5qyUJjubxf0arnW9pKs6QOZ_krx6GSJsTg3YUiwXEy-Sfrc-gXA6PjHyOsDcYDmuU54OqjgrAwRyMlU0IDqyP4HFwIAVnsKFf-hBbxOEHKDfnK-fkjNTYED_nhnEpkduwOgbkUI6sdTLvzQf4b0_mNlgb1wU0A1t3gdIFZj8TDZwlPUNdeK8zttGFMgoFMmXal1LAY-vcD\"\u003ewww.birdgirlindustries.com\u003c/a\u003e).\n I am building an army of women and social workers that are actively \nengaging in graceful revolution to change their worlds. I drink whiskey \ndaily. I adore black tea with heavy whipping cream in the fall. I love \nchunky sweaters and 5 inch heels. I drink Red Bull unapologetically. I \nam a bitch. I am a woman. I am terrified of people hating me for what I \nhave to say. I drive too fast and own a race car because my husband says\n I need a car that fits my personality. I love my mom and dad and have a\n complicated relationship with my sisters. I have built a solid tribe \nthat will be with me in jail if I need them to be. 43 is good and I have\n a great rack. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Dr. Melissa Bird, PhD. I am an activist. I am a writer. I am a social \nworker. I believe in the power of Twitter. I drive a convertible Camaro \nwhile listening to Metallica and Tori Amos. I have three children who I \nadore yet aren\u2019t biologically mine. I didn\u2019t believe in God until my \nex-wife left me in 2010 and I prayed for the first time. I believe in \nthe power of women. I love vanilla steamers with whole milk and whipped \ncream. I have been married 3 times, twice to men once to a woman.\n I started Bird Girl Industries because I believe in the power of \nspeaking on a stage to give women the tools to infiltrate houses of \npower so that we can take over government and public spaces. I have a \nbachelors degree in early childhood education and taught preschool. I am\n a lobbyist. I am a feminist. In 1st grade I was reading at a 9th grade \nlevel. I have recently discovered that being authentically me is more \neffective than being what I think others want me to be. I dream of a \nhouse on the coast and a house in the mountains. I am writing two books.\n I fantasize about wearing leather miniskirts daily. I love sex. I love \npower. I am a bitch. I am a loyal friend. I am told weekly to be more \ndemure and to quiet down. I am imperfect. I set goals and then don\u2019t \nmeet them. I set goals and then exceed them. I am a woman. I am a human.\n I am deeply devoted to changing the world by educating others. I love \nmy curvaceous, bodacious body. I am a rocker. I am a punk rocker. I cut \nup my t-shirts like it is 1988. I am unapologetically fierce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is me.
