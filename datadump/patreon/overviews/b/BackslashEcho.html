Sadly, I don\u0027t presently work in the industry, but I consider writing fanfiction to be a neat little loophole, as well as a lot of fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my fanwork (and a great majority of my daily thought) revolves around RWBY, Naruto, and other archives, as well as a handful of crossovers that seem interesting. The fact that anybody reads what I write is already an amazing feeling, and I appreciate every single pageview. Responses to my work have generally been positive, so I think I\u0027m mostly on the right track, but the only way for me to improve as a writer is to write! \u003cbr\u003eYour support will offer me the opportunity to do that more, and therefore provide story updates more frequently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI should emphasize that \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0of my fanfiction is and will remain free, unrestricted, and always available on at least two locations online. With support or not, I doubt I\u0027ll ever be stop writing, but donations like yours will help keep stress levels low and provide an additional incentive to spend my downtime doing what I love: telling stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(I would be absolutely thrilled if I someday get to a \u0027monthly\u0027 system. This would mean I\u0027m able to spend enough time writing that per-chapter donations are\u00a0infeasible\u00a0or unfair. It seems like a pipe dream, but dreaming never hurt anyone.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThank you kindly for reading and for your consideration. \u003cbr\u003eUntil next time, this is BackslashEcho signing off...and I\u0027ll see you on the other side!"
