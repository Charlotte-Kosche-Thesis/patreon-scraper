    "summary": "Well, hi there! Welcome to my Patreon page. So why the hell should you give me money? Well... Ok, hold on. I\u0027ll come up with something...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAh, right. You see, the goal of the Best Ever Food Review Show has always been to entertain and to expose (and I don\u0027t just mean me exposing myself). I mean exposing viewers to new cultures, food and customs in a way that\u0027s fun and entertaining.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love all that makes us different and I find that these differences, however endearing, usually end up being hilarious as well. No culture really makes sense including my own, but if we can learn more about each other with an open mind, maybe we can make the world a slightly better place. Also, it\u0027s just fun watching someone eat a disgusting bug.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I enjoy sharing my stories and discoveries with you, the biggest challenge in maintaining this channel comes down to time and money. I\u0027ve invested thousands of my own personal resources in equipment and travel. Right now, I have to work as a freelance videographer in order to afford what I do, but this takes away from planning, shooting and editing time. Your contribution will afford me more time to focus strictly on BEFRS.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, the people have spoken. Many of you have requested VLOGS. If you want to be a part of moving closer to this goal, please join with the others who are also supporting. Once I reach $250 a week, I can quit some of my freelance work and start doing vlogs for you guys. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease check out the rewards section too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to learn more about me and the Best Ever Food Review Show. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
