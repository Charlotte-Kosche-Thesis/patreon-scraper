    "summary": "Hello everyone Braxxis here:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are visiting this site then you probably know that I am the creator of the Divinity 2 GM campaigns The Lie of Succession \u0026amp; Seraphim Sanctum.\u00a0 After the last campaign I have decided to take this to the next level. After receiving the green light from Larian Studios to create a Patreon account I believe it\u0027s time to announce my plan for the year. I have a concept to create a Lvl 1-25 campaign. This campaign will be divided up into four acts releasing one every three months. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat separates this campaign from the other two is the party is going to level naturally. So no more grated levels, I\u0027m going to calculate the encounters and balance the XP drops from mobs so that the party will gain levels even during key encounters as planned. I am also implementing the same algorithm used in Seraphim Sanctum to create\u00a0 the unique feeling of GM vs Players as far as armour and damage dealt is concerned, so the war is on. I have quite a few more tricks up my sleeve for this puppy but I don\u0027t want to give too much away. If players decide to support this project as I hope they do it can\u0027t stop there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have every intention of spreading the wealth with the talented people I have found on steam to help with new map creation, mods, original vingnette art, so that this adventure will be completely unique from anything else available. That being said, I\u0027m not a Pr!(k so this campaign will still be released for free to the Divinity community. I am relying on the players and GM\u0027s who want this to support what I am trying to accomplish and essentially make them a new\u00a0 game based in the Divinity 2 world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProduction for the voice mods and the new campaign won\u0027t commence until February 21st 2018, I promised myself, my wife, and my band, I would take a break to recharge the batteries before I tackle this monster. This will also give me an idea if I will whether I\u0027ll have the support needed to pull this off, and if not, it\u0027s all good. This experience has been amazing. I have always been a musician and a songwriter. Being able to stretch my creative self has been worth the while even if it stops here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. doublejack.ca if you want to see what I do as far as music. As always, Cheers:)"
