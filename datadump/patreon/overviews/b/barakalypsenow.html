I created an educational YouTube channel dedicated to breaking down news and politics in our contemporary historical moment for my friends and family. I believe there\u2019s never been a more challenging time for the average citizen to comprehend the enormous barrage of information that we all face in our efforts to be informed citizens of a democracy under pressure. I aim to deliver my own research and commentary on a vast range of critical issues to my viewers and supporters \u2013 including racism, fascism, demagoguery and propaganda \u2013 but I can only do so with YOUR HELP!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Will You Do With My Money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support enables me to aggressively locate the ever-shrinking signal hidden in the noise of our 24/7 news culture. I create weekly deep dive video analyses with a supplemental email news roundup, frequent written blog posts, and personal coverage of local events when possible. Your contribution also earns you tangible benefits focused on creating an intelligent and curious community around these issues, including early access to my work, solicited critiques, one-on-one Skype conversations with me, T-Shirts and even special shoutouts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWith enough support, I\u2019ll be able to work full-time to generate this content on a predictable schedule without the pressure of affording basic necessities like food and rent. Everything beyond those expenses will go right back into my craft, improving my production quality and providing the highest-quality commentary I can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want an example of the kind of work I want to make more of, check out my newest video, \"This Is Neoliberalism: Introducing the Invisible Ideology.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/myH3gg5o0t0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Are You Doing This?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are currently living through one of the most dangerous and precarious moments in human history. Donald Trump is President, climate change is ramping up, nuclear war is rearing its ugly head, and homegrown fascism beginning is starting to flex its muscles on American soil. Understanding the convergence of these various crises is imperative to taking corrective action and creating a more just and sustainable world for all. That\u2019s why I\u2019d rather be educating myself and others about these crucial developments all day, every day, than working a conventional job that changes nothing about our situation. YouTube and Patreon \u2013 with generous support from my viewers and readers \u2013 allow me to generate a basic income that guarantees I can keep doing the work this moment demands of us as citizens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Can I Do To Help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe number one way to support my work is to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?c=1263676\" target=\"_blank\"\u003econtribute to my campaign via Patreon\u003c/a\u003e. There are numerous tiers of support, each with their own unique rewards that aim to foster an engaged community between me and my supporters, and between my supporters and each other. Each tier includes all of the rewards of the tiers before it. If you can\u2019t contribute through Patreon, that\u2019s OK!\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://paypal.me/barakalypsenow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYou can still make a one-time donation to me with PayPal!\u003c/a\u003e But even if you don\u0027t contribute, I would still love it if you watched and read my work, left me comments and shared it with your friends; that way you will still be participating in this community while helping it grow at the same time!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you to everyone who supports me. It means the world to me that I can do this kind of work with the help of my friends, family and complete strangers who know that a better world is possible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn solidarity,\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBarak Bullock\u003cbr\u003e"
