    "summary": "First of all - thank you so much for coming to visit this page! The fact that you clicked on the link at all means you gave some thought to how much work went into creating the video you watched, which makes you a wonderful person even if you don\u0027t have money to support it. You\u0027re the best!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I making?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeautiful Books is a video essay series about the most beautiful books in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I making these videos?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been collecting books for over 30 years.\u00a0I want to share my love and knowledge with people, to encourage and support you in building your own beautiful libraries. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI consider myself a \u0027book lover\u0027 rather than a collector, because a true collector keeps their books pristine and beautiful and invests with an eye for reselling, whereas although I hoard my treasures like a dragon, I also fondle them and evangalise their merits to anyone brave enough to enter my orbit. I\u0027ve lived and worked in many countries around the world, so my taste is eclectic and culturally diverse. I currently live in Australia (where book postage = nightmare), which means I look at all the different editions around the world before deciding which one is the best. My personal tastes have a bias towards illustrated fiction, children\u0027s literature, fantasy, and paper engineering.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not a fan of ads - life is to short to spend time on those - and I don\u0027t want to put anything behind a paywall. Making these video essays is time-consuming as I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make decisions about what you love and don\u0027t love, and I do a lot of research about the artists and publishing decisions behind each of the books that I present. But it\u0027s also a labour of love, and I\u0027m doing it largely for the joy of sharing beautiful things. So I am making all my videos free to viewers, without ads, and I will offer additional benefits to Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to make the essays a starting point for interesting discussions on the books. After finishing each essay I often still have tons of additional information to share that would be of interest to book-lovers, such as additional interesting anecdotes, or historical snippets, or further ideas to explore. I also know a lot about interesting upcoming releases and I will be making this list available to any of you generous enough to support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often do I release?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile my channel is new, I am releasing both short and in-depth videos several times a week to build up content. However, it has taken half a year of preparation to get these essays ready to go, so in future I will be moving to a more sustainable pace of a couple of in-depth releases a month. My release dates are slightly erratic, because my focus is on videos of quality, not quantity, but you can expect at least one new in-depth video every few weeks. The patron-only posts will go up either at the time of releasing the video, or within the next couple of days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can you help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, my channel is supported entirely by my love of books and - hopefully soon - the kindness of Patrons. Any support\u00a0you can give will go into making the essay series better: educational videos, video annotations, and additional resources. You will get Patron-only access to carefully curated additional resources about the books, information about upcoming beautiful book preorders that might interest you, as well as a possible opportunity to provide input about future video essays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your generosity and for sharing your love of books with me and the world.\u003cbr\u003e"
