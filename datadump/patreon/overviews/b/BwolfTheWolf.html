I started my third YouTube channel in 2013. The reason I decided to start uploading to YouTube was my sister. My sister had always enjoyed watching me play video games but as we got older and our schedules changed, we no longer had time to play video games together anymore. So I turned to YouTube as a way for her to still see the video games I was playing. After I had uploaded roughly 100 videos to YouTube I noticed I had gained a few random subscribers along the way. From this I developed a lust for making videos. 4 years later I have uploaded almost every single day and made over 1,600 videos. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe bread and butter of my YouTube channel is gaming videos. I generally play on the top difficulty and give tips and tricks as well as tell the odd random story. Another type of video I create is \u0027BwolfTheWolf cartoons\u0027 which are drawn by my sister. Also I occasionally upload Twolf videos. Twolf is a hand puppet that I use to share my thoughts about the current state of YouTube. He isn\u0027t very family friendly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(118, 146, 60); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eWhy am I joining Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have worked my butt off for years uploading one or two videos every single day, whilst also having a \"real\" job. I\u0027ve spent upwards of \u00a32000 on gear just for YouTube. This Patreon is a way for fans to help me out financially so that I can keep up with the top channels technology wise and also recover some of the costs I\u0027ve already amounted. I also receive many requests to play certain video games which of course, cost \u00a340 each time. Donations will help me fulfil more game requests. Yes, even those pesky horror games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube has also become a very unfriendly place for creators with many of our videos being falsely demonetised. This means I barely make \u00a34-12 a month from ads (at the time of writing). So with your help I can continue being the person you\u0027ve all grown to love without having to change my channel to please YouTube\u0027s questionable rules.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo put it bluntly. Money = more and better quality videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I do with your money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eBuy a new PC\u003c/strong\u003e. At the moment I\u0027m after building a brand new desktop PC. The reason I need a new PC is because my laptop is unable to use the new Elgato Capture card which records in 4K/60fps. With the new Elgato Capture card and a strong PC, I will be able to bring you 4K/60fps videos on YouTube and also be prepared for the upcoming PlayStation 5.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eBuy a high quality video camera\u003c/strong\u003e. Although my current video camera is good enough for my gaming videos. It is terrible outdoors. I recently bought (and then returned) a Sony a6000. I used it for my Bwolf Movie and it was great. Unfortunately I had to return it as I realised \u00a3550 was too much money for me and buying it had affected my savings badly. I would like to repurchase this camera for my outdoor projects. I have some cool ideas but lack the equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eBuy requested video games\u003c/strong\u003e. Sometimes people request that I play certain video games. I would love to please everybody but the cost of games makes it impossible. With my patreon money I will be able to fulfil a lot more requests. Even those pesky horror games. Note: This doesn\u0027t guarantee I will play all games requested. I have to at least somewhat enjoy the game to be able to record a good video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Nintendo Content\u003c/strong\u003e. As you may have noticed. I primarily upload PlayStation content. This is because Nintendo claim all videos which feature their IP\u0027s which means you won\u0027t make any money. Because of this I avoid Nintendo games at all costs. If you ladies and gentlemen join me on Patreon. I will be able to upload Nintendo content and ignore the loss I would make via AD revenue. You CAN get partnered with Nintendo and earn money VIA ads but their programme isn\u0027t currently available in the UK.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Pay the bills\u003c/strong\u003e. Even werewolves have to pay rent. So some money would naturally go towards bills.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
