    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is BandTools?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBandTools is a podcast and online resource that discovers the best online tools for bands \u0026amp; musicians, whilst providing helpful hints \u0026amp; tips for DIY band management \u0026amp; marketing along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe weekly podcast covers a different tool every week, explaining what it is, how it works for bands, how to use it, and tips on using it effectively.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe website is an online musician resource in the making. There are recommendations throughout the site on all sorts of band-related tools, but the highlight is the package that has a pre-made set of folders to allow for easy DIY band management. Each folder contains templates, examples and instructions on every aspect of running your own band. This package has been free until now, but is has received a major overhaul and this is where the Patreon campaign comes in...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy is BandTools on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst things first, you don\u0027t owe me anything. I am thrilled to hear people are enjoying the show and never expected so much interest, but I started it as a passion and will continue to do so. People have contacted me asking how they can support the show, how they can get coaching, how they can contribute.. It\u0027s all a bit messy on the website and hard for me to suggest anything solid, but now I can direct them to something that is easy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo go a bit further, here are a few more reasons behind it;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConfirmation of interest - If people are subscribing, then I know you are enjoying the content and I will continue to be motivated to make the best resource that I can!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney - My day job allows me to pay for a computer, gear, website, hosting, podcast, and all that stuff.. But with a bit of extra coin I can make the website WAY better and podcast WAY better. Premium website themes, nicer sounding audio gear, stuff like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePromotion - I want to reach more people with BandTools. Online advertising will benefit to find the musicians out there who have the potential to succeed but just need a bit of help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMerch - I want to keep giving away free t-shirts to people who call in to the show! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorth - The stuff I have put together in this BandTools database is 10+ years of work rolled into one pretty package. As much as I love giving it away for free, I just feel like i\u0027m selling myself short. A few bucks a month would be super rewarding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTest dummy - The whole concept of BandTools is about trying online resources for musicians and providing quality info to make their life easier. I want to give Patreon a shot and let you know what it\u0027s like. If it fails, we\u0027ll analyse the reasons why!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eF.A.Q\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Can I cancel or modify my subscription anytime?\u003cbr\u003eA: Absolutely. Your support is hugely appreciated regardless of the duration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Will I be charged if you are not releasing episodes.\u003cbr\u003eA: No way. That\u0027s why I like the idea of PER CREATION rather than monthly. I don\u0027t want payments if i\u0027m not releasing episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: I can\u0027t afford to pay for every episode, can I cap my monthly spend?\u003cbr\u003eA: I\u0027m told that you can. If you have any issues during check out just let me know.\u003cbr\u003e"
