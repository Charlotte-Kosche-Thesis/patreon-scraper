     "about": "We are Bizarrelyfunny, two cousins who grew up like brothers emulating the characters of early Mortal Kombat Games. Before we started on Youtube, we spent a lot of time practicing martial arts moves from \u00a0some of the greats like Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and Bas Rutten. We also started filming Backyard Wrestling Videos where we did promos, and wrestling matches against each other on the cold hard dirt. These things together helped us with our fight choreography, which we practice frequently in our Videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoon after, we filmed some random skits that we didn\u0027t even upload, and because they were so fun to film, we decided to start the Youtube Channel BizarrelyFunny in 2009. At the beginning we weren\u0027t very good, and did regular skit comedy videos which very few seemed to care for. We then started a parody series called Video Game Flaws, with our first parody being Resident Evil 2. From there, we moved onto Video Game Flaws: Real Mortal Kombat, and after filming the dialogue between Ermac and Stryker we came up with the idea to make a series where all of the MK Characters are roommates, called Real Mortal Kombat. This series primarily focuses on Scorpion and Sub Zero, and spun off into a Lets Play series called MK Lets Plays where Mortal Kombat characters play popular games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNowadays, we primarily film MK Lets Plays, Real Mortal Kombat, and Video Game Flaws exclusively, but the frequency, and quality of our uploads are hindered by one of us working 50 hours a week, the other going to school, and living $70 of gas away from each other. With these donations, the quality of our videos will increase and it will also allow us to film more frequently and dedicate more time to what we love to do.",
