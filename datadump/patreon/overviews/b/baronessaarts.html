    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, for more examples of my art and style (and possibly more consistent updates), please feel free to check out my Facebook page:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/crimsonbaronessa/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/crimsonbaronessa/\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoing art - creating and working with pencils, charcoal, pen, and paints - has been a love of mine for as long as I can remember. Unfortunately, with illnesses and the necessity of regular work-hours, finding time to do this and having the money to cover all my bills have not coincided very well, forcing me to work only a few hours a month on what I love - which isn\u0027t nearly enough!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout a year ago I started an art project that had to do with lots of detail, design, and patterns. I especially learned to love working with animals, skeletons, and blending the macabre with beautiful and delicate floral designs (Yes, I like Georgia O\u0027Keefe!). I have found that I really enjoy the detail work that goes into it (despite the agony of my poor poor wrist afterward) and in the growing world of adult coloring books, I knew I\u0027d found a niche for my love of excruciating detail.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also adore webcomics and have two currently in the works! The one I\u0027ll be working on first is a high school drama and romance called \u0027Silent Abbreviation\u0027. It\u0027s in the baby stages right now. I\u0027m working on getting at least one chapter done before I release it to the public, so keep an eye out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second is an adaption of my Jane Austen-esque novel (that isn\u0027t quiiiite complete); it\u0027s a delightful mix of proper romance, drama, love, and thrilling 1816 detective work! It\u0027s also very long. I\u0027m going to be putting it up for free on Webtoon as soon as I get more of it figured out, and as soon as I have more time I can dedicate to it. This will be directly influenced by you, my lovely little ducklings!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve currently got a novel up on Kindle Scout!\u00a0https://kindlescout.amazon.com/p/1F51CE7WAA0RG Please feel free to check it out and give me a nomination if you\u0027re so inclined. I\u0027m working on several other works at the same time so keep an eye out for excerpts and chapters for your viewing delight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of my visual art is done by hand first, and then neatened and fixed up via computer/phone if I feel the need. This means that sometimes it\u0027s about 1000x more time consuming than it should be, but I always feel like it ends up being worth it in the end! It also means that every mistake you see is a true-to-life mistake that I made! There is rarely beauty in perfection, anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon page is going to cover my comics, coloring pages, and my novels while sharing my progress and process with you, my Patrons! Any help that you\u0027re comfortable with giving, including just sharing my work and spreading the word about how awesome it is, is really greatly appreciated and helpful! I hope to see you all soon, and thanks for any and all help you\u0027re able to give.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost Sincerely\u003cbr\u003eMiss Ellie Anne"
