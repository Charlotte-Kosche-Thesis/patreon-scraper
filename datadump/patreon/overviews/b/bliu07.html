Plus, I can\u0027t teach workshops forever, and this will be a permanent home for lessons and teaching content. Once you join, you actually automatically get access to ALL previous content. I love to teach - my philosophy with teaching is not to have you photograph the way I do, but to provide you with a toolkit, a foundation, with which to continue your own creative journey. When I provide a preset, it\u0027s not the exact preset I use, because how boring would that be? I\u0027ll provide one to serve as a foundation, then teach you how to progress and start to build on that according to your style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and bonus? My husband Alex, the better half of our wedding photography business Alex + Betty, the Lightroom and tech nerd who sorts all of our gear and actually creates our presets, will be joining me in providing content as well.
