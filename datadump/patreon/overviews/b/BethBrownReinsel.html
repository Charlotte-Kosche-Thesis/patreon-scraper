    "summary": "Hi! I want to welcome you to my\nPatreon project! I am a fiber artist who focuses specifically on traditional knitting, and I am an instructor of historic knitting techniques. My area of expertise includes knitting primarily from the 19th century, the time of the advent of the sweater as we know it today. For thirty years, I have been on the road, teaching these old techniques. During that time, I have travelled in eighteen countries, including Scandinavia, the UK, and parts of the Baltic, absorbing as much as I can of the many knitting traditions of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough my work, I hope to honor and preserve the historic practices of knitting. These precious textile artifacts, usually hidden away in museum storage, tell a story: of women\u0027s work\u2013and of men\u0027s as well; of the hardships of life, and the deep human urge to make a useful object that is also beautiful. I have learned so much from the hundreds of museum objects I have examined, and from my readings and studies. I incorporate these techniques into my own knitting, my designs, and in my workshops, because it\u0027s\u00a0important to me to discover and disseminate these old skills, passing them on \u00a0to the mainstream of modern knitting. \u00a0It is my hope that my efforts will help to grow the art of knitting into the future for the next generations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, I have been unable to complete many projects due to the necessity of maintaining my intense travel schedule in order to pay my bills. I have several books and workshops to be completed that I started as far back as 1997!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou and Patreon can help me change that!  This website is based on the ancient concept\nof patronage, where patrons give support to artists (like Leonardo da Vinci and J.S. Bach) so\nthey are able to create more of whatever they are doing. Your generous pledge will make it possible \u00a0for me to develop and provide more knitting classes, patterns, and books which will continue the work of keeping these historic knitting traditions alive, making them accessible to the world. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis site is structured so that you will receive something for your investment. I have put together a program just for my Patreon\nsupporters.  Over the next few years I\nwill cover the countries whose knitting I have studied: England, Scotland, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Estonia, Latvia, and Canada. \u00a0I will be covering aspects from one country each\nmonth, February through December, using many methods to convey these skills, such as technique videos, PDFs, articles, patterns, charts of motifs, and more. January will be an overview, plus some technique video.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you participate, you may choose one of the\nlevels of monthly support on the right side of this screen.  Even $1 per month will enable me to continue my studies and research. You can end your patronage at any time.\u00a0By receiving money in this way, I will be able to develop online classes in my new School of Knitting Traditions, some that are too in-depth for me to offer at the big knitting shows. In creating my school, knitters can access this information on their own time, and people who can\u2019t travel to attend workshops would\nfinally be able to take a class! Proceeds from Patreon and the school would support my ability to generate more\ncontent. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn the future I can envision incorporating some of my patrons\u0027 ideas and feedback into my creation of new content: classes, designs, and books, all based on traditional knitting\u2013you can be a part of that process! I\u2019m offering group chat room sessions, one on one Skype or FaceTime meetings, and possibly knit-alongs of my patterns! \u00a0I might even teach a class here on Patreon with live video over a\ncouple months. Ultimately, this funding could help to support further research, to increase knowledge and understanding of traditional knitting I have\nnot yet fully explored!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDepending on your level of giving, you would have access to\nsome or all of these things!  And I would\nlove to hear YOUR ideas for other reward levels that I may not have considered.\u00a0Thank you so much for visiting my Patreon site, and for contributing what you can!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
