As I am full-time student geared towards the latter interest, I dedicate a lot of free time to the former two by writing fanfiction. Hopefully this Patreon will come to support me in doing what I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith respect to my writing, my claim to infamy is 0800-Rent-A-Hero in the Harry Potter verse. I love working on it and I cannot see myself stopping until it\u0027s finished, for whatever reason. So fear not, I am not ransoming my story like some kind of literary terrorist. Expect somewhat regular updates, whether or not you leave a tip.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s right, somewhat-regular, because on average it takes me more than 10 hours to write and edit a chapter (5-10k words) and sometimes that is more time than I can spare. There are many more tales that I would really like to tell, but I\u0027ve had to classify that as an ambition instead of a realistic goal for the same reason.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn practice, this is really what your support would contribute towards: my time spent writing as opposed to pursuing the many other things calling for my attention. It would allow me to write more often, which in turn will help me improve. After all, practice makes perfect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave you enjoyed reading my stories? Did you lose track of time and feel a pang of disappointment when there was no more? If so, then please think about supporting me for whatever you can. Top off my tipping jar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your thoughts.\u003cbr\u003e-brainthief\u003cbr\u003e"
