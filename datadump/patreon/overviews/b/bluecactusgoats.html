    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWHO ARE WE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe are a goat loving family of six that loves to work hard and play harder! Believe it, or not, this fun life all started with 4 chickens my husband, Derek, brought home many years ago. From there, I decided, \"heck.. if he can have chickens I should have goats!\" Our love for the goat has continued to grow!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt that time, we were on one acre and grew our small little ranch into something huge! We had chickens, ducks, a very large garden, and of course, the goats! I quickly began showing my goats and fell in love with the goat community. Only having one acre was a real struggle for me. I wanted to grow my herd and was limited to the amount of goats we were allowed to have (even though I went way past that amount.. hehe..)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout two years ago I decided to start looking for a home with more land. Even though it was out of reach in most cases, I continued to look at EVERYTHING in our area. It seemed I was merely chasing down a dream that would never come true. FINALLY! Over a year of hawking all listings daily and dreaming\u00a0of what could be, we found the home and land I never thought existed. Not only did it exist, but it was not out of our reach. A lot of pieces had to fall into place very quickly to make the home ours, but it did. And do you know what??? I CAN HAVE A LOT MORE GOATS NOW!! My main struggle\u00a0now is convincing\u00a0my husband why I need so many :).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY DID WE START A YouTube CHANNEL??\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell.. It was something we thought about for a long time.. Mainly Derek, really. We leaned on YouTube for many educational purposes, but it was close to impossible for me to find many channels that could educate me on my goats and showing them. I decided IF I were to ever start a channel it would be to educate people on showing goats and how to care for them. So finally, I decided to dive in and post our first video. Of course I wasn\u0027t in the video, but the main stars were. The adorable baby goats playing around and being silly. The second video we made, I was in. Have you ever talked to a camera knowing you will be posting it for millions of people to have access to?? Quite literally, may have been the hardest thing I have done. I swear, the camera would turn on and I would forget what a goat even was! One video would take the whole day to get past the opening, folks! I still cringe over my first videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a year of posting two videos a week, I have gotten past my fear of the camera. For the most part... All of you loyal followers have turned my fear into a dream! It has become my second job and I am working hard at making it my only job! Well.. plus a wife, plus a mother of 4, plus a goat herder-chicken raising-garden grower, of course.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have to be honest. Creating a Patreon account wasn\u0027t something I thought I would do. It was a little uncomfortable for me, to be quite frank. I never want our viewers to feel like I am asking for handouts. The fact that I have followers, and the list continues to grow rapidly, makes me so fortunate. The truth of it is, however, YouTube is an amazing platform, but the stream of revenue isn\u0027t very large.\u00a0 To make this dream become my full time job, more that one stream of revenue needs to be coming in. As I said before, YouTube is my second job. I put countless hours, if not more, into making videos every week. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I do it because I love to and I love all my followers! My goal is to be able to focus on the videos that have helped so many of you, and be able to give it my all! That can\u0027t happen if I have to drive to my Monday - Friday, 40 hour a week grind of a job. So adding a Patreon account may help me get closer to that goal!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other reason I finally decided to create a Patreon account is because of several followers asking when I was going to create one so they could donate. I couldn\u0027t tell you how amazing that feels. To have followers that are actually asking to support us through Patreon?? I am still in awe by that. You guys are the best!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWE CAN\u0027T THANK YOU ALL ENOUGH FOR YOUR SUPPORT!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo each and every one of you! Thank you, beyond the words can go! This journey has been very surreal. To read all the wonderful comments, on a daily basis, knowing that our channel has helped so many of you, makes me a very lucky woman!\u00a0\u00a0I am excited to see where we will be in another year, and the years to follow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to support us through Patreon, I want you know how very grateful\u00a0we are! If you are supporters on YouTube, you have made my unrealistic hope a dream that is closer and closer to being achieved! Thank You! Thank You!! Thank You!!!\u003cbr\u003e"
