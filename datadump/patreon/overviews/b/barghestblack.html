My name is Lauren and I\u0027m a novice taxidermist and naturalist trying to expand my knowledge of the natural world and preserving the dead. I hope to use this patreon to educate others on the art of taxidermy, insect collecting and skeletal processing. I\u0027d one day like to donate my collections and work to a natural history museum or university to be used in research and education!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a forewarning the content of this patreon will be gorey as I will occasionally post WIPs and streams of me working on skinning and processing projects - as well as anatomical reference photos for artists. If you are uncomfortable with blood and dead animals I highly recommend sticking to my twitter where I\u0027ll only post finish pieces or tanned pelts. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile at the moment I\u0027m looking for full time work, my patreon may be a bit slow as I do have to focus on rent (but perhaps once I\u0027ve reached a certain monthly amount I can focus on it full time and make lots of content)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy taxidermy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe taxidermy when done within legal means can be a great way to preserve life after death, everything I work on was not killed for the purpose of taxidermy. Taxidermy and preserved specimens have provided researchers with so much information over extinct and extant species that we might not otherwise have. This is especially true for insect collections (when done correctly and labeled) - many insects are keystone species that allow us to know how man is harming the environment and we can use collected specimens to help pinpoint how and why. Last of all, I think when done respectfully it is a beautiful way to honor the animal in death. Death doesn\u0027t have to be ugly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow did you learn?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI took my first class with Allis Markham at Prey Taxidermy in Los Angeles, from there I started learning things on my own! I\u0027m still very new, so patrons will get to learn along with me and from the plenty of mistakes I\u0027ll probably make. ;) Taxidermy.net\u0027s forum is also a wonderful resource but I will do my best to share any knowledge I gain through my patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you get your specimens?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI buy my specimens and pelts from various sellers, I will state that I am pro-trapping and pro-hunting when again done within legal means and no unnecessary suffering is caused. I believe hunting and trapping are necessary parts of wildlife management, while I don\u0027t personally do either I do not have an issue supporting them. Most of my specimens are either salvaged (i.e. roadkill, salvaged, stillborn, etc.), from depredation control, leftovers from someone\u0027s hunt for food, or donated from several online sources - all legally taken. Insects are collected by me. When I see good deals that I\u0027m not personally going to buy I will also link them to my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere can I learn about the laws?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKnowing your laws are INCREDIBLY important if you plan on dealing with animal parts in any way, Lupa has a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thegreenwolf.com/animal-parts-laws/\"\u003efantastic guide\u003c/a\u003e but you should still read through your own country and state laws as things can change all the time. You are always free to ask me questions regarding the laws and I can do my best to answer or point you in the right direction. If you\u0027re never sure who to ask consider contacting your state or country\u0027s Department of Fish and Wildlife. Many animals are illegal to have ANY parts of (especially nearly all birds in the US unless domestic, game birds or invasive) - this includes feathers. Refer to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) for more information. Other important information to look into is the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and CITES. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e*\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDue to import/export laws I will not be selling any animal parts I put up for sale outside of the USA.\u003c/strong\u003e*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the perks of being a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost this patreon is to allow me pursue a hobby I love while also providing education, reference and information to those who support me. I do not have tiers nor plan to lock things behind a high paywall, however by being my patron you gain access to process photos, tutorials and streams, early dibs on any products/taxidermy commissions, etc. and my love and attention.\u00a0\u2764\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you have any recommendations or suggestions for things you\u0027d like to see on my patreon please feel free to let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI hope you\u0027ll become my patron and come learn with me!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
