In the past 7 years, I have concentrated on a series of paintings that I refer to as \"Water Microcosms\" in which I depict small areas of creeks and waterways to reflect on human consciousness, ecology, and perception. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the beginning of my creations, I have been interested in nature, especially water and trees. \u00a0Now, I will embark on a series of large water motif paintings inspired from the Kalamazoo Nature Center\u0027s creek. \u00a0I have six photographs to correspond to four 48\"x60\" and two 48\"x48\" paintings to be arranged in a grid. \u00a0This format will hopefully immerse the viewer in an overall experience and wake up the senses to a feeling of interconnectedness.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother ongoing project relates to trees. \u00a0I am fascinated with the way trees carve out space and create a presence. \u00a0They sustain and they endure as the oldest living things on the planet. The way trees relate to the human body is also an interest. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan to do four large paintings looking up into trees depicting the four seasons. \u00a0The paintings will be 78\"x48\" per canvas. \u00a0I have photographs of the trees and I wrote a creative writing piece to relate to the four tree paintings which I will share once the paintings are finished. \u00a0I have started one 48\"x30\" sepia tree drawing for this project. \u00a0I may submit these four paintings for the Grand Rapids Art Prize for next year in 2017, but I also have another idea in the works as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will post any new preliminary drawings, paintings, and finished large scale paintings related to these series and other projects. Patrons will be rewarded with images, cards, prints, drawings, and paintings. \u00a0All patrons will be able to see new images online with my process instructions on how to make a particular painting or drawing. These descriptions will be like tutorials, and I encourage patrons to respond, ask questions and make comments about the artwork or the process. \u00a0This can act as an interactive online class, starting at $2 per month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny pledges will help me to purchase large canvases, paint, drawing supplies, paper, ink, and brushes as needed. \u00a0I plan to show the finished work in a Midwestern exhibiting space, possibly a rented space. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA future goal is to build a 16\u0027x40\u0027 studio-gallery barn on our Barton Lake property to get my current studio out of the basement so we can make room for a new baby on the way. \u00a0In this studio-gallery I plan to hold instructional workshops, art exhibits, and benefit auctions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your time in reading this! \u00a0I appreciate your interest and your support!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_fill,h_415,w_620/g5h34iy7bnxsglpmgwc9.webp\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is an image of the future Bernhardt Studio-Gallery on the Lake made by Prairie Built Barns.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo see more of my work online, please visit: \u00a0www.bernhardtfineart.com\u003cbr\u003e"
