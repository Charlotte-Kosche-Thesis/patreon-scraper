    "summary": "Hi there! My name is Bella Blue. I am born and raised in New Orleans and am a full time burlesque performer, producer, and educator. I have created this account to share my work with a broader audience who believe burlesque and it as a medium to create experiences for performers and audiences alike. I have found that because my fan base has spread out so far, many people would like to support it but aren\u0027t physically able to come to shows because they live in other cities. I thought this might be a great way to perform for those supporters and perhaps make some new fans as well!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have spent over decade performing and teaching burlesque. I make most of my own costumes and I also choreograph all my own acts. With your support, I can continue bringing burlesque to the masses through my travels and by producing quality burlesque and variety shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also in the process of getting my 400 hour yoga teacher certification. While I want to continue producing and performing as long as possible, I also want to be realistic in what life has in store. Bodies are temporary and I know that one day I will need to transition into another career. Yoga is something that came into my life in 2008 and was always something I knew that I would want to pursue when the time is right. In 2016, I got my Restorative Yoga Teacher certification as well as a basic 100 hour training. This November, I will complete my 400 hour training which will put me at over 500 hours of training that I hope to be able to go out into the world and provide a medium for others to find their own healing in peace through yoga. I have already been able to incorporate many levels of yogic philosophy and teaching into my burlesque classes and performances. It has truly changed how I see burlesque as an art form and the world as a whole.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my favorite quotes:\u003cbr\u003e\"Originally, the shamanic role of the artist was to uplift people with authentic experiences of transcendence, to inspire them to move out of the mundane and toward the divine.\"\u003cbr\u003e--Sharon Gannon/David Life\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that through my burlesque and dance experience combine with everything I am learning in yoga teacher training that I will be able to do just that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Born and raised in New Orleans, Bella Blue started dancing at the age of 3 studying extensively in ballet and modern into adulthood. In 2007 she traded in her pointe shoes for pasties and hasn\u2019t looked back since! Her style can be best described as unpredictable! Bella can offer everything from classic fan dances and reverse stripteases to androgynous, neo, and controversial pieces. But no matter what, expect to be entertained! She has become one of the most recognized burlesque performers in New Orleans, across America, and in the world. At the start of 2015, she debuted at #16 in the \u003ca href=\"http://21stcenturyburlesque.com/burlesque-top-50-2014-20-11/\"\u003eBurlesque Top 50 by 21st Century Magazine\u003c/a\u003e. In 2014, she headlined the Virginia Americana Burlesque and Sideshow Festival and the Caput Mundi Burlesque Award Festival in Rome, Italy. She also made her Burlesque Hall of Fame Weekend debut in June 2014 where she was invited to perform in the \u201cMovers, Shakers, Innovators Showcase.\u201d So far in 2015, she has headlined Nude Nite Orlando, The Great Burlesque Exposition in Boston, The Vienna Boylesque Festival, The Oklahoma City Burlesque Festival, The Snake Oil Festival, and she has performed at the highly esteemed Life Ball; the world\u2019s largest AIDS fundraiser taking place annually in Vienna, Austria.\u003cbr\u003eBella\u2019s pride and joy is The New Orleans School of Burlesque, where she has reigned as the headmistress since 2008 and hosts New Orleans\u2019 only weekly running of burlesque classes. She has taught the art of the tease to hundreds of women and men from New Orleans and beyond. The New Orleans School of Burlesque is also host to a number of guest teachers from across the country and specialty workshops. Bella is deeply entrenched in preserving burlesque in New Orleans (which is rich in burlesque history) and can often be seen performing in other local productions and fundraisers.\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to running the school, she is one of the leading show producers in New Orleans. She is the Artistic Director of \u201cThe Dirty Dime Peepshow,\u201d \u201cThe NOSB Student Showcase,\u201d \u201cStrip Roulette,\u201d and \u201cThe Blue Book Cabaret.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e",
