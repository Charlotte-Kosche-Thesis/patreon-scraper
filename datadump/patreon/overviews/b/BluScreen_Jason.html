Welcome to my corner of the internet!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a Youtube content creator focusing on video gaming commentary and discussion, but who isn\u0027t these days? What makes me different? Well in case you\u0027re not familiar with my channel and what I do, I\u0027ll give you my sales pitch, and link you to my channel so you can judge for yourself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that commentary should be informative. Humour and other entertaining elements should be used to accentuate on informative commentary. As such, my focus when covering a game is first and foremost on informing the viewer. My videos tend to be part \"Let\u0027s Play\", part review, and part tutorial/walkthrough. I approach each game with a sense of curiosity and desire to understand how the game works on a base level.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course it\u0027s important to have fun while playing games, I approach each video as if I was just sitting down and hanging out with friends... very silent friends... who don\u0027t talk back to me. It\u0027s probably better if I just let you see for yourself:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SkyeFlayme\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy channel page\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I use your pledges for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy regular job gives me enough to cover bills and not much else. Rather than increase hours further and reduce the amount of time I can put into the channel, your pledges would ensure that I can at the very least maintain my current level of content. Beyond that, extra funds will be used to make hardware and software purchases to improve the quality and quantity of videos on my channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like being accessible to everyone. Go ahead, add me on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BluScreen_Jason\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSteam\u003c/a\u003e, on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/BluScreen_Jason\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e.
