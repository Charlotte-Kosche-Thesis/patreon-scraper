As an 18 year homeschooling veteran, I am on a simple mission: \u003cem\u003eTo make the choice to homeschool an easier one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThe homeschool world is filled with people and organizations lining up to tell you why their approach is right and what you\u0027re doing is wrong. There are days where it\u0027s enough to make the most confident, loving, intelligent mother go weak in the knees with doubt. I want to change this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to cut through all that noise and consistently remind you...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can do this.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNo one loves your children more than you do.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNo one knows your children\u0027s needs better than you do.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSo you are the perfect person to invest in their training and education.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eBut I can\u0027t accomplish this mission alone. I need your help! There is so much future content bouncing around in my brain. Podcast episodes. Blog articles. Webinars. Livestream events. Resources. Tips. Lifehacks. And so much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnter Patreon.\u003c/strong\u003e Through this site, you can join in the mission with me.\u00a0When you choose to support the show, you are investing your treasure (your time and hard earned money) into something bigger than yourself--something that will benefit the rapidly growing homeschool community which may one day include your grown children and dear friends who have not yet started homeschooling. Together we will have produced great content that makes their efforts more successful because they are able to stand on our shoulders and learn from our experiences. What a gift you can give them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupport is simple.\u003c/strong\u003e Most homeschool families already have the task of supporting a large family on one income, so budgets are important. That\u0027s why I\u0027m so thrilled that Patreon makes it possible to give regular contributions (as little as $2 per month) at a level that works for you. And in appreciation for your support, I\u0027ve come up with all sorts of fun rewards for each contribution level--including suggesting more rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo ask yourself these simple questions: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eDo I want to help make homeschooling an easier choice for others?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eCould I benefit from taking an active role in a community like Beyond Curriculum patrons?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eDo I want Julie to produce more great content that keeps me encouraged in my journey?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIf you answered yes to any of these questions, then choose your contribution level and let\u0027s get started today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

She studied Music Performance at Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, TX where she met, married, and started a family with her husband, Jeff. Passionate about personal freedom and responsibility, homeschooling was a natural fit. With encouragement from friends and family, Julie started the Beyond Curriculum Podcast in early 2017. When she is not homeschooling or podcasting, Julie can usually be found at her kitchen table researching, developing, writing, or consulting for her first business venture\u2013Talent Insights. She also enjoys spending time with Jeff over a wonderful meal, taking in a musical performance, or walking the beautiful streets of downtown Fort Worth. Grateful for the fruits of homeschooling, Julie looks for opportunities to encourage and guide others down this rewarding path.\u003cbr\u003e",
