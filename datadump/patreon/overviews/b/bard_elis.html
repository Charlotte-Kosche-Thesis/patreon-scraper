Storytelling is integral to my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo one day, I decided to write a story (or two) of my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to Patreon, and the loving support of those around me, I am finally able to begin my dream of becoming an author; of building worlds, researching things I would never have had reasons to investigate before, and painting a picture in the mind\u0027s eye of my viewers. I have attempted this many times in the past, but now is the time to push forward and finally finish my dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of this Patreon is to work through the writing and world-building process of my upcoming novela. Based on the overall value of pledges, new features will become available to all Patrons; rough drafts previously removed after being edited, character concept art and outlines, research materials, etc. Tier-based compensation will be a long game for all of you, since many rewards will not be available until the books are near completion; discounts on merchandise or the novels themselves, personal invitations to book signings, etc. However, I appreciate your patience with me and my stories in the coming months, and look forward to your input on this momentous project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, Patrons, for everything that you have done (and will do) for Creators like me.\u003cbr\u003e"
