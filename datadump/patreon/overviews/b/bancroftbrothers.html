    "summary": "Welcome to \u003cstrong\u003eThe Bancroft Brothers Animation Podcast.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is a podcast where two ex-Disney animator brothers (who happen to be twins!) talk about their careers, other famous animation folk\u2019s careers, creating,\ngrowing artistically, branching out\u2026having dreams and making them come\ntrue!  Our goals for the podcast is not just to talk about current events in animation (although we do that), or discuss the\ndifference between art and commerce (we do that too) but mostly, we are here to\nEDUCATE, INSPIRE AND ENTERTAIN (not necessarily in that order).  We strive to make a podcast like one that we\nwish we had when we were younger.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhy we do a podcast:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  Tom and Tony love animation. In fact, we used to call each other every week, not to talk about our families, but to talk about what was going\non at Disney, Sony, Dreamworks, animation projects we wanted to make or things we were working on currently. It\u2019s\nnot only our careers- it\u2019s our passion! We\u2019re\ngoing on 30 years working in the animation industry with all kinds of ups and\ndowns and we love to talk about it. We have hundreds of professional friends\nand celebrities that we love to talk to and about. We do it for people\njust like you!  We want to give back and\ncelebrate the industry and art form we love. Join us!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nWho we are:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nTom Bancroft\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  After leaving the prestigious California Institute of the\nArts, I began my over 25 years in the animation industry, most of which was for\nWalt Disney Feature animation where he was an animator for 11 years on films\nlike: \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d \u201cAladdin\u201d, \u201cPocahontas\u201d,\u201cMulan\u201d,\n\u201cTarzan\u201d and \u201cBrother Bear\u201d for which he animated characters like Young Simba,\nJafar and Iago, Pocahontas, Rutt and Tuke and lead the design and animation of\n\u201cMushu\u201d the dragon.  After Disney, he\nworked with Big Idea Productions as a Supervising Director/ Co-creator for a\nVeggietales DVD series \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHis popular character design\ninstruction books, \u201cCreating Characters with Personality\u201d and \u201cCharacter\nMentor\u201d have become the most recognized in the industry and are required textbooks\nat many art schools around the world. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nTony Bancroft\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  After going to CalArts with Tom, Tony also worked at\nDisney for over 12 years as an animator on \u003cem\u003eBeauty\nand the Beast \u003c/em\u003e(Cogsworth),\u003cem\u003e Aladdin \u003c/em\u003e(Iago),\n\u003cem\u003eThe Lion King \u003c/em\u003e(Pumbaa),\u003cem\u003e The Emperor\u2019s New Groove\u003c/em\u003e (Kronk) and as\nco-director of \u003cem\u003eMulan\u003c/em\u003e.  At Sony Animation, he was the animation\nsupervisor on \u003cem\u003eStuart Little 2\u003c/em\u003e.\nBesides work at the big studios he learned what it was not to make money but\nlove what you do by owning and operating his own animation studio and now is an\nindependent animation director and producer creating his own animated features.\nIn his spare time, he makes babies with his wife (3 girls!) who will go on to\nrule the world\u2026or at least their father. In his 2nd and 3rd spare times, Tony writes books like \u003cem\u003eDirecting\nfor Animation\u003c/em\u003e, speaks at colleges and conventions and is (the better) half\nof the best podcast in the world, The Bancroft Brothers Animation Podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
