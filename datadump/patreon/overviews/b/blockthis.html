    "summary": "Hey guys. I\u0027m\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://savageorgiev.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSava\u003c/a\u003e - the creator of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://block-this.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"Block This!\" - Adblocker \u0026amp; Privacy app for Android\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs most of you probably know \"Block This!\" is an enhanced privacy \u0026amp; ad blocking app, that aims to fight malware, viruses, tracking cookies, ads, etc., but most of all it fights greed. Nowadays big corporations will do anything to get your money, by bundling their software with junk that just hinders your experience and/or collects your personal information in order to later sell it to advertising companies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made \"Block This!\" out of frustration, as this affects me no less than it affects you. For me it is a way of saying \"NO\" and opposing to those who invade my privacy and follow me everywhere on the internet trying to make me believe I will be better off buying their stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the app was taken down from Google Play for violating  their \"Distribution Agreement Terms\" I felt like it was over. But I did not give up and decided to make the app FREE even if that meant paying for its existence from my own pocket. Since then, the feedback I got from you has given me confidence and I\u0027m starting to believe that the app has a greater future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to be able to put more efforts into expanding our community to iOS and Windows, but as you can imagine I cannot do this all alone. As the app is completely free now, I have to balance between my 9 to 18 job as a software developer and working at home afterwards to improve \"Block This!\" and provide support to users.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here I am on Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way for people to patronize an idea and support its development. If you agree with my vision and wish to be part of it, please become a Patron and support me so that I can continue to develop and expand this software. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
