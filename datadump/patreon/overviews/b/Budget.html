    "summary": "When I was very young, I had a dream of being an entertainer. I loved performing skits for my family, making up funny stories, and playing DJ with my enormous 80\u2019s boom box. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut somewhere along the way, I let my shy, introverted and practical ways get in the way of my dreams. I thought performing as a career was a pipe dream and certainly not one that would pave the way toward future financial success. Instead \u003ca href=\"http://www.tonyadesigns.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eI chose a career in television\u003c/a\u003e working behind the scenes, figuring it would be the second best thing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFortunately, I continued writing, and have always found a way to express myself\u2026\u003cstrong\u003ebut I always knew I wanted more.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2005 my brother was devastated to find out he had colon cancer. I was inspired to \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/20379541\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ecreate a documentary\u003c/a\u003e about his experience, and how we raised money for the Livestrong Foundation. I\u0027m happy to say my brother is fine, but I loved creating the documentary, \u003cstrong\u003eand in the process rediscovered my true passion: storytelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, life, my job at the time, and a million other excuses got in the way of making videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I created \u003ca href=\"http://budgetandthebeach.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBudget and the Beach\u003c/a\u003e in 2012, I immersed myself full force into that creative outlet. As the blog grew, so did my confidence that people enjoyed the content I was taking from dream to reality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, in the summer of 2014 I combined my skills as a writer, video editor, and closet performer, and created \u003ca href=\"http://budgetandthebeach.com/batb-tv/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBudget and the Beach TV\u003c/a\u003e. I didn\u0027t want to record the typical one person in front of a camera doling out financial tips scenario. I wanted to imagine something fun, funny, and and educational for my viewers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI love storytelling and I\u0027m so incredibly passionate about the material I want to create, but to continue doing it, I need help financially. \u003c/strong\u003eWhile I can tackle many tasks on my own, some require help\u2026.and money, for example a camera operator, motion graphics artist, sound operator, etc. \u003cstrong\u003eFor now I\u0027ll never be producing more than two videos per month, so you can budget accordingly! And you can cancel at any time!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI appreciate any support you can give!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Can\u2019t spare a dime? That\u2019s okay. It\u2019d still mean the world to me if you could take a moment and share my story and videos with your friends, family, and social network! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much! \u003cbr\u003e-Tonya\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://budgetandthebeach.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_6118.jpg\" style=\"width: 323px;\"\u003e"
