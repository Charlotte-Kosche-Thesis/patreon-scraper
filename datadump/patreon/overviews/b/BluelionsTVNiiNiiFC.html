    "summary": "Hey everyone this is NiiNiiFC from Bluelions TV and yeh, now\u0027s my chance to try and sell to you, why your donations can really help boost the channel\u0027s quality and content and elevate it to a different league!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere my love for Chelsea began!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0But before i get into that, i want to talk about myself and my love for Chelsea. I went to my first game in 1999 ( I won\u0027t forget the day), i must have been 6 or 7 years old and the first game I ever watched was against Sunderland! We beat them 4-0 and Gus Poyet scored an amazing acrobatic volley. Since that day, my passion for Chelsea and football kept growing and growing and the club is a massive part of my life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eHow fast the channel has grown and why i got into YouTube!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I decided to start a YouTube channel as I wanted an outlet to express my footballing views, as i didn\u0027t really have any friends or family who cared much for the beautiful game.\u00a0I decided to channel my passion and delved into YouTube. I studied my videos and taught myself from scratch, now a year has passed and the channel has grown exponentially!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts been an amazing journey so far and along the way i was lucky enough to meet my friend Andie, who invited me on to this channel to collaborate. Since then, we decided to partner together and run in alongside each other, to great effect! The channel is close to 10,000 subscribers and we should meet that target in the next few days as we are getting a couple hundreds subs every day now!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhat the point of the channel is!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0The vision i always pictured for the channel was to always offer very insightful and thoughtful opinions on football. The football community and media in general sway\u0027s towards the reactionary and i just could not relate to it. I realized observations i noticed where often overlooked and the level of analytical observation and discussion was poor. This channel was created to offer what is lacking with football content today. We will always strive to follow that mantra, we value level headed insight and community above all!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eFuture plans for the channel!\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u00a0We have big plans which we are preparing in advance before the start of the new season begins!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0- \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI am planning on introducing Match Vlogs for the start of next season, so you can get the NiiNii FC experience!\u00a0\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 -  \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003ePodcasts will be introduced from next season, special guests have been lined up to make them interesting!
