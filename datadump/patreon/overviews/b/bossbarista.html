    "summary": "Hi friends! We\u0027re Boss Barista, an award-winning intersectional feminist podcast. We interview folx who are often overlooked or marginalized in the coffee industry, and talk about issues that affect baristas and coffee professionals everyday.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCoffee touches everyone. Most people don\u0027t see anyone as often as they see their local baristas, and coffee travels the globe to get into our cups. Coffee affects everyone around the globe, and that\u0027s why we believe it deserves a closer look\u2014a critical eye to delve deeper into issues of race, sexism, ableism, gender identity and sexual orientation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoss Barista is hosted by Ashley Rodriguez and Jasper Wilde, two coffee pros who were annoyed with the level of discourse available in the community and eager to both shed a light on important issues and learn along the way. We mess up, we discover new things, we sing a couple of \u0027Fuck Trump\u0027 chants at the end of episodes. We try to put out at least two episodes per week, and currently have over 30 episodes, covering both topics that are timeless within the coffee world (tips? customer service? we got this) to breaking stories and newsworthy ideas.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve considered working with sponsors, but we\u0027d like to keep the message and the ideas behind Boss Barista pure and uncluttered as best we can. We have never made any money on the podcast and both work full time in our industry, as baristas, writers, and advocates for the coffee community. We volunteer a lot of our time to help build the coffee community around us\u2014Boss Barista is a passion of love we do on the side. We were lucky enough to have a hand with editing for the first few months, but we\u0027ve recently taken that over as well, so Boss Barista is completely made, produced, and edited by the two of us. By supporting us, you support our continued mission to elevate the voices of the marginalized and make coffee accessible for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
