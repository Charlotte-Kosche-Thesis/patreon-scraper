    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are ya?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a wrestling fan who makes stupid videos for other wrestling fans. My contribution to the world since 2007 is Botchamania, which is a video series about everything good, bad and Sabu to do with wrestling and video game music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough mostly focusing on the botches (hence the name), ridiculous moments in terms of booking, storylines and in real life are highlighted (lowlighted?) with a healthy dose of nerdy jokes that are aimed at people like myself (adults who should know better).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWait a minute sunshine, you\u0027ve been doing these videos since 2007. Why are you suddenly on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBotchamania is free. If you want to donate a dollar, you can get to watch the new videos a day before anyone else. If you don\u0027t want to do that, nae bother:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou still get the video. For free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect everybody to donate a dollar and I\u0027m very thankful for everyone who does, but it\u0027s not essential for Botchamania\u0027s existence for you to do so. I don\u0027t have it in me to beg or guilt people into paying my rent and I apologise for the very badly-worded last Patreon statement that (understandably) annoyed so many people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo pat myself on the back Barry Horowitz-style, I\u0027ve been quite happy with the good relationship I\u0027ve built up over the years with the fans and been impressed I haven\u0027t made too much of a tit of myself or got drunk on Twitter or something.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then I typed a whiny Patreon message which effectively said \u0027\u0027IF I DON\u0027T GET MONEY I\u0027M QUITTING\u0027\u0027. Which is why you should never type shit when in a bad mood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou don\u0027t have to like me to like the videos (which is just as well) and it\u0027s just as well so many of you are forgiving. If you want to donate and help a guy out, that\u0027s fine. If you don\u0027t want to but want to continue watching the videos, that\u0027s fine too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust remember: anytime a wrestler botches and I make fun of them, they can always type \u0027\u0027fuck you Maffew, you embarrassed yourself on Patreon.\u0027\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about the donation levels above a dollar?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSome people wanna give more, so I\u0027m giving other incentives. The only way you get \u0027money for nothing\u0027 is via Weird Al.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have other ideas for incentives, I\u0027m open to ideas. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust when you think I have all the answers...I fuck it up by opening my mouth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about: if I donate a few dollars more I get to pick a song for the videos?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGOD NO.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tried that before in the past with the MAGFest Kickstarter and it wasn\u0027t a good idea. A lot of Botchamania\u0027s charm comes from the music selections and last time I did that, a lot of un-Botchamania songs then had to get used. I tried to give some people their money back for bad songs but they wouldn\u0027t take them. So yeah, I won\u0027t do that again. I don\u0027t care how good your band is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat happened to that $3,000 thing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to the poor typing (my bad) and some other people trying to be helpful and linking this Patreon on websites with the title \u0027\u0027HELP MAFFEW QUIT HIS DAYJOB!\u0027\u0027, a lot of people got the idea that I needed three grand to live or something. This was a mistake but I accept \u0027\u0027Three Grand Maffew\u0027\u0027 as an ironic nickname.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027re making other videos like Let\u0027s Watch Raw and SinCaraMania. Am I going to be charged for those too?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, just the ability to watch Botchamania two days before anyone else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other videos are my attempts at trying new things and giving you people intended value for money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSinCaraMania was made, any other targets?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now? Nah. If you have any urges, send \u0027em this way.\u003cbr\u003e"
