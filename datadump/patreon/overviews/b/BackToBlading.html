    "summary": "I started Back to Blading in 2016 as a way to create content for people picking up skating again after being away for a while. I was documenting my skating journey on the YouTube channel, reviewing the products I was buying, and eventually started a podcast with my friend Ben to talk about all things blading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBack to Blading has always been about promoting skating; getting more people to skate, and keep them skating once they started. And it\u0027s working! Every week I get a message from someone saying that they\u0027re skating again because of Back to Blading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57cae17d197aea06e47b46c8/59393380197aea05cfe11098/5add0189352f53828802fc65/1524433291559/comments.png?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo now I\u2019m looking at the future, and how Back to Blading can create even more content and get even more people involved with the community. This is why we\u2019re starting a Patreon. Over the last year, lots of people have asked how they can support me and help Back to Blading grow. Here\u2019s your chance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve experimented with live streaming of skating sessions\u00a0and have found it\u2019s a great way for people to be part of the community regardless of where they are in the world. You feel like you\u0027re at the session, even if you\u0027re halfway around the world. Being able to chat with the person skating, and to speak back to people watching, is a great feeling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GobctlHCNns\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to add more contributors, skaters other than me that will live stream their sessions. There are so many great sessions happening all around the world, let\u2019s invite you to them. Your support will cover their data charges, equipment, and give them some extra money to make it worth their time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe dream goal is to get enough supporters so that we can rent a permanent, indoor location for us to skate. We have a warehouse in mind that\u2019s big enough for a mini ramp and some street elements. If this works out, we\u2019ll have scheduled sessions for you to participate in, and if you\u2019re nearby, you\u2019re invited to skate with us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57cae17d197aea06e47b46c8/59393380197aea05cfe11098/5adcf0a003ce64e68387848f/1524428962806/skatepark.png?format=1000w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for your support over the years of Back to Blading and everything I\u2019ve done with skating. I get messages every week from people like you who have gotten back into blading because of the podcast or be seeing one of the videos. I would really appreciate your support with this Patreon to let me continue to help grow the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
