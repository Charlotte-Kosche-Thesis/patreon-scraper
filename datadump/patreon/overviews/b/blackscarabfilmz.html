    "summary": "Hello and Welcome to the BlackScarabFilmZ Patreon. I\u0027m Michael Gleason and I\u0027m a reviewer. If you don\u0027t know what that is... well I\u0027m confused at how you found this page. What I do is take a work of media, my preferred media being books, television shows or movies, and I review them, de-construct them and generally poke fun at them using a touch of snark, though for the really bad stuff, it\u0027s a little more than a touch. For nearly seven years, I\u0027ve produced YouTube videos as a hobby, having come from humble, and to be honest poorly put together beginnings, to now, where I might not be the best reviewer out there, but I\u0027m miles ahead from where I started. And a few years ago I started a Patreon in order to try to take YouTube and make it more than just a hobby, and since YouTube has effectively stripped my channel of revenue making tools because I\u0027m not a \"thriving channel\", this is the only way I can make revenue from these videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe two main shows that I produce on a (currently) weekly basis are: \u003cem\u003eThe Literary Lair\u003c/em\u003e, where I look at books, short stories, and anything tangentially book related, such as audio dramas or book related toplists, and \u003cem\u003eHow To Fix It\u003c/em\u003e, where I look at a flawed work of media, usually movies or television shows, (but video games aren\u0027t off the table if so requested), talk about the aspects that worked, the aspects that didn\u0027t, and then detail how I would improve the work to make the good parts better and remove most/all of the bad parts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, I\u0027m not asking for free money, there are some reward levels, so that you can get something in return for supporting the show with your hard earned cash. These range from seeing videos a day earlier than the rest of the world at the lowest levels, and at the highest levels, you can request a review for either of the shows and force me to review whatever you want!\u003cstrong\u003e*\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you enjoy my videos, have a few extra dollars lying around every month burning a hole in your pockets, and you want to help out the show (or possibly reap the benefits of those reward tiers) consider becoming a BlackScarabFilmZ Patron today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e*\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003eAnything you want within limits, (See the $7 reward tiers for those limits)\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
