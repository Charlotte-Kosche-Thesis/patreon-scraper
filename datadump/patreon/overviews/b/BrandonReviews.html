    "summary": "Hi there my name is Brandon. More than likely you stumbled on this page knowing who I am but if not let me tell you. I produce anime reviews, analysis, and discussion videos on my YouTube channel \u0027AH Brandon Anime Reviews\u0027 which ranges from episode to full-on series based videos.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always had a huge passion for anime and a few years back I decided to take that passion and put it on the internet for the world to see. Over the past\u00a0couple of years, I\u0027ve invested a lot of time and money into my channel to make the quality and standard of my content stand above a lot who make similar videos. I love making videos but I put in as much time as one does for a full-time job without the normal full-time pay. I decided to start my own Patreon as it\u0027s a great way for anyone who supports my content to give directly to me and for me to give directly back to you. I\u0027ve set up three rewards tiers that I think are both affordable and fair and lets me retain control over my channel but also give you some perks as well. I\u0027ve been aiming to build a community these past few years and the growth and support I have gained is\u00a0already phenomenal. If you have any extra money to give and want to help support the channel than please consider donating to my Patreon and if not no worries my channel and content isn\u0027t going anywhere and it will always be free. But for those who want to go the extra mile you have my eternal gratitude. \u003cbr\u003e"
