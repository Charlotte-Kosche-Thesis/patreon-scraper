    "summary": "Matt Chat is dedicated to preserving and celebrating the history of the videogame history. I contend that videogames have become an indispensable part of our culture, and great videogame developers are just as historically important today as any great film director or book author. Instead of only enjoying games, I want to take you on my journey to learn where our favorite games and platforms came from--what kind of people made them, and what were they thinking?\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/blacklily8\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMatt Chat\u00a0began as a hobby project in February 2009. Starting off primarily as a way to promote my book \u003cem\u003eDungeons and Desktops, \u003c/em\u003eMatt Chat quickly evolved a life of its own. Each week, I feature in-depth reviews of classic videogames and interviews with famous developers such as John Romero, Chris Avellone, Tim Cain, Richard \u201cLord British\u201d Garriott, and Rebecca Heineman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have fun doing these videos, and love humor and frequent references to my favorite 80s movies and games. However, unlike many prominent \"YouTubers\" doing videogame stuff, I\u0027m dedicated to being factually correct and well-informed about the games and developers I have on the show. You\u0027ll never hear me throwing tantrums, disrespecting guests, or dropping the F-bomb.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are a few things folks have said about Matt Chat:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Matt has done a great service for the RPG community over the years and I\u0027m excited as always to be back on his show.\" - \u003cstrong\u003eBrian Fargo\u003c/strong\u003e, Leader in Exile\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI think these are the most definitive interviews with me so far. One of the most pleasant interviews I\u2019ve ever been in.\u201d \u2013 \u003cstrong\u003eGeorge \u201cThe Fat Man\u201d Sanger\u003c/strong\u003e, Game Audio Legend\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYou were one of the best-informed interviewers that I have ever spoken with. You seemed to know everything about my career.\u201d \u2013 \u003cstrong\u003eTim Cain\u003c/strong\u003e, Fallout Designer\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI just want to say how much I enjoyed watching your latest episode of Matt Chat. Your running commentaries are hilarious.\u201d \u2013 \u003cstrong\u003ePhilip Jong\u003c/strong\u003e, Founder and Editor-in-Chief of Adventure Classic Gaming\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou won\u2019t see any ads on my show. It\u2019s entirely, 100% fan-funded, and all of my videos are licensed with Creative Commons, so you or anyone else is free to watch and remix them without having to pay me anything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and support!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
