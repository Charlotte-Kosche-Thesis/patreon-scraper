A Little About Me\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy fun, humor and as my name suggests, bliss. \u00a0I\u0027m all about being inspired and inspiring others in the process.  I am all about expanding, ascending and growing into my absolute best self and I believe that doing what feels good to me (such as hosting this Patreon Blog,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ethericrealmsinv.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEtheric Realms.com\u003c/a\u003e, and BlissfulMindfulness YouTube Channel) is the most proficient way of doing that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFour years ago I was laid off of a \"good job\" and I put that in quotes to intentionally be humorously sarcastic. \u00a0So anywho what would have been a devastating occurrence, but for my blissful mindset, turned out to be just the opportunity that I had been waiting for to open the way for me to dive in head first into my crafts. \u00a0As an artist of many outlets including writing, singing and being a certified yoga instructor I have always wanted to see where life would take me if I channeled life\u0027s bliss and figured out a way to earn a living doing each of my crafts full-time..... \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, four years later I can report that the \u003cem\u003ebliss\u003c/em\u003e has been wonderful!!! \u00a0So now I\u0027m looking forward to the income finally tying that knot with the bliss so that I can REALLY turn up! \u00a0Now I\u0027m a patient mate so I haven\u0027t been nagging. \u00a0Though recently my bliss has led me to believe that a proposal is close at hand. \u00a0In fact, it hinted around that creating this Patreon blog may just line things up for that long-awaited magical moment to occur. \u00a0So now that I\u0027m here, breathing in the goodness of this hopefulness I KNOW I\u0027m right where I am supposed to be for this divine marriage of artistic bliss + income to take place. \u00a0I\u0027m here, I\u0027m excited and I\u0027m ready for love baby! \u00a0This is the perfect venue to create a marriage made in heaven and I intend to do just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus, I know that you will enjoy my shares. I know that you will enjoy one blissful moment after another on this blog and I have made it my mission to make sure that you do. \u00a0Life is meant to be blissful. Life is meant to be inspiring and most of all life is the means of your expansion so come and expand with me. \u00a0Let\u0027s grow together and learn together in fun, love and bliss!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat My Patrons Will Get\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that everyone deserves the divine gift of bliss so in following my bliss I am offering everyone the same rewards. Therefore if love, likes, shares and comments are what you are inspired to give at this time know that I am just as appreciative of those gifts as I am monetary gifts. \u00a0However, please do not let me get in the way of your inspiration to give sizable monetary gifts :) \u00a0 Regardless of the amount of your gift I give you the best of me.  I believe that when you are in the position to give then you position yourself to receive.  Thus, I give you the best of me and open my heart to receive any size gift that you are inspired to give. \u00a0I love you and appreciate your gifts all the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange for your gracious gifts I\u0027ll be posting videos and music that will inspire you to follow your bliss. \u00a0You will be uplifted, inspired and moved to the blissful depths of you. \u00a0We\u0027ll talk about staying focused on the goodness in life. \u00a0We\u0027ll also talk about ways to attract an abundance of love, prosperity, happiness and bliss into your life. \u00a0Together we\u0027ll make this a sacred space for bliss. \u00a0So sit back and enjoy what Blissful Mindfulness has to share and in doing so continue to enjoy life\u0027s blissful moments. \u00a0 Love you lots and I am eternally grateful for your patronage!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSunflower Smooches!\u003cbr\u003eBlissful Mindfulness"
