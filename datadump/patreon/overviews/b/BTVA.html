    "summary": "Behind The Voice Actors has existed in its current state since 2009, and from inception we have striven to become the ultimate all-in-one information and discussion repertoire for voice actors and their fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal from the beginning has been to carve out our own unique path, distinguishing ourselves from various other VA enthusiast websites. \u003cstrong\u003eEvery voice actor, character, game, show, and movie\u003c/strong\u003e is accompanied by \u003cstrong\u003especially-cropped and captured images\u003c/strong\u003e, many also with \u003cstrong\u003ecarefully-chosen and edited audio samples\u003c/strong\u003e of the voiceover work within. Though this makes working on the site a much more time-consuming process than if all pages were simply text, it is one that we hope is rewarding - we do our best to ensure each and every profile, credit, and database entry on the site is crafted with care, our team members\u0027 personal touches, and the time and attention they need to create a unique visual and audible experience for fans and visitors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough the main heart and soul of BTVA has always been the aforementioned database of voice actor, character and title profiles, our scope has broadened over the years to include a bevy of extra features such as a news section, Casting Call, AYVO (the voice acting contest) and of course, the fan favorite Voice Compares. In particular, the annual BTVA Awards are a massive, celebratory endeavour that have also become a major pillar of our site. We at BTVA pride ourselves not only on the sheer breadth of our site coverage, but \u003cstrong\u003eour devotion to ensuring that each and every facet of said coverage is of the utmost quality\u003c/strong\u003e - even if that takes time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been upfront that our team comprises of a \u003cstrong\u003esmall team of volunteers who dedicate much of their free time\u003c/strong\u003e to work on the site. We are all adults with our own social lives, careers, families, hobbies, and educational pursuits. Over the years, the site has grown and matured. We have built a broad userbase of fans and voice actors alike.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith growth comes a greater magnitude of demand. The amount of work that must be done almost never ends, including a database of images that has to this day never been completed. Greater demands mean even greater pressure to balance our passion for voiceover with our personal and professional lives. Working on the site has almost become similar to a fulltime job in itself, coupled with the diminished time our team has had in recent years. \u003cstrong\u003eWe want to do our best to be able to face that pressure as best as we can\u003c/strong\u003e. And so, after much thought, we have decided to turn to Patreon to \u003cstrong\u003ehelp us accomplish our goals, serving fans and voice actors\u003c/strong\u003e alike without compromising output quality or quantity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this Patreon, \u003cstrong\u003eour goal is to dedicate more time and resources\u003c/strong\u003e to daily site tasks - from things like small quality-of-life improvements to new site features, on top of content addition, creation, and upkeep. We also hope to ensure that the research and preparation done for the annual BTVA Awards is as thorough and all-encompassing as possible on a timely basis - something which proves one of the biggest challenges year-in and year-out for the team, yet nonetheless one of the most rewarding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEssentially, this is a way to \u003cstrong\u003ehelp support Behind the Voice Actors\u003c/strong\u003e in its current state and to help guide to an even greater state. It\u0027s a push to help provide us with the resources we need to ensure an optimal level of site output, dedicating even more of our free time and lives so we can give back to you, the visitors and voice actors alike.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOTE: We\u0027re currently doing a soft launch to collect feedback and accept questions. Feel free to direct your thoughts to our forum threads below:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=137\"\u003ehttp://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=137\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
