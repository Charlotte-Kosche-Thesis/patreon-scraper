    "summary": "I am writing my first\u00a0book. There will be many more. Many more. I will also write short stories from time to time. Currently I have written just under a hundred thousand words of my first book. Originally I estimated that the book would be around a hundred and forty thousand words but I have come to realize that my prediction is pretty far off and this first book of mine might be about three hundred thousand words. In between writing books (or during) I am also going to self produce my music.  But producing my music is contingent upon me obtaining my financial goals because I need to acquire more instruments and equipment than I currently have.  Finally, and foremost, I am a poet. Great poetry is the most difficult literary work to create.  Quite often writing a great poem can take longer to create than a novel or a song. So because of this fact I cannot guarantee that I will release poems as often as I would like.  However I do have many songs and their lyrics at times resemble poetry. So I will at times release some of those lyrics.  Since I have said what I intended (for the most part) I will end with a line from one of my songs.  \"Beyond everything I dream can be, lies a world I hope to see.\""
