     "about": "Karma\nYeshe Rabgye is a Western Monk in the Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism.\nOriginally from England, he now lives in Ashoka Buddhist Temple, Khuda Ali\nSher, Chandigarh. He is a meditation master and has his own meditation centre in\nPanchkula called Prajna Meditation Centre. At the centre, he teaches Buddhism\nand meditation classes to people of all ages. He also travels around India\nteaching mindfulness to teachers and students. He is the author of three books\non Buddhism and has a large world-wide following on social media.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLama\nYeshe has just launched his own app on Android and iPhones. The app, which is\ncalled Buddhism Guide, is one of a kind and has guided meditation practices,\ninformative podcasts, teaching videos and interesting blog post. There is also\na feature whereby people can ask any questions about Buddhism, mindfulness and\nmeditation. Lama Yeshe personally answers all questions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs\nof January 2017, Lama Yeshe\u2019s podcasts have been listened to over 335,000\ntimes, blogs have been read over 180,000 times and his guided meditations have\nbeen practiced over 290,000 times.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLama\nYeshe has studied with H.H. The 14th Dalai Lama, H.H. The 17th Karmapa and many\nother enlightened Buddhist masters and yogis. Having received teachings and\nstudied works of all traditions of Buddhism, the Best Way to Catch a Snake, his\nfirst book, was inspired by successive short-term retreats in which Yeshe took\nthe Gautama Buddha\u2019s early teachings as his inspiration for practice. This book\nis now being translated in to Hindi and will be available on Buddha Jayanti\n2017. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlthough\nYeshe learnt from the great Tibetan Buddhist masters in exile, his Western\nbackground forced him to question some difficult elements of the teachings, in\nparticular, to distinguish those teachings that were essential aspects of the\npath from those that were mere cultural embellishments. Life\u2019s Meandering Path,\nhis second book, stems from this questioning and is aimed at a more secular and\nsceptical audience.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRipples\nin the Stream, his third book, was released last year and is a compilation of\nhis most popular blog posts. All his books are published by Amazon and have\nsold extremely well around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYeshe\nspent several years in a monastery in the foothills of the Himalayas teaching\nyoung monks basic Buddhist philosophy and meditation. He now offers teachings\nfreely to all in a manner that is unpretentious and clear. He does not demand\nstudents to blindly accept what he says, but instead invites them to examine\ntheir own minds and experiences to discover the validity of Gautama Buddha\u2019s\nteachings. Using everyday examples, he has the ability to bring the teachings\nalive, particularly to a younger audience seeking to make Buddhism relevant in\ntheir lives. His approachable manner has attracted many students who appreciate\nhis sense of humour and practical advice.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYeshe\nquietly demonstrates Gautama Buddha\u2019s teaching on compassion through the\ncharitable trust \u2018Sangye-Menla\u2019 that he founded in 2008 in Chandigarh, Northern\nIndia. The trust provides medical assistance and care to people from the\nHimalayan region in India.\u003cbr\u003e",
