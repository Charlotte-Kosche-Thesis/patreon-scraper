    "summary": "Hi! My name is Blaine. I\u0027m a writer. I\u0027ve written for a long enough time that I feel I can set up a Patreon as an additional source of income.\u00a0I\u0027m still in the process of getting my content off the ground, but I consider taking this new leap a positive step towards pushing myself towards consistently making great content. Content such as short videos, comics, cartoons, and more. (Oh and I also try to stream games for Midboss when I can.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn much simpler, less excessively wordy terms:\u00a0I\u0027m just getting started and would love and appreciate support in trying to make something of my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThings you\u0027ll be directly supporting if you contribute to my Patreon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Folly of Face Value: A series of videos critiquing and dissecting videogames with a main focus on how games are seen at face value versus what truly lies beneath. It will cover games from the widely known and popular to the niche and virtually unknown. Over all I aim to encourage people to take a closer and more realistic look at the media they consume.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMy livelihood: I have a day job and, like many, it isn\u0027t cutting it. I don\u0027t make nearly enough to both survive AND pay off my series of debts, so if you support me here you\u0027d be helping out of a really rough point in my life and I\u0027d be forever grateful for that.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDebts: College loans, credit cards, etc. I\u0027m doing this for the sake of full disclosure and transparency.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe TallStout Project: I can\u0027t say much here, but it\u0027s a project I\u0027ve been developing for a number of years in collaboration with my partner, and it\u0027s also kind of my life\u0027s dream as a writer/creator. Seeing it fully realized would make my life have all new meaning and any money I make via this website would only help me make that realization a full reality.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMy contributions to the queer horror website \u003ca href=\"http://www.genderterror.com\"\u003ewww.genderterror.com\u003c/a\u003e : It\u0027s been a slow start for me due to having two day jobs, but I plan to contribute more in the coming months.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMy two dogs Samson and Cutie. They\u0027re adorable and eat a lot and you can help me and my mom provide for them.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read all this and please consider donating to my fund, I\u0027d truly and deeply appreciate it!"
