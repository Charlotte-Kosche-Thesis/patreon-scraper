This is going to be a slow grow, a steady revival, a nurture, like a little seedling in a pot that is ready to grow into a big mystery plant.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWould you like to join me on this mystery art journey?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a monthly service that allows you to connect to me. You choose an amount of $$$ to send me per month and with that support I will share my art, my ideas, and numerous other aspects of my creative life with you. You can also comment and chat with me and the other patrons. It\u0027s like instagram, but more cosy, because it is just for us.\u003cbr\u003eLater I will be adding more tiers of Patronage, so you can get other kinds of perks, like a handwritten post card, or an envelope full of art, maybe a monthly Patreon only print!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are lots of great things about the Patreon format. If you need to for any reason, you can pause your monthly payment! There are so many questions you might have about this format, so I am going to direct you here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002888963-What-is-Patreon-\"\u003ehttps://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1150...\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I support you and see your art without paying money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOf course! I appreciate all kinds of support. Sign up for a Patreon account and then click the follow button in the top lefthand corner. Every time I make a public post, it will go directly to your email inbox, or it will pop up on your phone if you download the Patreon app.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you be making?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRight now I am focusing on smaller drawing projects and intertwining what I am learning about witchcraft and magic with my artwork. I will be sharing my finished works, sketchbooks, ideas, possibly some more embarrassing videos of me trying to talk about things, or less embarrassing videos of me making things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the month of October I will be creating daily ink drawings for Inktober. But it will be my own spin on the project and I am calling it Kinktober. It\u0027s about sex positivity, kink positivity, and all that rawrrrr. And I will be posting as daily as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future, when I start reaching my goals I am have ideas to create and facilitate some events and projects that have been stewing in my mind for the past 6 years. With enough $$$ I will be able to hire other artists and creatives to join me. This is my dream, and what I will slowly be working towards over the next couple years."
