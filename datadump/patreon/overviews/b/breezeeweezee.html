I\u0027ve completed 23 cosplays to date, among dozens of closet cosplays and other fun challenges. I have spent countless hours and dollars on these cosplays and I think it\u0027s completely worth it. I love cosplay so much, that over a year ago I launched\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.breezeeweezee.com/\"\u003ebreezeeweezee.com\u003c/a\u003e with the purpose of helping others start their cosplay journey, provide some insight to my projects, and empower others in the cosplay community with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.breezeeweezee.com/blog/category/featurefriday\"\u003e#FeatureFridays\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sJlVREw.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY I STARTED A PATREON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love making cosplays. It\u0027s more than just a hobby for me. I already spend hours building costumes, and marketing myself on social media - it\u0027s a full time job without the pay! I would love to be able to put more of myself into cosplay; really push my limits and challenge myself with new skills and techniques. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not looking to make a sustainable living via Patreon. I want to find a way that we can support each other mutually. By becoming a patron you enable me to take more time to give you more content like tutorials, work in progress photos, exclusive products, and \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003etopless Tuesday photos!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT TO EXPECT FROM YOUR REWARDS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tried to create a tier for everyone. The main content you can expect from my Patreon is crafting help; tutorials, videos, work in progress photos, and an interactive Facebook Group with weekly tips and a supportive community for life! Yes, that\u0027s right - sign up once and you have immediate access to our Facebook Community for life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst time sign ups are always \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eDOUBLE\u003c/span\u003e rewards!

Patrons will get a very personal and hands on feel for the costume I\u0027m building as if they\u0027re building it with me. I am committed to \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eDAILY\u003c/span\u003e posts and content that are exclusive build photos, tutorials, or early access photo shoot content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also offer occasional opportunities to vote on future cosplays, bonus prints, extra photo shoots, early access Youtube videos, simple prop patterns, and a monthly reaction GIF! It will be me doing something ridiculous and you will be free to save it and use on any social media for any reason you choose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eBONUS MODE: FRENCH FRIES\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA huge part of my patreon is creating community with everyone. I\u0027d love to see more interaction on the posts, so I created a free reward system in addition to all our other awesome rewards. Each month, you have the opportunity to collect \u0027French Fries\u0027 - aka the perfect side to any sandwich - to exchange for more rewards.
