I made this channel as a way of recording my hobby and being able to interact with people while playing games!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI generally make videos about survival strategy games. I\u0027m always looking for a challenge, and will often try to fit something incredibly difficult and challenging into something more suited to my way, and I think this is best showcased through the wit and humour behind my videos. I\u0027ve been focusing on indie games recently and I\u0027ve found success in doing so, just been having an amazing amount of fun. I truly believe my viewers are some of the best on the site, luckily. Thank you all for the support, through money or just being a nice person, just know that I appreciate you more than you think!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(219, 238, 243);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eHow your donations help\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donations will allow me to devote more of my time towards my channel. Higher quality videos can be made as I\u0027ll be able to dedicate more time towards each aspect of my videos. The quantity vs quality argument is a big deal to me, and something I don\u0027t want to ever take a shortcut on. I\u0027m always looking to increase quality foremost, and quantity second. With more time to dedicate towards the channel I\u0027ll be able to cover new topics, area of games, and focus on harder to make videos such as my political ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(219, 238, 243);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(219, 238, 243);\"\u003eIs donating the right choice for you?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease don\u0027t ever feel obligated to donate. The amount of support I receive is more than enough to make me carry on making videos for the foreseeable future, Patreon or no. If you\u0027re a fan of the channel just know that I appreciate you a lot more than you think. Monetarily or not I appreciate any and all support and the last thing I\u0027d like to do is make it seem like donating is obligated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is however the easiest and most reliable way of supporting me and my channel. It\u0027ll help me grow faster, which in turn brings with it all sorts of new things, as well as a consistent rise in quality. If you\u0027d like to see my channel grow faster than this is the way to do it. If not then even sharing this page would be an awesome amazing thing to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(219, 238, 243);\"\u003eThank you\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonating or not just reading this page is worthy of me saying thank you.

I receive overwhelming support constantly and I can\u0027t appreciate anything more in my life than that. So again, thank you very much.\u003cbr\u003e"
