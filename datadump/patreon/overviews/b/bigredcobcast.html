    "summary": "Ryan Tweedy and Pat Janssen are Nebraskan natives living in Hollywood. They\u0027re also comedians and huge Husker fans. And they\u0027re both taller than they look. Very little stops them from saying what\u0027s on their minds about the Big Red. Some things (alcohol) accelerate their thoughts on game days. A mixture of in-the-moment thoughts on fall Saturdays, everyman analysis in season and out, and interviews with royalty from inside the Husker kingdom and out (Taylor Martinez, Matt Davison, Charlie McBride, Milt Tenopir, Grant Wistrom, Tim Miles, Jack McVeigh, Kent Pavelka, Faux Pelini, Greg Sharpe, Darnay Holmes, Eric Warfield, Aaron Taylor, Ralph Brown, Larry Culpepper, Matt Herian, Chris \u0026amp; Chad Kelsay, Keyshawn Johnson Jr \u0026amp; Sr, Tristan Gebbia, Mike Riley, Eric Lueshen, Adam Carriker, astronaut Clayton Anderson, former Michigan State and NFL quarterback Tony Banks, and a whole lot more), the Big Red Cobcast is a splash of something different in the Husker pool. Also along for the ride is the guys\u0027 buddy and resident burnout Joe Canale. And occasionally joining in the fun are fellow Nebraskans and comedians Bob Wiltfong (The Daily Show, It\u0027s Always Sunny in Philadelphia), Patrick Tamisiea, Chad Fogland and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
