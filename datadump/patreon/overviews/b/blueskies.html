    "summary": "Hello and welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy name is Dave and I release music under the band name Blue Skies. This site is for people who like that music and want to support me and help me make more of it. If that\u2019s you, read on and I will explain how it works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen I write a new song, I record a demo of it and send it out to everyone who has pledged their support on Patreon. Every time this happens these people pay me however much they have pledged to. That\u2019s pretty much it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOk there\u2019s a bit more - you can receive additional rewards by pledging higher amounts - the full list is at the bottom of this page - and you can also set a monthly limit on how much you are charged, just in case I release 18 songs in one month and you have no money left. As it happens I\u2019ve never released more than one song per month, but it\u2019s nice to know you\u2019re in control. You can also cancel your pledge at any time, even after a song comes out and before you pay for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to be giving me money, don\u2019t worry - I will continue to do everything I have been for free. You can still watch my YouTube videos and listen to my music on bandcamp, or buy songs in the old fashioned way (seems downloading is now old fashioned, that didn\u2019t take long). This is just a little extra to help me turn my music into something resembling a career! Any money I get will go towards new equipment, making videos, mastering, printing CDs and such.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks for all of your support over the years!\u003cbr\u003e\nx\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ep.s. everything is in dollars because this site is American, but you can pay in any currency - it\u2019ll convert it for you.\u003cbr\u003e"
