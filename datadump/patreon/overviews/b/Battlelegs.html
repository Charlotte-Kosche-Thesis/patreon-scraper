    "summary": "We are Battlelegs! \u00a0Join us every week on Friday as we release short videos and songs, mostly in the Celtic Acoustic genre. \u00a0We appreciate the vast majority of our fans (Kasey has a long running beef with Canadians), and absolutely all of your donations! \u00a0Join us on our new journey to create video and music content every week, and you shall be rewarded appropriately! \u00a0Our weekly videos are free for all, but even more perks have been added as we\u0027ve gotten rolling -- free songs from our albums, bonus videos, live performance tracks and more! \u00a0What will happen next? \u00a0Will we dress like hobbits? \u00a0Will Kasey edit videos of Lance to make him say offensive things? \u00a0Will Andrew play a cowbell for thirty minutes? \u00a0One thing is for sure: if this internet channel thing works, we don\u0027t have to go out into that terribly oppressive sunlight anymore to play gigs, which damages our soft, sensitive, freckly skin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuuuuuut, if you\u0027re new in these parts, here\u0027s the obligatory band bio:\u003cbr\u003eOut of the dark, mysterious forests of central Minnesota come three penniless day-shift prisoners bearing the ultimate weapons of sonic annihilation, namely, the acoustic guitar, the cajon, and\u2026the accordion. Ando, Lance, and Kasey grew up playing together in freezing cold garages, basements, living rooms, and military training facilities in various rock and pop bands and later moved to clubs, colleges, and bars all over Minnesota. These three scoundrels have been traveling, performing, flipping over their neighbors\u2019 trampolines at midnight, and stealing candy from small children together since before Kasey\u2019s first kiss \u2013 and now they proudly present: Battlelegs.\u003cbr\u003eBattlelegs grew out of the newfound love of Celtic music, and after trading in their huge guitar amps for acoustics, they\u2019re still ready to rock. With a perfected blend of comedy, energy, memorable stories, shredding accordion licks, spoon solos, and mug-swinging sarcasm, Battlelegs is dressed to impress. Don\u2019t bother seeing them live if you have leg problems or a heart condition \u2013 your own dancing and clapping might kill you.\u003cbr\u003eTheir latest album, \u201cLost My Shoes,\u201d was officially released in February of 2017, and is available at shows as well as online at \u003ca href=\"http://cdbaby.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCDbaby.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 Battlelegs plays a healthy mix of original and traditional Celtic tunes in the style of \u201cAcoustic/Celtic/Facemelt Rock.\u201d And they know all your favorite pop chick songs, too."
