    "summary": "Hi! My name is Bacon Donut, and I am a content creator! I\u0027ve been very fortunate to call this my full time job since 2013 as I\u0027ve worked to create a positive drama-free community to help people forget about real life problems for a little while, mostly playing video games as a pretext for conversation! Recently I\u0027ve also started writing articles to act on my desire to share what I\u0027ve learned about broadcasting and content creation with other people so they can improve their own content. I aim to help creators big and small to improve their craft!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy philosophy since the very beginning of this is to never pressure people to support me financially. For the people that WANT to do that, I try to provide a variety of methods and just let people choose for themselves what they prefer. This Patreon is just one more option on the table for people that want to do extra. Whatever your choice is, even if it doesn\u0027t involve money at all, I am very grateful for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is a way for people who love my articles but don\u0027t watch my Twitch stream to support me because the money from the Patreon goals will offset the time away from streaming that it takes to write the articles. It also works well for people that don\u0027t like other payment options out there (PayPal, Amazon Payments, or Xsolla). Contributing here doesn\u0027t get you fancy twitch features like chat emotes, but the middle man cut is much smaller here, so in that sense it\u0027s a trade off. It also works well for the people who, for whatever reason, just want to help make sure that I can keep doing this as my job for years to come! Thank you so much for what you do for me! \u0026lt;3"
