    "summary": "I\u0027m a nationally known a cappella singer... who just happens be an old soul.  I wanted to put my stamp on big band music and style...a modern stamp... AND raise money for local charities across the U.S.  So recently, I started the Shaun Johnson Big Band Experience.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little bit about me...I\u0027ve toured/performed across the world for over a decade... independently. And because of people like YOU, I\u0027ve gotten to create an awarded vocal quartet, a production company and multiple PBS specials, as well as visit hundreds of universities to teach/speak. Heck, I even won an Emmy somewhere in there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to get to know YOU.  So now, with your help, I can start a new movement of music for people who wish to be original and strive to be different...together.  The Big Band Experience has edge. We love crazy socks and suits ... our music is definitely emotional and unexpected.  Join us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t thank you enough for taking a chance!  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat does my donation help support?\u003cbr\u003eYour support allows me to actively create new songs, new music and videos to spread the message of an art form we are creating together...to hire a sound engineer, camera operators, an editor, rent locations, film equipment, props, etc., and take the songs/videos to a level we\u0027ve not yet imagined.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow many videos will you release a month?\u003cbr\u003eI usually put out 2 - 3 videos or songs a month! This is a monthly subscription, NOT pay-per-video/song.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan I stop donating in the future if I can\u0027t afford it?\u003cbr\u003eOf course! You can cancel or adjust your pledge amount for any reason at any time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStill have questions?\u003cbr\u003eShoot an email to michelle@bigbandexperience.com, and my team will help you out!\u003cbr\u003e"
