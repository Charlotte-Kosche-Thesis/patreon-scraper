I share how I build them;\ndesign them, and my methodology on how I run my small marker business here on\npatreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUnfortunately, not all clients have a taste for crazy unique\nbuilds and may not have a great imagination to have something really cool\nbuilt.  They feel more comfortable\nplaying it safe and commission me to build a familiar piece.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat I am hoping to do here on Patreon is build a series of\nprojects that are funded by my patrons. \nProjects where patrons are able to give design input, not only on what\nprojects they would like to see built, but on the overall design aesthetic and methods\nof joinery and construction.   I think\nwe would learn a lot from each other during the process which I think would be\na rewarding experience for all of us.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI hope this will challenge are creative minds and push us to\nlearn more skills and better our craft.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\nPlease join me here on Patreon and help fund, and design a\nproject.  Then watch it get built.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nIn The Meantime\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs we work toward our goal of having enough support to pay\nfor the time and materials to produce patreon funded projects, I will continue\nto release build videos of the commissions I build, shop updates, tips and\ntricks, as well as a behind the scenes look into how I run my maker business.   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your support!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope we can brainstorm may project builds together\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYou can find more about me and my craft at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.benhamdesignconcepts.com/about/\"\u003ehttp://www.benhamdesignconcepts.com/about/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027m the furniture maker and artist behind Benham Design Concepts. I specialize in building unique pieces of custom furniture and functional art. I enjoy the process of designing apiece just as much as I do building it, and bringing something new into the world. My main skillsets are based in woodworking; however, I\u0027m a maker at heart and I am always looking to expand my skillset, to work with new materials, new ideas and come up with new designs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a 3rd generation craftsman, and have been working is a shop since I was a kid. \u00a0I started this Patreon page as a way to pass on the things that I have learned from all the past craftsmen I have worked with and my lifetime of experience in making. \u00a0It is my hope that I will be able to use the funds from my patrons support to continue learning new techniques and create new \u00a0unique pieces of functional art. \u00a0 \u00a0In turn pass on what I learn on to my patrons, and hope they will find value in what I create, and we will be able to learn new techniques and develop new design ideas together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Back Story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a third generation craftsman, who grew up in a neighborhood of makers. On the corner was Jeff a custom cabinetmaker working out of his two-car garage. Next door was Mark, who ran two businesses out of a shop, built in his backyard. The first was making false teeth, and gold and porcelain crowns. The second was building clocks and all kinds of other cool things out of wood. Then there was my father, a carpenter by trade who turned bridge builder. \u003cbr\u003eAs I grew up, I worked alongside these makers learning their craft and their different techniques. My father took me with him on many trips to see how bridges where built and help me get a job in a welding fabrication shop, building steel earthquake restraints for bridges. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, it was woodworking that captured my imagination, and is where I chose to hone my skill set. I have been studying the craft as long as I can remember. As a kid, I was more excited about the PBS woodworking TV shows, than watching Saturday morning cartoons. Some of my best lessons were learned by watching, This Old House, The Woodrights shop with Roy Underhill, and the New Yankee Workshop with Norm Abram. I watch and learned with passion and spent my idle hours in the garage emulating what I had seen, and honing my craft.\u003cbr\u003e",
