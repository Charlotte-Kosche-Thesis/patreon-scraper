    "summary": "Hello, I\u2019m Ben Duncan. I make comics, prints, a lot of drawings and sometimes sculptures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main fascination is in what I call \u201cdetailing the trials and tribulations of the common creature.\u201d  What this amounts to on an average day is a look into the themes of companionship, resolution, closure, the beach and decapitations. Not to mention flayings, splayings and flesh fireworks in abundance. God\u2019s sense of humour has perhaps grown into a weathered, gnarled piece of leather but is no less hilarious and wry imho (so it\u0027s a funny looking piece of leather then).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have what I\u0027ll call a \"strong interest\" in the constant churning out of ideas, which often means things get made, tossed aside and it\u0027s on to the next project. I enjoy sharing my work online free of charge, which won\u0027t stop, but there is a lot of other stuff that gets swept under the rug that would benefit from some discerning sets of eyeballs. \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePay a paltry sum to get on the reg access to my feed (including early access to artwork) and other tidbit trinkets like comics (see below), selected writings, screenprints, digital prints and t-shirts if you feel the need to move up in tiers. Maybe even sculptures down the line!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/71a721ebf30e0f1f80e5bcc03d7b773b/tumblr_n0fr4qfD0E1r9s5x8o1_500.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/3836431d48abbec02aa60d8efb3246de/tumblr_my13nn44qJ1r9s5x8o1_500.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://41.media.tumblr.com/04bf4b836d313062d8b111c5b3340121/tumblr_mw5549MmZd1r9s5x8o1_500.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKnow that your generous patronage is appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e"
