One day, I\u0027d like to be on a broadcast desk interviewing a celebrity talking about why they love the Legend of Zelda so much; that would be dope as hell. But for now I want to focus on two things: \u003cstrong\u003eInterviewing \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eBreaking Gaming News\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you need Patreon? Don\u0027t you have a vault of YouTube/Twitch money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nAll the money I make is from my full time job I\u0027ve been doing since I started YouTube/Twitch. Any money I make gets reinvested into the channel to bring more quality: I commission artists, musicians, and editors when appropriate. YouTube has never been a full-time thing for me, but this is where you come in! This Patreon campaign is for my fans who want to directly support me and my goal to become a full-time content creator. Maybe you couldn\u0027t afford a t-shirt, or don\u0027t want to turn off Adblock. Maybe you just want to go that extra mile to keep me going. I want to keep doing this and giving you guys and girls what you want! This is what this Patreon will help to accomplish, hopefully. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo just to make this absolutely \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e100% clear\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e to everyone: \u003cstrong\u003eChoosing to pledge to me will help to pay my bills.\u00a0Please make sure your other financial responsibilities are satisfied before throwing me any amount of money. I don\u0027t want to be a reason you cannot feed yourself. If at any time you are unsatisfied with the content I produce, immediately suspend your pledge; it will be with no penalty or ill will from me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDespite all of the above, my content will \u003cstrong\u003ealways be free \u003c/strong\u003eand you will\u003cstrong\u003e never have to pay me a penny\u003c/strong\u003e. But, if you want to support me in my ventures to be the very best, any amount you pledge will be a building block to greatness. Every bit helps. Imagine if 10% of my user-base gave $1 a month. You can do the math: that\u0027s life-changing. I don\u0027t want to do sponsored deals or rely on ad-revenue to carry the channel. I want to be able to say \"You see all these patrons and people who watch? They support the hell out of me!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eBringing it all together!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nIn closing, regardless of the amount of money you pledge, everyone who has taken the time to check out my content and give me many virtual pats on the back makes this all worth doing and I love every single one of you.
