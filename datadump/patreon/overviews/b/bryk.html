    "summary": "\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eHi, my name is Dan Bryk and I\u0027m a singer slash songwriter.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve been writing songs and releasing records for almost 20 years now. I guess that officially makes me old, but it also means I have a little perspective on the whole music making shizness.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWriting songs is generally speaking, hard work. Occasionally a song will just leap out of you without a lot of interference, but sometimes you struggle with a song that\u0027s \u003ci\u003enot quite there\u003c/i\u003e for years. And years.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are people out there who really, really like my songs, and that\u0027s incredibly gratifying, and playing a good show is rewarding too. But for me, the \u003ci\u003eactual act of songwriting\u003c/i\u003e is artistic and personal and selfish, if you will. The feeling of accomplishment I get after writing something I think might be actually be great -- that\u0027s like the weirdest, most addicting orgasm there is. You want to keep going back there.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen the post-coital, chocolates-in-bed moment is actually making a recording of the song.\u00a0It used to be a lot more expensive to make great-sounding records, but thanks to some mind-blowing advances in technology \u003ci\u003eanyone can do it. \u003c/i\u003eThe downside, of course, is that \u003ci\u003eeveryone\u003c/i\u003e thinks\u00a0they can do it.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot that I feel (as some seriously do) that music and songwriting are fields solely for \u003ci\u003eprofessionals, \u003c/i\u003ebut with a gracious nod to Anders Ericsson\u0027s \u003ci\u003e10,000 Hour Rule\u003c/i\u003e let\u0027s propose that some effort, practice and serious time commitment are required to be really good at this.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhich is perhaps where you come in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhy this and not a Kickstarter like everyone else?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy intent with this interesting and promising platform is first and foremost to buy myself more time for making music. Time I don\u0027t have to spend chasing a dollar here, a dollar there.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have a wife and recently a kid, and it\u0027s been tough justifying the diminishing returns of making music by carrying on as if I will sell enough \"albums\" to even approach the income of a \u003ci\u003ereal job.\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0These days most of my favourite artists don\u0027t (or barely) make a living from music.\u00a0My income from the sale of recorded music has dwindled to the point of \u003ci\u003enot muchery.\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0 Once Apple or Amazon takes its percentage, and then the aggregator takes its cut, I\u0027ll be lucky to buy a week\u0027s worth of groceries with my six month royalty cheque. Payments for using indie music in TV shows and movies keep getting lower and lower, and they\u0027re all up front these days with no residuals.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve been on labels and done completely DIY releases. Much of my album\u00a0\u003ci\u003ePop Psychology\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0is about the frustration of dealing with the boom and bust of music biz hype cycles. The economics of selling recorded music without some publicity machine blowing smoke up everyone\u0027s asses don\u0027t seem to work any more. And boy do I suck at being the guy constantly telling everyone how great I am.\u00a0Some days I sit down at the piano and honestly believe I\u00a0\u003ci\u003etotally\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0suck. But I keep working, and eventually I write that one song that I fleetingly think might be as great as a great Mark Eitzel or Lily Allen or Paul Williams or Jill Sobule song, and that gives me the faith to keep going.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo maybe it\u0027s time to reassess what a \"Dan Bryk Album\" is, and whether what I do has value above and beyond the sale of a little polycarbonate disc (or these days, .zip file) of ones and zeroes.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat I (and Patreon) propose is simple:\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. I keep writing songs and recording them, and \u003cspan\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e2. You give me a little money when I release them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNo more irrelevant focus on finishing and marketing a 10-12 song \"album\", although I certainly have some songs in mind to release together. I might even have a \"concept\" album or three in the works, so if and when I compile these songs into digital albums available in online stores I promise that the same finished and mastered versions will be available to you as a patron so you don\u0027t have to go and buy them all over again at iTunes or Amazon. (I certainly wouldn\u0027t stop you from doing that, though.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf I end up releasing any physical product of these songs I will offer steep discounts to Patrons, since you\u0027ve already helped pay for their creation once. (If enough people are interested, I would love to raise funds Kickstarter-style for pressing vinyl or some other objet d\u0027art format.\u00a0\u003ci\u003eLovers Leap\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0never made it to vinyl. Hell,\u00a0\u003ci\u003ePop Psychology\u00a0\u003c/i\u003enever even made it to a proper CD pressing.)\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd if by some chance I end up playing a live show near you, you will have first dibs on discounted admission.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cb\u003eCouldn\u0027t I just give the music away and make money from Other Income Streams, like say, Playing a Live Show Near You?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou hear a lot of this talk from people in the tech sector, as you might expect from businesspeople whose stock valuations are based on commodifying and\u00a0devaluing music. In my personal experience there\u0027s little or no money to be made on the road. It can be fun, and you get to meet the people who love your work, but I\u0027m not a folksinger or a jazz musician, and most of the touring for pop-rock artists like myself happens in \u003ci\u003esmelly bars\u003c/i\u003e.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not a social drinker, and with some notable exceptions my fans don\u0027t seem to be heavy drinkers either.\u00a0There are too many struggling artists ALL trying to tour, booking their own shows and jamming econo, and so few non-smelly-bar venues for them to do it, and even fewer traditional ways to promote the gig outside of the weeklies that exist to cover the smelly-bar-circuit. Splits are low, and there aren\u0027t even guarantees to cover the gas. I did tons of unpaid gigs for exposure in my twenties, and once in a while plugged my nose and did a \"pay-to-play\" gig,\u00a0believing I was \"paying my dues\", but after a certain point you have to put your family (and even your dignity) first. I\u0027ve played some great house concerts, but the catch is \u003ci\u003eyou kind of have to be asked\u003c/i\u003e. And I\u0027m not out there blowing smoke, remember? I will admit I haven\u0027t put enough effort into my merch over the years, but that\u0027s never been a huge moneymaker either. I\u0027m not sure if I have the kind of image people want to plaster all over their bodies.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut back to \u003ci\u003eall that exposure\u003c/i\u003e from letting people share my music. It\u0027s not really about swapping a C-90 or putting a song on a mix CD to turn your girl/boyfriend on to your favourite music anymore; these days kids swap terabyte-sized iTunes libraries in their quest for auditory awesomeness. I even allow everyone to stream nearly all of it \u003ci\u003efor free\u003c/i\u003e on my Bandcamp page. It\u0027s been created, it\u0027s been recorded, it\u0027s ready for \u003ci\u003esomeone\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0to enjoy, and it seems silly not to have it out there in people\u0027s ears. But that still doesn\u0027t put food on my family.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s got to be another way to let people who love music by non-famous people help them make continue making it. One that isn\u0027t filtered through the capricious fractions of Apple, Pandora and Spotify.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m certainly hoping this might prove to be a reasonable option as another income stream. It\u0027s a low-entry, low-committment thing for people who have fallen for a particular song of mine and want to check out what else I\u0027m up to. And help me continue putting as much of my focus and energy as possible into making music, not t-shirts or no-whip skim doppio lattes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd for the dozen or so of you who are \u003ci\u003ehard-core Dan Bryk fans\u003c/i\u003e, there\u0027s an extra tier with demos, outtakes and old rarities. No $500 after-show VIP passes here, but I will do my bestest to keep you guys and gals VERY entertained.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIsn\u0027t this just passing a hat after a gig?\u00a0\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps. If what I do tugs at your heart strings, would you mind if it also tugs at your purse strings?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eBut you\u0027d just be doing it anyway!\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course I would.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBunnies and flowers,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDan Bryk\u003cspan\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eDar Es Salaam, Tanzania\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"
