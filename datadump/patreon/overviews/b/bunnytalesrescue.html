     "description": "We heard about an old property with around 11 abandoned bunnies, which they were chased and caught by feral cats and homeless people We went there to analyze the situation and every time we went back there some bunnies disappear, specially the babies. With this such a terrible situation, we decided to take them all in as soon as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a month of hard work, we could finally succeed and we got them all it was really a difficult task as the place was full of trash, boxes, bushes and holes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of them went to the vet and we got them deworm, put revolution on them and the ones they were injured got treated. Three of the females were pregnant and gave birth 7 babies each of them, so you can imagine how much our numbers increase\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as we love them and care for our little ones, now we are in the situation we need to sterilize many of them. We currently are providing food, hay, pens, litter boxes and bowls from our own resources. This is why we ask for your help to raise the money to sterilize around 12 bunnies. So they have a better chance to find their forever home and to prevent any more pregnancies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope we can count with your help so we can keep making a difference in these bunnies lives any little amount it will be great\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for all your support and love for what we are doing\u003cbr\u003e",
