The site address is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.socialgreets.com\"\u003ewww.socialgreets.com\u003c/a\u003e .\u00a0I started this idea because i got tired of writing the very boring \"Happy Birthday\" whenever i got a Facebook birthday notice. I didn\u0027t always write Happy Birthday. Sometimes I write \"have a swell day!\" or \"I hope your day is grand!\" None of these are bad, they\u0027re just not very WOW. \u00a0Luckily for me (and my friends) I started creating animated gifs. I found that I could pop these animated gifs into my friends Facebook feed. I\u0027m not sure how impressed my friends are but at least I\u0027m entertained.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.socialgreets.com\"\u003ewww.socialgreets.com\u003c/a\u003e has a lot of room to improve and grow. Right now it only works on desktop computers, tablets and laptops. I really need it to work on mobile but that\u0027ll take a bit more investment. I\u0027d love you financial support.\u00a0Just think how much more fun those Facebook Birthday notices will be.\u00a0Not a bad deal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re still not compelled to support me you can read my sad little story below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was an illustrator/animator at Hallmark Cards for many years. I am one of the creators of Hallmark\u0027s hoops\u0026amp;yoyo. I was the main animator of hoops\u0026amp;yoyo as well as the voice of yoyo. I was laid off by Hallmark in 2015\u00a0at the age of 55. I have one daughter starting her sophomore year of college and the other starts her freshman year of college this fall. I went from having full health benefits for my family of 4 to having to pay out of pocket just 2 months after being laid off. Not the ending to my Hallmark career I was hoping for. That\u0027s life."

Did I mention I\u0027m no longer doing all those things? I got laid off! \u003cbr\u003eSo my story is this, I really need to find some new income to help support my wife, 2 daughters and our 2 old cats who seem to be more costly than my daughters. What makes this hard is that I have very narrow skills. I can cook pretty well and i can make little animations that make people smile. There isn\u0027t a third skill but that smile thing is pretty cool. \u003cbr\u003ePlease help me make smiles by being a patron of my page. The world needs a heck of a lot more smiles. I think I can help.\u003cbr\u003e",
