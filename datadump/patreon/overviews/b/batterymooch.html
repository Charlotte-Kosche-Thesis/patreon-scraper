As a vaper it is very important to me that we know the actual ratings for the gear we use. Not only for our safety but to help us choose the best performing batteries and devices for the way we vape.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhat \u00a0I Want To Do\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love the testing I do for the vaping community and I want to do it full time. Your subscriptions as patrons will help to pay my bills so I can quit my day job and expand the testing I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to continuing to do my battery testing, creating of YouTube videos, having live Q\u0026amp;A sessions, and answering of your questions, doing this full time would help me add the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eCharger testing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDifferent battery testing, such as LiPo\u2019s, 18350 batteries, and regulated mod batteries.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMechanical mod and atomizer voltage drop testing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMeasuring the actual effects of metal oxidation and arcing damage on mechanical mod performance.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMeasuring button and contact heating at high current levels.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRegulated mod reliability/durability testing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMeasuring regulated mod circuit efficiency and battery life.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTesting of contacts, buttons, atomizers, etc., to address reliability, durability, or safety concerns.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOther testing that my patrons request, which will be given a higher priority.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo show my commitment to this I have already built a new testing station and have bought the equipment I would need.\u00a0The equipment is set up and I am ready to start right now.\u00a0Here\u2019s a video of the new test station.

Unfortunately, I have no gear to give away, I damage most of the batteries I test, and I feel my test results should be shared with the entire community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I will tell my patrons about ongoing testing and new battery availability before posting publicly\u00a0and testing requests from my patrons will be given higher priority.

Sorting out who is trying to fool us with unsafe/untested mods and exaggerated battery ratings will help us all vape safer.
