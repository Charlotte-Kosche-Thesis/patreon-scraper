More of a statement than a pseudonym. Representing the creative process and becoming stronger as an individual through it. I, Blake Ortego, am trying to push further, to become more and more transparent and more and more connected with people through artistic expression.\u00a0Patreon is a great way to aid the progression of my art as well as connect with the patrons thereof. I want to share this all with you. Lots of music, film and writing in the works. I truly appreciate your support and look forward to connecting with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome history...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy musical interest started when I was very young. I was infatuated with rhythm at a very early age; Dancing to anything from C+C Music Factory to Metallica; I was fixated on big beats. In 1994 I started playing drums. As time went by, I had joined and started a variety of projects; Rock to metal; Metal to punk; Punk to avant garde; Eventually favoring more personal and electronic efforts. 2007 marked a big change in my life; Deciding I wanted to focus my life on creative efforts. That year, I started an electronic project named Kid Midi.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/blakeortegojr/what-to-do-with-you-now\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKid Midi - What To Do With You Now\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really enjoyed singing live and going crazy on stage, but over time Kid Midi become more focused on entertainment; Hyping up crowds and creating a party atmosphere. At first the enthusiasm was validating, but eventually left me feeling empty, even depressed. The crowds were growing, but my relationship with the people was becoming more servile and less emotional. In 2012, I decided Kid Midi was finished, but this opened the door for something much more powerful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRoman Discipline is a band/project built on transparency; Honest and intense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExSl420-YrE\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRoman Discipline - Please Say What I Want You To Say\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSocially, I wanted to either challenge or compel the audience; Whether you crave connection or fear it. I also wanted to challenge myself, lyrically and socially; Trying to avoid metaphors and analogies for a more direct, almost preaching or pleading approach. This was definitely what I consider a growing period for myself artistically. Every aspect of this band was intended to be meaningful, from the songs to the band\u0027s website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRoman Discipline ended in 2014 after self releasing two albums,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://blakeortego.bandcamp.com/album/acts-i\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eACTS I\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://blakeortego.bandcamp.com/album/acts-ii-2\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eACTS II\u003c/a\u003e. (Art designed \u0026amp; audio engineered by Blake Ortego.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOvertime I have taken to a wide array of mediums based around my musical endeavors, such as graphic design, videography, and poetry; Pushing to use all these outlets to further connect with and know myself and those around me. I incorporate everything I can into my art; My drumming ability, an unlabeled thrift store cassette, depression, and even a simple text from a friend might find it\u0027s way into a piece. Thus leading to Now I Am Become Death. A culmination of my life thus far, creatively. Multiple albums deep, with much more on the way, such as short films, poetry, sample libraries, and live performances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://smarturl.it/thepieces\"\u003eThe Pieces\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Short film and composition about insecurity, obsession, delusion, and ego.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://smarturl.it/niabm\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNow I Am Become Movement\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Driving dance narrative about life momentum.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://smarturl.it/mythlogic\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMyth/Logic\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e(Militant techno fashion show score.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://store.steppepper.com/album/01-090213-092813\"\u003eA Folder - 01\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(No-wave / avant garde experiment.
