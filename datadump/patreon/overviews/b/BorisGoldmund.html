The Monthly Salon\u00a0 in my home in San Francisco.\u00a0 The Salon was scheduled\u00a0 on my one day off every month from being harpist at the Ritz Carlton San Francisco and the US Navy on Treasure Island.\u00a0 \u00a0I negotiated the 14th of every month off and I immediately\u00a0started a monthly gathering.\u00a0 \u00a0The evening included and still includes a potluck meal, music making and sharing in all media.\u00a0 \u00a0The Salon has grown to have a life of its own.\u00a0 \u00a0Every month new artists join and show their work and have found new audience and\u00a0 buyers for their work.\u00a0 The Salon has grown in size to no longer fit in my home.\u00a0 We move between private homes, galleries and other venues.\u00a0 Communications and preparation for the Salon takes a good amount of time.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0I have\u00a0 found that the salon provides a place for people of all persuasions, races, genders, nationalities, orientations, and religions to find common ground in harmony, beauty, movement, sound and taste.\u00a0 \u00a0A guest at a recent\u00a0 Salon told me she was about to move away from San Francisco, but after attending the Salon, she felt she had found community in San Francisco worth staying for.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ve come to realize that putting mixes of creative people together is a social medium unto itself and that its something I like to do.\u00a0 The Salon is a great way for me to practice this medium and also bless mankind with the results.\u00a0 \u00a0Its like facebook, but without the separation.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn 20017 I started a monthly salon in Berlin Germany.\u00a0 My family lives there as well as several artists whose work I greatly admire.\u00a0 \u00a0 With their assistance I started a monthly salon in Berlin and it\u0027s already a success with regular attendees and its growing every month.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll sorts of collaborations have taken place in the Salon.\u00a0 \u00a0First showings of award winning videos,\u00a0 first \"nerve\" performances by renowned classical soloists from the US, Europe, Africa\u00a0 and South America.\u00a0 Exhibits of bronze sculptures, oils, pastels, and music in all genre including African, Rap, Classical, Opera, Jazz, Country Western, Indian, Pakistani, Chines, Japanese and more.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor twenty-seven years I\u0027ve covered the costs of the Salon from my performing income as harpist.\u00a0 \u00a0Now, I am inviting those of you who enjoy the Salon to become participants\u00a0as monthly recurring patrons, here on Patreon.\u00a0 \u00a0The Salon has always been a free event.\u00a0 I want to keep admission free.\u00a0 \u00a0Making graphics and communications happen, along with clean up, catering utensils, glasses, etc.\u00a0 are recurring costs.\u00a0 I\u0027d like to be able to share the largesse of your patronage to engage a Berlin Artist/harpist/organizer,\u00a0 and to pay for graphics and communications costs.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There are several levels of participation possible.\u00a0 \u00a0Check it out on the right side of this page.\u00a0 \u00a0At each level of commitment there is a different reward ranging from Harp mp3.s to full paid airfare and accommodation to attend a Salon in San Francisco or Berlin.\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to thank you in advance for becoming part of the lifeblood of The Monthly Salon.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is an exercise\u00a0in coming together as community through art and food\u00a0 and a place for people of all races, genders and classes of people to meet on level ground for enjoyment and exchanging ideas.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnloy the videos and blog below from Salons from the
