I have found my own systems and challenges to improve and have began to help and teach others to do the same. Talking with other creatives I have learned a few of the common struggles that we all struggle with and I have done my best to share my knowledge to help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe we are all creative in our own ways, we just need to tap into it and express it.
