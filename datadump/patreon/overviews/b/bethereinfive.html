THANK YOU SO SO SO MUCH!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sincerely will NEVER be able to adequately thank anybody who follows, listens, and reaches out to me to tell me they like what they hear and are interested in what I have to say. And by pledging $1 a month (I feel like I\u0027m narrating an ASPCA commercial) you are seriously making so much of a difference in my life by enabling me to continue doing what I enjoy (but with a hell of a lot less guilt and more joy because I can justify the time spent). It\u0027s often hard to promise what exactly you\u0027re building or how you\u0027ll pay someone back when you\u0027re in the middle of something, but all I can say is that I\u0027m working on a lot of things, everyday, to do more of what I enjoy and what you tell me you enjoy and I hope that I\u0027ll be able to continue to keep you company, entertain you, and talk about the things that we are all thinking. It means so much to me that you\u0027d be willing to support a random person when there are so many people, far more legit than I am, asking for your money. And I\u0027ll work endlessly to prove to you that I\u0027m a worthy investment :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--\u003cbr\u003eABOUT BE THERE IN FIVE: PODCAST EDITION\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs\na person that often texts their friends \"Be There in Five\" when she\njust got out of the shower, Kate Kennedy (entrepreneur, self-proclaimed\nmillenni-old, and unofficial pop culture reporter) started a company that aimed\nto solve a major problem of likeminded people running out the door; wondering\nif they left their curling iron or straightener on.
