    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to Patreon. Let me explain what this is and how it works. \u003cbr\u003eMedia has for all of human history been controlled by just a relatively few very powerful people, governments, and large companies. We are some of the first people ever to have access to truly free forms of media like independent music, podcasts, youtube, and so on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMedia has traditionally had to conform to the lowest common denominator, and appeal to mass audiences, or worse, just push an agenda. But be excited because now we can create and support media that has the consumers best interest in mind. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat happens when you directly fund the things that you want to exist, and Patreon seems to be helping creators connect directly to the consumer. It\u0027s an extremely exciting and important  development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Break it Down podcast is essentially an experiment in self-directed learning. I am a very curious and driven person who has never really fit in or learned well in traditional systems. I\u2019m a curious guy you could say, and to me nothing feels better than to be engaged, focused, and stimulated. I\u2019m always looking  to get into a discussion, or even just listen to a discussion on music, technology, the future, or human social behavior. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePodcasts have been the perfect thing for me.  I\u2019m not super into books or colleges or anything like that, so I\u0027m trying to design a career for myself that may have not really ever existed before, and that is to just talk to people who know stuff that I\u2019m curious about and have some thoughts on. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s called long form conversation. I think it\u0027s better and more fun and more valuable than other more propositional forms of information exchange. My guess is that by me exposing the topics that are interesting, you will be be greatly benefitted just as I am. The exciting part to me is that the show is designed to have your and my interests aligned. I want to be your guide to exploring how things work. We will learn a bunch of stuff and it will be fun too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e What do I want you to do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport what I do directly with your money. This show is a hundred times cheaper to produce than any radio or TV production, but I do spend a good deal of money and a tremendous amount of time on it.  I have a producer named Reva that I pay every month already to do everything for this show: run the cameras, publish the files, update the website, make the graphics, do the bookkeeping, manage and book the guests, and listen to all my crazy ideas. My first goal is just to pay for her work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso we do pay rent here in my studio so that I can walk into the studio and broadcast anytime I want and also work on music and other projects. Beyond that I would love to be able to justify making several shows a week and do more in-person conversations by traveling and flying guests here to my studio. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWe are creating an actual community of people interested in the similar stuff via a private Slack group. I\u2019m looking forward to interacting there and having that group drive the show and guests and topics we cover.  I\u2019m exited to learn from you guys too about what is interesting and stimulating in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo lets do it. I promise you that your contribution really does matter and I also believe that you yourself will get more out of the show and feel better for doing it. This is not charity. It is you being proactive in your consuming of media that I believe will make you a better, more informed, reasonable person. \u003cbr\u003e"
