Using Appalachian mountain dulcimer, Native American flute, ukulele, drums and electronic effects, he deftly navigates the varied waters of traditional and modern Americana with passion, wit and a genuinely huge heart for sharing music with a crowd. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKnown for his musical shape-shifting, Futch switches the channels on style with every new song, sung in a limber tenor voice and woven together with the other instruments. His casual way with any audience, coupled with a fierce originality on the lesser known mountain dulcimer, makes each show a one-of-a-kind and good-timing romp. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a nationally touring solo performer he\u0027s headlined at such events as \u003cstrong\u003eThe Florida Folk Festival, Old Songs Festival, The Big Muddy, Kentucky Music Weekend\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eCommon Ground On The Hill. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a strong love for traditional music, Futch has enjoyed a career on both sides of the folk and rock divide, first as guitarist for CCM post-punkers \u003cstrong\u003eCrazed Bunnyz\u003c/strong\u003e in 1986 and much later in 1999 as co-founder of \u003cstrong\u003eMohave\u003c/strong\u003e on mountain dulcimer.
