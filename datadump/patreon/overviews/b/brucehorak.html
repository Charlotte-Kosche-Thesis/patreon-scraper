     "about": "I am often asked how a person with such limited eyesight sees the world.\u003cbr\u003eI took up painting as en experiment to see if i could capture how I see.  The portrait series began in April of 2011 and most of the portraits in the series were done from actual sittings which last between 2 and 3 hours.  I have completed over 500 portraits, the majority of which are on 8x10 stretched canvass.  I work in Acrylic Paint as the density and texture of the paint has the right feel, and also because acrylic dries very quickly and travels well.  I have been living out of a backpack and doing portrait sittings across Canada and into the United States since July 1, 2010.   I\u0027ve been inspired by the work of Tom Thomson, Fredrick Varley, Vincent Van Gough, Pablo Picasso, Claude Monet, Gahan Wilson, and James Christensen.  The quick field sketches of AY Jackson and the Group of Seven are a particular inspiration to me, as I like to work quickly to capture a mood or feeling and to avoid being bogged down and restrained by the internal critic.\u003cbr\u003eAs a result of the damage I\u0027ve had done to my remaining eye, everything I see has a halo of light around it - an aura.  I begin every portrait by taking time to observe the colour of the subject\u0027s aura, and use that colour as the base-tone of the portrait.  From there, I work at trying to capture the shadows, highlights, shapes, edges, and an overall feeling of the subject.  Over the course of a sitting the aura may change, at which point I will add in those colours and often shift the perspective of the portrait.  \u003cbr\u003eWhen I finish a canvass I will invite my subject to put on my heavy prescription glasses and look through them at the completed portrait.  With one eye closed and at close range through heavy magnification, a kind of tunnel-vision is imposed, different areas are emphasized, and a 3-D effect occurs.  \u003cbr\u003eWith my glasses on, my subjects are forced to see themselves in a new way, and I hope that the literal aspect of that will translate to a figurative one as well. \u003cbr\u003e",
