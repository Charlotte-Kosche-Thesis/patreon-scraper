    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eI believe that fine art can be an ongoing joyful practice and a personal journey of self-exploration. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I paint, I try to give myself room to be playful while continuing to hone my skills in representation and portraiture. Rather than produce portraits of individuals, I am interested in depicting moments of\u003cstrong\u003e humanity\u003c/strong\u003e and transformation. I depict dynamic, \u003cstrong\u003eemotional\u003c/strong\u003e figures \u00a0to represent the human body as an \u003cstrong\u003eexpressive\u003c/strong\u003e tool. The use of texture, \u003cstrong\u003ecolor\u003c/strong\u003e, and movement creates pieces that go \u003cstrong\u003edeeper\u003c/strong\u003e than the surface layer, bringing to light our \u003cstrong\u003einner world\u003c/strong\u003e in a beautiful, visual way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage provides me the ability to pursue this as my passion and my livelihood, so that I can make great art to share with you!\u003cbr\u003eYou can help me\u00a0break into the art world, gain exposure, improve continually, and pursue more ambitious projects in my work.  The funding will go towards overhead costs like gallery fees, entry fees, supplies, marketing, etc. \u003cbr\u003eThis is not my business model or a long-term plan. I will continue to market and sell my art in the traditional market. \u00a0Your patronage is simply \u003cstrong\u003ea helping hand\u003c/strong\u003e for this first step in my journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor those of you new to Patreon...\u003c/em\u003e \u00a0\u003c/h2\u003eIt is a wonderful way to \u003cstrong\u003esupport artists in a practical way\u003c/strong\u003e, with a very \u003cstrong\u003elow and very flexible financial commitment\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0It brings the old-world idea of art patronage into today\u0027s crowdfunding environment. \u00a0Think like Kickstarter, but instead of raising a whole bunch of money all at once for one huge project, it\u0027s an \u003cstrong\u003eongoing relationship\u003c/strong\u003e on a smaller scale. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this case, you will provide small amounts of funding \u003cstrong\u003eper Painting\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0You may pledge any amount you choose, starting at \u003cstrong\u003ea single dollar\u003c/strong\u003e. When I create a new piece, I will be paid the pledged amount from each Patron to help recover some of my costs.\u00a0I will average about\u00a02-3 paintings a month. You do have the option however, to cap your monthly payments at any amount you choose.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make it more fun and to really bring you into my process and share my work with you, there is a tiered reward system for different pledge amounts, which includes access to my Patron-only Newsfeed where I share \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive insights\u003c/strong\u003e about my work and creative process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLearn more about Patreon\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/200359925-Patrons\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
