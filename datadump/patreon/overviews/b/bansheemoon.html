    "summary": "It was recommended that I start this page so that people who wanted to help me create content or just be supportive, would be able to do so. I was told that people simply want to support what I am doing without expecting anything in return. I was a bit skeptical and reluctant because asking for help is not something to which I am accustomed. I thought about it for a few months and then finally decided to go for it. I was instantly amazed and delighted to find this to be true! I owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of those willing to pledge here. Even the one dollar pledge shows me that people care enough to just get involved and help out and believe me, every bit helps! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love to have fun and create videos and photos. I could see doing this full time but doing so would be a real challenge. With all of the expenses of day to day life and the cost of producing the videos and photos that are coming out now on a regular basis. I need to juggle working full time and producing creative content. Taking the time to be creative, buying and constantly upgrading camera gear, lighting and props can get expensive. Hey, and a girl can always use things like new bikinis and better camera and sound recording equipment! I would also like to be able to travel which is the biggest expense. So if you are able to help (within your budget) as my patron, who knows how much more fun and exciting the videos could be!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe NUDITY question... \u00a0For some reason I get this a lot... \"Is the Patreon account set up for Farm Girl to post nude pics and videos?\" To answer that, I\u0027d just say: The internet is chock full of that kind of stuff and so there really isn\u0027t a great need for just one more nude model. I want to offer something I consider fun and daring but keeping in perspective that I am a mother of two very loving and supportive adult children who really don\u0027t need to see more of \u00a0me than I\u0027m already revealing.\u00a0The primary purpose of the Patreon account is to offer a way for friends to help support the Banshee Moon enterprise as a whole. I am new to Patreon and will figure out ways to add little extras for our Patrons like special pictures or sneak previews etc. as I move forward. Thank you for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eREFUNDS:\u00a0Not something typically requested but please know that if there is any reason you may be in a situation where you may find your self requesting this PLEASE DON\u0027T PLEDGE. This is digital material and as such there there are no refunds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to directly influence the Banshee Moon creativity process and help me to be more prolific. Why not pledge whatever you can and watch what I can do! \u00a0Thank you and bless you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFarm Girl\u003cbr\u003e"

The channel is comprised of simple no frills videos of me working, playing and trying new things \u00a0(usually in a bikini)\u00a0on the farm, at the beach on the boat, or out on the town. We have a wide range of videos including- fitness, pranks, comedy, discussions,\u00a0how-to\u0027s and more! We have positive approach to life and a positive outlook as we enter our sixth decade.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt really is a lot of fun and from time to time we get to travel. We would like to do more traveling to be able to get real adventuresome with the videos but traveling is expensive. We have started with destinations in the South that are not so far from our North Carolina home but we hope to raise the funds to be able to travel to places far and wide like L.A., Las Vegas, The Grand Canyon and eventually abroad. We know we will get there.",
