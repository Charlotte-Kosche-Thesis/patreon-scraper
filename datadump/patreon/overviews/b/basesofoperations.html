    "summary": "Well first things first, i\u0027m super happy you have chosen to look at my Patreon page here, and for that, you have my deepest thanks. I hope that you like what i\u0027m trying to do here, and should you choose to support me, I would be forever grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo who am I and what am I doing here. Well the first is simple, I am a Tabletop War game Miniature Commission painter, based in Ipswich UK. the second is a little different. I live stream from the studio, giving my viewers an inside look to how the studio operates, as well as being on hand for questions about painting miniatures, it also allows my clients the opportunity to get live, up to date updates on how their personal orders are progressing (this is on top of the ability to private message me when ever they wish too, and the weekly updates they receive as a matter of course). But i also film almost everything i do in the studio as well, speed them up and show you on youtube just what it takes to build, convert, and paint tabletop miniatures\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that is what I wish to do, with your help, and the continued support from my viewers and clients, i wish to build this business from strength to strength, so thanks again for taking the time to have a look here, and i hope to hear from you in the future"
