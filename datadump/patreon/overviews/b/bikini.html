    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHelp Make Bikinis Great Again!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to the Patreon page of BikiniMagazine.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are reading this chances are you a fan of hot bikini babes.  Who doesn\u0027t like a beautiful girl with an amazing fit body in a sexy bikini?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI got my start in swimsuit photography back around the year 2000.  It was a great exciting time with some of the best bikini photos ever being produced. I personally helped put many girls on the map that went on to build more of a name for themself doing things such as becoming WWE Divas and getting the cover of the Hooters Calendar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel I\u0027ve always had a good feel for what swimsuit photography should be.  Which is to photograph young beautiful girls that have a girl next door vibe to them.  A girl that knows they are young and pretty with a good body and are willing to show it off to a point but not do anything too sleazy.  To often what swimsuit photography has become is just getting girls who are kind of skanky to show as much skin as possible.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to that I always prided myself on treating models in a professional way and maintaining a good reputation. I would hear so many horror stories from models of all the inappropriate behavior of other swimsuit photographers they have worked with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs time went on I feel in general swimsuit photography has gone in a bad direction for a variety of reasons.  Some photographers like myself got burnt out and took a break from shooting and others gave up on it and moved onto different ventures.  Many of the newer swimsuit photographers that came along were like robots who all do things the same way and have little character in their work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn some ways social media has been a good thing but in other ways it has hurt swimsuit photography.  Now every girl with an Iphone is a photographer of sorts and can take constant selfies which take no effort.  Often in these photos they are promoting a tea or something which they are being paid to promote.  Wheres the art in that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTheir whole existence is really based on Instagram.  What happens if Instagram announced tomorrow that thong pictures were against their TOS or they had to set their account to private?  Most of these people would be screwed.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings change and evolve but I am just as committed to wanting to produce swimsuit photos that I feel are true to the genre and last the test of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be the best at that I need to take things to a whole new level.  There are many amazing hot young girls out there but to entice these girls to shoot it takes money.  These are the type of perfect 10\u0027s I want to mostly focus on.  New, fresh, amazing girls who have done like zero other photo shoots.  There is also increased expenses on things like equipment and wardrobe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe vision for Bikini Magazine is, in addition to being the online site, to also have a quarterly hard copy printed magazine.  As a Patreon you can help all of this come true.  Seriously, whats a better cause they helping the production of super hot bikini models?  You can also help suggest what you want to see. Is there specific models and poses that you want to make a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery little bit helps.  Thanks for Making Bikinis Great Again!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.bikinimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bikini-magazine.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
