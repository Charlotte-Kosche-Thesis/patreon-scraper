In the game you will travel through a fantasy world encountering many different girls, each with their own fighting style. You will be learning spells and gain power-ups along the way. When fighting, the girls will try to seduce you, but when necessary they can use brute force, and ofcourse,\u00a0Losing a fight will result in a complementary H-scene. Here\u0027s a screenshot to give you a quick idea of what it\u0027s gonna look like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/X863daD.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will my support do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou will of course receive the pledge rewards, I will make sure to keep in contact with my patrons to give everybody what they want out of the game as much as I can. At the moment I do still have a job to pay the bills and eat food, cus who doesn\u0027t like those things. I would like to make this a project I can work on full time. The more support I get, the more stuff I can create and the more I can discuss with my patrons what they would like to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will the fights be like?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ethe fights are going to be turn based, with a lot of similarities to MGQ. The girls will react to the player\u0027s choices in the battle. The Alraune demo is the old type of gameplay which had it\u0027s problems. So now a new demo is out featuring a Holstaur, which works much better. All girls will start out trying to seduce the player, allowing the player to resist or allow them to do what they want, similarly to the imp fight in MGQ, afterwards the actual fight starts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/28MKKbg.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill there be walking around?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere will be a village for the player to walk around in, which will function as a hub world. The player can then travel to the different locations to find the monster girls.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/j7ipvJW.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVR support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, implemented, just press \u0027v\u0027 in the titlescreen to activate. You can activate it anywhere, but it\u0027s best to just do it in the titlescreen to avoid problems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSimilar to MGI\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimilar schmimilar! So I expect people will mention this at some point, so I thought I\u0027d nip it in the butt right away. MGI was actually one of the main inspirations. We\u0027re both creating first person Monster Girl games. I prefer the approach to Monster Girls in Monster Girl Quest, so they will be generally more evil in this game. I think both of the games we\u0027re creating still have enough differences to stand on their own. In any case, I feel there should be more Monster Girl Games out there. So please, keep supporting Redamz Monster Girl Island. He\u0027s very professional and I believe he will actually finish the project.\u003cbr\u003e"
