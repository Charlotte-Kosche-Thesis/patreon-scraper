    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Bobby London, a writer and journalist in Los Angeles. I\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://thisisbobbylondon.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eself-publish\u003c/a\u003e most of my writing but I\u0027ve also written for or had my work republished by outlets such as ForHarriet, CounterPunch, Truth Out, It\u0027s Going Down, and Infoshop .\u00a0I\u0027m also a part of a media collective called On Resistance, with a weekly radio show on 90.7 KPFK (you can listen to all our past shows \u003ca href=\"http://www.soundcloud.com/on-resistance\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this moment where the narrative of \"where we should go from here?\" will definitely be to signal us back into the democratic party, and maintaining the status quo, it is important that voices like mine are able to continue to write, and find financial support . While I\u0027m trying to make a living off my work, the prospects are slim for a black woman whose politics push against the white liberal consensus of many publishing outlets. Although it may appear that we are seeing more \"diversity\" in the media, it is still must fit a certain criteria, one that either, upholds liberalism, or is willing to whitesplain their struggle. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a writer whose perspective takes years for most media outlets to catch up to, I\u0027ve found that most of my writing is two years too early, for most media outlets to be able to digest. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goals for 2017 is finally have time to focus on the projects that I\u0027ve wanted to attempt but have not been able to due to funding:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreate my own publication which pays it\u0027s creators and contributors\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreate video segments\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake my article The Anti-Bluprint a book that further details the topics and tactics I discuss in my piece.\u00a0 \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI\u0027ve created this Patreon to try and find a way to fund my work that doesn\u0027t compromise my principles. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you appreciate my work and would like to see more of it, please consider signing up as my supporter on Patreon to make a monthly donation to support my writing. If you\u0027re struggling in capitalism like me, I don\u0027t want your money, and your shares are supportive enough. But, if you do have disposable income, and are looking to offer financial support, than that would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
