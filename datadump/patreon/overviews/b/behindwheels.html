    "summary": "Hi! My name\u0027s Omkar Jadhav, and I\u0027m an amatuer cyclist on the path of being pro.\u003cbr\u003eIn each episode I strive to reveal the hidden roads of Belgium, decode the training process, pass on the philosophies of the world\u0027s best cyclists, or take a critical look at the most recent products.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe videos are for both enthusiasts looking to learn more about their favourite game, and budding cyclists looking to find out more about how to train then to use their power to compete, deliver experiences, and tell stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got endless ideas for new episodes - and I want you to help me make them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a service where you can pledge to send a regular payment to creators, so they can support themselves and keep making new stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is better for creators than advertising or sponsorship. The content is 100% uncompromised, payment is more predictable, and creators don\u0027t need to stoop to clickbait content or other shady practices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon means that creators serve their viewers, not advertisers or corporate sponsors. And where the viewers choose what deserves to be made and who deserves a voice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow often will I end up paying?\u003cbr\u003eYou get to decide how much you pledge, how long you want to support the channel for, and how often you pay. You can choose to pay once per month or once per episode of Behind\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWheels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do you need the money?\u003cbr\u003eStarting in 2017, I was able to make cycling my full time job. So, Patreon is now my primary source of income. I therefore need the money to, like, eat and stuff - all while spending upwards of 100 hours training, researching, writing, editing, and publishing the latest episode of the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also use the money to purchase equipment for upgrades, better capture equipment, online services, and stuff like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003cbr\u003eAll Patrons pledging $5 or more get updates about the show, behind the scenes stuff, opportunities to help with upcoming episodes, a monthly newsletter about me and my work, and a terrific collection of articles and videos that should be of interest to any fan of BEHIND WHEELS. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus, you can take part in our regular discussions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledge $10 a video and you\u0027ll get a bonus video each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd those who pledge $15 will get new episodes of Behind Wheels 24 hours early and will appear in the credits for every paid-for episode. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill I get previous Patron-only content when I subscribe?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, but only after your first payment has been processed (which happens at the beginning of the month).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
