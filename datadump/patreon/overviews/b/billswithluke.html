I\u0027m excited to have you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a too long didn\u0027t read:\u00a0I\u0027m Luke Scorziell, a high school student headed to college next fall. I host a podcast on policy, I interview experts and analyze popular legislation (Tax Reform, Immigration Reform, etc) and spend hours researching, editing, recording, publishing each episode.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a service that allows you, my fans, to support me with monthly donations.\u00a0By becoming a Patron, you\u0027ll access to two things:\u00a0\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eExclusive rewards and new content\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eIf you\u0027re ready to join the team, then head over to the rewards page. If you\u0027d like to keep reading, then keep going!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eOkay, if you have more time, here\u0027s my story...\u003c/h4\u003e\nIf you don\u0027t already know me, my name is Luke Scorziell. I\u0027m \n\u003cstrong\u003e18 years old\u003c/strong\u003e, and I live in a small rural town in Southern California (surprisingly, there are small towns in SoCal!?). I\u0027ve been the Editor-In-Chief for my\u00a0website\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003esince I was 15 and hosted my podcast,\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bills-with-luke-scorziell/id1193048403?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBills with Luke Scorziell\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003c/em\u003esince I was 17.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started my podcast after the 2016 election cycle with a goal of finding \n\u003cstrong\u003etruth\u003c/strong\u003e in our political landscape. I wanted to cut through the fruitless fights that plague American\u0027s TVs and find the \u003cstrong\u003ehonest facts.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThe best place I knew to start was by taking an objective look at the policies everyone was arguing about. By analyzing the legislation our government passes, I found a out how exactly we, the people, will be affected. As such, I decided to pursue the research.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince launching my podcast in January 2017, I\u0027ve interviewed \npolicy experts, economists, supreme court\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eattorneys, CEOs, medical experts, and\u00a0more. I\u0027ve published episodes analyzing tax reform, immigration reform, and campus speech reform.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo create each episode, I take a piece of legislation and spend \n\u003cem\u003ehours\u003c/em\u003e researching its in\u0027s and out\u0027s. Then I record (and sometimes re-record) in my \u003cstrong\u003eself-funded\u003c/strong\u003e home-studio, which doubles as my bedroom. Finally, I spend a few more hours editing and publishing the episode to iTunes and my website. In total, turning an idea into a podcast takes an entire weekend.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition, I run a\u00a0Twitter account to promote my podcast. \n\u003cem\u003eBills with Luke Scorziell \u003c/em\u003e(@theedgeofideas) has garnered over\u003cstrong\u003e 7,300 followers\u003c/strong\u003e and we grow more and more everyday. But the growth does not come without a lot of work. Each morning I spend time seeking out similar accounts and driving engagement on my own. I schedule and post tweets with articles, images, quotes and more while also maintaining a good relationship with my followers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\nWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/h4\u003e\nBy becoming a Patron, you\u0027ll gain\u00a0access to all rewards and prizes I give out.
