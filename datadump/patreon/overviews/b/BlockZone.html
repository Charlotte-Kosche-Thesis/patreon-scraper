We wanted this and figured the best way to get it right is to do it ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eOk....but that sounds really hard and might cost you a lot right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWell now you have to remember where you are.

We want people we can hang out with and be ourselves around. A lot of us in the admin group are kind of shut ins. Both in the gaming world and the non-virtual. By making our first server, a little minecraft thing with a mod pack, we wanted to hang out together and know what was going on in each other\u0027s lives. Some of the Admins here were friends before this started, but then some were met though the games we love.\u003c/div\u003eWow, I didn\u0027t ask for all of that but neat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eSorry, the main thing we here are trying to do in get a few gaming servers running, if that happens the community will form\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOH...by the way....you can get your discord rewards here....sorry I forgot to put that anywhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/QN9MfNe\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/QN9MfNe\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eIf you join the discord you can have access to all levels by just sticking with us for a while and participating in chat.
