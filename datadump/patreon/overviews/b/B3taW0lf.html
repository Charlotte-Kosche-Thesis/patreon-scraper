    "summary": "Hello, my name is Jonathan Gibson and I\u0026#8217;m a hacker. My obsession with technology began when I got my first computer at the age of four, back when Windows 98 was the latest OS and AOL was our internet gateway. My love for computers has grown and stuck with me throughout the years, longer than some people had expected. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough it first manifested through logging countless hours into in video games like \u003cem\u003eThe Great Battles of Alexander \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eCivilization III\u003c/em\u003e, it was when some friends showed me the many things one could do with an understanding of networks and computer functionality, things I never even thought were possible, that my interests in technology skyrocketed. At a young age, I taught myself programming, basic Python for scripting, tool development and automation, Ruby, HTML and CSS for Web development, and the domains of computer hacking, reconnaissance, enumeration and attacking systems. I soon felt like the king of the internet, master of my computer and its domain. But this feeling did not last forever, as I promptly fell out of favor with the tech gods at the age of thirteen (let\u0026#8217;s just say 2007 wasn\u0026#8217;t that great of a year). Four years later, I was finally allowed to step back into my throne only to find that so much had changed. BackTrack 5 was just released, so many new tools had been added, and the internet as I knew it became something much different, something almost foreign and overwhelming. I could\u0027ve been lost, but I took this as a learning experience, an exciting opportunity to explore all the new gateways that had been opened by these advances in technology. I moved quickly, learning as much as I could as fast as I could because I refused to be left behind. To this day I still find myself learning... Honestly, the best of us never stop learning. \u003cbr\u003eI eventually decided to start a company: a small startup cybersecurity firm that endeavors to help not only businesses but newcomers to our community as well. My goals are to produce content that can be enjoyed by both the novice and the pro. In return, you can help me by donating to my cause. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have many plans for this YouTube channel, the forums and this Patreon page. I hope you\u0026#8217;ll join me on this journey to make a difference in our community and to help the people who fear it\u0026#8217;s too hard to join or move forward. Remember, none of us are imposters. We all belong here, learning side by side.\u003cbr\u003e"
