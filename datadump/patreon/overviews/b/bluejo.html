    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Hugo, Nebula and World Fantasy award winning author\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://http:///www.jowaltonbooks.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJo Walton\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write science fiction and fantasy novels, and also poetry. I\u0027ve been posting poetry for free on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://papersky.livejournal.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy livejournal\u003c/a\u003e since 2002. I just checked to make sure that was right, and indeed, the sixth thing I ever posted to LJ was the poem \"\u003ca href=\"http://papersky.livejournal.com/1702.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNext Talking Fish, Five Hundred Miles\u003c/a\u003e\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that speculative poetry is having a Golden Age right now, with so many people producing such wonderful stuff and showing it to each other. Many of these speculative poets have Patreons, because there isn\u0027t a whole lot of money to be made out of poetry, and I\u0027ve decided to join them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t intend to do anything different, I\u0027m just setting this up so people who enjoy my poetry can directly contribute and let me know. I\u0027m just adding this as an extra place -- the poems will still be posted on my website, and here as well, with an email going out to contributors to tell them when there\u0027s a new poem.\u00a0I\u0027m pretty sure there has never been a month without at least one poem, and sometimes I get on a tear, so you might want to do a monthly amount, or set a limit, in case I do something like the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.jowaltonbooks.com/poetry/whimsy/the-godzilla-sonnets/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGodzilla Sonnets\u003c/a\u003e and just keep going.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy orignial intention for this Patreon was to use it to support the other artists I already support on Patreon, because I love Patreon, I love the democratization of patronage. It\u0027s such a nifty thing, supporting creation. This goal was met\u00a0almost instantly. This Patreon is making more than enough to support all the people I was already supporting, and a bunch more that I\u0027ve added. This is awesome. The rest of it, for now, is going into my theatre, books, and museums budget, with some of it being saved towards the long term goal, see below. In 2016, this Patreon paid for me to go to New York to see the RSC Henriad in April, and to Chicago to see Edward II, Henry V, and Henry VI part 1 in May, the Globe Merchant of Venice in August, and in September Henry VI parts 2 and 3 and Richard III. (I do sometimes see theatre by people who are not Shakespeare. I saw Aeschylus\u0027s Agamemmnon last year. And Webster\u0027s The White Devil the year before. But 2016, all Shakespeare. Well, he is the best.) It has also paid for a ton of books that I\u0027d otherwise have had to wait on, and helped subsidize a trip to Florence in June.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017, in which my husband and I have both been living on my income as he searches for a job (anyone need a Bioinformatician in Montreal?) without this Patreon I wouldn\u0027t have a book or entertainment budget. It has also helped subsidize my month in Italy writing, and my trip to Helsinki for Worldcon. I couldn\u0027t have done either of those things without this money. It also paid for me to see 12 Fringe shows in Edinburgh while we were there for the Book Festival. (Only half of them were Shakespeare!) Right now some of it is even being frittered away on bills and groceries, though I hope this is temporary because it sucks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI also have a long term goal of producing a really solid \"Collected Poems\" volume\u003c/strong\u003e. This is looking like it really might be possible, and I will get back to saving up for it as soon as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy novels are published by Tor in the US and Corsair in the UK and other publishers in translation in seventeen (unless I\u0027ve lost count) countries. I am very happy with this and have no desire to change it and go into business for myself. My non-fiction essays are published on Tor.com, and have been collected by Tor, and probably will be again. I like traditional publishing, it does a lot of things for me that I would be terrible at doing for myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut poetry isn\u0027t commercially possible in the same kind of way, and I have dealt with that mostly by just giving it away online. If you want to support me continuing to do that, I really appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

It is already more than covering the pledges I make to other creators, and I can use it for solid things in the world. (Mostly theatre tickets...) And I thought I would add this goal -- I take Amtrak all the time, pretty much every time I go somewhere in North America, and if I am paying myself, I go coach, and if somebody else is paying I get a room, with a bed, and where I can actually work. The upgrade cost of a room is about $200 a night -- so for example from here to San Francisco, which is three train nights, it would be about $600 extra. I can never bring myself to pay it, I get sticker shock. If there\u0027s two of us, it\u0027s worth it, as the price is per room, not per person, and it includes meals, so $100 extra is worth it, but not $200, just for me. So this is actually a psychological financial goal -- if this Patreon reaches $200 per poem, I will get a room on the train, because in that case I\u0027d be getting it for a song, wouldn\u0027t I?",
