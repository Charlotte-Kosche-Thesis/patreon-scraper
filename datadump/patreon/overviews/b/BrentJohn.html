Depends on what seems to be more popular. Honestly, I don\u0027t have a particular or consistent style pinned down yet.

If you start to pledge in the middle of a month, the charge will come at the beginning of the next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIMPORTANT: All money is calculated using the USD system.

While I appreciate any amount of money given, I don\u0027t believe that begging is an appropriate way to get it. Money is only required if you wish to gain access to my rewards or hire me for commission. You can support me via other means, such as following me on Twitter, sharing my work online (not making any money without my permission or outside the boundaries of Fair Use, of course), watching me on deviantART, etc. The choice is entirely yours!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the more patrons I accumulate on here, the more time I\u0027ll be able to dedicate towards the rewards offered here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you still looking for full-time employment?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes!

How much do you charge?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes! And that varies on the project. Message me so we can discuss it further.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI noticed an error/want more value for my donations. May I suggest corrections and improvements?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease do! Criticism is the crux towards becoming a better artist, and deliver better value towards people who decide to financially support me. All I ask is that it be\u00a0constructive and respectful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGOD DAMN you\u0027re amazing!
