    "summary": "Growing up, I never thought I could be a writer. I didn\u0027t think I was good enough, talented enough, or expressive enough to put my work out there, let alone get paid for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo growing up, I quieted my voice. I decided I would bury my passion for writing no matter what. Even when my English teacher scribbled in the margins of my paper to tell me I had talent, I didn\u2019t listen; even worse, when I did muster up the courage to mention my love for writing to my friends, they laughed at me. They told me my dreams were ridiculous and I didn\u2019t have a chance in hell making a living at doing what I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd the worst part was, I \u003cem\u003ebelieved \u003c/em\u003ethem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was the very definition of living scared.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSo I did what any scared teenager would do: I buried my dreams in favour of wearing a mask. While it made me look good on the outside, it made me feel like a fake to my core.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result of this mask I wore, I never truly fit in wherever I went. Because I never had a true identity, I lost the ability to connect with others beyond the surface.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was so afraid that my dreams would become a reality that I buried them even deeper. I hesitated when anyone asked me what I wanted to be and refused to talk about my dreams. I shoved them aside so much that I forgot about them, that is until I went to college to study English because that\u2019s what all the other creative writing kids were doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe truth is, I was never a writer growing up. I didn\u2019t do anything with my gifts. I didn\u2019t write, and I certainly didn\u2019t read outside of class. I never really took action on my dreams except for writing a few poems here and there, but they were so bad I ended up burying them somewhere in my computer hard drive never to be found again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never wrote because I was scared. I was afraid someone would come up to me one day and tear off the mask I wore because they would see beneath me. But underneath all that fear, the desire to be something bigger festered inside me. It burned off pieces of my soul and is with me to this day, long after I obtained my degree in English literature and obtained any suitable credentials to do the job at hand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the time I graduated, I didn\u2019t know what to do because all of the passion I carried for writing had long died inside of me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had ignored my passion so much that I thought it was too late for me to start.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil eventually, I couldn\u2019t take it any longer\u2026.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I burst.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is what changed everything for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne decision. That I would become a writer no matter what.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had nothing to lose that morning as I pulled myself into a corner of my college library and just sit down and wrote. I still remember how the words poured out of me and how my fingers hit the keys like daggers, excited to dig up the thoughts and feelings I had long held from this world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn that moment I became a writer, and ever since then, I haven\u2019t looked back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I have over 4000 followers on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@blakepowell\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMedium\u003c/a\u003e and close to 1000 email subscribers for my personal blog\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.bulletproofwriters.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. And I never could\u0027ve done it without my readers and the supportive people in my life today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe truth is, you are more than you think you are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd no matter where you are in your writing career, I know you\u2019re capable of so much more: of self-love, of greater mastery, of expression\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is a climb. But I can help you to the top.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know what it feels like to think you\u2019re not good enough to be a writer. I struggle with that feeling every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut still, I create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a writer. And I know I\u2019m born for great things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u2019t force you to join me, but I\u2019d love for you to take this journey because I know you\u2019re capable of making amazing art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t create an amazing community on my own. I need your support and ideas, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to make a pledge to Bulletproof Writers today, you can help me build an awesome community for writers just like you. Let\u0027s create something unparalleled and unprecedented in this world today, a place where writers can develop their skills, share their work, and be challenged and have the support they need to grow into the writers they deserve to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYet it all starts with you and the choice you make today. I hope you help me build this awesome community for writers just like you. I hope you choose you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause by becoming a Patreon, you can help me find that greatness inside of you, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
