I\u0027m Brett Gleason\u003c/strong\u003e, a piano-based alternative artist who plays pretty much all the instruments in my music.\u00a0 My work is intimate yet intense as I write both to express myself and connect with others.\u00a0 I\u0027ve always believed art should be a two-way street and especially as a solo artist, it\u0027s too often been me working alone at home, a truly isolating process. I\u0027m super active on social media but I have had to limit what I share in terms of my in-progress work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI started my career writing about my experience with bipolar disorder and living as a gay man - my latest album, \u003cem\u003e\u0027Manifest\u0027\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0 focuses on stepping out from behind my \u0027disorder\u0027 to live life openly, it\u0027s like a rebirth or 2nd adolescence, intense \u0026amp; emotional but not so angry. I\u0027m now busy writing new songs and am feeling hopeful.\u00a0 I\u0027m in love and excited about life, trying to figure who I am and how I fit in. I have some truly relatable, instantly engaging songs and can\u0027t wait 3 years to release another album - I\u0027m hoping you\u0027ll join my Patreon to help me craft my new music?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e Put simply it\u2019s a monthly support system that directly connects artists with their audiences, a private world to explore new work together as we bring it to life. You can jump on for as little as a $1, not get charged until 1st of the next month as well as change your Pledge at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBut I know you\u0027ll love it - \u003cem\u003ePatreon\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is our own social, multi-media account, interactive blog, messenger, live video streaming and chat service. Of course, like most internet platforms, it\u2019s whatever \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e make out of it and I have some big plans for us...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e For many reasons - most important of all is that I\u2019m looking for a long-term, sustainable path to making music and connecting more intimately with my supporters. Even more important than the financial support is the emotional support and with this Patreon I am committing to making music for whoever is listening, whether it\u2019s a small, core group of supporters like I currently have or beyond. I am committing to a life of creating the most authentic, sincere and directly connected music I can - I am selling out to \u003cem\u003eyou.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the money go?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eEvery dollar that I make from the Patreon is being saved to get me into the studio to record the songs we choose or to purchase something I need for my home studio, I will be 100% transparent.\u00a0 And of course, Patreon takes about a 10% fee for us to use this excellent platform.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMy truth?\u003c/strong\u003e I\u2019m a guy who works two jobs to fund the day to day costs of making music in one of the most expensive yet creative cities in the world. But the most expensive thing of all is my time as I not only write but play 90% of the instruments, self-record and produce my albums/videos from my home studio. I have no label or manager. I hire a publicist for 3 months when I have a record out but that\u2019s it. By the time I release the record, the Kickstarter covers the mixing/mastering/printing costs after I\u2019ve spent years and thousands of hours/dollars to get to that point, mostly alone. I\u2019m then too far in debt to tour and have to get back to my day job so the record never gets to truly see the light of day...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you can make the leap of faith and pledge a monthly support it would be a huge first step towards creating a sustainable life as a musician for me, which is the only way I can continue to create consistently. Not sure if you\u2019re into this? Not sure where your finances will be next month? Put in a small amount to start, you can always change it - for now, the symbolism of your support is huge, as I get my bearings with this platform. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been supporting and following a few different artists and it\u2019s been amazing, I know you\u2019ll love it here and I know I can be a good host. I\u2019m ready. Let\u2019s do this. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAny thoughts? Concerns? Let me know! I\u2019m figuring this all out with you! xBG \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ou4z6NBeAks\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e"
