    "summary": "Hey! I\u0027m bigheadjoe (One word. All lowercase. ALWAYS.) and I\u0027m SUPER EXCITED to bring you \u003cem\u003eTo The Bitter End with bigheadjoe\u003c/em\u003e, a podcast about horror movie franchises that may have overstayed their welcome a bit. Each episode, I will review and discuss a different horror movie franchise, one that I have watched all the way to the bitter end (dun... Dun... DUUUUUUNNNN!!!) so you don\u0027t have to. Some episodes, I will talk about the Horror Movie Franchise as an art form (like the first episode I have planned, entitled \"3 (4, 5, 6, 7? 8? 9?) Is The Magic Number\") so we can gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the movies I am subjecting myself to.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing that will set \u003cem\u003eTo The Bitter End with bigheadjoe\u003c/em\u003e apart from a lot of other movie podcast is that I am going to try very hard not to be too cynical about the movies I watch. I genuinely LOVE these movies, and only stumbled upon the idea to create this podcast after wrapping up watching my 2nd 7 movie franchise in a month. Some of them ARE legitimately bad movies though, and I won\u0027t hold back when appropriate. Honestly though, I went into some of these films ready to trash them but managed to find plenty of things worth praising.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePLEASE NOTE: This podcast WILL contain spoilers for the movies I am reviewing. You have been warned.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTo The Bitter End with bigheadjoe\u003c/em\u003e will be released biweekly, every other Wednesday. The first episode will be posted on Wednesday, April 26th.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOW, \u003c/strong\u003ewhy create a Patreon? That\u0027s simple. I want this to be YOUR show. I did a Magic: the Gathering podcast called Yo! MTG Taps! for almost 7 years, and we had a sponsor for the majority of that time. It was nice to be sponsored, but there\u0027s a lot of pressure (that I mainly put on myself honestly. The last sponsor we had was super chill, but I still felt this way regardless.) to produce a show that\u0027s worth your sponsor\u0027s money. With Patreon, that decision is in YOUR hands. If you think the quality is lacking, or the perks aren\u0027t up to par, you can stop supporting the show. I like that as almost a monthly job evaluation. I\u0027m confident that I can create a show that will be worth supporting, or else I wouldn\u0027t be doing this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that said, creating a podcast is hard work. Watching movies and talking about them sounds easy, but there\u0027s a massive time investment involved in watching six or seven 90 minute movies, then coming up with material to fill an entire show, editing that show (the most time consuming), and then getting that file online, plus promotion. I\u0027d love to feel as though I can properly dedicate the time needed to create the highest quality show possible without needing to worry about losing money from taking time away from work to get\u00a0\u003cem\u003eTo The Bitter End with bigheadjoe \u003c/em\u003eup to the high standards I set for myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I want to eventually be able to produce stickers, buttons, and t-shirts to help promote the show. Your contributions will go a long way towards making that happen!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot to mention, movies cost money. I like to watch most of my movies on DVD or Blu-Ray, and that adds up after awhile!! Patrons will help make some of the harder to find series affordable! (Plus one Patron will be able to win a copy of the series I\u0027m discussing each episode!!)"
