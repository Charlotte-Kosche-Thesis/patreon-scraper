We program conversation evenings and social gatherings\u00a0to bring feminists together in learning and friendship. It\u0027s experiment to see what we can learn from each other that can inspire small improvements in our lives, from the simple realization that there are others with the same questions to more tangible community actions, whatever that may mean. We have BIG plans for 2018 and we are excited to grow -- with your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMember contributions go to help pay designers and creators, promote programming, and run events.
