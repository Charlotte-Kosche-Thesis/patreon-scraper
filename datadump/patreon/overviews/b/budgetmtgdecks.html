Welcome to the Budget MTG Decks Patreon page! Read\non to find out what we do for the Magic community and how you can help us do\neven more\u2026\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho\nare we?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2015 we started making YouTube videos with one very\nspecific goal in mind; to help others enjoy Magic: the Gathering even if they\ndid not have a lot of money to spend. Most magic content available at the time\nfocused on format staples which could easily cost over $20 per card. We knew\nthat it was possible to build fun, competitive decks by focusing on synergy\nrather than card value and as such, Budget MTG Decks was born. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour team: David, Ruud, Stephan, Liza\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe love Magic: the Gathering because it encourages\nstrategic thinking, social interaction and above all\u2026fun! We have gotten to\nknow many of our friends through the game which has brought so much joy to our\nlives. And so we want to make the game accessible to everyone, no matter their\nbudget. In order to do this, our mission is to make videos which lower the two\nlargest barriers which people encounter with the game: \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n1: Cost of playing magic\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2: Complexity of playing magic\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u2019s\nour Mission?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOur mission is to provide tutorials, reviews, spotlight\nand full deck tech videos which help players understand the game better and\nreduce the barrier to deck building. Our videos are evergreen as the formats we\nfocus on are EDH/Commander, Modern, Duel Decks, Sealed and Draft. Most\nimportantly, to make sure the decks are truly budget, we have limited the price\nof all our cards to under a dollar which means the average EDH/Commander deck\nis under $30. Now everyone can join the Magic: the Gathering fun!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\nPatreon?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nInexpensive as our decks may be, their cost is still\nnot covered by YouTube\u2019s ad revenue. Not to mention gaming supplies, audio and\nvideo equipment and the countless hours which go into writing episodes, testing\ndecks and editing videos. If roughly 1-2% of our subscribers would support us\nthe equivalent of a cup of coffee, our dreams would come true and we could make\nvideos for you full time!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\ndo we do with your money?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n- We are going to make more videos. Right now we are\nlimited by our free time which means we can only barely produce two videos per\nmonth. With enough support we could up the frequency to multiple videos per\nweek.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- You asked for gameplay videos and we want to give\nthem to you. Right now we don\u2019t have the time or resources to bring you awesome\nmultiplayer paper magic gameplay videos. Your support will lead to this series\nbecoming a reality. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- We can improve the quality of our videos. Better\ncameras, audio and computer equipment will allow us to make better looking and\nsounding episodes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Awesome loot! That got your attention didn\u2019t it?\nWith your support we can start producing sweet Budget MTG Decks merchandise,\nfrom T-shirts to playmats and everything in between.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- We currently have two jobs, making videos for Budget\nMTG Decks and the full time jobs we have to pay the bills. By supporting us we\ncould turn those two jobs into one sweet job with half the stress and twice the\nfun!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBecome\na Patron\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, if you enjoy our content, feel like we have helped\nyou save a couple of bucks and want return the favor, become a patron. We\ncannot put in words how much it means to us.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBudget MTG Decks\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor\nthe most powerful decks and advice everyone can afford!"
