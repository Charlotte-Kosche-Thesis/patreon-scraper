    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m a game designer and social animator, \u003c/strong\u003ecreating frameworks for playful happenings which act as catalysts for social change and personal growth. My artworks are immersive events, social experiments, real world \u0027quests\u0027, festivals, culture jamming installations and interactive / experiential playgrounds. There is a sentience to art which acknowledges and responds to the \u0027player\u0027. I\u0027m establishing systems which set up serendipitous moments, which create habits of the unusual, which open the gateway to the improbable and unconceived. I aspire to LIVE my ART and PLAY my LIFE. #WeAreNewkind. We are the outcast pirates, lovesick and crusted in sea spit. Open-faced and sailing together, defying the cries that humanity should not be trusted. We intend to tell a different story... WE MAKE OUR OWN SYSTEMS. WE PLAY OUR OWN GAMES!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.bravochild.com/images/bow.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an artist this is my statement of intent:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\"I am Bravo Child. I am open to you. I surrender to the possibility of us. I aspire to building a bridge between the absurd and the lucid. Between the playful and the earnest. Between meaninglessness and an honoured witnessing of existence.\u003cbr\u003e\nI may break things, including myself, but if so, I state here an intention that it is done in the hope that the crack may give way to a golden moment of knowing through which something completely new oozes from mystery into the light of the seen. That we can stand together in awe of the art we both birthed through our collision.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is my decision; to act as the creative catalyst. A bringer of change. A shamanic tool of the inexplicable. Too quick for the mechanics of sensible words and dignified context. This is the ART DERBY; a rodeo of shimmering spirits riding chaotic comets through the pulsating cacophony of possibilities. I\u0027ll hold on for dear life, for Life is dear to me! \"Dear Life...\" I write this letter daily. May our lives be the signature of our souls. Let\u0027s drive today like we stole it from the grip of death and abysmal cataclysm. We dusted off the impossible and settled for the improbable. Living unique lives of the unspeakable; dedicating our loving breath to etching a new language into the celestial winds. As futile as any other attempt at possession. As immaterial as anything born of human pursuit, yet as exquisite as the universal ingredients we were woven from. This is a dangerous wick to light. It may lead to a candle or dynamite... I do not promise, I do not lie, I do not impose, I do not hide. I aspire to meeting the moment and offering participation in it. Smiling, I ride the dying light, into the final actualisation in which all of the fractal tangents collapse into the simplicity of what is. Let\u0027s commit to being honest in this? Yes - this is just a game. Thank you for playing. I am a chaos clown. You have found me for a reason. Let\u0027s unlearn it together!?!\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aO8FySQMbEU\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support will enable me to apply my days to designing systems of play. To building interfaces for human interaction. To venture out into society to explore the arbitrary parameters. To explore nature and learn from the source of chaos. To purchase software and sensory equipment to compose and conduct immersive spaces for visceral learning. I want to \u0027unframe\u0027 art; not confining it to screens, theatres or galleries, but placing it in public spaces and weaving narratives across multiple touch points so as to dissolve the border between art and life. This is \u003cem\u003eOpen World Theatre;\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0boundless, potent, raw and as dangerous as the wilderness... and just as vulnerable, generous and empowering. We are already part of the dance; universal particles in a momentous storm of creation and destruction. I just wish to salute it and point to the stars swirling around us, to remind us where we are!"

I am invigorated by the current peer-to-peer, open-source, crowd-funded approach to innovation and people-powered change! My Patreon account is the gateway to a \u0027membership\u0027 to the Cognitonaut \u0027School of Unlearning\u0027. The premise is to live in an activated way through creativity. This leads to social experiments and sensory experiences. These are then documented and translated back through art, (wearable art, animations, toys, video games). I am opening my lifestyle up for your involvement, by publishing an open calendar. All Patreon members are welcome to join me at any of the nominated activities for workshops, creative jams, performance art, sensory immersions and social experiments. I aspire to remain in a state of raw engagement, yet be able to pay tribute to the wonder of the imagination and the Universe beyond the surface of the everyday world. I find Physics to be extremely Spiritual. I also see so much technology in Nature and would love to evolve our \u0027robots\u0027 and apps into symbiotic systems of exchange. These humanitarian and post-human aspirations are documented through a vibrant world of stories, characters and magical spaces. I hope you enjoy sharing this process with me and get to experience one of my playgrounds firsthand one day :)",
