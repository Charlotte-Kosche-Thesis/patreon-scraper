    "summary": "Hi, we\u0027re bacon and eggs. Well, not actually, because neither bacon nor eggs can talk, but in a joke everyone talks. We\u0027re actually Tyler Carlin and Ethan Edghill, lifelong best friends and amateur film critics since at least June 12, 2007 (That was the original release date of the first Transformers movie. We gave it a 9/10). We\u0027ve done everything together, from living together, to breaking up with each other\u0027s girlfriend\u0027s (that one was a trip), to headlining the biggest shows on our college campus. Now, we want to podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, THANK YOU SO MUCH for taking the time to listen to us. It actually means the world to us and your support is the most unbelievable thing in the world. I know what you\u0027re thinking, is it more unbelievable than your mother\u0027s support for you? Of course not, because I know it\u0027s you reading this, mom.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eB. We couldn\u0027t do this without you. Especially you, next supporter. This show is something we\u0027ve dreamed about for a long time, and we want to do it for a long time, but we need your help to keep it going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eiii. We are as excited about growing this community as we are excited about meeting every one there is to meet. Which is why we are committed to keeping you, our patrons, as involved as you\u0027d like to be."
