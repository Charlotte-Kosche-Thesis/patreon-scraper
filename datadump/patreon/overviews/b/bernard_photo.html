And I love my job.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo... Why I\u0027m here???\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is simple... I would like to make something different, something more than pictures of lingerie, swimsuit, skirts, dresses, jevelry or suits - which I was doing for last 9 years. I would like to create real pictures with real \"something\" in it. And If You are interested to see it I would like to share it with You.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I propose...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBe the sponsor of my pictures, of my whole sessions.

You can print them - they will be in highest possible quality. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, you can have - as co-founder - our work on Your wall in Your living room, You can give that image to Your friend, or do whatever You want to.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://bwstudio.com.pl/images/6G0C7526.jpg\" style=\"float: left; width: 100%; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\nOn every picture will be my signature and\u00a0PostScript.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery session will produce at least 5 pictures, which You\u0027ll find here, and every picture will be carefully postprocessed.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd every session will be documented here - with backstage pictures, making-off tutorials (with light and postprocessing exact explanation), and everything what could be interesting in making session.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo - I please - Help me create some interesting images - there will be our - yours and main creations."
