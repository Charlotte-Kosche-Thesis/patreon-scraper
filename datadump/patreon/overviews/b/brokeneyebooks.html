These are the stories that take place in the realms between science fiction and fantasy, between the realistic and the absurd. This is weird fiction and its borders with other genres.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd what is weird fiction? Is it undefinable? Maybe, but we don\u0027t think so. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe at least want to tell you what it is to us. So here\u0027s a quick list and then below, in \u003cstrong\u003eToward a Weirder Tomorrow\u003c/strong\u003e, we dissect it in a bit more detail. We are looking for, in no particular order, dark fantasy, cosmic horror, fabulism, folk horror, magical realism, slipstream, \"soft\" science fiction, supernatural horror, and surrealism. In short, weird fiction and where it borders with science fiction and fantasy: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eIt must be speculative fiction.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eIt need not be horror. At its core, weird fiction is the unknown.

That particular spectacular and shifting lobe contains all of speculative fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCHARTING THE WEIRD: \u003c/strong\u003eIf one were to attempt to map \u003cstrong\u003especulation\u003c/strong\u003e, at one end might lie \u003cstrong\u003efantasy \u003c/strong\u003ewhile at the other \u003cstrong\u003escience fiction\u003c/strong\u003e. And caught in between is the \u003cstrong\u003eweird\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFantasy represents the \"impossible\" at its core. These are the stories presenting pasts that have already happened (but differently) and the stories relying on elements that the consensus has deemed impossible (see also magic and dragons, that while perhaps there is indeed more to understand about Universe, there is nothing substantive pointing toward this ever actually happening). These are the tales, whether heroic or dark, that don\u0027t try to replicate our reality in every detail but that create worlds beholden only to their own internal logic, either from whole cloth or by reweaving the existing fabric of history (whether baldly or subtly). \u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eScience fiction, on the other end, represents that which is inevitable, that which is perfectly likely, and even that which might very well happen to us as a species at some point in the future possibly\u2014at least based on how we understand ourselves and the universe here and now. Science fiction, at its core, is an extrapolation of our current reality, building social and technological advances or curtailments as befits the time of the writing. It is all of our possible futures based on our current understanding.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eWeird fiction (now that we\u0027ve set a foundation) falls in between those prior two giants\u0027 extremes. It is more proximal to our current state of being. It is our \"unknown,\" us trying to give name and shape to the darkness and to the ecstatic\u2014to that which we don\u0027t understand. It is often labeled as \"supernatural\" or \"weird science,\" depending on which side of the scale it tips, toward fantasy or toward science fiction. Compared to fantasy, it is anchored more firmly in the known: rather that rewriting all that exists, it instead merely pokes holes and pulls strings, tearing down or building up, layering upon the known. (Supernatural horror and folk horror and fabulism are some weird subgenres that often tilt toward fantasy.) Compared to science fiction, weird fiction is less certain. It relies on established principles, on a \"science\" and \"nature,\" that has perhaps been imagined but has no accepted model. (Slipstream and \"soft\" science fiction are often the more science fiction\u2013leaning of weird tales, exploring themes of death, dreams, psychic abilities\u2014the very nature of reality\u2014and similar realms that we recognize that science possibly hasn\u0027t yet said its final piece on.) \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, back to our massive map! It is comprised of axes, each a continuum of some quality, each further expandable into its own multidimensional spectrum as needed. But the two such measures of a story that might be most helpful now are time (or \u003cstrong\u003eproximity\u003c/strong\u003e) and \u003cstrong\u003erealism\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eProximity is simply the past-present-future of the story, and this measures how close the reader is to the story in spacetime. Does it take place in a projected future or a derived past or is it snug in a present-day approximation?\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eRealism is how far the fiction deviates from consensus reality. (The zero point here is our consensus world\u2014this is realistic fiction and not speculative at all\u2014and the opposite extreme is absurdism, or bizarro fiction.) So to what extent does a story speculate? Is there only a touch of the unreal painted on an otherwise \"healthy\" reality (as in magical realism), does it enter the surreal, or maybe sail on clear to the absurd?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI suggest here that all of speculative fiction could be measured on on the plane created by \u003cstrong\u003eproximity \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003erealism\u003c/strong\u003e. We could certainly refine this by unpacking the axes further and even adding more dimensions, but at the core, this feels a good approximation of speculation. Speculation is about setting, the time and place and cultures; you need to add plot and tension and mood if you want to add horror, comedy, romance, (or \"emotion\") to the equation; and it is independent of style (existing anywhere from literary to pop).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo to wrap up, speculative fiction incorporates three genres\u2014fantasy, weird, and science fiction. (Horror is on a separate axis that only intersects with speculative fiction sometimes, but more on that another time.) And within those three genres lie a multitude of subgenres.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs ever, this is a work in progress. Thinking of it this way has been helpful to me.
