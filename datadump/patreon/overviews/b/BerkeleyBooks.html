    "summary": "A bookstore is a natural habitat for book nerds to meet, and for writers to read their work. Over the last few years at Berkeley Books I\u2019ve expanded that idea, and host art exhibitions, tiny concerts, dance performances, staged readings, and the occasional film screening. I believe sharing a space freely with artists and writers is vital. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I specialize in providing excellent used and rare books in English at below market prices, the shop has also become a center for the arts. Berkeley Books is proof that a rebel bookstore/dedicated art space can \nresist wave after wave of market forces, and persist in offering a free \nspace for artists to exhibit or perform their work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017, I hosted over 60 events in the bookshop. In 2018, I intend \nto keep up the pace and the ethos of Berkeley Books. Artists always keep\n 100% of the work they sell at the shop. When musicians pass the hat, \nor a painter sells some of her work, they keep all proceeds. These days, opening the shop every day feels like a small act of resistance to extreme capitalism. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe shop is run as a not-for-profit and I volunteer all my time. Where possible, I pick up the \nslack when sales are down. As I cannot do that indefinitely, I turn to Patreon as a way for people who want to contribute to the shop, be a patron of all this art but cannot drop by and buy books, to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to help me support a vibrant, if tiny, American cultural center in the heart of Paris, here\u0027s a way to do so. All contributions can be converted to store credit, gift certificates, or even funding books for students with few resources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the moment, I\u0027ve chosen the option for monthly support. All proceeds will help with the expenses associated with the upkeep of the space: maintenance costs, repainting, improving wheelchair accessibility, and if we can do that, I can start paying the artists who have generously shared their work with us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe intro video is a fine example of what I do with the space. Just last month, Herenui Crawford and Cody B. came to Berkeley Books and serenaded the crowd.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks very much for supporting independent bookstores/art spaces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
