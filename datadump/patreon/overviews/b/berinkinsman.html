What they mean is, report on the things that we\u2019re told to be afraid of. Tired of living in fear, I\u2019m saying something. This is not normal. It is not right. These things are not inevitable. HUBRIS is a zine about the struggles we face in the modern world. This is cultural horror.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/15461990\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Why HUBRIS?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e covers my reasons for selecting this name for a personal zine, beyond the obvious.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/15477726\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Cultural Horror?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e covers how I\u2019m defining the overall theme of the zine, and how it connects the disparate articles and essays together.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/15477739\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a Zine, Not a Blog?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e goes into my rationale for choosing this strange and old-fashioned format, and the advantages that I perceived to go along with it. These articles are available for free to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Get\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA new issue of zine every month! Each issue will be a minimum of 32 pages long, possibly longer. All patrons can download the electronic version of the zine and participate in the community. You\u2019ll also get my thanks, no matter what amount you pledge! Your patronage lets me know that this is worth doing, above and beyond the fun that I have doing it. At higher levels, you\u2019ll get a direct \u003cem\u003ethank \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e in the credits of the next issue.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Often You\u2019re Charged\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatronage is per issue, not per month. When you first sign up as a HUBRIS patron, you will not be charged immediately. You will be charged when the next issue after sign up comes out, at which point you will have access to past content. This also means that if something happens and I do not release an issue due to illness, alien invasion, or zombie apocalypse, you will not be charged.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe goal is to release a new issue on the final Wednesday of each month. I will post a notice several days prior to the release of the next issue as a reminder. Patreon charges appear at midnight Pacific time. It may take up to 72 hours for the payment to process, and Patreon will send you an email to let you know if your payment has been accepted or declined. I never see your payment information \u2014 you pay Patreon, and Patreon pays me.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Need You Patronage\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve run a blog off-and-on since 1996, before the term \u201cblog\u201d had even been coined. At various points they\u2019ve been successful, and things have waxed and waned along with the popularity of the medium. Blog posts are ephemeral, though. They matter for a couple of days at most, down to a few minutes or not at all. A zine is a more fixed thing. It has a structure and a context that\u2019s appealing. The formality of it, as opposed to the casual and often rushed natural of blogging, means that I need to up my game. Patronage brings an accountability that a free blog post can\u2019t.\u003cbr\u003eAnd honestly, I can always use a little extra money. My wife and I are middle-aged people who live like graduate students, because Katie is a grad student. I supports the household as a writer. Most of what I write, outside of this zine, centers on creative writing advice and tabletop roleplaying material. I\u2019m trying to diversify from those niche markets into, well, other niche markets. Every bit helps.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Berin Kinsman\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBerin Kinsman is a writer, indie publisher, and entrepreneur.
