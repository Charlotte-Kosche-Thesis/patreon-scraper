In our everyday life Sofie is studying to become a doctor, and Mads is studying to become a teacher. Otherwise we are both DGI (badminton) consultants, and works primarely with coaching kids and adults, but we\u0027re also helping several clubs around Denmark to become even better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we doing this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe wanted to make inspirational videos and tutorials for badminton-players that don\u0027t have the access to coaching and thereby no access to improve their game. So! - we began uploading a variety of videos - and then things went fast!\u003cbr\u003eWe got motivated by an amazing community, who requested for us to make this Patreon profile. So we did :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you become a patreon, you will get \u003cem\u003e\u0027\u003cstrong\u003eexclusive access\u003c/strong\u003e\u0027\u003c/em\u003e to the backstage of our project.

Camera equipment, editing software, company software, car, website costs, and so on... We must work a lot to make sure that this is sustainable, which is time and energy (physically) consuming. \u003cbr\u003eWe could use this time to create better content etc. Direct funding is just way more sustainable than anything else.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we had enough pledge, we will be able to spent more time on filming and creating videos by upgrading our equipment (especially camera), use more time on creating content and help people reach their full potential as badminton players.\u003cbr\u003eRight now, we are just quite limited on time\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
