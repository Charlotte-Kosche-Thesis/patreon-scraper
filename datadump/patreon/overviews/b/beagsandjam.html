Over time, different people have voiced their desire to donate to us and have asked where they could do so. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe love doing this stuff, and we want and hope to continue entertaining you guys for a long time. That the people who enjoy our content are kind and generous enough to want to give support financially is incredible to us, and this page, set up years ago, was the first time we decided to accept that generosity.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs we created this page, and as we began to accept PayPal Donations and recieve Twitch subscriptions, there\u0027s one thing we wanted to always make clear - \n\u003cstrong\u003ewe\u0027re grateful to anyone who wants to support us, but we never want to force or incentivize that support.\u003c/strong\u003e Nobody should feel like they \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e to donate to us. Patreon\u0027s design is to offer rewards for each pledge tier like Kickstarter, but we never wanted to put anyone in a position where they\u0027re forced to pledge to us just to get certain rewards - \u003cstrong\u003ewhat we offered in return were gags and tokens of gratitude, not products we were trying to sell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs a result, setting up this page years ago took a great deal of brainstorming to figure out the right kind of rewards to offer. We tried to settle on things that were fun and desirable for our fans without being too valuable. But ultimately, the strangest thing about setting up this page is nobody really wanted any of it. Few people ever went to the trouble of claiming their rewards. Few people sent in their addresses to receive physical items, few sent in their nickname choices, and even at the high tiers that we thought would exist just as a gag, few wanted to receive any of the large set of rewards we\u0027d laid out for them. They didn\u0027t want any of the things we were offering. They just pledged to support us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving learned that, as we switch away from primarily focusing on XCOM, a reboot and simplification of this page has been a long time coming. We\u0027re doing away with the pretense of rewards and simply allowing this page to exist as what the vast majority of you have used it as - as a place to pledge and support us without looking for anything tangible in return.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhether you\u0027re here to pledge, or just out of curiosity - thank you for your support. Nothing is more valuable than the kind words you give us, the feedback and encouragement you send, and the time you\u0027re generous enough to give us when you tune in to our stream or watch one of our videos.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/WSmj6Eh.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
