    "summary": "I\u2019ve been published in the commercial marketplace all my\nadult life (newspapers, magazines, websites, radio, a collection of short\nstories and a forthcoming novel).  But I\nhave recently \u2013 in just the last two years \u2013 made my greatest breakthroughs\nwith works developed outside the marketplace, and even outside commerce.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTwo books of fables that have become sacred\ngifts which cannot be bought;  \u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eA collection of Fairy Tales for Adults that has\nsaved my soul;  \u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eA ritual for a whimsical community;  \u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eA poetic constitution for a collective of\nartists;  \u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eA historical conspiracy for a secret event that\ncould only be given as a gift \u2026 \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2026These are things I could not have imagined writing just a\nfew short years ago, and they beckon me towards extraordinary new horizons of\nmy art.  This must be cultivated \u2013 and\nthat cultivation works best when it happens on its own terms, instead of trying\nto fit a market.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou, my patrons - my community - will help me achieve that:  you\u2019ll give me the freedom to follow the work\nI am called to do (instead of what I can get published this month) and see where\nit leads me.  Every meaningless freelance\nassignment you keep me from having to do will be time and energy reinvested\ninto writing that is meaningful, and a building block to something profound.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn gratitude, I\u2019ll share with you the work that I\u2019ll produce\nas practice \u2013 the writing that I create both for its own sake and to hone my\ncraft.  Essays on culture and politics,\nnew bar columns in the style of my much loved bar column for the SF Weekly\n(\u201cDistillations\u201d), a new fable each month, and even a look at some of the most\ninteresting experimental work I create \u2026 the seeds of my creative unconscious \u2026\nweek after week.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd as I take the time you\u2019ve given me and the practice I\u2019ve\nput it towards to produce works worthy of everything I have, I\u2019ll share that\nprocess with you too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI believe amazing things are on the horizon as I take\ncontrol of my artistic life, stepping out from the marketplace and towards\ntruth and beauty for their own sake.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI could not be more grateful for your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
