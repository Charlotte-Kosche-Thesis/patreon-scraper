Settlements are scattered across the map, wherever \nthey can find a patron to protect them or a hidden cove to shelter from \nthe storms. Spirits demand obeisance before one can clear land for a \nfarm. Demons ask for a drop of blood every day or they will tear down \nthe town\u2019s walls. A goddess protects her chosen people from the perils \nof the open desert in return \u2013 but no one else.\u003cbr\u003eVailia is the \ncenter of  the world. Not out of arrogance does the city claim this, but\n as established fact \u2013 in all the thousands of miles of land and sea it \nhas explored, no other nation dares brave the untamed wilds and storms \nof the open ocean. Its merchants bring together distant lands, carrying \nnews across the known world despite the risks.\u003cbr\u003eNatalie Rowena is \none such adventurous soul.

Along \ntheir travels, they\u0027ll run into the Universal Trading Concern - an \nattempt to bind together nations and people with a spell woven of \ncommerce and power.

But before she can \nprotect anything she needs to come to terms with herself \u2013 and find a \nreason to keep living.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003eThe game includes adult content, both graphics (coming soon) and text.
