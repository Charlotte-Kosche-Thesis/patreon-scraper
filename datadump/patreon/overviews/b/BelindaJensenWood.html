    "summary": "Hello, Art Patrons! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Belinda Jensen Wood and my passion is painting. I attended Missouri State University as an art major, and enjoyed trying\n all different mediums. While attending college, I worked for two years \nas the student director for the MSU Student Exhibition Center, an art \ngallery featuring shows by art majors and faculty. My duties included \nscheduling shows, assisting with installations, public relations and \nmanagement of the gallery employees. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work with acrylics on stretched canvas. My favorite subjects are landscapes and oceanscapes. I especially enjoy using a lot of color in my paintings. My style is more impressionistic than realistic. I find that I put a lot of emotion into my paintings. There are times with my emotions are so close to the surface that I find myself painting how I feel, which usually results in a more abstract painting full of shapes, strong brush strokes and a contrasting colors. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003ePlease visit my new website \u003ca href=\"http://www.bluemoonacrylicpaintings.com\"\u003ehttp://www.belindajensenwood.com\u003c/a\u003e to see photos of my paintings and links to \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003ewhere I sell prints.
