    "summary": "You are enabling lifelong musicians to steer their own craft towards the independent artminded goals that can only come to fruition with your help. \u00a0We want to make sounds you\u0027ve never heard, and come to your town and play them for you. \u00a0We already run at a VERY low overhead, and do not live beyond our means. \u00a0To exsist at the level in the marketplace we know is worthy of our songs - touring, merchandise, promotion, etc. - we need to expand our operation. \u00a0We make music that changes lives, empowers people, brings them together, but most miportantly - FEEL ALIVE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will NEVER use patron funding for anything but the musicians and the music. \u00a0We will not pass money to promotional engines nor record labels. \u00a0We are creating our own corner of the industry with your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout us:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight out of the gate we found a common tongue between us. With that language in hand, we fabricate music we want to hear that we aren\u0027t hearing elsewhere.  Each track tells a story on a new journey in familiar scenery. To us, having fun sounds like this... ...Thanks for checking us out, and \u003cbr\u003elet us poke your ears and brain a wee bit, hopefully we find our way into your heart, and deeper into the soul.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout Barrett:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBorn north of Chicago, Barrett began studying piano at the \u003cbr\u003etender age of 3. He picked up baritone, then trombone, \u003cbr\u003etuba, bass guitar, and then upright bass in elementary \u003cbr\u003e\u0026amp; high schools. Barrett says he revolted by teaching \u003cbr\u003ehimself guitar. This led to him lashing back at himself more, \u003cbr\u003eeventually learning banjo, mandolin, saxophone \u0026amp; fiddle \u003cbr\u003eenough to not annoy. As if this wasn\u2019t enough, Barrett fought \u003cbr\u003eoff being a musician entirely and dove head first into sound \u003cbr\u003eafter deciding NOT to become an artist/illustrator. Learning \u003cbr\u003ethe gear, studio, \u0026amp; then live engineering, he became \u003cbr\u003edangerous in the sense that he knows too much, yet still \u003cbr\u003eadmits to knowing nothing. Years of mixing on stage for the biggest names in the industry, and in \u003cbr\u003estudios for rookies, turned Barrett into \u003cbr\u003esomething else, a collage of sound and\u003cbr\u003emusic. Barrett calls himself is a \"tonologist\" and \"songsmithy\"\u003cbr\u003eand can \u2018do it all\u2019 in a sense that he clearly knows his boundries as a player and producer. When he can\u0027t, he finds others that can. \u00a0In turn he\u0027s surrounded himself with some of the finest friends and talent. \u00a0This \u201cHidden Agenda\u201d of his, well... ...that\u0027s for you to decide on...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
