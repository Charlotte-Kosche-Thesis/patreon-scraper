    "summary": "My name is Jerry Berg (aka. \u003cstrong\u003eBarnacules\u003c/strong\u003e) and I produce Barnacules Nerdgasm on YouTube. It\u0027s a channel that focuses on anything nerdy including 3D Printing, Virtual Reality, Unboxings, Reviews, Gaming, Tutorials \u0026amp; much more! Unfortunately, YouTube ad revenue has been decreasing to the point where creators like myself can no longer support their craft and so many people are now using Ad Blockers without white listing sites they enjoy which further reduces revenue generated. For this reason I\u0027m turning to my most hardcore viewers that enjoy what I do to give a little support to help take up the slack and hopefully free me from the YouTube juggernauts that try to control me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6qR9SJUe_R0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge will help me generate a more reliable and dependable revenue from my full time job as a content creator and live streamer so I can continue to make great content for you and support my family so my wife stops trying to make me go back to work.

Also, I would love to contribute to my 401k retirement and my sons college fund which are things that have been neglected in the down turn of YouTube over the last 2 years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/URfMhFl9R1Q\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration and I look forward to growing my Patreon and giving you bonuses and rewards for helping me out and above all else create much better content since I won\u0027t have to spend my days figuring out how to generate alternative revenue and can focus on the content itself which is what this all started as in the first place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b2Dl04h_Qn0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a Discord server so please don\u0027t by shy and come have a chat with me and other like minded people.
