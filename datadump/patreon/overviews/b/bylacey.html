My current project is a comic named \"Lies Within\", which started in early May of 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLies Within follows the story of Lysander Farrokh, a 28-year old freeloader whose life changes drastically after getting possessed by a wendigo spirit. With the help of his best friend and neighbour, Simon Isadore, Lysander learns to navigate this tumultuous world of supernatural beings and the war they\u0027re fighting against a growing vampire threat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://lieswithincomic.com\"\u003elieswithincomic.com\u003c/a\u003e -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tapas.io/series/lieswithin\"\u003eTapas mirror\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lgEAixg.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon? Patreon allows me to invest loads of time into not only my fledgling comic, but other illustration work as well. Someday, it would be great to do this full time! That\u0027s where you guys come in! Your pledges allow me to set aside valuable time to draw, host my website, and keep my hardware and software up to date in order to keep creating! As this community grows, I\u0027ll be able to update Lies Within more frequently, create more full illustrations, and upgrade my tools, working toward my ultimate goal of drawing as my primary occupation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking a look at my page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ORfPWrz.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
