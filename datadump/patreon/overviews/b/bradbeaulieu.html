The good news is that my writing has gained a lot of traction over the past few years, and things are looking good in the coming years as well. So\u00a0I\u0027m looking at this change in fortune as the universe telling me I need to start writing full-time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://quillings.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Why-a-Patreon.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who don\u0027t know, writing is a spectacularly unsteady source of income.\u00a0I have a number of books written and more under contract that I\u0027ll write over the next several years, but there\u0027s no guarantee that those things are going to provide steady income in the coming years. In fact, it\u0027s pretty safe to say that it \u003cem\u003ewon\u0027t\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0be steady income.

Even the books under contract aren\u0027t guaranteed. The publishers could drop them, or ask for a different book from me, creating a large gap and a potential drop in income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027ve decided to start a Patreon as a way of providing more stability. The primary goal of the Patreon would be to create more fiction, to share some of it early with backers, and to provide writing tips along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://quillings.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/What-you-get.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrimarily, I\u0027m hoping to write faster. And if I\u0027m able to focus on writing exclusively, I\u0027m confident I\u0027ll be able to do that. The cool thing about this Patreon is that there are several ways you can benefit beyond having more of my books in stores.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the cooler ones is that I\u0027ll be providing sneak peeks of my current writing projects. In the rewards section you\u0027ll see some levels that will get you a look at some of my in-progress\u00a0writing, and more levels that will see you getting the print books (ARCs and author copies) well before they\u0027re published.\u00a0I\u0027m also going to do a few mini-projects that I\u0027ve been hoping to get into but haven\u0027t because, well, day job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really enjoy talking about the ins and outs of writing, what makes it tick, how and why we react to it, and so on. In that vein, I\u0027m going to start working on short writing videos that show how I write, some insights into writing technique, and that will lead to more extensive talks that I\u0027ll occasionally give online or in person at various events. I may even have an interview or two.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://quillings.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Whats-my-plan.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the short term, I have \u003cem\u003eA Veil of Spears\u003c/em\u003e, the third book in the Song of the Shattered Sands series, to finish. I\u0027ll also be editing the second book, \u003cem\u003eWith Blood Upon the Sand\u003c/em\u003e. Beyond that, I\u0027ve recently sold\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://quillings.com/2016/03/24/the-days-of-dust-and-ash-sells-to-daw-books-in-a-three-book-deal/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Days of Dust and Ash\u003c/a\u003e, a new sci-fi thriller series with a lot of dark, fantastic overtones. And then I have the last three books in the Shattered Sands series. Those aren\u0027t currently under contract, but I hope they will be sometime next year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be writing a few short stories along the way as well, and at some point, I\u0027m going to gather up a small series of Shattered Sands shorts and sell them as a collection.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus, I\u0027ll be generating the various videos and writing tips along the way, and eventually rolling those thoughts up into how-to articles, longer videos, and/or seminars.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://quillings.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Patreon-Goals.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m setting only one goal of $2,000 for this Patreon. Why $2,000 specifically? The short answer is health insurance. That is the rough budget for health insurance (medical, dental, and vision) in Wisconsin for a family of four. This particular cost will skyrocket to become the single, largest expenditure I\u0027ll have for my family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause my health insurance was subsidized in the past, it wasn\u0027t nearly as much of an expense as it will be in the future. Not that it was \u003cem\u003echeap\u003c/em\u003e, but the swing from employer-provided insurance to private is pretty staggering. So if I can get that covered, I feel very confident I can keep the writing moving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShould I be so fortunate as to reach this primary goal, I\u0027ll set up additional goals to get you more cool stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, let\u0027s get started and see where we land. Thank you all in advance!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
