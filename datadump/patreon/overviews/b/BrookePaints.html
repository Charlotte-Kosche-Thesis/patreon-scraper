    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eThe first time I painted with oils I knew this\u00a0is what I was meant to do the rest of my life. Everything about oil paint resonates with me. As a person who relishes corporeal experiences,\u00a0the olfactory delight of linseed oil and the visual\u00a0richness of glistening pigments intoxicates me.\u00a0As an artist who approaches the easel with only\u00a0a  silhouette of an idea, the range of oil paint (from translucent glazes to opaque, juicy passages)\u00a0inspires the spontaneity and experimentation\u00a0that is so essential to my creative process.\u00a0When paint stays wet for several days,\u00a0anything becomes possible.\u00a0Brushstrokes can be manipulated,\u00a0scraped off, or remixed into new colors.\u00a0In this flexible state, art becomes more present, more capable of capturing the subtle changes\u00a0of mood and emotion. Oil painting makes me fearless in this knowing.\u00a0Oil painting brings me closer to myself.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge to support my art is really a \"layaway program\" where every dollar pledged goes towards a \"future purchase\"\u00a0of an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://brookepaints.com/original-art\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eoriginal painting\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://brookepaints.com/giclee-prints\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egiclee print\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://brookepaints.com/services\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecommissioned work\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://brookepaints.com/fine-art-cards\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efine art card\u003c/a\u003e, or whatever artwork your heart desires.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll monies raised through this Patreon campaign go towards the purchase of materials (paints, canvases, gesso, varnish, brushes, etc.), pay studio rent (including heat/ac, storage, and insurance), supplement jury fees for exhibits/competitions, help with the transportation and crating costs to send art to galleries/museums, and other expenses incurred by running an art business.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI urge you to look at the paintings I was creating just\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://brookepaints.com/sac\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e5 years ago\u003c/a\u003e to witness the vertical growth of my \u00a0work.
