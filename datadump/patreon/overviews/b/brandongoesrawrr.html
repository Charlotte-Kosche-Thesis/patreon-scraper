    "summary": "Hey,\nwhat\u0027s up guys?!! My name\u2019s Brandon GoesRawrr and you\u2019re most likely part of the most magical family on the internet, the Brandoneers!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m\na HUGE lover of ALL things Disney! Disney movies, shows, parks, theories,\ncollectibles, Disneybounding, and FOOD!! You name it! Really, I\u0027m in love with the magical,\nfantasy world in which Disney allows me to escape to! I visit Disney every single week, I love to Disneybound, and I\u2019m fascinated with the many different magical aspects Disney has to offer! Oh, I also have a bit of a shopping and eating problem\nwhen I go to the parks\u2026 All of which I just LOVE to showcase on my YouTube\nchannel every single Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for your personal enjoyment!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYouTube has finally given me the outlet to express my love for Disney as well as find people like me who share in the same love and who are a part of one big Disney community! The Brandoneers! This\nlast year has shown me many\npeople share similar feelings I have, whether these feelings be personal to me\nor my fascination with Disney. With my videos, I try to embrace these feelings\nand provide a place where us Disney lovers can all come to have fun and share in the fandom together! I also intend to give people a safe place\nwhere everyone can feel accepted for the incredible and unique people they are. One of the characteristics I love about the Brandoneers is the love, encouragement, and support we show one another! Through my fun vlogs at Disney, hauls, Disneybounds, and sometimes a\nbit of a heart to heart, I hope to continue to grow a positive community where\neveryone can feel welcomed and accepted!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo\u2026 Why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nwant to continue to make the best content I possibly can for YOU!!

That\u2019s where you come in! See, these\nvideos tend to take a bit of funding to create. With Patreon being the ongoing crowdfunding\nsite it is, I hope to be able to achieve that funding! I hope to use the funds\nto continue making the content you know and love, as well as creating bigger\nand better content in the future! Can we say, \u201cinternational parks\u201d?!!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow much do I have to donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nABSOLUTELY\nNOTHING!!! I can\u2019t stress this enough! Just the fact that you are as supportive\nas you are, have taken the time to read this, and watch my videos means the\nabsolute WORLD to me! Now, becoming a patron is a whole other story. The donation\namount is completely up to you! One dollar would mean so much more to me than\nyou know! To help paint a picture, 5 dollars from 5 people would be enough for\nme to do a \u201cTOP 5 FOODS UNDER 5 DOLLARS\u201d video! Yeah! Crazy, right?!! But, like\nI said, just the fact that you watch my videos and support me enough to read\nall of this is more than I ever expected!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank You.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank\nyou for watching my videos, thank you for taking the time to read this, and\nthank you for your consideration in helping me fund the best content I possibly\ncan create for you, the Brandoneers! Everything you do for me means so much! I feel so grateful\nto call you my family and to be a part of such a loving community! Thank\nyou for everything! \u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
