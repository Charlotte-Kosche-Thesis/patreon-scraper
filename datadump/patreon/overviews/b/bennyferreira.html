    "summary": "Why. A very short word that asks for an explanation, when any explanation needs to be everything but short. Even the word \"explanation\" is kind of large. Anyway, back to the point. I am a very creative person. I tend to try every creative form I find, and add it to my collection of \"creative ways to do things\", but guess what: I do love origami, I love building things like furniture from pallets, I even love to cook and mix up the recipes creating new ones, but there are few creative processes that I enjoy and love as much as writing. For me writing is a way to create with no limits, you just need a piece of paper and a pen and you can start write and if the paper is over you can continue in the floor or the walls, and if the pen broke or something else you can even keep on writing in your mind (or take notes in the cellphone, that helps). But as all creative things is difficult, and a LOT more at the beginning, live just by your art, and in my country, Dominican Republic, it is also like that. Lets no get in details of publishing costs and other affairs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why I pledge to you for your support? So that you can help me become a writer in this phase of my life. Yes, I have a few years, I will never say how many, I usually celebrate 23 one year, and then 54 the other and then go to 17 the next one, I don\u0027t believe in ages or years, in what I believe is that through this website I can find people that can relate with my story, the one about somebody who wants to be something that haven\u0027t been yet because of circumstances but that truly believes that is never too late o dream or become your dreams in reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, I started working harder into being a writer like since three years ago. I started compiling my poems, and writing down ideas for new ones and I also had the magical opportunity to write theater, that is playwrights. And here is something more you should know about my writing style: I write for adults and children. No altogether, I mean my poems are for adults, but the playwrights I worked are for children, because I am a childish person who love those fantasy worlds and daydream about magic and transformations and everything like that, so writing for children is something that people who knows me say \"I do pretty well\". So what I want is to keep writing playwrights, poems, tales and anything that comes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is something else I need to tell you: I write (mostly) in spanish. Im not there yet like writing in english, even tough I have like a couple of poems in english, but part of my goals are to translate my tales and playwrights to english, so that many more people can enjoy them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a few goals in sight now: I want to publish my first book with a collection of my poems so far (for adults) as an ebook(with audiobook) and printed book; and also my first collection of children tales, the ones I want to become into playwrights later for children musicals. So I will be asking for your support to help me achieve this goals, and I will be very thankful in every possible way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your attention reading this. See you around!!!"
