Join us now at bakedwithlove.cf!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA \"Brief\" Foreword.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll start by talking a bit about myself. I\u0027m Kat. Sixteen year-old MtF lass with an unreasonable affinity for a game about clicking on cubes. Aside from that, I\u0027m pretty artsy, making illustrations, music, poetry, and performances with my community and school theaters. But, like I said, I spend a lot of time with Minecraft. I\u0027ve been through plenty of servers in my time, searching endlessly for an experience that was community driven and had a reason for me to stay there. Needless to say, I never found it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.planetminecraft.com/files/resource_media/screenshot/1748/2017-11-22-17-20-17-1512172104.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCredit to jorgenrorvik\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to try my own hand at creating a server. Not for money, not for power, but to create the experience I never saw in other places. A server I\u0027d want to join myself. A server that was player-centered and focused on making the play experience better for everyone, not just the staff who wanted power or the owner making money. I set out making the Bakery in September of 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.planetminecraft.com/files/resource_media/screenshot/1748/2017-11-01-16-01-33-1512172099.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCredit to NightZephyr\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe server opened in September 2017, a full year later, and was a place where people far and wide came not for its popularity or wide variety of minigames, but for the core values that made this game work in the first place: An engaging survival experience with a community of friends. We had a fantastic network of twelve players within the first month, and that number has dropped, risen, fallen, spiked, and all else in the months after. It\u0027s growing. Not steadily, not quickly, but it\u0027s growing much like any other community. With problems, with risks, with losses; but with no less gains, successes, and pleasures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does this have to do with money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNeedless to say, everything costs money anymore. That includes the many costs of creating a functional server and community. Hosting the server, retaining the domain, upgrading things, buying plugins and augments, and more and more and more! I originally came in with the ideal that players should never pay a cent, and that they should get the full experience free. I remained that way until I got more and more questions from players about how they could support the server financially. No prompting from me or the server, just pure kindness and willing to give to the greater good. That is what inspired this Patreon. Now, like I said, I wanted players to get the entire world at their fingertips without throwing money my way, and I intend to keep it that way. Patrons will get their benefits, but there is no power discrepancy between players.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.planetminecraft.com/files/resource_media/screenshot/1748/2017-12-02-23-47-06-1512276515.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCredit to AliceIsLost\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyone donating not only gets their rewards and my thanks, but they get something more. They get the knowledge and understanding that they are keeping the server growing and evolving. With only my own money, I can only go so far. Eventually, the cost of maintenance would exceed my capabilities. But with your help, we can go further than I ever expected. This is my dream, to run the community I could never find. If you\u0027re wanting to be a part of that community, that\u0027s fantastic already. But, those who are willing to go beyond and contribute not only their time but their finances are truly a cut above the rest. A cut that I give my full thanks to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSeriously. Thank you for being a part of the community, and thank you for giving in every way imaginable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll the images on this page are of community creations.
