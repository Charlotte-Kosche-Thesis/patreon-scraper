    "summary": "My name is Ben. I\u0027m an erotica writer and game maker. Primarily using Twine as a medium I\u0027ve made a few gay-themed games, the most notable of which is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theeroticledger.com/games/fuck_that_guy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFuck That Guy\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and more recently\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theeroticledger.com/games/gods.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGod(s)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to keep the bulk of all the content I create free for everyone, because I know what it\u0027s like to be broke and walled out of great stuff because creators need to eat. There\u0027s no perfect solution, but I think Patreon is a great first step. For a relatively low financial commitment you can help me make awesome stuff. I do have day job and a lot of that money goes back into my creations, but not having to rely on that income to produce content means that the process becomes a lot easier and less stressful. It gives me more time to create instead of having to pick up extra work just to fund new projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I lend my support?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are not a lot of people making exclusively or primarily gay content in games. There are a few notable and high quality examples, but we\u0027re a long way off from seeing anything near equal or even visible representation of work from a gay perspective. One of the most amazing things about Twine as a medium (though I\u0027m not restricting myself to only working in Twine going forward) is that it has helped democratize how interactive stories are told, but there are still a lot of different types of stories that haven\u0027t been made yet. When it comes to gay content, especially erotic content, I think I have quite a bit to say and with your help I intend to say it loudly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from good feelings and an unrivaled sense of accomplishment? Everyone who donates at least $3 will get access to finished games and the first crack at work that\u0027s hot off the press \u003cem\u003eat least a month before the general public. \u003c/em\u003eThe payment structure is per month*, which means that you\u0027ll donate toward my ongoing projects every month, but you can set limits on your account as you see fit. You can also donate a few more bucks a month for extras like personalized fiction and your very own game written and designed by me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.theeroticledger.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FCK-U.jpg\" style=\"width: 567px;\"\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, thank you so much in advance for even considering supporting me and my work. Being able to create and disseminate these little projects means a lot to me. Your support makes all this possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Ben.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*for the month of February, due to low progress from me on Patreon related projects, I\u0027ve changed the payments structure to \"per work\" so that patrons won\u0027t be charged for work I didn\u0027t even do.\u00a0"
