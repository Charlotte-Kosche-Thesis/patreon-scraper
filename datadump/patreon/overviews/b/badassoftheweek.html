    "summary": "Hey, my name is Ben Thompson, and I\u0027ve been writing Badass of the Week since April of 2004.\u00a0 I\u0027ve written seven books and hundreds of website and magazine articles where I take insane, awesome, and incredible true stories from history and try to tell them in a fun, enjoyable way that hopefully won\u0027t bore the hell out of you.\u00a0 Basically, it\u0027s the Cliff\u0027s Notes of history -- I read everything I can about a person or event and then condense it down to just the good parts (sex, drugs, murder, rock \u0027n roll, killing, destruction, etc.) and try to present it so it feels more like an action movie than a history text.\u00a0 I think history is really cool, and that you can tell a really awesome true-life story without actually changing any of the real history behind it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my website as a fun side hobby when I was bored at my regular day job, and I ran the website ad-free for about eight years.\u00a0 Eventually my site got enough traffic that I had to suck it up and start running ads to try and cover my hosting expenses, and while this new age of ad-blocking software is great for filtering annoying bullcrap off obnoxious clickbait websites, it\u0027s making it tough for me to break even on the fees at the moment.\u00a0 Honestly, I don\u0027t even care that much... I\u0027ll continue to do the site even if nobody ever goes to it, just because I love this stuff and I really enjoy doing this.\u00a0 But, hey, if you want to chip in a couple bucks and help support the site I really appreciate it., and to say thanks for helping me do this I\u0027m offering some rewards that I think are pretty cool.\u003cbr\u003e"
