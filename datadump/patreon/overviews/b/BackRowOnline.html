    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eMy name is Matthew Coker, a Christian, a husband, a father, and the founder of The Back Row, an online humor and healing ministry aimed at Christians who desire some daily encouragement and laughter - \u003ca href=\"http://www.backrowonline.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBackRowOnline.com\u003c/a\u003e. Our biggest draw is our podcast, The Back Row Baptist Podcast.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack Row Online launched as a ministry in 2014 and has created a lot of uplifting content aimed at Christians who are struggling or just need a smile to get through their day. Originally launched as a blog and a YouTube channel, our main focus since early 2016 has been the Podcast, which wrapped up it\u0027s first season in January of 2017 with 56 episodes and over 100,000 podcast downloads - a massively impressive first year! Season 2 launched on 2.28.17 and as of 6.5.17, we\u0027re already at 170,000+ podcast downloads, on our way to cracking 200k by the end of Summer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis podcast follows the same duality in mission as the ministry always has - humor and healing - providing a fun-filled episode on Tuesdays (with games, interesting topics about church culture, multiple guests, featured music, and more) and then offering a more focused, devotional-style, often recovery-themed episode on Fridays. I am the Ministry Leader of a Celebrate Recovery program in my church and we often discuss CR topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a stay-at-home Dad, funding this ministry has been a challenge and to move forward and grow, we\u0027re going to need the funding to get us there and keep us there. Hosting, equipment, advertising, and travel expenses are all things that we must take into account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e is a service that\u0027s become quite popular in online ministries. Artists and authors use it to get ongoing support directly from \ntheir followers, and in return, to offer some rewards to their patrons. \nIt\u0027s kinda like Kickstarter, but instead of one big push to fund a \nsingle project, it\u0027s a method of continuous support from patrons to a \ncontent creator whose work they believe in. It\u0027s a very cool model and I\n think it\u0027s the direction the world of content-creation is headed. It \nalso happens to be the way Christian ministries have been funded since \nthe early church.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you believe in what we\u0027re doing at The Back Row and want to \nhelp us continue to expand and improve our branches of ministry, you can sign up to be a patron of BackRowOnline.com, to donate as little or as much as you want every month to \nsupport our work. Even if it\u0027s just a dollar or two, every little bit \nsupports us directly and helps us bring Jesus to people through these \nunique and effective mediums. And there are some little rewards for \npatrons, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe get emails and messages constantly from people thanking us for our ministry and telling us how our devotionals, testimonies, videos, and podcasts have affected them, uplifted them, and encouraged them to take a new step in the right direction. Churches and recovery groups have been using our videos and devotionals as tools to encourage their members, and our funny stuff is shared constantly. The unique combination of placing equal importance on humorous content and devotional content is something that has resonated with people and affected them in ways we didn\u0027t expect, and it has been an amazing joy to be a part of it so far. I feel like we\u0027re just getting started. The Back Row is on track to become so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether or not you decide to \nbecome a patron, please know that we\u0027ll continue to produce content and \nit will always be free for everyone to come and enjoy. That\u0027s not going to \nchange. This is just an opportunity for you to support The Back Row, to help us branch out in more amazing ways, and become a part of this whole thing. If you \nbelieve in what The Back Row is doing, I would be extremely honored and humbled by \nyour support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cstrong\u003eMatt Coker\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cem\u003eMinistry Director\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
