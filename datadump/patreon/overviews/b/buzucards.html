It signifies that while Buzu cards can come from anywhere, they are all a part of the same system of collectivity and gameplay!

CUSTOMIZATION\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPossibly the most unique aspect of Buzu cards is that their designs come from YOU!

ACCESS, VERSATILITY and TURN TIME\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eInstead of collecting whatever trading card a company chooses to make, Buzu cards are custom-made by YOU!! I want the Buzu-verse to be an open-invitation for anyone to participate and contribute to the population! And unlike other standard services offering custom-made merchandize, Buzu cards are completed within hours - not weeks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e3.

EDUCATION\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBuzu Trading cards have been proven to be an effective behavior management tool for schools. Buzu cards featuring fantastic characters specifically designed to help students learn information relating to standardized tests are already in production.

That\u0027s why I will be holding a monthly drawing where a pledge of just $5 can get you a FREE custom-made Buzu card.
