     "about": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch3\u003eBrittany McQuinn is a Canadian East Coast singer/songwriter. Growing up in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Brittany chose to be involved in as many musical activities as possible. She was not raised in a musical household, and describes her earliest influences as \"Disney movie soundtracks, Nintendo games, and an incredible blues pianist that played weekly at my church.\" She began writing songs when she was 6, and would request that her father bring home blank cassettes from the studio where he worked so that she could record them. Brittany continued writing songs throughout her teenage years, often writing ten a month. She has now written over one thousand songs. \u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eBrittany lost her older brother in a car accident that she survived when she was three. Grief, loss, and how to live a life that began with exposure to trauma are one of the main themes of her debut album, written while she was a teen. In 2010, a local producer heard her music and pursued a production deal with her for a single and an album. They began recording in a basement studio and, due to flooding, finished the album in an apartment on the top floor of an Victorian-era home. This album, \"From Basements to Rooftops\" released October 2015 to a full house at a memorable concert in Fredericton. \u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCompeting against over 60 other artists from the East Coast of Canada and the U.S., Brittany reached the top 10 at the New Brunswick Talent Search competition in Fall 2015. Soon after, she began a mentorship with Rick Barker, Taylor Swift\u0027s original manager. She showcased at Canadian Music Week in Toronto May 2016. Brittany is now working on her second album while performing her first album live.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
