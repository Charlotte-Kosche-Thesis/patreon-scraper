My name is Wil and I am the solo-dolo\u00a0guy behind the idea for Best For Business. Growing up a major fan of WWE gave me a lot of opportunities to learn about pro-wrestling from afar. One day, I decided that I wanted to work for WWE too, and I went to Full Sail University and had the chance to work for WWE NXT just as it was becoming the phenomenon we know today.I worked in marketing, social media, ticket sales and venue relations, as well as any other area we needed to staff. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work at WWE NXT led me to an opportunity to work for WWE\u0027s Chief Brand Officer as their first professional intern and eventually a paid employee in the same role (anyone knows who the WWE Chief Brand Officer is?!). At WWE HQ, I learned a lot from (spoiler!) Stephanie McMahon and other senior staff while also originating the strategy to induct Connor The Crusher into the WWE Hall of Fame. (I\u0027ve never cried so hard in my life!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I don\u0027t work for WWE anymore, my vast knowledge as a life-long fan, a former employee, and a marketer and business-guy by trade gives me the chance to share my insights with a wider range of folks who love WWE, is that you?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile some of us might remember \"best for business\" as a phrase used by The Authority on television, there are some very real reasons why WWE typically does what is, \"best for business\" and I hope to share my insights with you all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy we\u0027re on Patreon\u003c/h3\u003eWhile ads are an easy fix, they don\u0027t give you, the reader, much value. In fact, ads are a pain in the ass when you\u0027re reading. We strategized around a number options, and ultimately landed with the idea that Patreon\u0027s platform would offer us the best opportunity to grow a dedicated audience and provide you guys a\u00a0real value!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
