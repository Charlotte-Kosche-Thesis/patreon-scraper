    "summary": "Hello! My name is Tony Bricky. I am an England-Based Traditional and 3D Artist. I use Blender 3D for the 3D aspect, primarily.\u00a0\u003ca target=\"_blank\"\u003eHere\u0027s some of my stuff!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created a Patreon due to the fact that I was pumping out art, and for a while it was my genuine passion, but after 3 years of doing the same thing, my ambition and passion grew for my 3D art. Problem is, the more ambition you have, the more Computer-consuming your models get. Currently I cannot afford to build a PC, I have saved up for a few years but not to a substantial amount. My models are getting bigger and better, to the point where I simply cannot work on them and I am reliant on others to texture them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, there\u0027s a program called Substance Painter. It\u0027s based on a dedicated GPU. With my current setup, it cannot run. And I want my models to look realistic and stunning, if you understand. Like I said, high ambitions, terrible tools.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donations will go toward things that would benefit the creation and the overall look of my art. Things such as Upgrades to my PC (I\u0027m stupidly using a GPU consuming render engine, Cycles, on a office PC of all things), and a Graphics Tablet, or alternatively, You could just donate for the sake of donating.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"What do you need an upgraded PC for?\" \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) For Rendering images at a (generally speaking) significantly faster rate. Currently I use CPU Rendering due to a lack of an actual dedicated GPU.\u003cbr\u003e2) For Compositing in Photoshop/Blender. To make images look nicer.\u003cbr\u003e3) For (potentially) video editing. I would love to show others how to use Blender. It\u0027s such a great program with a stupidly high learning curve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEither way, If you do decide to donate, or even check this page out, I appreciate it greatly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
