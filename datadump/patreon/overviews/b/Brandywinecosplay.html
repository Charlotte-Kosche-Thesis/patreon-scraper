    "summary": "Hello,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Brandy, but I guess I\u0027m more well known as Brandywine Cosplay! I\u0027m a 25 year old photographer who enjoys dressing up as my favorite characters like the nerd I am. I went to my first con, Colossalcon, in 2011 and I dressed up as a character and didn\u0027t even know the term \"cosplay\" yet. Until last year I only attended Colossalcon once a year with some friends. However, over the past year I\u0027ve started cosplaying more often and attending more cons. I realized that cosplaying, like photography, is something I am very passionate about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am self taught at sewing and prop-making\u00a0and I\u0027m still figuring a lot out as I go, but I believe learning new things is half the fun of cosplay! I have learned so much in the past year about myself and cosplay. I made my first props and cosplay completely from scratch and it was so rewarding! I\u0027ve also been able to make some amazing friends who I have collaborated with for group cosplay\u00a0and some who I hope to collaborate with in the future!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWith the help from my patrons I hope to be able to produce more content than I normally would be able to. I also hope to produce higher quality cosplays and eventually take on the challenge of trying to make armor and larger builds! By no means do you need to feel obligated to become a patron! This is just for people who want to support me and get some extra content and such! So thank you for taking the time to read my ramblings and I can\u0027t wait to share future projects with you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou can find me on Instagram, CosplayAmino, and Facebook all @Brandywinecosplay\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRULES:\u003cbr\u003e- I will not be doing any shoots or anything that are over pg-13 \u003cbr\u003e(So nothing beyond lingerie/boudoir)\u003cbr\u003e- I reserve the right to block anyone who says anything inappropriate, rude, or \u00a0sexually suggestive. This includes asking for other types of pictures...you know what i mean...\u003cbr\u003e- Do not be rude to other Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInfo about reward shipments:\u003cbr\u003eIf you are in a tier that is to receive\u00a0prints, stickers, access\u00a0to my snapchat, \u00a0etc. your package will be sent out/ Snapchat access will be given after Patreon has confirmed that your card has been charged on the first of the following month! If you have any questions please feel free to message me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Also after I start getting patrons I hope to be able to add more content and rewards to various tiers as well as higher tiers!)\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
