    "summary": "Hello all, I\u0027m \u003cem\u003eBubbajack\u003c/em\u003e, a fan fiction writer going by the same handle here as I go by on Fanfiction.net. My profile and works can be found here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3235503/bubbajack\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.fanfiction.net/u/3235503/bubbajack\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow before I ask\u00a0anyone to toss their hard earned cash my way, I\u0027ll tell you a bit about myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBio:\u003c/strong\u003e I was born premature at 26 weeks to a cocaine addicted mother weighing only 1lb 10oz. Due to a stroke I had at birth, I am partially paralyzed on my left side and have Cerebral Palsy. By the Grace of God, I was put up for adoption and adopted into a loving family three months later. Yet as time past I had to go through various surgeries because of my conditions. For the first ten years of my life, I even suffered from seizures. Thankfully that is no longer an issue. Yet as I went through high school my classmates would complain about how \u0027unfair their lives were\u0027 and how \u0027tough\u0027 they\u0027ve got it. All I could think to myself, though I did emphasized was, \u003cem\u003e\u0027You can walk perfectly fine, play sports, swim,\u00a0and do all manner of other things I can\u0027t. But you don\u0027t hear me complaining do you?\u0027\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0After awhile, I\u00a0began to feel as if I didn\u0027t fit in anywhere even though, looking back on it, I was rather well liked. At the time, I felt like an exotic animal caged in a zoo. Or a puzzle piece that just didn\u0027t go into this\u00a0grand design\u00a0called Life. Yet, as they continued to complain and I found myself growing frustrated for they didn\u0027t realize just how good there lives were in comparison to others. Annoyance became anger. In anger and growing distain for those around me, I dropped out of school in my tenth year. For awhile I was as angry as I was directionless not realized until I left that though I hated it, school gave me direction, a schedule, and purpose...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen I found fan fiction. I found a vent for the growing frustration I felt in my life, due to being unable to do all the things people regularly took for granted. I am NOT telling you this to take pity on me and throw a couple of bucks my way every month. In fact, I would be insulted if that was the case. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can hear some of you saying, \u003cem\u003e\u0027Then why tell us this?\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI tell you this so you can understand where I\u0027m coming from and why I write what I do. I through various experiences in my life am more emotionally mature than age would suggest. As such I focus on certain themes in my works These include by are not limited to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCosmicisim-\u003c/strong\u003e A favorite one of mine pioneered by one of my favorite authors of all time, H.P. Lovecraft. For those of you who don\u0027t know, many stories put the focus on humans. This is the opposite of that. Where we are nothing but apes on a spinning blue dot in the cosmos, incapable of fathoming with our primitive intellect what truly exists beyond the veil of stars or even in the depths of our own oceans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHarem Romance-\u003c/strong\u003e I, for reasons even I cannot\u00a0fully\u00a0comprehend, have\u00a0I never really understood the appeal of the whole Nuclear Family idea. It just seems so bland and ordinary to me. Plus, just writing about two people falling in love get\u0027s boring and predictable after awhile.\u00a0So I choose to spice things up by not writing traditional romance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMagic and Science Fiction- These two things go hand in hand as far as I\u0027m concerned. For as a wise man once said, \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" I am of a like mind. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eComics, Anime, Books, and RPG\u0027s- \u003c/strong\u003eFor awhile there, I went on a comic reading kick. For the first six months I was out of school I watched...well, a lot of anime, and I have always been a bibliophile and fan of RPG\u0027s like The Elder Scrolls, Warhammer 40k,\u00a0and pen and paper D\u0026amp;D.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I set up a Patreon page-\u003c/strong\u003e Writing fan fiction doesn\u0027t pay anything, and my SSDI checks pay\u00a0only\u00a0a few hundred dollars\u00a0a month. Hardly enough for someone to live on.\u00a0So I hope that by setting up this account, I can earn a little something doing work I actually enjoy doing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSchedule-\u003c/strong\u003e This is what things are looking like, for the moment anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwice Inheritor-\u003c/strong\u003e A My Hero Academia x Fate/Stay Night x Rick and Morty x Highschool DXD fic with elements of other universes added due to multiversal shenanigans. My primary focus at the moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWrought in Iron-\u003c/strong\u003e A BtVS fic (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Includes elements of Ironman, LotR, and Fate/Stay Night.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRouge Trader-\u003c/strong\u003e This fic. Yet another BtVS fic. It\u0027s going to be a very, very long term thing for me. I could see myself completing several other stories before this is finished if it ever is. As that\u0027s the beauty and the horror of it. There are infinite possibilities with this story meaning it could seemingly have no end. So I\u0027ll work on it sporadically.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRemnants Strongest Hunter-\u003c/strong\u003e A RWBY crossover fic with Nioh and various sh\u014dnen anime elements. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn closing, if you choose to contribute, I thank you kindly in advance. Even earning a couple of bucks a month would mean someone likes my work enough to pay for it. I thank you for your time if you actually read my sob story of a life, and hope you enjoy my work, regardless if you pay or not. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Bubbajack\u003cbr\u003e"
