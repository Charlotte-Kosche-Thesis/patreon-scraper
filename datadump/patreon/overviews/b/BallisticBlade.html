And we\u0027ve done quite a bit. Shot 2 features for clients and hundreds of other videos.....But we can do a lot more.\u00a0 Like mini-major studio more...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.ballisticblade.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Company-profile.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are one of the founders of the Austin Action Fest that will begin this year in August.\u00a0 We have already shot 2 feature films for others and we\u0027re working on our own first film.\u00a0 We have shot 1 web series.\u00a0 We are writing our second feature film.\u00a0 All that was accomplished with basically no financial help.\u00a0 We can make something out of nothing. Take a look at the video below which we shot in 4 hours under duress.\u00a0 Give us a little something and we\u0027ll make magic.\u00a0 Three companies have sponsored our projects with in kind donations and that has been helpful, but what we need is you.\u00a0 Your financial support, your likes and your shares!!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It always comes down to time and money.\u00a0 We find spend one to get one.\u00a0 Shooting these shorts and features takes both! We have waited a long time to do things this way but recent changes have led us to believe NOW is the time!\u003cbr\u003e1.This is the fight time to be a compact and aggressive film company.\u00a0 The opportunities are out there....for now.\u00a0 Unless Hollywood finds a way to recalibrate.\u003cbr\u003e2.\u00a0 People are looking for projects with diversity and that\u0027s basically all we do.\u00a0 Multi ethnic/cultural projects that of course still typically focus on action.\u00a0 If we do it right, bigger organizations will take notice.\u00a0 Even if they don\u0027t, as long as you guys have our backs, we\u0027re good.\u003cbr\u003e3. There are a multitude of platforms to assist us in doing this.\u00a0 Tugg, VHX, Distribber, and a host of resources online to help in the distribution process make this way more feasible.\u00a0 Oh, and sites like Patreon to help us connect with current fans and potentially new ones. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we are asking for your help with this.\u00a0 Join us in making this content!\u00a0 Partner with Ballistic Blade Entertainment.\u00a0 Know in advance about all the projects that are coming out.\u00a0 Be in some of them!\u00a0 The features.
