    "summary": "Thanks so much for making your way to our Patreon page! Are you a time starved Bible reader, pastor or ministry\nprofessional? Who isn\u2019t these days? Most people don\u2019t have a decade to study the historical,\ngeographical and archaeological context of the Bible like I have had the\nprivilege to pursue.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eIf you can listen to a podcast, you can begin to study\nand apply the Bible in new ways!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eKnowing more about the\ncontext of the Bible is like going from \u201cblack and white\u201d to \u201cliving color\u201d\nwhen you read the text.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eKnowing more about the\nBible\u2019s original audience allows us to better translate the Bible\u2019s original\napplication for our world today\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eWhen we read the text\nwithout cultural context we can miss important details that change the meaning\nof the text.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eReading and applying the\nBible contextually helps us live better today!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe hardest thing about understanding the Bible in its original\ncontext is knowing where to start! When you\u2019re faced with getting that next\nsermon done or trying to finish up your study for small group, who has time to\ncheck the atlas or look for additional resources? What I\u2019ve found though, is that when\nyou enter into the ancient world of the Biblical text, the way you approach,\nread, and apply the text is fundamentally transformed for the better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim is to offer material that is applicable\nand important to ministry in a church context from academics that are experts\nin the field of the cultural backgrounds of the bible. You\u2019ll gain insight into\ncurrent research and biblical application that will begin to change the way you\nread the text\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother podcast ... seriously?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes! For time starved individuals, podcasts are\nthe perfect tool for learning on the go. Together, we can begin to gesture towards how this deeper contextual\nmeaning affects the way we apply the text in our congregations and in our own\nlives today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBible translation begins\nwhen we understand the Bible\u2019s original application in its own place and time\n(Get this right, you\u2019ll be in a better place to apply the text today!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eBy hearing from experts in\nthe field, podcast listeners will be on the cutting edge of biblical research\nand understanding.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eContextual study helps us realize\nGod\u2019s story is filled with people and places that are more real than we can\nnormally imagine.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eGive me 30-minutes a week\nand I will give you resources that will shorten your bible study and sermon\nprep time.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need your help to produce this and make it better! I want\nto make sure that the material I am offering you in the Biblical Remains\nPodcast is of the highest quality and caliber. You can help by becoming a\npatron of the podcast! Your monthly subscription will help grow our team, pay\nfor the hard costs of producing a high-quality podcast and encourage other\ncreators to produce similar resources for the Church today. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s also some great bonuses for becoming a patron of the show!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eP.S.\u003c/strong\u003e The time is now. There is a significant gap\nbetween the church and the academic study of the Bible. Let\u2019s work together to\nbridge that gap. By doing so, not only will the church be better but that\nacademy will be better because of the mutual engagement. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEncounter the ancient world of the bible and live better\ntoday! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
