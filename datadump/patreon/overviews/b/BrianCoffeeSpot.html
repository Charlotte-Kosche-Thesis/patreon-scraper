    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://www.brian-coffee-spot.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBrian\u0027s Coffee Spot\u003c/a\u003e is a blog about places I like to have coffee. However, since I started the Coffee Spot in September 2012, it\u0027s become so much more than that. It\u0027s grown to become an on-line resource for finding great, independent speciality coffee shops.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTired of going to a new town or city only to end up in the same old chains because you don\u0027t know where the good, independent coffee shops are? Then take a look at the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.brian-coffee-spot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCoffee Spot\u003c/a\u003e! I only write about places I like, so anywhere featured on the Coffee Spot is going to be good (at least, it\u0027s going to be somewhere I thought was good!).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFrom the outset I decided that I didn\u0027t want to take advertising or sponsorship on the Coffee Spot. My independence is very important to me and the freedom from\u00a0advertising and sponsorship means that my only criterion is \"do I want to write about this place?\". I don\u0027t have to worry about page views or click-throughs, I just write about what I want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s very liberating and I believe that this independence is key to the Coffee Spot\u0027s success. However, the simple fact is that the Coffee Spot costs me money to run; money for travel, money for coffee.\u00a0Although I\u0027m based near London, I get around as much as I can, covering almost all parts of the UK. I\u0027ve also travelled further afield with places from Ireland, France, Portugal, Denmark, Hong Kong, China, Vietnam, Japan, the USA and Canada all making appearances on the Coffee Spot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, I\u0027m fortunate enough to have a flexible, part-time job that pays me to travel and leaves me enough time to write the Coffee Spot, so I don\u0027t need the Coffee Spot to support itself. Instead, I\u0027ve decided to use the money raised from your Patreon donations to improve the Coffee Spot website by purchasing specific WordPress modules.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHead over to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.brian-coffee-spot.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.brian-coffee-spot.com\u003c/a\u003e to see what I do. Hopefully with your help, I\u0027ll be able to make the Coffee Spot bigger and better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks,\u003cbr\u003eBrian.\u003cbr\u003e"
