     "about": "A.F. Branco Bio\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAntonio F. Branco was born\nin 1956 in Fort Bragg California, and raised in a small California logging town\n(in the Mendocino county) called Point Arena. He joined the US Army MP corp. in\n1975 and was honorably discharged in 1978.  He attended Woodland Hills\ncollege briefly before moving to the Northwest.  His beginnings in\ncartooning came while working at a saw mill in Sedro-Woolley Washington. His\nability to frame life in picture created a humorous environment, depicting his\nbosses and coworkers in exaggerated, but realistic scenarios.  Signing\n\"Guess who\" kept the cartoons a mystery.  Following the\nyearnings of entrepreneurship, he decided to take his creations to the next\nlevel in the formation of A.F. Branco Designs.  His political passion would\nbe displayed on t-shirts and hats.  Other projects he was involved in were\nmusical.  His band Tony and the Tigers, played at gigs all over the\nPacific Northwest.  Flash Forward to today, A.F. Branco has taken his two\ngreatest passions, (art and politics) and manifested them into the cartoons\nthat have been seen all over the country, in various news outlets including\n\"Fox News\" and \"The Washington Post.\" He has been\nrecognized by such personalities as James Wood, Sarah Palin, Larry Elder, Lars\nLarson, and even the great El Rushbo. \u003cbr\u003e",
