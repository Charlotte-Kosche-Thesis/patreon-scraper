My focus is split between revisiting the retro games of my youth and showcasing the modern indie darlings that have sprung forth from those old-timey sensibilities. My style is split between thoughtful musings on game design and making loud, weird noises to keep from shouting obscenities. Folks seem to like my stuff and I reckon you will too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been creating Let\u0027s Play content for YouTube since 2008. In that time I have shared many of my favorite games, discovered some rad new ones, and suffered through a couple of bad ones. I have had the pleasure of introducing many great games, new and old, to audiences that wouldn\u0027t have played them otherwise. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013 I started streaming to Twitch.tv, which allowed me to branch out a bit and play lots of games that wouldn\u0027t have fit in well with my YouTube content. RPGs, open world games, roguelikes, and multiplayer games don\u0027t condense well into episodes but are great for live streams. On Twitch I have met lots of cool people and built a fun little community (many of whom are reading this now!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis has been the most fulfilling hobby I\u0027ve ever had, and I would love to make it my full-time job. To do that I need the support of generous viewers like you! If you\u0027re here from my Twitch streams, subscribe to my YouTube and check out my daily episodes there. And if you\u0027re in from YouTube, drop by Twitch some evening and meet the nice folks in my chat. Either way, please check out my reward levels and consider helping me reach my various milestones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime, I\u0027ll keep doing what I do. Thanks for being awesome, everyone!\u003cbr\u003e"
