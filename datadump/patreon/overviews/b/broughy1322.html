    "summary": "Making videos on YouTube is a tricky business. Often the most watched gaming videos contain the bare minimum amount of information or effort because the most important thing to YouTube is ad revenue. YouTube\u0027s algorithm promotes 10-15 minute videos with lots of ads or creators who post a lot of short videos with ads since it means more money for them. This is all regardless of actual video quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut those aren\u0027t the type of videos I want to make. I\u0027d much rather upload videos that go in-depth on a subject and really explain it (with no intrusive ads in the middle), then answer questions/respond to comments, than the alternatives above. I\u0027d also prefer to spend a lot of time behind the scenes crafting a well made video/series that will stand the test of time, as opposed to treating my videos as throwaway content. YouTube doesn\u0027t like that since to them quantity \u0026gt; quality, but hopefully if you\u0027re reading this you like what I do enough to consider supporting me directly yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonating to me here every month, no matter how big or small the contribution, will mean you actively contribute to my entire video making process and allow the more in-depth videos I want to make to even be possible. You will be making Patreon a consistent and reliable source of income which will allow me to rely less on YouTube ad revenue alone to buy the basic necessities required to live. You\u0027ll be continually aiding my efforts to improve myself and my videos and I will be eternally grateful for that. Don\u0027t underestimate the power of even a single dollar donation each month - it all adds up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e~~~~~\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cost of the rewards have been set as they are to ensure I\u0027m not inundated with too many requests and to reflect the amount of time each reward will take me. I\u0027d love to do all of the above for everyone for free, but the amount of time I have just doesn\u0027t allow it. The free content I post to YouTube will continue to be my main focus and by donating here you\u0027re supporting the creation of that content before anything else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf anything the rewards here should be seen as an extra bonus for support you would have given anyway because you think my content is worth it, and of course you don\u0027t have to claim a reward each month either. A message will be sent out on Patreon at the start of each month to those who are eligible for a reward and if you choose not to claim anything that month that\u0027s fine. You are also welcome to double up on rewards (for example claiming the $10 reward twice if you donate $20 per month). However you cannot accumulate rewards for a few months and claim them in one go. Patreon is a rolling service and if you don\u0027t claim a reward in any given month it can\u0027t be claimed at a later date. Otherwise I run the risk of being inundated with an impossible amount of requests in a single month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, thank you so much for even reading this far and thanks again for the support - whether it\u0027s $1, $100, or just commenting/liking/sharing my videos, I really do appreciate all of it.\u003cbr\u003e"

I recognized the name from I think gtaforum or something, and I had some of your playlists on my Xbox. So I quickly and excitedly subscribed. In the month or whatever it\u0027s been you\u0027ve put more meaningful videos out than 99% of all other larger fan based GTA YouTubers have since starting their channels. Also the time and work involved. I see people slap the same gameplay they used for 50 videos, 2 minutes of self advertising and rambling, then 45 seconds of speculation and ridiculousness together. Upload it. Then say it took them all day to make that video and they are too tired to respond to subscribers. It\u0027s mind boggling. But you became easily #1 with your video quality, hard work, passion, genuine \u0026amp; positive attitude, and the fact that you actually care about the subscriber base. You aren\u0027t here to get 500k subscribers and act like a star. You are here to keep it real, have fun and help out. I admire and respect your authenticity.\"\u003cbr\u003eView comment here:\u00a0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U86uBZA6GXY\u0026amp;lc=z13qchwpruerir0g204cjzrjttfhd5xqrqo0k",
