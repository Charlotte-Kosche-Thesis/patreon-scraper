I\u0027m an illustrator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e however thought about being a superhero at great\u00a0length... like A LOT.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I digress.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been drawing and coming up with stories for as long as I can remember. I have always loved the feeling you get from a well thought out world a creator has laid before you. I often found myself playing in these worlds long after the book was read. So I drew and I wrote, but never with the intention of making comics professionally. I grew up in a small town and I\u0027m not sure why but it just never crossed my mind that, that was something you could just do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI worked in the tech field for a number of years ranging from web design to programming and even into a bit of engineering. Being that connected to the internet I started to see tools that at first I wished had been around when I was younger. However eventually I realized that A. I\u0027m not old and B. I really should just do it now, because again it is something that you can always just do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here I am drawing as much as I can. Pushing to get better so I can use my art to tell every story I want to. I would like to share this process with you, from the pencils to the finished product, as well as my sketch book and beyond. \u003cem\u003eHopefully\u003c/em\u003e with live streaming and time lapse video in the future, \u003cem\u003eif\u003c/em\u003e that is something that would interest people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is an opportunity to see my process and watch my stories take shape. This is my tip jar. This is your chance to support something you \u003cem\u003elike\u003c/em\u003e AND want to see more of. The more money I make the more stories I can write and illustrate. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus I rely on you the internet. If you like what you see every little bit helps. I really do appreciate any amount of generosity\u2026 like any amount\u2026 like pennies. Seriously I\u2019ll take pennies, whatever you\u2019ve got.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003eBen\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s how this works:\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now I want to keep this simple and scale up as things progress. There will be only one tier to start which is one dollar a month. If you want to donate more, GREAT! A dollar though is where it starts and it will be put in the \"tip jar\" once a month. The cool part of this though is everyone who donates will be entered into a drawing and at the end of the month a random patron will be selected to receive a free 6\"x6\" watercolor portrait of a character of their own choosing. As time progresses and I am able to focus on this more and more I hope to expand the rewards here as well as start to be able to present you all with an opportunity to follow me through the process of creating my own comics. This is where it starts though.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
