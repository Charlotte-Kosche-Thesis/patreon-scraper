    "summary": "Thank you so much for supporting Barrier Breakers through Patreon. We are a small charity based in Gippsland, Victoria, Australia. Our purpose is to create a better life for people with mental illness, their families and carers. Some of the things we do (and which your support will allow us to continue to do) are:\u003cbr\u003e1. We challenge governments at all levels to provide more resources to the mental health sector, which has been sadly neglected.\u003cbr\u003e2. We seek to educate the general public about mental health issues, thus helping to remove some of the stigma that has been attached to mental illness.\u003cbr\u003e3. We offer free personal crisis advocacy for people with mental illness who are facing a crisis situation. See our short video for a better understanding of this.\u003cbr\u003e4. We run an art program for people with mental illness, their families and carers. Art is a great way for people to express emotions which otherwise they would keep bottled up.\u003cbr\u003e5. We run Team BB, a program through which we provide teaching about mental health to schools and youth groups, and seek to encourage young people to become involved with Barrier Breakers.\u003cbr\u003e6. We have been instrumental in establishing a secure, low cost, supported accommodation complex in Traralgon, and aim to replicate this model throughout Gippsland.\u003cbr\u003e"
