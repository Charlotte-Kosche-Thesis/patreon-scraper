You do NOT have to wait until retirement to do the things you want\u2026 you can live your dreams NOW.\u003cbr\u003eFirst, we want to say \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU\u003c/strong\u003e! We appreciate all of the support that you have already given us by watching, liking, commenting, and sharing all of our videos! It means a lot!

We are Born2Explore! Madi and I were married in March 2016, and at the time I had what I thought was my dream job. I worked from home full time as a Project Manager for a Civil Engineering company. Soon after the wedding, we fell into the trap of pursuing the \"American Dream\". For us this meant moving out of our 1 bedroom apartment and into a 3 bedroom house in a nice community. We filled the two car garage with a brand new 2016 Subaru Crosstrek and two motorcycles. We filled the rest of the house with couches, a guest bed, a full office, a 6 person dining room set, and more. We bought anything and everything we thought we wanted. After a year of living this way and never feeling content, we came across the \"Minimalism\" documentary. It really got us thinking... Shortly after, I was offered another promotion which would have required us to relocate to Maryland and would no longer allow me to work from home. We had a few weeks to think about what our response to the offer would be. If we said yes, my career would become the focus our time and energy. If we said no, it would dead-end my career and allow someone else to take the position. We took a road trip to Colorado and thought about the answer we would give on the drive home. We ultimately declined the promotion, and began re-thinking all of our life goals. We decided that we would NOT spend the rest of our lives working just to get a paycheck with the hope of one day being able to retire and then live our dream. We decided to start living our dream of traveling the world now!\u003cbr\u003eFor us, March has been a month where we consistently make our biggest life changing decisions. In March 2016, we got married. In March 2017, we made the decision to live this traveling lifestyle full time. And in March 2018, we will be full time living and traveling out of our van!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur YouTube Channel\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWe want to inspire people to break out of the 9am-5pm rat race. We want to show people that there is more to life than just the pursuit of the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d (to get a good job, make lots of money, buy a nice house, drive a fancy car, etc.). You do not have to work your whole life with the hope of one day being able to retire at 67 years old and THEN go live your dreams (whatever they may be). You can live your dreams NOW! It doesn\u0027t matter if you are age 18 or 60, you don\u0027t have to wait for retirement to go do what you want. Our dream is to explore and travel, what is yours?\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eAnd for those whose dream, like ours, is to travel, we want to show you that it is possible. You can do it, and you don\u2019t have to wait. We want to INSPIRE and HELP you get out there and DO IT! We will take you along on our adventures to show you how much there really is to see out there! We will be staying at as many free campsites as we can to bring you detailed information on each site to let you know where you should stay, and where you should not. We will show you how we cook, how we keep clean, how we budget, and how we travel and explore with our dog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill you consider partnering with us as we share our story and inspire others?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Does Patreon Work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003ePatreon is a platform that allows YOU to become more than just a viewer. It allows you to join in our adventures on a whole new level. By choosing to support us at one of the various support tiers, it shows that you value our content and believe in the message of our channel. Your support says that you are interested in what we are doing with our channel and that you are excited to be a bigger part of it. Each support tier comes with its own UNIQUE perks and rewards. For example, if you chose to support us with $15 a month, you would be within the \u201c$10 or more\u201d tier. You would receive a personalized shout-out on one of our vlog style videos, exclusive access to behind the scenes footage, bloopers, and blog posts available ONLY to Patrons, AND all of the rewards of the previous tier ($1 or more).\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Does Our Money Go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eIn March 2018 we will BOTH be quitting our consistent and stable jobs to travel and live this life on the road full time. We will be keeping you informed of our travels by posting multiple videos a week. Getting to the beautiful places you want to see, filming, editing, and then posting these videos takes time, energy, and money. We absolutely enjoy making these videos and inspiring this community, but we are also in need of income to fund our adventures. We don\u2019t want money to keep us from bringing you the adventures and inspiration you want, so your support will directly relate to the quality and quantity of the videos we are able create. For more information on the direct impact your support would have, see our \u201cGoals\u201d on the left hand side.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you ready to partner with us by helping to supplement some of our income so that we can bring you the BEST of our van living adventures as we explore and inspire the world?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Should NOT Support Us?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eAs mentioned above, we would love to have you partner with us! However, if you are considering supporting us, but you are tight on money, please DO NOT support us by giving money. If you are barely paying your bills, please enjoy our videos, but consider contributing to our channel/community in ways other than with your monetary support. Liking, commenting, subscribing, and sharing our YouTube videos is another major way that you can contribute.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember, we are not the only ones who were born to explore\u2026 YOU ARE TOO!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support and encouragement!\u003cbr\u003e-Brandon, Madi, and Troy\u2026 Born2Explore\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNOTE: All information published through this site is for the personal use of paid patrons ONLY.
