Raised on the road.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHailing from the colorful and gritty La Boca neighborhood of Buenos Aires, Blue Tango Project is a ground-breaking exploration of the emotional and musical crossroads where tango and the blues embrace. It is a collaboration between Argentine Latin Grammy nominee Mar\u00eda Volont\u00e9 and California harmonica player Kevin Carrel Footer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis globe-trotting duo celebrates the deep spiritual bond that joins tango and the blues, as two musical genres born in desire and marginality, many times censored yet always resurgent and speaking directly to our hungry souls. When they play together, Maria\u2019s voice and guitar fill the stage with echoes of tango\u2019s forbidden pleasures while Kevin\u2019s harmonica whines with the lament of the solitary blues soul.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe project began at the San Francisco Jazz Festival in May 2008, when Mar\u00eda and Kevin debuted new material and a new sound that they had been developing in Buenos Aires. Based on the success of that first show, the Blue Tango Tour was born and years of intense touring in North America, Latin America and Europe have followed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe duo\u2019s adventures in places as diverse as Vancouver, Kosovo or Caracas have marked and nourished their music deeply. Their original songs reflect their embrace of the road as a way of life and their commitment to global music making as a spiritual experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cBlue Tango,\u201d the second CD from the duo -- and the ninth CD of Mar\u00eda\u0027s career -- was produced by Laura Ros and Federico Gil Sol\u00e1.\u003cbr\u003e",
