For the past seven years (I became a monk when I was 19) while I was a Hindu monastic, I traveled the world teaching workshops at temples, yoga centers, festivals, peoples homes etc. I am a teacher of ecstatic meditation and esoteric Hindu Philosophy. \u00a0I have recently stopped traveling and began writing books to help benefit the world in a different way. I live reclusively on a small farm in North Carolina USA and immerse myself daily in several hours of meditation, and study of the ancient scriptures of the world. I am constantly involved in teaching others in person and through the internet. \u00a0 Contributions will help tremendously in the way of producing books and educational content. It will be greatly appreciated by me and all others. Om tat sat.\u00a0",
