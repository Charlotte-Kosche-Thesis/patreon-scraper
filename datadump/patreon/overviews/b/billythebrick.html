I\u0027m a cosplayer and prop maker as well as a dad of two little geeks. While my first cosplay was technically a \u003cem\u003eStar Trek: The Next Generation\u003c/em\u003e jumpsuit for the 5th anniversary of ST:TNG, cosplaying with my son (who is now five) and, soon, my daughter (who is not quite two) is what really sparked a renewed interest for me.\u00a0I\u0027ve been seriously making costumes and props since my son was born with a dream of eventually doing it full-time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn October of 2016, I was laid off from my IT job of 12 years, and I decided to go all the way! While I fully plan to make cosplay and props for the rest of my life, I\u0027d love to be able to spend more time on it, make better things, and give back to the community with tutorials, videos, and more. If you\u0027d like to help make my dream a reality, support an artist, and get some early-access and free stuff along the way, become a patron! I could never thank you enough!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Can You Expect?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://billythebrickcosplay.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BTB-Patreon-Samples.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you may have guessed from the above, you can expect to find a wide variety of stuff going on here. I sew and make my own patterns. I model and print 3D accessories and props. I make blueprints. I make props out of foam and wood and whatever else works. I make foam helmets and armor. I make molds and cast things. As a patron, you\u0027ll get to see behind-the-scenes on all of the things I work on. There will be polls to help me decide what to do next. There will be secret cosplay that only patrons know about until they are revealed (there are two in progress right now!). There will be private chats. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is Not a Paywall\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, at certain levels my patrons are paying for access and physical rewards, but I do not plan to keep any of my content (tutorials, videos, photos, etc.) away from the public. As a thank you for supporting me, patrons get early access to these things, but eventually, they all become free to the public because my main goal is always to give back to the community.\u00a0Timelines for the exclusivity period will vary depending on the type of the content. For example, I\u0027ll usually post a tutorial video publicly a week or so after patrons get it, but on a big, secret cosplay build, patrons may get behind the scenes photos and videos for months before I unveil it to the public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://billythebrickcosplay.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BTB-Patreon-Rewards.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, for many of my backer levels, you\u0027ll also get fun stuff sent to you in the mail! Hopefully, like me, you\u0027ll never get bored with so much going on and you\u0027ll learn a ton of stuff on my journey with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Does Your Money Go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be doing all sorts of things. I love costuming and prop making. And I love experimenting and learning new things. I want to build a full fledged workshop. I want to do more videos and streaming. All of those things take time, money, equipment, and resources. Your support helps make those things a reality. I also plan to do more professional photoshoots and attend more conventions (where I can do panels to share more of what I do and know with more people and meet people).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant Some More Examples?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you want to see more of the kinds of things I\u0027m doing, follow any of the links below.\u003cbr\u003eFACEBOOK:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/billythebrickcosplay\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/billythebrickcosplay\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTWITTER:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/billythebrick\"\u003ewww.twitter.com/billythebrick\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSTORE: \u003ca href=\"http://etsy.com/shop/BillythebrickCosplay/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eetsy.com/shop/BillythebrickCosplay/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSITE: \u003ca href=\"http://www.billythebrickcosplay.com\"\u003ewww.billythebrickcosplay.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eINSTAGRAM: \u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/billythebrick\"\u003ewww.instagram.com/billythebrick\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTWITCH: \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/billythebrick\"\u003ewww.twitch.tv/billythebrick\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want this Patreon to be a living thing, so any feedback or suggestions on what you\u0027d like to see or things that would make becoming a patron more appealing, please let me know!"
