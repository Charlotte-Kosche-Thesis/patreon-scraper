    "summary": "Although I was born a little over 31 years ago, my life really began in May, 2006. That was when I played my very first round of disc golf at Renaissance Park in Charlotte, NC. Since then I have dedicated everything to this sport, game, hobby, lifestyle, culture, etc. I think that most disc golfers would agree that the one thing that makes the sport so amazing, above all else, is the group of people within the sport. Disc golf attracts an incredible variety of people and there is always something you can learn from the interesting characters you meet on tour. The most amazing people I have ever known have come from within the sport.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you know me personally or have ever heard me on the mic before you already know that I LOVE TALKING DISC GOLF! I feel like there is always so much to discuss and I love sharing my passion with others, especially those who have the same desire to share ideas and stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past month, I have started recording several hours of commentary with Jomez Productions. Joining up with Jomez has been an absolute pleasure. It\u0027s amazing to see how much work goes into the entire production especially considering that each video is delivered the very next day after recording. So far, I\u0027m pleased to say that the \u0027Big Sexy\u0027 commentary team of Nathan Sexton and myself has been very well received! We are both very eager to continue improving our chemistry together on the mic in order to provide you, the listener, with the greatest disc golf commentary available!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEarlier this year I helped start a disc golf podcast with my friends Brady Hanna and Paul Ulibarri called \"Two Pros and an Average Joe.\" We discuss hot topics within the sport and sprinkle in our unique sense of humor. Most episodes run about 45- 60 minutes and usually include about 12-13 minutes of relevant material. It\u0027s certainly worth a listen on your drive to work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, I would like to take a moment to THANK YOU for helping support my passion of sharing my insights and experiences with the disc golf world. It means the world to me any time a fan lets me know that they\u0027re out there supporting me along my journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee you on the course, \u003cbr\u003eBig Jerm"
