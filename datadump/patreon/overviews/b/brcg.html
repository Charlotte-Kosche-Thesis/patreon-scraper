     "about": "In 1993 Ben Pasley established the Blue Renaissance Creative Group as a dream. It was a dream about creative people on fire with love for others, and stirring up the gifts in them that could draw new pictures of Jesus. In 1998 Ben and Robin Pasley founded Enter The Worship Circle, which was born from the same dream, and rocked the culture of worship with songs that were honest, common in language, and warm and welcoming to those who felt like outsiders. This how to understand our \"guild\" here at Patreon. Are you an artist? Do you love people? Want to spend time with people who practice this artful way of life as a career? Join us.",
