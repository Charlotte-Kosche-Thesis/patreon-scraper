    "summary": "Hi friends! My name is Bobby Jo Valentine. I\u0027m an artist. I write and sing songs about why we\u0027re were, how it feels, what matters most, and all points in between. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love for you to support the art I\u0027m making. Back in the day, there were patrons of the art, a generous minority that allowed art to continue being made into the world. Today, the world is a \u0027consumer majority\u0027...mostly made up of people who relate to art in a \u0027what can my money buy me\u0027 sort of way. But, there are some beautiful people - hopefully like yourself! - that understand for art to thrive, us artists need to be supported with a \u0027creative\u0027 and not a \u0027consumer\u0027 mindset.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m inviting you to pledge monthly to help me continue making art. \u003c/strong\u003eThe invitation is to donate every month, for however many months you\u0027d like, and help me make something beautiful. Pledge $3, or $30, or $300 per month - whatever your comfort level is and however strongly you feel connected to my art. If 200 people pledge $10 per month, that means I get to make an album a year with your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ll be releasing a video blogs on here, and new songs, and more!\u003c/strong\u003e Everyone who pledges - you can pledge as little as $1 per month and as much as $500 - gets to experience the new art I\u0027m creating as soon as it arrives, before anyone else, and some of which will only be available to patrons. The greater you can support, the more fun the reward!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease click on one of the levels below - whatever you can do - if you\u0027d like to be a patron. Thank you, so much, for being part of my life sharing music. I hope you become a patron today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
