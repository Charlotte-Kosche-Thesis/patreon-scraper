At least some of you probably remember me from one of several touring bands I\u0027ve been in for the last 27 years. For the first time in my career - i am making a \u003cstrong\u003eSOLO RECORD\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd when i say solo - i mean \u003cstrong\u003eREAL\u003c/strong\u003e solo. as in i will play virtually every instrument (although i will have some of my really talented friends sit in here and there), record it, arrange it and produce it. I\u0027ll design the cover art, and i\u0027ll make all the videos. Virtually unassisted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy? Well (a) because i can, and (b) quite frankly in the absence of a label budget - there just isn\u0027t the overhead to pay other people a fair rate to do all these things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHIS IS WHERE YOU COME IN.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m happy to pour an ocean of time and effort into this - but the reality is that the physical production and shipping costs of even the smallest vinyl run is literally \u003cstrong\u003ethousands of dollars\u003c/strong\u003e, mastering isn\u0027t free, and god forbid - it wouldn\u0027t be the end of the world if a musician actually got paid at least something for the hundreds of hours of labor that it takes to execute this process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the video above for my carny barker pitch - and check out on the right which level of commitment is right for you. Please note that these flat rates are for this finished 9 song record in total (you aint paying by the song)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first target is a measly \u003cstrong\u003e$2500\u003c/strong\u003e, which at least gets the boat in the water. Our \"fully funded\" (as in nobody lost money) is \u003cstrong\u003e$4000\u003c/strong\u003e, and we even have a couple goals beyond that where this project actually \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003emakes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e some degree of money.
