I write because I love to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073ZLK3TS\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Vigilante Angels trilogy\u003c/a\u003e (audio, Kindle, paperback, boxed set) gave me great joy to create and that\u0027s what I want to do every day of my life. That\u0027s my dream - to write stories that intrigue others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u0027ll support me on Patreon. I\u0027ll be posting short stories that I\u0027ve written, as well as chapter-by-chapter previews of my next novels. I hope they\u0027re worth a buck a shot. I\u0027ll post them here when I consider them finished, story by story, chapter by chapter, in hopes of getting feedback from you before I compile them into books for sale.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, you get a first look\u00a0and a way to help me guide the material. I write fast and already have content, so I\u0027ll post at least once a month. I\u0027ll post writing and audio narration of said writing. I\u0027m not into the other stuff like live\u00a0meet-ups and so forth because frankly, I\u0027m private, antisocial, and would rather be writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve posted the first short story. They\u0027re mostly Raymond Chandler-esque explorations of the quirky things normal (okay, and some abnormal) people do, a few old-timey love stories and perhaps,\u00a0 a sprinkling of sci-fi.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re gonna love it, or your money back! You can keep the Ginsu\u00a0knife set though."
