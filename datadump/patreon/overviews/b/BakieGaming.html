You can also find out how to make your game look more realistic and alive by using The Effect Player.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\nPatreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe main reason for making mods is that I just\nlove to use my creativity to make new things for The Sims 4 and\nbecause of that also helping other people enjoying their game even\nmore. Because\nI know there are many people out there who would love to make their\nown mods too, I decided to start making video tutorials in which I\nshow you step by step how to accomplish that. Because of my way of\nteaching, both beginners, veterans and\neverything in between, can easily learn new ways of modding.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMaking\nthese free mods and videos cost a lot of time and work and to be able\nto make even more awesome mods and videos I need your support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirst\nof all there are these Stuff packs, Game packs and Expansion packs I\nneed to buy. Besides that, using better hard/software can make\nthe workflow even faster\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEventually this may also\nresult in uploading videos more frequently than once a week and/or\nuploading other kinds of videos about The Sims 4.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\nshould you consider being a Patron? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFirst of all,\nbecoming a Patron is a choice. You\u0027re completely free to choose for\nyourself if you want to support me a bit more or not. You can see it\nas a \"tip\" for the time and work I put into making these\nfree mods and videos for everyone to enjoy (both Patrons as\nnon-Patrons). In return, as a way of saying thank\nyou to those who give me that extra support,\nthere will be some small \"rewards\".\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen being in the $3 supporting tier, you\nwill get access to my Patron-only feed, where I\u0027ll discuss everything that keeps me busy at that moment\nabout The Sims 4, share info on what I\u0027m working on, share\nWork-In-Progress screenshots/video teasers, give you the possibility to get early access to some of my\nWork-In-Progress mods to help me testing if necessary and\u00a0share when ever I uploaded a new mod/video. You will also be free to ask me anything you want about those mods and videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e-There is\na possibility that more rewards will be added later to any of those\ntiers or as a new one.-\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat happens when you become\na Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBeing a Patron means that you pledge $1 (or\nany amount) each month for however long you desire and get the\nrewards matching your tier. (And a lot of love from me of\ncourse!)\u003cbr\u003e\nYour subscription can be edited or cancelled at any\ntime!
