And I can tell you that there\u0027s no comparison to having someone who\u0027s been there show you the \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ewhy\u003c/em\u003e as you learn. So that\u0027s what I\u0027m offering you as a patron of my art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ll take you behind the scenes.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ll show you what it\u0027s really like to do this work. And I\u0027ll share what I know with you as openly as I can. I make my living teaching 3d graphics, but it can be difficult with so many students worldwide to connect this personally. My goal is to take you as a patron through the looking glass and show you what can only be seen from the other side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMy Background\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhen I started learning back in high school I became a super fan of the 3d software Blender\u003c/strong\u003e and now I\u0027m one of only about 50 other people in the world who are Blender Foundation Certified Trainers.

I also love helping people on their own journeys find success in what they do so at the beginning of 2015 I became a full time freelance 3d artist and Blender Instructor. This led to the launch of my blog in the summer of 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to take you behind the looking glass and show you my process as I develop new art.
