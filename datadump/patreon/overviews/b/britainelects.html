    "summary": "Those that already know of Britain Elects most likely came across us on Twitter. Since late 2013 we\u0027ve developed an online feed putting out published polls on the state of British public opinion and a slew of election results held almost every week. We like data. We like aggregating and crunching it, and presenting it in an easy-to-understand way, and so far it seems there\u0027s an audience for it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOn Twitter we have a followerbase of over 150,000 (up from just 10,000 in November 2014) and to many we are seen as the place to go to for live updates on what the public are thinking in Britain. We put polls and election results and all the detail in between in one place and on one site, making it easier for those in need of them to get them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince Christmas of 2016 we\u0027ve had a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://britainelects.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e hosting this archive of data alongside our own analysis of current events and polls - we published briefings, for instance, on the 2016 local elections, on what\u0027s up, what might happen and what would be a good night for who. For the general election, we developed our own poll tracker (which goes as far back as 2006) and \u0027nowcast\u0027, a daily projection on how we think the general election might be played out using a regional swing model which, had the polls got the result right, would have got the result to within an error of six seats! \u003cem\u003eTo our shame our nowcast on the day of the election had the Tories to get a comfortable majority, but such is the peril of making a projection.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur nowcast and poll tracker both received coverage by regional, national and international publications and we\u0027d like to do more of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are ambitious, but we are volunteers,\u00a0staffed by, at present, two people. We have had experience working as political and design consultants but now one of us is a student and the other in a job of his own. Our time is finite, but we most certainly would love to dedicate more time to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a short list of what we\u0027d like to do in the future:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDevelop a large archive of easy-to-access and aesthetically pleasing election results and polls spanning as far back as 1945.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBuild up a team of experienced writers who can commentate on the state of elections and public opinion.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBroadcast election coverage and discussion through a visual or audio format.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCommission our own non-biased polling on issues we think are relevant and interesting so to advance understanding of what the public want and feel.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eBy backing us, you are letting us invest more time and resources into the project that has been Britain Elects. We have done a decent job so far out of our own back pocket, but we\u0027d like to do more.\u003cbr\u003e"
