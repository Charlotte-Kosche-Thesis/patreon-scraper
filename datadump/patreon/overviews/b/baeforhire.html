I\u0027m Axel, but you may know me elsewhere online as baeforhire. If you found your way here on purpose, you probably already know that I\u0027m a fiction writer and blogger based out of Central Florida, and that this fancy mess of a webpage is the best place to keep up to date on my work. Here on Patreon, you\u0027ll find all sorts of exclusive content you won\u0027t see anywhere else, including everything from chapter samples from future releases to unfinished projects from the past. On the other hand, if you stumbled in here on accident, you should probably know what you\u0027re getting into first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I said, my main export is fiction, typically falling in line with the science fantasy or horror genres, but every so often I\u0027ll try my hand at other stuff. While you won\u0027t see me dropping a brand new novel every other month, you can expect a steady flow of short stories and supplementary works in between releases. Other than that, I frequently write about more \"real-world\" topics, for lack of a better term, covering anything that has to do food, travel, politics, technology, or even finance (hey, it\u0027s important stuff, man).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon and YOU: A Guide\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOne thing I want to make clear right away is that Patreon isn\u0027t some sort of charity site. I\u0027m not here to ask for handouts or the like. Patreon is a membership-based market for writers, artists, musicians and other creators. As such, every contribution is made in exchange for content. In the case of my own page, all of my Patrons receive free digital copies of my work, rather than having to purchase them separately through Kindle or other outlets. Higher-level memberships correlate with more rewards, including sneak peeks, deleted scenes, rough drafts and tons of other cool stuff. More than anything, Patreon is a platform for me to connect with my readers. You can see all of the reward tiers in the sidebar on the right.\u003cbr\u003e"
