    "summary": "Ears of Steel: The Podcast started in the summer of 2013 as a fun way to promote the\u00a0book \"Ears of Steel: The Real Man\u0027s Guide to Walt Disney World.\" Since then I\u0027ve made incredible friends and had amazing experiences because of this little podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only downside has been limited time and resources. Sometimes I just don\u0027t get a show recorded because life gets in the way. Sometimes it\u0027s family, but most of the time it comes down to my day job. I\u0027d like to ensure this doesn\u0027t happen, and I\u0027d like to increase my output. I wish I could do multiple shows a week; at least 2, or maybe even 3. And they\u0027d all sound fantastic with top-tier equipment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus I want to write more. I don\u0027t want to make those who enjoy my books wait three years for the next one. I\u0027d rather put out three a year! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that I\u0027ve recently started vlogging and I\u0027m loving it. Even though sometimes it\u0027s only\u00a0as exciting as a trip to the grocery store or Target, I still love doing it. And those are often the kind of vlogs I enjoy watching the most. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I\u0027ve started this Patreon account. My listeners know I hate asking for money - even for my books, even when I have no choice. With Patreon, I can ask for audience support in exchange for more of the show you guys love, and maybe even find new ways to include you. Will this ever generate enough income to make EoS and writing books my full-time job? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*he shrugs and digs his double-chin into his shoulder* \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s no secret I\u0027d love that, but who really knows? My kids\u00a0are obsessed with a\u00a0family who became millionaires by playing Skylanders on YouTube, and my financial tipping point is much lower, so\u00a0anything is theoretically possible.\u00a0What it should definitely do is help me be more productive for you guys, as well as keep the show more topical and current, and more interactive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can contribute and be my patron, I truly appreciate it. I will try to make it worth your time and money. If you cannot, please do not feel pressured or obligated. I will keep on keeping on. I know how tough it is out there. This is only for those in a position to give comfortably. If that isn\u0027t you, I\u0027m totally with you and I love you just the same. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond that, who knows? As Walt Disney never said, but Tom Fitzgerald did, if we can dream it, we can do\u00a0it! Thank you!!!"

     "about": "Hi there! I\u0027m a writer and podcaster. I hate begging for money. However I hate that I haven\u0027t had a new book out since Ears of Steel in\u00a02013. \u003cbr\u003eYes, I have a novel due later this fall, but there should but I want to be\u00a0more productive, to deliver\u00a0more stories,\u00a0and produce\u00a0funnier,\u00a0better quality podcasts.\u00a0The problem, as always,\u00a0is money and time. So I\u0027m asking, if you like what I do, and can, would you be willing to help out? In return I promise more fun. More books. More pods. More vlogs. More meet-ups.\u00a0Who knows what else?! If you can\u0027t contribute please don\u0027t feel bad. Like I said, I\u0027m conflicted about even asking. But if you can spare the price of a Starbuck\u0027s, I\u0027d truly appreciate the support. \u003cbr\u003eAnd if you don\u0027t know who I am or what Ears of Steel is, go to: \u003ca href=\"http://www.earsofsteel.com\"\u003ewww.earsofsteel.com\u003c/a\u003e.",
