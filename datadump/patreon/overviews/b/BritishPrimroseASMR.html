    "summary": "Have you ever questioned that strange tingly sensation through your scalp when you watch or feel certain things? What about feeling sleepy at certain points during, or feeling quite satisfied? There is a word for this, although scientifically it hasn\u0027t been proven, we call it\u00a0ASMR which means \u0027Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response\u0027.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI discovered the ASMR community only three years ago, but whilst I begin to think about it, I remember feeling in an aura of relaxation when I was much younger during dental trips and the gloves and metal against my teeth, the sounds of nature whilst I lay in the middle of a field, the rain against the window and roof whilst I slept.\u003cbr\u003eI was very curious and interested in the concept once I had discovered the community online, as I stumbled anonymously on Heather Feathers\u00a0Comprehensive Physical Examination, which to this day, is still my favourite ASMR video to watch. From the moment I clicked on that video, I opened myself to a place I wanted to be a part of, and I wanted to create the same experience to those who were already there as well as those who have just entered this phenomenon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am overwhelmed by the amount of support around the world since I began this channel and watching my videos and taking the time to write heartwarming messages. I appreciate it more than you know, and I am thankful. My videos on Youtube will always be available for free, but now you can support me if you like for $2 or more a month. \u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you support me? \u003c/strong\u003eAlthough it isn\u0027t compulsory, supporting me and my channel will give me the opportunity to purchase better equipment. At the moment, I am using a Logitech camera attached to my computer and I use the Zoom 1 Microphone. Although this equipment works effectively, I would like to purchase a new camera, and new microphones, so I am able to travel to different locations to film the best role plays I can and not have any background noises (like my computer).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI absolutely love making these videos and I plan to go above and beyond not just ASMR but adding beauty, lifestyle, vlogging and food to my channel as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much if you have donated, I appreciate it tremendously.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI hope you stick around to watch my channel grow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- British Primrose ASMR (Roseanna)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ex\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
