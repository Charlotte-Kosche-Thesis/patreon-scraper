I wasn\u0027t even close. One grey winter\u0027s day in 2014. I was rushing my 3 and 5 year old sons out the house to nursery and school. I had a big work meeting on that morning and a train that couldn\u0027t be missed. The kids were taking ages and I got angry. I shouted,\u00a0bellowed is probably a better description. Manhandled them into their coats and shoes, picked them up and plonked them down outside. They zoomed off happily on their scooters, I was seething.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen I caught myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was an angry dad. A dad I never, ever wanted to be. In that moment I promised myself and them I\u0027d be better. I\u0027d be the best dad I could be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what does it mean to be a great dad?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s what Being Dads is finding out. Of course there\u0027s no universal truth, but there are threads we can follow, ideas we can put into practice and practices we can repeat, getting better each time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been a great journey so far. I\u0027ve spoken to some incredible men who have done something interesting in life, because I\u0027ve found that\u0027s a good proxy for them having a different perspective on fatherhood, one we can all learn from.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support I can speak to more dads and read and distil more research. All to help you be a better dad. The more support I get, the more I can do and the better dad you can become. As one dad I interviewed said, \u0027there\u0027s a last time for everything. A last time they want to hold your hand, sit on your lap and give you a cuddle, make the most of it.\u0027 So let\u0027s get cracking. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eApparently posting a picture and a video will help me get more patrons. But all I could post would be pics and videos of me and my kids, which isn\u0027t going to be very motivating because you don\u0027t know them. So instead, take a second to picture your kids and ask yourself what it\u0027s worth to you to be a better dad.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
