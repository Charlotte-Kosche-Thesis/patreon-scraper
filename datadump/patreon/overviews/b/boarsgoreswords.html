    "summary": "Boars, Gore, and Swords is a television and film podcast primarily about Game of Thrones, hosted by comedians Red Scott and Ivan Hernandez. Since 2011, BGaS has recapped and reviewed every episode of Game of Thrones, and covered much of George RR Martin\u0027s A Song of Ice and Fire extended universe. With a casual, occasionally filthy tongue in cheek, Ivan and Red cover the show, \u00a0books, video games, and more, along with other TV and film like Doctor Who, Jessica Jones, The Force Awakens, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been releasing episodes consistently for years now, besides a brief hiatus from which we\u0027ve now returned. Patrons\u0027 donations would go towards the technical costs of improving the sound quality of the show and perfecting our long-distance recording set-up, and allowing us to profit off all the work we put into the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re still thinking of potential goals and rewards, so if you\u0027ve got any suggestions for extra episodes or goodies, you can find us on Twitter\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/boarsgoreswords\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@boarsgoreswords\u003c/a\u003e, like our \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BoarsGoreSwords/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook fanpage\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:boarsgoreandswords@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eemail us\u003c/a\u003e.
