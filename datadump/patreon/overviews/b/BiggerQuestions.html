    "summary": "I love asking and discussing the big questions of life. One of the ways in which I do that is through a radio show and podcast I have developed called Bigger Questions (formerly Logos Live).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBigger Questions is a podcast and radio show which explores the big questions of life in a fun and thought-provoking way. It is a unique mix of fun, stories and answers to objections to the Christian message. Through Bigger Questions we show the truth and relevance of the Christian faith.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show is produced before a live audience at lunchtime in the CBD of Melbourne (Australia). We want to provide a fun forum that workers in the city can invite colleagues along to explore the bigger questions. We provide the show free of charge to guests and we also provide the show free to radio stations to broadcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the consistent challenges we face in producing Bigger Questions is funding the venues and the time spent for me on editing and polishing the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this Patreon project I\u0027m going to be producing better content and a more polished show that will effectively engage objections and demonstrate through stories and Scripture the truth and relevance of the Christian faith.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd you can help!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will allow me to not only produce better quality podcasts, it will also allow me to dedicate more time to generate more episodes, write books, and engage the broader culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will also give you a voice in directing the content I produce. Do you have questions you\u0027d like me to deal with? I can do that. Do you have a friend with a particular argument or questions about Christianity? I can do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether we can create quality content that effectively defends and commends the Christian faith to the world. Who said exploring the bigger questions of life shouldn\u0027t be enjoyable?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eN.B. Please note that all contributions via Patreon are charged in $USD.\u003cbr\u003e"
