The first is of course Critical Mass, which will be about five volumes long. The second is Wasteland which is an undecided length. Once I have done these I might focus on others. However, it has taken a long time to do entire chapters, much less entire volumes, because I have to spend the majority of my time doing illustrations for clients in order to keep all my bills paid. The simple problem is that time is money, and having no money means I have no time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuy becoming a patron to my comics, you can remove some of that burden, and with all the extra time I have, I can make more comics, and make comics faster, and maybe I can pump out entire volumes within the span of a year, and maybe I can keep up with multiple webcomic projects, and maybe I\u0027ll have more time to paint huge pictures, and make special gifts for my fans, and create merchandise, and maybe I\u0027ll even some day be able to start an animated youtube series I\u0027ve been kicking around in my head. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhere is Your Money Going?\u003c/h2\u003eRemember, Patreon takes about 8% of all the money you give me! \u003cbr\u003eThings I will use your money for include bills and utilities, taxes, equipment for better skype and livestream sessions, a new tablet to draw with, paper and other art supplies, website hosting fees and domain registration, advertising costs for growing my readership, convention expenses to run tables and meet readers, comic merchandise, printed books, and the big pipe-dream down the line:\u003cbr\u003eHiring assistants for helping me with animation projects I\u0027d like to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll still probably be doing freelance illustration on the side so I can have some spending money for myself, but the purpose of this patreon is to make my comics self-sustaining instead of a constant out-of-pocket expense. If you\u0027re generous enough to help me do that, you will be well-rewarded, I promise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also will be periodically changing or updating these reward tiers and possibly the reward goals depending on popular demand and my circumstances. If you have suggestions or requests for what you\u0027d like to see, feel free to engage me directly about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have such sights to show you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Once this tier is reached, expect to see a MASSIVE increase in content and speed, as I spend every work day exclusively drawing comic pages and various other artwork. My webcomic will likely become weekly again, and Volume 2 (and 3 and 4) of Critical Mass will be done in a fraction of the time! If I can devote all my time and energy to the stories floating around in my head, I\u0027ll finally be able to share them with you all. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e",
