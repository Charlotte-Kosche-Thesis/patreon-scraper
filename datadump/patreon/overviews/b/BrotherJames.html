    "summary": "My name is Brother James, known by friends and family as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://brotherjsongs.com/about\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJustin Sinclair\u003c/a\u003e. Also known as one half of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://Brotherjsongs.com/the-portion\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Portion\u003c/a\u003e (if you\u0027ve come here via the Portion, you\u0027re in the right place: patronage toward Brother James will also support the work of The Portion).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI care about three things: helping people, making family, and making music.\u003c/strong\u003e If you care about one or all of these too, we should probably partner up. Your monthly support will allow me to accomplish these three things with my art:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Helping people.\u003c/strong\u003e Mostly I just want to help people. Maybe even help them in ways they don\u2019t know they need yet \u2014 and in the process help myself in ways I don\u2019t know I need yet. This sort of growth happens in conversation. The way I communicate/converse best is with my songs: I want to cut the small-talk and get straight to things that matter, and my songs toss my mind and heart on the table. That way we can jump right into talking about what matters,\u00a0by talking about what\u2019s wrong and what\u2019s right with me. I\u0027m down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Making family.\u003c/strong\u003e I want to connect people, connect deeply \u003cem\u003ewith\u003c/em\u003e people, give and share love, build and grow relationships... etc. I think life is about humans, and so a meaningful life is found in the connection of human souls \u2014 everything else (jobs, hobbies, technology, etc.) is just support or distraction. I call this sort of life-sharing and love-sharing \u201cmaking family\u201d; it is the kind of thing that\u2019s built into how biological families develop and function, but that\u2019s reflective of a broader beautiful human capacity and necessity for connection (so yes, it\u2019s suggestive, but that suggestiveness is suggestive of something better).\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Making music.\u003c/strong\u003e Music runs in my veins, and I can\u2019t be satisfied with listening to or copying other people\u2019s music. I need to create. So I listen to and copy other people\u2019s music... as way of expanding my musical imagination and musical vocabulary/toolset. So that \u003cem\u003egood\u003c/em\u003e music come out of me when songs need to stumble out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1+2+3 = Brother James\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe converging of these three passions, taking skills and talents into account, is a sort of musical existence in which I write songs and share them with friends, in person and online. I\u0027m calling this bard-life \"Brother James\". So here I am, to share songs with friends. \u00a0And if you care about those three things above, your patronage can enable them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut what\u0027s Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is platform that\u0027s bringing back the tradition of patronage for artists. Rather than artists hoping to get discovered by a table and \"make it someday\", we can bypass the system and make art just for the people who care about it and want more. So \u003cstrong\u003einstead of paying for CD\u0027s, you pledge monthly to demand (with your dollars) that I make more content\u003c/strong\u003e, which gives me incentive to create more often. \u003cstrong\u003eIn return, I give you exclusive unreleased content \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e I\u0027ll give you any and all published music for free when I release it to the public.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo\u00a0I\u0027ll share \u003cstrong\u003ea new song\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0(in demo form) exclusively with my patrons \u003cstrong\u003eonce a month\u003c/strong\u003e. Your \u003cstrong\u003emonthly patronage\u003c/strong\u003e will serve to cover the costs of turning these demo songs into finished products (make \u0027em sound real good in a real studio) that I\u0027ll release for free so that we can reach as many people as possible. Your patronage will provide resources for the best music we can possibly produce, will help me to be the best Brother James by our growing conversation (challenge me! grow me! push me! fight me!), and turn this family-making into a vocation of loving people.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to be your brother.\u003c/strong\u003e If you\u2019ll let me, I think that together we can make the world a little bit better. At the very least, make our lives a little bit better. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*\u201dFamily\u201d and \u201cExtended family\u201d are for those who want to provide time as a resource rather than money for production costs; so this particular patronage will become my paycheck, freeing me to work on these songs instead of making coffee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
