    "summary": "Hi there! If you\u0027re reading this: thank you! I appreciate you taking the time to stop by and check out what this is all about. I\u0027m an artist. I haven\u0027t always been able to call myself that, and I\u0027m still working on accepting that identity for myself. I am not coming from a formally trained background. I\u0027m mostly self-taught, and I\u0027m sure that shows, but I embrace the adventure of learning all the rules and figuring out which ones I am comfortable breaking. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here, really. I want to share in this learning experience with all of you. And through that experience I\u0027d love to build a community with you around the idea that creative\u00a0opportunities and art\u00a0exist for everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little bit about me: I\u2019m a freelance artist in the U.S., originally from a small town in Pennsylvania, currently living in Florida. I enjoy playing with styles and exploring different tools and techniques. Some of my favorite subjects are animals, including the mythical or fantastical kind, and I get a lot of inspiration and influence from fairytales and fables from around the world. My style is probably closer to folk art than fine art, with occasional bursts of extra fancy and handfuls of glitter tossed in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027ll be sharing here: Works-in-progress, insight into what passes for my personal creative process, discussion of different resources available for the self-teaching creative individual, and the opportunity to have input into my art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution as a patron: Your generosity will allow me to test out new materials, pay for tutorials and other learning resources, and participate in gallery shows and other opportunities to challenge myself and expand my skills, all while becoming a part of a supportive community that, as it grows, will\u00a0allow me\u00a0to pay it forward to others in return."
