    "summary": "Hello! Welcome to my little space on Patreon! I am so so glad you\u0027re here. Are you familiar with Patreon? I\u0027m pretty new, too. Here\u0027s hoping there\u0027s a learning curve. Let me show you around! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way I see it, makers gonna make. Patreon is for the creators and the createes who love them. It\u0027s for those of us who have grown suspicious of the middle men (and women) who want to take a cut without creating or consuming the art. They\u0027re selling tickets into the theatre.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, welcome to the new theatre! The basic gist is that if you support me (even just $1 a month) then you\u0027re a patron of my art. It also means I am glowingly grateful for you!\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow I got here\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce upon a time, I was a hot mess. I go into the details of all that messiness in the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/throwinglightpodcast/e001\"\u003efirst episode of my podcast\u003c/a\u003e, Throwing Light (one of my arts, bytheway). One day I realized that I didn\u0027t want to be such a mess anymore. More importantly, I didn\u0027t want my mess to spill over to other people. So I cleaned up my side of the street. Mostly. To be fair, I am still a hot mess sometimes. I\u0027m sure we all are. And the most beautiful thing I teach (and learn regularly) is that we are all allowed to be hot messes, sometimes. I believe we all have the capacity for more goodness and love than we could possibly imagine. And, on the other side, we all have the capacity for more cruelty and hate than we could possibly imagine. The problem? We know the second part. We are intimately aware of our demons. Most of us, anyway. But we downplay the love part. Because we\u0027re so bleeping guarded.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more I cleaned up, the more internal clutter I found. And the more I sought out ways to deal with what basically amounted to mental hoarding. I realized how many lies I had internalized\u2014I am not good enough; I am weak; I should be ashamed of myself. To work through it all, I read everything I could get my hands on. What do the Christians say? What do the new agers say? What do the psychologists say? What do the Jews say? What do quantum physicists says? Somewhere around the 18th book, I realized that I\u0027m not the only one struggling here. Slowly, a mission emerged. At the time, I called it wanting to partner with God in the restoration of Shalom on earth. Put simply, I wanted to leave the world a little better than it was when I got here. And I wanted to do that using my unique set of gifts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy unique set of gifts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am passionately interested in the intersections between evidence-based science and ancient spiritual wisdom. I\u0027m also highly empathic and intuitive. Almost to a fault. I come equipped with an unnerving amount of optimism that we really can make the world a better place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe podcast\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, the Throwing Light Podcast! This is where I put all my research to the test. My hope is that it feels like self-care for activists, creators, and dreamers who disguise themselves as ordinary human beings. Note: The gig is up. I know you are so much more than ordinary. I hope to start conversations. And I hope you chime in!\u00a0I upload a new episode every other week on #ThrowingLightThursday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWriting + speaking\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext, I make with words! I am a regular contributor for Care.com and HuffPost. I\u0027ve also written for Marie Claire, The Kitchn, Guideposts, and Thought Catalog. Sporadically, at open mic nights and readings in and around the DC metro area, I share poems. Upcoming events are announced at the beginning of each podcast, so you can check them out if you are so inclined. If you are a patron, you might even know before I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCoaching\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, I am secretly a coach. I do mainly one-off sessions by request, to bring clarity and spiritual direction. I am good at it. And it\u0027s a lot of fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSO, that is who I am and what I do. I am very very excited that you are here. I am even more excited to see the places that we will go together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDISCLAIMER: Politically, I tend to lean pretty far to the left. It\u0027s part of who I am. Inevitably, I will end up talking about #BlackLivesMatter or intersectional feminism or even the idea of a universal basic income. It comes out because it\u0027s what I believe, but what I also believe is that I could be wrong. And as long as you practice kindness and respect in your disagreements, you are wholeheartedly welcome here, even (or especially) if you disagree with me. I totally understand if it\u0027s not your cup of tea, and sometimes in my passion, I\u0027m not very good at recalling this disclaimer. But I want you to know that if you want to be here, you\u0027re invited.**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e** And that is true even if you\u0027re not a patron! I know not everyone is able to contribute. That\u0027s why the majority of my content is free. That\u0027s why Patreon exists. If you can support an artist and you want to, this is a really good way to do it.\u003cbr\u003e"
