    "summary": "I am an art photographer who creates history-focused photographic exhibits. Through my work, I aim to remind us all that every day we live on a \nfoundation built by those who preceded us \u2014 and that at present we are \nleaving our own legacy for future generations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got three exhibit projects going on in 2017.\u00a0 The one with international scope is centered on the life and times of Flora MacDonald who lived both here in North Carolina and in Scotland. And yes, this project includes work on both sides of the Atlantic!\u00a0 My aim is to have this ready for display by late in 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I have two exhibits on display. One opened on September 15th in Asheville and is centered on life in the NC Mountains. I shot this at the Vance Birthplace State Historic Site.\u00a0 It is called \u003cstrong\u003eThe\nMountains are Calling: At Home in Western North Carolina (c.1790-1830)\u003c/strong\u003e. This exhibit will be on display through the end of 2017 at the West Asheville Library. \u003ca href=\"http://www.brendascottarts.com/Blog-images/i-n5KFd2Z/A\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e This will move to the North Carolina Capitol Building and will be there January through April 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other exhibit that is currently on display is of some my favorites. It is called \u003cstrong\u003eInspirations\u003c/strong\u003e and will be up through the end of November in the \u003ca href=\"http://www.personcounty.net/departments-services/departments-i-z/parks-recreation/kirby-cultural-arts-complex/art-galleries/upper-gallery-schedule-2015-2016/november-2017\"\u003eUpper Gallery at the Kirby Cultural Arts Complex in Roxboro, NC\u003c/a\u003e. This is a great chance to purchase holiday presents. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Stagville: Black \u0026amp; White exhibit at the North Carolina Museum of \nHistory (a Smithsonian affiliate) included 64 of my images, a soundtrack\n by vocalist Yolanda Hall, and video interviews of Stagville \ndescendants. It  was on display for nearly two years, first in Raleigh, \nand then at the Museum of the Cape Fear in Fayetteville.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I found in doing this exhibit and working with wonderful people in the museums was that this exhibit could have reached even more people if the state had funding to help send it on tour. As an independent artist, I couldn\u2019t fund that myself, so I vowed that for future exhibits, I would find a way to fund my work so that \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eI could keep working on history-related exhibits without either going bankrupt or working myself to death by taking on a second job to fund my exhibit work and \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI can make my exhibit affordable - even for small museums operating on a shoestring budget.  \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003ePatreon allows you to become my patron and make all of this possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease support my work.\u00a0 All of my Patreon backers get access to behind-the-scenes work.\u00a0 Other perks include artist edition prints from me and even regular meetings.\u00a0 I am grateful for any amount. \u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "\u003ch3\u003eBiography\u003c/h3\u003eI am a fine art photographer and cellist based in Durham, \nNC. I have been making music since I was three and photographs since\n elementary school. Also trained as an organologist (one who \nspecializes in the history and development of musical instruments), I \nworked as a curator of a small musical-instrument museum for just over \n10 years before becoming a freelance photographer and cellist, and music \nand photography teacher.  Currently I am working on an exhibit called \"The Mountains are Calling\" based at the Vance Birthplace in Weaverville, NC. I continue to work on a longer-term, large-scale project called, \"My Bonnie Lies\n over the Ocean\"; a photographic exploration of connections between the \nPiedmont region of North Carolina and Scotland, using as its starting \npoint the legendary Flora MacDonald. My exhibit, \"Stagville: Black \u0026amp; White\" \nwas shown at the NC Museum of History, a Smithsonian affiliate, for 11 months before moving to the \nMuseum of the Cape Fear in Fayetteville, NC. I earned my doctorate at\n the University of Oxford (Somerville College), and hold degrees from \nUNC-Chapel Hill, Auburn University, and the Academy of Art University.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://brendascottarts.com/contact/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFull c.v. available upon request.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eArtist Statement\u003c/h3\u003eI\n am a photographer and cellist because I cannot imagine spending my life\n doing anything else. Music and photography have always been a part of \nmy life. My parents introduced me to both arts, even taking me to meet \nAnsel Adams, Rostropovich, and Yo-Yo Ma when I was a child. However, \nuntil recently, it did not strike me that a combination of photography \nand music could be my profession. Now I want to work as a photographer \nand cellist until I can no longer work at anything. The two fields work \ntogether. Originally I studied music, and my greatest cello teacher \ntaught me that there are at least five ways to play every musical \nphrase. His words echo in my mind as I work with my camera, guiding me \nto look at scenes in many ways. I\n have always felt a strong spirit of place; the land tells the stories \nof those who preceded us and of those who share our time. This is why I \nexplore places, looking for a visual and musical \u201cwhisper history.\u201d Visual\n and musical exploration are my adventure. I get lost in visual \nexperience or in a musical piece and feel as if I am a part of something\n much larger than myself \u2013 as if stories merely flow through me. This is\n the magical moment when I am both created and creator.\u003cbr\u003e",
