    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m BenDanTa, a gamer, trader, and general nerd. With the loss of most of my right hand in 2017 and the sudden need to adapt how I do everything, I have become acutely aware of how difficult life can be for people with disabilities. While I have come up with many ways to cope with the situation, I believe that it is my duty to help others like me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo this end I have built several devices to aid in living a normal life, and begun work on designing my own prosthetic hand, using modern technologies like 3D modelling and printing. However, I want to both raise awareness of the issues people face in similar situations, as well as design, test, and build various tools and prosthetics for anyone I can. For this, I will need some help, so that I can focus full time on these activities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledges that I receive will be used in 2 main ways. Firstly, to allow me the time and money to create designs for new prosthetics, and if I receive enough, to be able to find people in need and provide them with custom built, low-cost (or even free) prosthetics. Secondly, I will make videos both of me playing games with my assisting devices, and talking about issues surrounding adapting to life when changes like this happen. These videos will serve to increase awareness and hopefully help people to understand and cope with events such as what happened to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, Patron, for taking the time to read my intro, and for any support you are willing and able to give!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHuge thanks to Shademp, for helping me proof my Patreon and tidy it up; to FancyPants for logo and banner (coming soon) design; and to my wife, for everything, every day.\u003cbr\u003e"
