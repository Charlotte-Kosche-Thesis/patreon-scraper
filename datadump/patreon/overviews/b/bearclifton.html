    "summary": "Hi I\u2019m Bear Clifton.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve been a pastor for the last 25 years, but I\u2019ve written\nstories since I was a boy. I\u2019ve always believed in the power of story to change\nlives and change culture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPeople would always say to me in conversations where we\u2019d\ngrouse about Hollywood, \u201cWell why don\u2019t you do something about it?\u201d Well in\n2016, I decided it was time to try. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd so though it took more faith (or perhaps idiocy) than I\u2019ve\never exercised in my life, my wife and I sold our home, I stepped down from the\nchurch in Connecticut that I loved and served for 20 years, and we moved to\nHollywood so I could take a least a year off to write my little heart out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd what do I have to show for it? In 18 months, I have written\n3 movie scripts, a TV pilot with 4 episodes, a 300-page novel, and a 40-day devotional\non how to walk in purity in this modern sexual wasteland of ours (as well as lay the foundation for a new ministry built around the purity book, called \u003cem\u003eTrain Yourself Ministry.\u003c/em\u003e)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow I\u2019m entering into the most challenging part of this\nentire adventure: Attempting to get these projects into the hands of the movers\nand shakers in Hollywood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMarketing takes time, lots of time. And it takes money, lots\nof money. But there\u2019s the rub. Our resources are tightening, and so it\u2019s back\nto work, and back to finding work. And I\u2019m still doing what I can to get \u003cem\u003eTrain\nYourself Ministry\u003c/em\u003e off the ground. But with all this, comes less time to do the\nmarketing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou see the conundrum. But this is why Patreon is such a\ngodsend. Because it gives an artist the chance to raise essential funding\nneeded to keep their dream alive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo why should you take the chance in supporting this particular artist?\nWell it gets back to my original question to you. Do you want to see better shows,\nbetter movies, better entertainment coming out of Hollywood? Well, then here\u2019s\none practical way to do it. Help support a proven writer, and a lifelong pastor\nwho right now is on the front-lines of Hollywood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI can\u2019t guarantee you what will happen. I\u2019ve not come to\nHollywood like so many Christians have in the past saying: God sent me here to\nchange the world! I have no idea what might happen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut what I do know is each and every one of my projects has won\nor placed high in several major script contests. And I\u2019ve had several Hollywood\nproducers give me promising notes from a couple scripts. And I have a veteran\nagent who has offered to give me his help. And with a little push, and a lot of\nprayers, and some good fortune to smile on me, maybe this dream can become a\nreality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHow can you help? Using Patreon of your portal,\u00a0 you can set up a small account, and in ten minutes, everything\u2019s up and running. And if\nyou only want to give a one-time gift, it\u2019s easy to deactivate your account.  But for us, your support of any amount would\ntruly be worth more than words can say. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd please, if you know anyone who like you wants to see\nbetter entertainment from Hollywood, share this with them. Let them know of\nthis guy you know in Hollywood who\u2019s trying to make a difference. Direct them\nto my two websites. Have them write me. I\u2019ll answer any questions. Send you copies\nof any of my scripts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ll do the writing, if you\u2019ll lend a hand, and together maybe\nwe can change a little piece of Hollywood.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
