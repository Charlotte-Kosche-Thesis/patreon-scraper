    "summary": "Greetings and Salutations! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Shay Stewart-Bouley, better known to a lot of folks as \u003ca href=\"http://blackgirlinmaine.com/\"\u003eBlack Girl in Maine.\u003c/a\u003e By day, I am a non-profit \"admin extraordinaire,\" heading up the oldest continuously running anti-racist organization in the United States, \u003ca href=\"http://www.communitychangeinc.org/\"\u003eCommunity Change Inc\u003c/a\u003e. By night, I can be found at my digital home, \u003ca href=\"http://blackgirlinmaine.com/\"\u003eBlack Girl in Maine\u003c/a\u003e where (since 2008) I have written about life in Maine as a woman of color, growing into middle age and musing on the state of race relations in the United States, among occasional other topics. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years I was a freelance columnist for the \u003ca href=\"http://portland.thephoenix.com/news/144025-working-to-nab-the-working-class/\"\u003ePortland Phoenix\u003c/a\u003e, until it changed management in early 2015. I rejoined the Portland Phoenix in January 2017. My work has been featured in \u003ca href=\"http://bitchmagazine.org/article/mothers-of-intention\"\u003eBitch Magazine\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shay-stewartbouley/why-we-cant-waitmusings-o_b_7985934.html\"\u003eHuffington Post\u003c/a\u003e and in various regional publications. In 2011, I won a New England Press Association award for my writing on diversity issues in New England. I was also a contributor to \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Good-Mother-Myth-Redefining/dp/1580055028\"\u003eThe Good Mother Myth: Redefining Motherhood to Fit Reality\u003c/a\u003e, which was released by Seal Press in 2014. At one point, I was considered a top mom blogger though, as a \"bad mother\" (wink, wink), the mom-blogging world realized the error of its ways and cut me from such listings. I appeared (in fall 2012) via Skype on the \"Melissa Harris-Perry Show\" that once aired on MSNBC, I have have made an appearance on Maine Public Radio\u2019s \"Maine Calling\" show, I have done numerous speaking engagements in New England, I\u2019ve appeared on television network affiliate\u2019s broadcast of a roundtable on race relations, and I\u2019ve answered more than a few questions from Maine reporters and columnists when several racialized events have cropped up. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter almost a decade of blogging, I am making changes as I work to accommodate more voices at Black Girl in Maine. I am working to move from Black Girl in Maine the blog to Black Girl in Maine Media as a media hub for non-white voices as well as ally voices in Northern New England, BGIM Media will include blog posts, podcasts and hopefully more. I have long held to the belief that we need to look at who creates the narratives that we read and believe. In most places, the narratives are fed to us by white people who are often unaware of the biases and prejudices that are often projected in the messages they share, which in turn tends to keep things like white supremacy and institutional racism alive and well, in both subtle and overt ways. Now more than ever (especially as we see so many Black hosts in particular having their shows yanked recently from various channels like Comedy Central and MSNBC), there is a growing need for non-white voices to be heard and elevated, and my mission is shifting to do just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBGIM Media now has several regular contributing writers and I asking people who believe not only in me but independent Black media to support the expansion. It is not enough to hear independent voices regardless of race (or gender) because, in a world where Black and Brown women earn far less than our white counterparts, economic justice is a must. I am committed to ensuring that anyone who writes or works for me under the Black Girl in Maine mantle is compensated because, as groovy as exposure is, as I have learned over the years that the utility companies do not accept exposure as payment, nor can we feed our families on exposure (especially in a world where for women of color exposure via digital platforms is often a one-way ticket to harassment). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support at this time will ensure that not only can I continue to run and grow BGIM Media but will also allow me to make the investment needed to sustain and grow the site including a well overdue site re-design and upgrade. If you enjoy my words (whether on the blog, Twitter, Facebook, in person or otherwise), please consider supporting those words with a monthly pledge. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo amount is too small, and it helps ensure that Black Girl in Maine Media moves forward to create a space for voices that need to be heard. And yeah, it ensures that I continue to have access to luxuries such as indoor plumbing, food and a retirement free of Kitty Chow under the bridge while I am working on birthing and nourishing this larger vision. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what\u0027s in it for you? Aside from the groovy feeling of knowing that you are keeping the words flowing and creating more spaces for writers/creators of color, there are perks. All monthly patrons access to patron only postings and first cuts from the podcast which is moving closer to materialzing thanks to the help of a a few angels and my son, Milo the rapper. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017, it\u0027s hard out here for writers and writing for pennies or exposure is just not something I can afford to do anymore. So I hope that if the spirit moves you, you will consider becoming a monthly supporter at whatever level is comfortable for you. If you aren\u0027t comfortable or able to make a monthly pledge, a one time tip to my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/blackgirlinmaine\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePaypal\u003c/a\u003e is also greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for your support! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eXOXO\u003cbr\u003e"
