     "about": "Hi, I\u0027m Jen. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a photographer, visual artist, and writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating stunning imagery that evokes emotion is my passion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor me, photography is about blending creativity and technical skill to create images that are both honest and inspiring.  Whether I\u0027m photographing people, artistic concepts, or nature, my goal is the same - to capture the moments that make memories, and to create art from the everyday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt took me a while to realize that photography was more than just a hobby for me.  I\u0027ve spent years working as a digital artist - making games, creating marketing and advertising assets, and helping companies and clients alike present an image that represents their best qualities.\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago, my grandmother began showing signs of Alzheimer\u0027s disease.  She was the woman who taught me to paint, to love the mountains, and to admire nature for it\u0027s wild beauty.  Learning these past years how fleeting life can be, how quickly our realities can change, I realized how crucial it is to preserve the moments we cherish now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe people I have the honor of photographing all have one thing in common - they understand that our portraits are not just for us.  Portraits are for our children.  They are for our grandchildren.  Photographs are the legacy we leave behind, from our wedding photos, to the images we have taken to celebrate our changing lives and simple mementos.  They are art, they are stories, and they are what we will recall when we sit with those we love, years from today, recounting the dearest times of our lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy artistic experience and background is one of CG art, ranging from graphic design and interface design to illustration and 3d content creation. Over the past seven years I\u2019ve worked as a 3d environment artist, an animator and 2d artist in both the casino and gaming industries. In addition, I\u0027ve gained experience in web design, SEO, and social media integration/marketing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love music; live on art, writing, and photography; and thrive on good food, wine/beer, and conversation. If given the opportunity to travel to someplace new and interesting, I will jump at it. I seek adventure and love nature, have the utmost respect for animals, and am an advocate for environmental conservation. I also use a lot of Oxford commas - arguably more than I should.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.bluevervestudio.com\"\u003ewww.bluevervestudio.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
