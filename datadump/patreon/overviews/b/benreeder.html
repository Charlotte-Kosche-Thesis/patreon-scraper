Your\nsupport helps me maintain the quality of work without having to depend so much\non churning out content at too rapid a pace.

Every book I write has to go to an editor, and every book needs a cover.

It has given me the opportunity to meet current fans and make\nnew ones, folks I would never have had the pleasure of getting to know\notherwise. Your support will also help me extend my reach for conventions, not\nonly geographically, but also in terms of size. With any luck, I\u2019ll be able to\ncome to a convention near you!\u003cbr\u003e"
