    "summary": "We\u0027re the Baby Bunch, a \"system\" of alters (historically called multiple personalities) with a combined passion for ABDL, age regression, and similar themes.\u00a0Note that though we\u0027re all technically the same person, we don\u0027t always share memories or know the people that the others know, so don\u0027t be surprised if you\u0027re talking to one of us and then another of us has no clue what you mean. Here\u0027s a bit more information:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTegan\u003c/strong\u003e is the main one who uses this profile. She\u0027s mommy to a few little ones but generally pretty little (comparable to Lia) as far as mental age is concerned. She handles most of the admin/moderation work that we do in various community Discord servers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLia\u003c/strong\u003e is the constantly little but still capable member of the group. She has a bit of a tendency to alternate between overworking herself and not doing enough work. She\u0027s fairly happy and silly most of the time and not really likely to get upset at people in most cases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKatie/Katelyn\u003c/strong\u003e is the littlest of us all, usually unable to speak more than a few words. She can be a bit fussy but others say she\u0027s adorable. Though she won\u0027t be using this account, we included her on here because she was the reason we used to be called ABKatelyn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmily\u003c/strong\u003e is the distinctly more sexual and submissive one, much more focused on that than on the babyish aspects of ABDL stuff. She\u0027s been out more frequently as of late and likely will handle a lot of those themes when they occur in our work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe write as many ABDL or other niche related stories as we can and love doing it. We also program ABDL-related video games and have a few tabletop gaming related projects. This has become our full time job due to mental health reasons, so we need your support to continue doing it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: ABDL-related does \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0mean pornographic. Though we sometimes release stories with erotic or 18+ elements, our number one goal has always been to use the ABDL niche to create stories and games with genuine artistic value. In addition, if there could be any confusion about if a character is younger than 18 years old, we will refuse to write sexual or abusive content involving that character.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re currently working to regularly release ABDL-related games in addition to my commissions and comics. Due to necessary delays, we are no longer guaranteeing any release dates, as we\u0027d rather polish games for release than release them in an unfinished form. We\u0027re also working on a couple of comic project with Hira-Dontell; you can view\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/regularhouse\"\u003ethat relevant Patreon here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find our writing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thebabybunch.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon my deviantArt page\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/babybunch/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy FurAffinity page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin us\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.me/babybunch\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon Discord\u003c/a\u003e if you want to chat!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also regularly stream on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://picarto.tv/BabyBunch\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePicarto\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
