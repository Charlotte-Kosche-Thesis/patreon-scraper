    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGreetings human being or Artificial Intelligence!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou are welcomed heartily to my patreon!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo you came to my page and you want to know what its about huh? What is this dude up to?\u003cbr\u003eI am definitely not combining animals into creepy chymeras or making strange distorted illustrations that somehow end up cute. You won\u0027t see any strange magical beings or alien based lifeforms. Nope, nothing here like that one bit. Don\u0027t believe me? Well, I guess you\u0027ll just have to check it out for yourself. Be warned though, there may not be what I mentioned earlier, but you might come across some FREAKY DEEKY STUFF! Alright, lets jump in...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Myself...(if you really want to know)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Blake and I am an artist, or a creator of things...which means I take the craziness in my head and put it on paper in (hopefully) interesting ways. Sometimes things work and sometimes they are a lesson in failure that I can only gather the pieces of and try again with. Every time I try to create something I learn a new lesson about myself and my art. I work as a graphic designer at my day job and the rest of the time I freelance as an illustrator (that is when I am not shooting my bow or boxing). I live in Vancouver, WA and I love the trees here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBONUS FACT:\u003c/em\u003e I grew up in Nigeria, West Africa from the ages of 8-19. This has shaped my life drastically and has given me a value for life I am extremely thankful for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is this Page Exactly? \u003cbr\u003eITS MY PRIVATE ART COLLECTION BABY! \u003cbr\u003eMADE JUST FOR YOU!\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a place where I will post things I create, some of them will be posted to my instagram account, but a lot will be solely posted on here. You beautiful folks support me and you deserve to be rewarded for that with never before seen works! SO FEAST YOUR EYES and may your hearts and minds be filled with enjoyment. I will probably open up requests for you fine people at some point.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you even do art man? Whats like, your goals?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love illustrating. Ever since I was a little kid I would pour my imagination through the markers and pen onto the page and lose myself in it until something had formed before me. It gave me joy to see that I had given form to my ideas and showing other people and seeing them like it struck a chord in me that has given me much joy ever since. Ultimately, I would like to make a career or a steady side income from my illustrations. Who knows, maybe get connected with the right person and work on a big project that leads to another big project? If things go well join or make a studio and build large projects with talented people. The future is unknown, but I am very excited to open up this new way to connect with people and I want to build connections with folks who like my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eYOUR SUPPORT GIVES ME LIFEFORCE! \u003cbr\u003eWell, food and a house and a gym membership so really.... LIFEFORCE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLiving in Vancouver/Portland is expensive. Who knew right? haha yeah. The coast cities are always expensive. While my day job is great, I don\u0027t make enough there to support my great family with just that income. This is why I freelance illustrate and take odd jobs here and there. This place seems like a fantastic way to reach people who would like my work, and give them a chance to support me. The life of an artist is not an easy one, but it can be most fulfilling. So help me help you with some COOL WEIRD STUFF. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I give you anything dude? The internet is full of awesome artwork from all around the world and most of it is free!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes. The internet is an amazing tool and there is a massive world of art out there on it. And yes you can technically get art for free from the interwebs. BUT...somebody made that artwork. Somebody busted their rump to create it and HOPEFULLY they were compensated for it. I am not against throwing a freebie out there to the world, I have done plenty of this (check my instagram). But believe it or not it takes work to create good art. And by work I mean hours and hours of refining your skill, learning new techniques, buying the equipment, etc. Not only that, but you really cannot place a value on a GOOD IDEA. They come from somewhere deep in the mind and they are rare. A truly good idea is worth more gold than you can carry in your hands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eALL THAT BEING SAID - \u003cbr\u003eYou will not throw money into my well and walk away empty handed!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThere will be bonuses for people that support me. Depending on how much you give those bonuses can be pretty awesome! But even the smallest donations or messages are welcome. I want to hear from you great folks and I want to know if my work makes your day better or made you laugh (or creeped you out. theres a market for everything!). If you like it, say something!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf you have a request send it my way. The worst I can do is say no. And if you are paying the chances of me saying yes are very high. Just like Mr. Krabs, I love money (or all the things I can do with money to be exact).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you for the support, the friendship, the sarcastic comments \u003cbr\u003eand of course, the patronage!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Blake G. x dudedrawsstuff\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
