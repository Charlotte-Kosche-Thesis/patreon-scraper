My name is Johnathan, and I\u0027m a Gamer and Video Game Content Creator on YouTube and Twitch that posts daily Gaming Commentary Videos and Live Streams of various games including Kingdom Hearts, Mario, Zelda, and more. Gaming was always a hobby for me, just like many other people. However, as of 2007, I started molding my hobby into a career. Since 2012, YouTube has been my Full time job as well as Twitch in 2015.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Quick Patreon Explanation:\u003c/h1\u003eAfter 10 years of creating videos and 5 years of getting something out of it other than fun, it\u0027s become my life. Even if I had some other full time job, I\u0027d find a way to post videos or stream on the side as often as possible with or without getting paid to do it. At the end of the day though, money is needed to pay the bills and YouTube/Twitch aren\u0027t doing too well in terms of adsense. One of the issues with trying to make it as a Youtuber is over-saturation. Ad revenue gets split between more and more people every year, making it hard to fund the YouTube channels. On top of that, companies are starting to pull their advertising off of YouTube resulting in much less money to go around for creators. That\u0027s why I\u0027m reaching out. Any amount you can pledge to help keep my YouTube and Twitch channels afloat would be greatly appreciated!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eDisclaimer\u003c/h2\u003ePlease don\u0027t become a patron if you\u0027re low on money! Trust me, I know what that feels like. However, if you can pledge even $1 a month, every bit adds up and can help a lot! I will continue to make videos and do live streams because it\u0027s what I love to do and I know you guys enjoy it, but with enough support, it all might just be even better and more consistent!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHere are some awesome rewards for your Patronage!\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$1/month:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to my patron only Discord text and voice channels (private sections of a public Discord)\u003cimg src=\"https://discordapp.com/assets/fc0b01fe10a0b8c602fb0106d8189d9b.png\" style=\"float: right; width: 211px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFirst to get updates regarding the direction of my YouTube and Twitch Channels\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$3/Month (includes everything above)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/1/11/Twitter_bird_icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20111228065136\" style=\"float: right; width: 61px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI will follow you on Twitter (and give you a shout out)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/geekandsundry/images/4/40/Twitch.png/revision/latest?cb=20150310174638\" style=\"float: right; width: 88px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eYour name or username will be featured in\u00a0list of Patrons on my Twitch Channel and at the end of each video/stream!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$5/Month\u00a0(includes everything above)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://rocketdock.com/images/screenshots/wifi_icon.png\" style=\"width: 93px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eOn Twitch, you will have priority for matchmaking and can skip everyone else to play with me once per stream for games such as Mario Kart, Splatoon, Smash, and more!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$10/Month\u00a0(includes everything above)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/sitemap-cards/256/media-08-512.png\" style=\"float: right; width: 121px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003eEarly access to all my videos!
