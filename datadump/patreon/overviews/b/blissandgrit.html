    "summary": "Bliss + Grit is a weekly podcast in which long time friends Brooke Thomas and Vanessa Scotto are having conversations about being on a spiritual path in the modern world. What does that even mean? What is a real evolution of our lives? How do we embrace everything- the beauty and the crazy, the joys and the messes, the bliss and the grit that is a human life?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe explore more questions than answers each week by diving into where we are in our own unfolding, co-pondering questions from listeners, and by hosting conversations with spiritual teachers who we feel are high integrity human beings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show has been running for over a year now and it\u2019s grown into a beautiful community of heart-based truth seekers. Many of you have expressed the desire for more guidance, contact, and private conversation. In order to provide that level of support, we need to be able to devote the necessary time to this work. That means the show has to become a reliable source of income so that we can take time away from our other earning work and grow all that is possible for this community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn trying to sort out how best to do that we landed on a few possibilities: scrambling to host a ton of events, putting up a paywall, or getting advertisers- but ultimately what we really wanted was to support, and be supported by, the community itself. That makes Patreon a pretty fantastic option for us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a place where we can offer all of what you have been asking for. So, if learning more about where to begin on an embodied spiritual path, getting access to guided meditations or joining a forum where you can have discussions with us and other people in the B+G community, sounds interesting to you, or even if you just want to contribute as an energetic display of love, you\u2019re in the perfect place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re so happy to be able to offer this to you and to have you here with us. \u003cbr\u003e"
