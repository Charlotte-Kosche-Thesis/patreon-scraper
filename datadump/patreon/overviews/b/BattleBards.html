But, the fact is, these lutes are very expensive to make. We spend every cent we have to make new Audio and to build the Tools to use them. As a result we barely manage to keep the lights on at the end of the month. And that\u0027s why we\u0027re here. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003ePlease note: Our Patreon is not a discount store, nor a pre-sales channel.

We invested a few thousand dollars to custom create audio for our games and it all ended up being pretty freaking awesome! So we thought to see if anyone else would be interested in pooling together funds to create an entire TTRPG audio library and that\u0027s when we hit Kickstarter for the first time in 2013 under the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/105982873/realmsound-project-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRealmsound Project\u003c/a\u003e. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFour years and two successful Kickstarter projects later, we are now \"BattleBards\". Our community of Thousands of gamers (including us) have worked together to create 700+ Tailor-made audio Tracks and the Tools to use them for Tabletop Role Playing Games. BattleBards audio includes background music inspired by fantasy races, Environmental Soundscapes, Racial Languages, Monsterscapes, NPC scripts written to bring life to everyday character interactions, and a colossal array of bone crushing, spell fire blasting sound effects... We\u0027re all about adding another level of immersion to every game.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/28852582\u0026amp;auto_play=false\u0026amp;hide_related=false\u0026amp;show_comments=true\u0026amp;show_user=true\u0026amp;show_reposts=false\u0026amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat do you get for your Pledge?\u003c/h3\u003e\nAside from a hearty Thank You, there are some real tangible benefits for being a BattleBards Patron. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDepending on how you pledge\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e you can get access to the following benefits:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInsider News\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhat is the BattleBards team up to that no one else gets to know?

Patreon tracks will be driven by you guys and are not restricted to a single theme and they don\u0027t have to cover every type of audio we create (music, soundscapes, sound effects, monsterscapes, NPC scripts, Racial Languages). Maybe we just focus on Music and Sound Effects for example. Or maybe we cover everything. We want to put the decision in the hands of the community.\u003cbr\u003e"
