If you\u0027re here right now, you can probably relate!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to share that feeling through my music with as many of you as I can and, with Patreon, you can be a part of that journey with me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is basically an ongoing \"Kickstarter\" for content creators. You pledge a certain dollar amount per video I release, and get some awesome rewards as a \"thank you\" for your support. This is a place for those of you who aren\u0027t content with being casual observers and want to be a bigger part of my music.\u00a0Ultimately, we\u0027re building a unique community of people who love the the beauty of the guitar and the wonderfully nerdy music that I play more than anybody else in the world, and I would love for you to be a part of it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhere does my money go?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to bring you guys the best guitar videos on the internet!
