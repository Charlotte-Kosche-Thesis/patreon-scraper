    "summary": "Body Rocket is dedicated to reinventing athlete aerodynamics by integrating wind tunnel technology directly into your bike.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are developing the first direct force drag meter, meaning wind tunnel accurate readings but under real-world conditions. Unlike a car or aircraft, bikes can\u2019t be completely designed in terms of aerodynamics because the rider is 80% of the drag, and each person is different.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what the experts are saying:\u003cbr\u003e\"It would be a huge advantage against my competitors\" - \u003cstrong\u003eJames Macdonald\u003c/strong\u003e, world record holder - John O\u0027Groats to Land\u0027s End and back\u003cbr\u003e\"You have a brilliant concept\" - \u003cstrong\u003ePaul Lew\u003c/strong\u003e, Cycling engineering expert \u0026amp; advisor to NASA-UTM\u003cbr\u003e\"Takes a lot of v. difficult variables, like tyres and drivetrain out of the equation\" - \u003cstrong\u003eMichael Hutchinson\u003c/strong\u003e, author \u0026amp; former elite cyclist\u003cbr\u003e\"Body Rocket... ...will allow me to optimize my fit process and take it out on the road\" - \u003cstrong\u003eJessica Laufenberg\u003c/strong\u003e, owner, Rocket Bicycle Studio\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s estimated a typical pro has a CdA of 0.18-0.25, while an amateur has a CdA of 0.25-0.3. What does that mean? At 300 Watts that means 2.5 kph, or over 1 hour it\u2019s a savings of 3 minutes 37 seconds! Just because they have access to a wind tunnel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re building a community to help change that. Real-time drag data means real-world understanding. Actual race data, testing time limited only by your own schedule, deeper understanding of CdA changes with fatigue, ideal setups for flat courses vs. hills. We could go on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin us on our journey. Be part of the team as we go through lab testing, wind tunnel testing and, finally, road testing. Help us shape this into a useful tool, for pros and amateurs alike.\u003cbr\u003e"
