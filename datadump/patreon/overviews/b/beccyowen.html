Record labels have shown a strong interest in my music over the years, particularly when I was still a smooth-faced, malleable young woman, but I realised early on that what I really wanted was 100% creative control, rights retention of my babies (songs) and the ability to choose my own path. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHowever, the DIY approach can also mean very limited resources\u003c/strong\u003e are available to a struggling solo artist, and until the explosion of the internet, access to a wide network of people and opportunities has also sometimes felt limited.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEven in times of DIY hardship, I\u0027ve managed to keep self-releasing and distributing my music\u003c/strong\u003e on CD, vinyl and online. I\u0027ve had a lot of critical acclaim and have built a community of fans and an underground support system, but none of this has led to a career as a singer/songwriter that has been as financially sustainable. So I hustled for other work to keep myself afloat but stay in the \u0027game\u0027, notably choir leading, which I love, but which in recent years had got to a point where it had completely taken over my creative life and I found myself not writing my own music anymore or gigging much. In the process, I found myself becoming more mentally \u0027challenged\u0027, shall we say, having been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 earlier this year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSinging and songwriting gives me a purpose\u003c/strong\u003e, outlet and focus like nothing else and I\u0027m keen to get back to it and make it sustainable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn July 2017 I gave up all my community and education work\u003c/strong\u003e (with the exception of a new project called \u0027Beccy Owen\u0027s Pop Up Choirs, but that\u0027s another story) with the sole plan of re-focussing my energies on writing and performing my music again. SQUEAKY BUM TIME, EH!? With all of that in mind, and after some serious thought and research, Patreon felt like a natural home for me and my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI should also say that I\u0027m new to Patreon \u003c/strong\u003eand so I\u0027m working it out a little as I go, even as I write this here blurb!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome of you may have stumbled across this page having never heard my music\u003c/strong\u003e or seen what I\u0027m about. Welcome! There are going to be some videos here that will bring you in to my general vibe and give your bonce and ticker* (*head and heart) a chance to probe my shtick (not a euphemism). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome of you may have been supporting my creative endeavours for years\u003c/strong\u003e, at gigs, buying albums, via crowdfunding, as a friend of my facebook ramblings and through various blogs and vlogs. You\u0027ll also have seen that over the last two years I\u0027ve been getting into pottery and yarn as well as music, with lots of you buying my \"hand knitted lullaby album\" and taking an interest in my new found passion for clay as a novice \u0027thrower\u0027. I don\u0027t now how much of that will feature as part of my Pateron account, but it\u0027s worth mentioning and saying thanks for all the support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU.

Basically: it\u0027d mean the actual world to me and be a motivating force for me to continue to write and record my music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you like what you see and hear, you might decide to become a patron\u003c/strong\u003e of my work.
