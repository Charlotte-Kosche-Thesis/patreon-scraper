    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Benny James!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a new-ish musician and voice actor in the world of podcasts! Currently I compose for the following podcasts: LEARN, The Lavender Ladies, Dining in the Void, and Project Ozma. Each podcast (other than Ozma since it\u0027s still in development) has episodes, music, and other various content for you to view! I compose music for each of these podcasts and voice Sine for LEARN, and do some voices here and there for The Lavender Ladies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you\u0027re here to purchase music for your podcast, video, or any sort of project, here\u0027s how we can make that happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStep One: Contact me at bennyjamesg14@gmail.com. There you and I can meet and talk about whatever kind of music you\u0027re looking for, and if I\u0027m the person that can do that for you, than we\u0027re in business!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStep Two: Discuss prices relating to length of piece and the amount/kinds of instruments you would like. Here\u0027s how that works:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInstrument Pricing: \u003c/strong\u003eUsing one (1) instrument in your song starts at $3, and each additional instrument you would like to add is another $3. So one (1) instrument is $3, two (2) instruments is $6, and etc. etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTime Length Pricing: \u003c/strong\u003eA song/piece starting at one (1) minute is $3, and each additional minute to the piece is another $2. So a one (1) minute piece is $3, a two (2) minute long piece is $5, etc.\u003cbr\u003eSide Notes about Length: If you want to save money and just get a shorter piece that you can loop, that\u0027s completely acceptable! Also, minute lengths will be rounded \u003cstrong\u003edown to the nearest minute, \u003c/strong\u003ewith the exception of anything under one (1) minute will still be $3 minimum.\u003cbr\u003eThe length and amount of instruments will be combined for a final total for the song. For example, the full version of the theme song to LEARN is one (1) instrument and 3:56 in length. So that would be: $3+$7=$10 Total\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStep Three: Once we\u0027ve discussed what you want for your piece and I send you (in a timely manner) a song(s) you deem acceptable to your needs, I will write up a total bill for each song, and then you just come back here and hit \"Become A Patron\" and enter the amount of money you owe!\u003cbr\u003e"
