You may know me\nfrom my growing YouTube channel BitsBytesBobs, otherwise known as 3b. At 3b, I\naim to provide a good mix of helpful videos on getting the most from the tech\nthat you already own. That manifests itself in the form of getting the best\nfrom your TV; calibration guides, setup guides, what to look for with a new TV.\nTo your audio equipment, getting the best sound, for least amount of money and\nwhat services to use and why. There are many How To\u0027s and guides on the\nchannel. Combine that with reviews, discussions, news and talking points. I\nexplain technical jargon in simple terms, more so I can understand them too! The\nchannel is growing steadily, we have re-branded recently and changed the entire\nlook and feel, but we know there is more we can do to serve you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat Do You Get By Being A Patreon of 3b?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nWith Your Support of 3B, I Support You \u0026amp; Your Tech!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e(oh and you get 4K comparative review downloads too!)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHere\u0027s the cool part! As a Patreon, you will also have\naccess to me directly. Depending on your level of support, you will get access\nto me, 7 days a week, on any tech related issue, question or advice that you\nseek.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHow you use this service I aim to provide to you, is\nentirely up to you. It could be you are looking for a new TV and want to run\nsome ideas by me. Or, you have a Hi-Fi and want to get better sound from it,\nand need some advice on what you have already and what you can do to improve\nit. Perhaps you\u0027ve an issue that you can\u0027t get help from anywhere else, and you\nneed someone to consider all aspects of all the connected devices. Manufacturer\nsupport, will only support their own brand, but many modern homes and gadgets\nconnect to other brand products. Meaning having to seek support with numerous\nmanufacturers for one single problem. An almost impossible task. Yet, when you\nget me, with your support of 3b, I support you and your Tech.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4K Comparative Review Downloads included! YouTube will not allow me to produce videos that show real World use of Movies, TV, Streaming in SD, HD and 4K. Simply due to copyright issues of showing such content. Even when it\u0027s for something like this. However, I can provide this to you privately. Therefore, ALL Patreon members get access to the downloads of the 4K, uncompressed comparative review using 4K UHD Bluray movies, HD bluray and SD/HD/4K streams to show how the reviews on firmware, TV\u0027s and more work out.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy supporting BitsBytesBobs, you support the growth and\nexpansion and become a deeper part of the reason why the channel exists; to\nbuild a community of like minded people together, to help one another and share\nin our love of tech. Your support and commitment will allow the channel to\nincrease it\u0027s output, increase production values and cover wider and more\ntopics. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0027t Take My Word For It....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePawPaw is a subscriber to the BitsBytesBobs (3b) channel, listen to his thoughts on what he gets from the channel and how I have personally helped him with his tech.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b466jRbCeEk\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLet\u0027s Grow 3B \u0026amp; Also Let Me Support You!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy goal for 3b is for it to grow and expand. As a channel\non YouTube, it\u0027s very difficult to do that effectively, we all have limited\ntime, money and available hardware to achieve the ideal in terms of production,\nquantity and resources. Attracting new subscribers for any channel is a\nchallenge, with high production values being expected by many viewers, without\nthe clear understanding of the what those production values required. At 3b, I\ndo my best with what I have, but it could and needs to be better. Content is\nrelated to what I have available, and any young channel is not going to attract\nthe manufacturers, meaning I have to be even more creative.  A few months ago I made a commitment to you,\nto the 3b channel, to spend more of my time doing videos and increasing the\nproduction values. To that end, I believe we have made progress, but could do\nmore. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat more requires more of my time and more resources, far\nand beyond what YouTube currently brings in from advertising and what I have in\nexpendable income. Combine that with just recently, the YouTube police causing\nme a great deal of issue with demonetizing the entire channel, for no reason. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis lead me to think towards Patreon, but I didn\u0027t want\nto do what many channels appear to ask, and that\u0027s simply for you to donate.\nPerhaps it\u0027s because I\u0027m old school, but I also believe that you should get\nsomething in return that has true value to you, and what I can give you is\nunique to my channel... that thing is me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPlease consider support this Patreon and in so doing I\nwill support you and your tech, your contribution will help foster the growth\nof the channel and together we can support each other.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank You!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
