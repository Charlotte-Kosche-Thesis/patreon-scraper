Lakes, rivers, ponds, oceans, pools, tubs...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been a defining force throughout our lives. And we pay very close attention to how other people think, feel, talk, and act towards water. What we notice is truly amazing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we went looking for a book, a conference, a conversation, or film focused on the full, true value of healthy wild waterways we found that spot on the shelf quite empty.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, now our job is writing books, articles, organizing summits and workshops, teaching, researching, giving talks, and contributing to films that fill that gap, connect the dots, to help people live better on this water planet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe old story of water is out of date, has served us poorly and has resulted in a globally undervaluing of healthy waters and oceans.

Water is our client.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe work \u003cem\u003ewith\u003c/em\u003e a wide range of organizations, businesses, agencies, movements, and individuals to tell the new story of water while building on relationships that go back several decades. You could say that we are growing, widening, and deepening the \u003cem\u003eBlue Mind\u003c/em\u003e Experience on a daily basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are very fortunate to collaborate with a wildly talented and creative team of neuroscientists, psychologists, artists, teachers, and watermen and women with diverse skills, so our approach is interdisciplinary and our reach is global. And as our patrons, we work for \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have no salaried jobs or formal paid academic positions.

This approach also allows us to share Blue Mind with all of our partners to help them do what they do even better. It\u0027s kind of like \"Vitamin Blue\", some have said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe old story we\u0027ve long told about water is outdated\u003c/strong\u003e, you could even say it\u0027s dangerously incomplete. Some have said it\u0027s \u003cem\u003eboring\u003c/em\u003e. Really, it\u0027s not easy to make this subject boring! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe result of this perpetually boring, outdated, and incomplete story is that waters and oceans are undervalued and whenever anything or anyone is undervalued, bad things happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs our client, we seek to share water\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003enew\u003c/strong\u003e story as far and wide as we can. We build networks, generate new research and compile the best science - and then we share what we learn widely and wildly.

Those have been ignored, downplayed, or discarded in favor of important economic, ecological, and educational aspects. This is a common observation across many sectors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWater makes life possible, of course. But it also makes life worth living. Healthy, clean blueways and oceans are also medicine - both for physical and mental health - for those who need it most.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlue Mind is leading a revolution in our thinking about the true value of water and we invite you to join us. You have many talents, skills, and gifts and we\u0027d like to put them to good use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to share our message widely and wildly, to change the conversation so that \u003cem\u003eevery\u003c/em\u003e human understands the true full value of clean, healthy water, blueways, and oceans.
