    "summary": "Hi I am J.R. Bjornson and I make videos and Podcasts on this thing called the internet. I am also legally blind, this is because I can not wear glasses due to an eye condition I have called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1200372-overview\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePeter\u0027s Anomaly\u003c/a\u003e. Because I am blind in the eyes of the Canadian government. I can not drive or operate any kind of motor vehicle. I can see a little bit, but at the same time legally I am blind. I read Braille, and use screen readers on my computer to do every day tasks like email and social media. I have 2 amazing boys ages 3 and 6 with another one on the way, and my high school sweetheart, now my wife. I love to make videos on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/jrbjornsonvideos\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube Channel.\u003c/a\u003e The videos I enjoy making are called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/0VQzHmOgK1w\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDaily Vlogs\u003c/a\u003e. In these videos you can find me sharing my thoughts and what I learned about that day of life. I also enjoy throwing in a how to video regarding\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/Fn8KaEvVDe4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebeing blind.\u003c/a\u003e I like sharing how to advice with others who have any questions about mobility and being blind or low visioned. My Number One favourite thing to do for fun is my podcast. I host a podcast called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/j-r-bjornson\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe J.R. Bjornson Random Show Podcast\u003c/a\u003e on Sound Cloud.\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see the Internet keeps me busy for most of my time. It is a kind of busy I would never give up for anything, because I do this part time, I always have room for a job if one shows up or if I get a job. One thing I have learned about being legally blind, is that hardly anyone wants to higher you due to your visual condition. Most who do not higher me because they say, \"You are a liability and a risk\" Pretty rough right? That is my normal, but one day I believe someone will give me a chance, and I will land a full time job being able to help support my family.\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a great place where people who also enjoy what I do when it comes to creating content can give a little something back in the form of a monthly donation. At the end of each Month Each Patron who donates monthly is entered into a draw for a chance to win a fun prize. Usually in the form of a USB Drive or SD Card, and a signed Braille picture. Thank you for stopping by and thinking about joining the Patrons. Remember a little bit goes a long way. Like that cup of coffee or bottle of water."
