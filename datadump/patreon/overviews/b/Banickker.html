I write short stories about four different worlds that are all linked, despite them all being very different they are all tied together by the same mad god. I try to release four stories a month, each one representing a different world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY AM I ON PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to write as a job and this seemed like a viable medium for me to obtain money. I also think this is a great way for creatives to receive money based on how much people are willing to pay.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY SHOULD YOU DONATE TO ME?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn order for me to continue writing at an increased quality, I will need money to allow myself to write all day without worrying about eating. If I cannot get these funds I will be incapable of getting quality stories of my world to you in a frequent fashion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE IS MY WRITING?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing is currently located on my own personal website, I would encourage you all to have a look and see if it is something you would be interested in seeing developed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://enterthehollow.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://enterthehollow.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is all in early stages but the more funding I receive will increase the frequency in which I can upload content. My current rate is one short story a week. I would thoroughly enjoy the idea of upgrading my website to allow better viewing, sadly I do not have the time right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as my website I now upload spoken versions of my stories to my YouTube channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnU4X_l7MxZEUOEQIayq9Rg?view_as=public\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnU4X_l7MxZEUOEQI...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSCHEDULE\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn short I have no schedule as my work load varys, below is my aim once I have more free time:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery Saturday 12:00PM NZ Standard time - Short story\u003cbr\u003e(Four shorts to be released a month)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery Wednesday 10:00pm NZ standard time - talking story on Youtube\u003cbr\u003e(Four spoken stories a month)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHoping to be able to set a fuller schedule with additional content with more funding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBottom line\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAll my writing is free, and it always will be. I write because I love to write, but I would love to write for a job. With funding I can dedicate the remainder of my life to writing.\u003cbr\u003eI have nothing else but the promise of writing quality content as a reward, that is why I do not want anyone donating over $1 a month. If anyone here could think of an award for higher donations please tell me, I would be willing to listen.\u003cbr\u003eI want this to be my job but I want it to be in a way that I do not exclude people from my works just because they don\u0027t have money.\u003cbr\u003e"
