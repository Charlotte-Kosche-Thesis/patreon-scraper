    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHey there! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are\nBad Mary, a punk band from New York! Critics say our sound is like New York in the\n70\u2019s but with a modern vibe - which isn\u2019t surprising since our main influences\ngo from Blondie and The Ramones, to Green Day and Paramore. Our music is an in-your-face\ntake on life in our current culture. We like to hold up a warped, fun-house\nmirror to the world we see around us and we definitely don\u2019t take ourselves too\nseriously.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBad Mary is\nlike this little circus that happens where we basically say, \u2018You know what? We\ndon\u2019t give a shit, we\u2019re having a good time\u2019. We want to push back on all the\ncrap going on in the world because that\u2019s not what\u2019s important, that\u2019s not\nwhere your life is \u2013 life is in the fun and the joy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u2019s the deal with Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecoming\na patron gives you access to the Bad Mary community where you will be the first\nto learn what\u0027s in the works, receive updates, and will be able to interact directly\nwith us and other Bad Mary patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere\nare also additional levels that include access to the complete songwriting\nprocess for our new album. Seriously -  completely\nunfiltered access to every rehearsal and writing session. You can also choose\nto get downloads of rough demo tracks that will never be available to anyone\nbut our patrons. And if that\u2019s not enough, you can get monthly Q\u0026amp;A sessions\nwith the band where we answer any questions you might have \u2013 and hey, we might\nask you questions too! We\u2019d love to know what you think about the direction we\u2019re\nheaded in, how the new stuff sounds, or whatever we think of.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are\ntotally excited to get started and hope you will come along for the ride. Got to\nadmit, we\u2019re kind of nervous about turning the cameras on but we think we can\nmake some great music together and we know, no matter what, it\u2019s going to be a\nblast. We\u2019re also looking forward to getting to know you all a little better\ntoo. Thanks! See you soon!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
