    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome, and please come inside. Watch that first step; it\u0027s a doozy. Please make yourself at home, although you may not want to make yourself too comfortable as you may not be able to escape the madness. I\u0027ll pop the kettle on and see if I can rustle us up some afternoon tea. The Mad Hatter promised me that he\u0027d pop by soon.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eLet me tell you a little bit about myself. I\u0027m an Aussie multi-genre writer. For as long as I can remember I have walked in many worlds; I usually have characters, settings, and ideas running through my head. I often joke\nthat inside my head are multiple doorways to other worlds, and that many\ncharacters run from one door to another. It makes for some interesting\nconversations (both in the real world and with my characters).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI can\u0027t remember a time when I haven\u0027t been creative; writing, singing, putting on plays, drawing ... well you get the idea. I\u0027ve always been\u00a0 eager to gather experiences\nand knowledge. I call myself a jack-of-all-trades, which in modern times is\nsometimes viewed as an insult but its term that is very apt for me and one that\nI wear with pride. I find it incredibly frustrating to wear only one hat, and\nover time I have gathered many skills. Some skills need refining, and that is a\nchallenge that I am up to. There is always something new and shiny out there to\nlearn. I often find people asking me if I have some particular skill that they\nneed, and I\u0027m always quick to answer that I\u0027m happy to learn.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am a Mum of 4 (although currently only my daughter resides\nwith me) and I find creating and parenting often go hand in hand. I am not a\ncreator that is a Mum, or a Mum that is a creator; I am both equally. But being\na Mum often needs to take precedence, and it can be a challenge to balance both, although it\u0027s getting easier now that the children are\ngrowing, and can understand what Mummy does.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nChildren cannot live on words. They cannot live on stories.\nStories can feed their soul, but not their bodies. My own health issues have\nadded to the challenges. I have anxiety issues, depression and complex PTSD\namong other issues, which makes going out to work in a traditional job a lot\nharder than I would like. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy writing files (both on devices and in many notebooks) are full of the many writing projects that I have been working on; including, but not limited to, poems, comic series,\nseveral series of books, stand alone books, movies scripts, lyrics and more. Most days I feel like Alice in Wonderland with the\namount of impossible thoughts I have before breakfast. I am slowly bringing these projects to life. Since January 1 2017, I have been slowly organising these files and I\u0027ve been writing daily. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main goal for 2018 has been to complete more work, and I\u0027m happy to say that I\u0027m on track with that too. My focus is to bring as many of these projects to final draft stage, until I am at a point where I can take the next step and hire people to work with me. I\u0027m fortunate to have many incredibly talented friends that are supportive and willing to work with me. I value their work, and will not hire them on promises alone. But before I can hire anyone to work with me I need to\u00a0find a way to provide\nfor my children. We\u0027ve had an unfortunate run of horrid luck, but I\u0027m\ndetermined that I will continue to dig my heels in and find a way to support my children through my writing. I have experience as a proof-reader and editor and in the near future I\u0027ll be offering my services for hire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the past, patronage was much more of a thing than it is\ntoday. It was recognised that in order to have the freedom to create, creators\nneeded support. Not at the end, when there is something to sell, but during the\nprocess. I am up setting up an account on Patreon, primarily to keep me on track\nwith my writing and other creative pursuits, and also in the hopes that passersby\nwill spare a few coins in my hat. In return, you will have my gratitude, sneak\npeeks at the madness behind the scenes, the opportunity to name characters, or\npossibly have a character based on you, and access to other goodies that I\nmight be able to offer. I am prolific with ideas, and when I keep myself on\ntrack, I am a prolific writer too. I write for many audiences, so there is\nbound to be something of interest for many.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have had an article published in a magazine in the U.K, a\npoem published years ago in an international poetry book, and I have had 13\nshort stories published in 6 anthologies (\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/-/e/B00ESEB5U8)\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehttps://www.amazon.com/-/e/B00ESEB5U8)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for your support ... oh and that sounds like the Mad Hatter is here. Please be a dear and let him in; the feast is almost ready.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
