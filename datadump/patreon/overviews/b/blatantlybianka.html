    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout The Creator:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBianka is a 23-year-old San Francisco-based writer, filmmaker, actor and musician. Though well-versed and interested in Politics (which she majored in at Bard College), she has been involved with an array of film, music and print media projects throughout her adolescence, undergraduate and post-graduate years. Bianka is currently pursuing her graduate degree in Film at California College of the Arts. Bianka\u0027s decision to pursue The Arts came subsequent to her understanding of how our present society functions: Our generation is enthralled by messages which are expounded via visual, performance and print art and media, resulting in a general proliferation of awareness and advocacy for crucial social and political movements of this time. Since recognizing this, Bianka has conjured in her mind that it is her duty as both an artist and a socially-aware citizen to disseminate progressive ideologies through her works\u2014both fictional and nonfictional.\u00a0She is the (Executive) Producer and Director for \u003cem\u003eBlatantly Bianka, \u003c/em\u003eas well as the lead actor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBianka\u0027s hobbies and interests outside of filmmaking and acting include music production/rapping and comedy. And sometimes sports (but she\u0027s a deep artsy betch nowadays).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSeries Summary:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA series-long exploration of Bianka, a queer, mixed-race, and often distracted multidisciplinary artist struggling to achieve financial, emotional and romantic stability in her life. To everyone around her, she\u0027s clearly gifted in her crafts, but Bianka has a difficult time understanding this herself. Her occasional spouts of self-doubt (a product of living as the family disappointment for not pursuing Law School and instead, moving to San Francisco to become the next Childish Gambino) generally supersedes her frequent moments of creative genius and interferes with any semblance of success she is close to attaining. Because of her keen ability to advise others, psuedoconfidence and cunning persona, Bianka appears unbothered to the masses. Her two best friends, Frankie and Geneva (Gen), are the only two people in her life who actually detect her reoccurring discontents, and consequently, act as her own personal (wacky) confidantes on the journey towards self-understanding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProduction/Release Timeline:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are currently in the production of Season 1 for\u00a0\u003cem\u003eBlatantly Bianka\u003c/em\u003e! The test pilot was released on Bianka\u0027s personal channel on January 1st. It was because of the receptive feedback Bianka received that a week later she went ahead and declared production for a whole series. Since early January, Bianka has casted the project\u0027s main roles, has written 4 episodes (of the 8 total episodes in Season 1), and has completed production on episode 2 (which will be released at midnight tonight, February 14th!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBianka is looking to wrap production for Season 1 by mid-April, with episodes to be released consistently every three weeks (Wednesdays). Episodes may become more frequent if we get enough Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Your $$ Will Go Towards:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eLOCATIONS/PERMITS.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFilming in San Francisco is expensive! In order to diversify the visual aesthetic in the series, we\u0027ll need money to pay location owners to shoot in/on their properties. These include (but are not limited to) bars, restaurants, cafes and parks. 25% of any earnings attained through this Patreon will go towards on-location shooting costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eACTORS/CREW.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to compensate my main actors and crew for their time and skill. 50% of this Patreon\u0027s earnings will go towards crafty (food on set) and PAYING actors/crew!\u00a0Yay for artists supporting artists!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eEXISTENCE/extra stuff.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a self-employed creative curating my own platform, I need money to eat/pay the bills! I will be using 25% of any earnings attained here to go towards my well-being, and any extra things that may be needed for set!"
