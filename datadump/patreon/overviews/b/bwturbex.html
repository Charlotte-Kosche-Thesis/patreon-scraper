We explore abandoned places and seek the\nbeauty in decay. Buildings were not left to rot for no reason \u2013 every abandoned\nsite has its own unique story hidden behind forgotten walls.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLet us take you on a journey through time in our\nepisodes. Together we are visiting unseen places and trying to lift secrets\nbehind closed doors; and all of this in the best possible\nquality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4169/34651135966_8f6939f249_b.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHelp us reach the next level!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are\ninvesting a lot of time and love in our project Broken Window Theory \u2013\nas well as a lot of money, which is fine because\u003cstrong\u003e we love what we are doing\u003c/strong\u003e! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, we have set high standards for us and our videos. We\nare always looking for ways to improve our work. Unfortunately, we have already reached the limit of\nwhat is possible to achieve with our current equipment. But new technology is\nreally expensive. We would love to upgrade our cameras, lenses and video editing hardware to produce even better content for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn addition, we would like to travel longer and to\nmore distant locations. At\nthe moment, it is only possible to compensate the food and fuel costs of\nshorter road trips with the monetization of our YouTube videos. But we have so many great ideas\nand plans for the future which are only feasible with your support.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e100% of the money we earn with Broken Window Theory will be invested in our project!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGive and take: the principle of reciprocity\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you gave\nsomething to us, it would only\nbe fair to give something back to you.
