    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi! We\u2019re Joe Robson and Rob Bright, long-time Japan residents and the brains and brawn behind BeerTengoku.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet us tell you about why we\u0027re here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started BT in July 2014 to introduce English-speaking people to the world of Japanese craft beer, and since then we\u2019ve seen our site grow far beyond our expectations. This year we hit over 90,000 visits to the site! That\u2019s amazing for us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love doing the site, and sharing our knowledge and passion about Japanese craft beer with everyone. Over the past three years we\u2019ve realised that we want to keep doing this for as long as we can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to keep doing the site for as long as humanly possible- I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to drink beer? - but that means:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn order to keep BeerTengoku going for as long as we can, the site needs to be able to sustain itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, we\u2019re paying for everything out of our own pockets from our full-time regular jobs. If you read the site, you know that we don\u2019t run any advertisements, and we\u2019re proud of that. But it does mean that every single bar and beer has been reviewed using our own funds. Not to mention the site administration and maintenance costs, and of course the time spent behind the scenes on the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur current costs look something like this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith an increase in traffic comes an increase in server costs. Currently our site hosting and naming costs come to \u003cstrong\u003e$210 a year.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTravelling for brewery interviews and bar reviews comes to \u003cstrong\u003eabout $100 a month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActually buying and drinking the beer can cost\u003cstrong\u003e between $100 and $200 a month, \u003c/strong\u003edepending on the beer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo an average month on the site currently costs us \u003cstrong\u003eabout $320\u003c/strong\u003e, or \u003cstrong\u003eabout $3800 per year.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past, costs were easier to cover because the site just wasn\u2019t that big. We weren\u2019t travelling so much or hunting down obscure beers. There was still so much right on our doorstep and in our convenience store for us to review.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut now we\u2019ve reached a point where we\u2019re travelling further afield for bars and breweries and buying way more beers just to keep up with what\u2019s coming out. And that\u2019s where our wallets start to take the hit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, we\u2019ve decided to turn to Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Patreon is a great way for our wonderful and generous readers to pledge whatever they want per month, and the amount is recurring after that. It isn\u2019t a one-time donation, so anything from $1 a month upwards is a huge help to us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is what we\u2019ll do with the money.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur initial goal is \u003cstrong\u003e$250 a month.\u003c/strong\u003e This will cover all of the site\u2019s basic costs, and give us a little leeway for any eventualities like broken computers, database tantrums and exploding beers. \u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019ll also allow us to work on some projects like the BeerTengoku app, designing merchandise and redesigning the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s it! Thank you so much for reading and we hope you consider pledging some money to us. Cheers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Joe and Rob\u003cbr\u003e"
