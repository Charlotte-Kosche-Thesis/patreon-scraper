    "summary": "Friends, With your help I am creating a book entitled \"I Want to Write a Memoir Too\". Your financial help is not really help so much as, you owe me. The help that you will truly be giving me by signing up for my Patreon is through the monthly obligation I am making to you to complete at the most 10 pages of a 100 page graphic novel about my life. I am not more interesting than other people - far from it actually. I am however funnier than a lot of people, sometimes on purpose and sometimes by accident. On top of being funny I can also write a good story. You will not regret receiving monthly updates from my page. Aside from writing comics, I write performance art. Performance art has been an amazing outlet for dealing with all sorts of the most fucked up parts about being alive. It is a consent I give myself to let go of inhibitions. It is not about being successful. It has nothing to do with being pleasing. When I say I write performance art I mean I write actions. It is contrived, but real and also funny. My intro video here is me crying braiding my hair, hilarious. Hair braiding and crying in performance art are derivative, just trust me on that, and when I was thinking about this\u00a0derivativeness in art and my own art while braiding my hair I just started crying, which was easy because I am actually extremely depressed at the moment, ready to cry at any moment when left alone. The performances from this Patreon will be exclusive to Patreon members only, as well as, the comics for the most part. (I do not plan on including all the comics in the final book.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn addition to the \u0027I Want To Write a Memoir Too\" updates \u0026amp; performances Patreon members will get exclusive weekly 3:00 Book comics, zines in the mail periodically, cat costumes, greeting cards \u0026amp; my undying appreciation for supporting me financially\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdel\u003e, which is most important - since we live under a capitalistic fascist government that does not fund art making and only independently wealthy people or those who are lucky are able to afford to make a living from art making.\u003c/del\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
