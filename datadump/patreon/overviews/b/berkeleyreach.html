    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eBerkeley Rationality and Effective Altruism Community, assemble!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the beginning of March, I rented out the bottom floor of Event Horizon and began running it as an EA coworking and guest space. So far the space has hosted: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTwo weekly meetups\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWednesdays 7pm: EA meetups, with rotating community members running hour-long talks or workshops and 10-20 people attending\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTuesdays 8:30pm: Rationalist Meditation\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBi-weekly Bio risk meetups starting this week (Tuesday 7pm)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOne-off community events (Opening event, Machine Learning Reading Group, LessWrong Launch Party, Game Day, etc.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGuests staying in the guest bedrooms about half the time\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e3 private events (Rationalist Seders, private coworking day for a small company)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIn all, over 100 unique people have attended events in our first month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I do not have an external source of funding* for The Berkeley Rationality and Effective Altruism Community Hub (\u003ca href=\"http://www.bayrationality.com/about-the-berkeley-reach\"\u003eThe Berkeley REACH\u003c/a\u003e), I have so far funded this project out of pocket (which is not sustainable for me). I am running this Patreon campaign to see if the community wants this space to continue existing as a public good enough to collectively fund it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main ways we expect the community center to be used:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eproviding event space for intellectual, growth-focused events\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eproviding space for social, community-building events\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eproviding a space to collaborate on existing projects\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eproviding space and support for helping people in the community brainstorm about and start new endeavors\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eproviding guest space for out of town guests and new community members\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eproviding classes and activities for kids so that parents in the community have low cost, enriching options for the kids\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the community center to succeed, it should be a gathering place. We\u2019ll need people to show up for coworking, host events here, find project collaborators here, and gradually make it a true hub of the EA and rationalist communities. Before any of that is possible, though, we need money to keep the lights on and the rent paid.  If this Patreon goes well, I\u2019ll set things up so donations go through a nonprofit and are tax deductible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like the idea of a community center but don\u2019t like the way it is being run, I encourage you to give direct feedback! I invite you to either send an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:theberkeleyreach@gmail.com\"\u003eemail\u003c/a\u003e, or use a willing intermediary to deliver actionable and specific feedback :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease sign up for one of the roles listed, or if there\u2019s some other way you want to help out, REACH out to me directly :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would prefer making a one-time donation rather than recurring monthly donations, use \u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/82D4R5tnuG\"\u003ethis link\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* I applied for a CEA community building grant in the hope that I could use that to fund running the venue for the next year, but they decided to support other projects that they expect to result in higher EA impact.\u003cbr\u003e"
