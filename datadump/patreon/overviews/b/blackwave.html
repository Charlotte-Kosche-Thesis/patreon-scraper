But what about all the other folks out there who are just as thirsty to be portrayed as hypnotized toys for the world to play with? Many of them don\u0027t have the same access to artists that allows others to be portrayed as such. And so, if this project is approved, I\u0027ll select randomly from among anyone who applies, and work closely with that person to create and develop an illustrated avatar, ready to be dropped into blissful submission!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDetails: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf this goal is reached during the month of April, 2018, I\u0027ll make a patron-exclusive post asking for anyone who is interested in having me design a character to represent them to leave a comment.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA winner will be chosen randomly from among all commenters after a period of 2 weeks. If no interested parties come forward from among patrons in that time, I will make similar posts on my DeviantArt, Twitter, and Tumblr pages, as well as the HypnoHub forums, and accept entries from anyone and everyone for 2 weeks before randomly selecting a winner.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI will contact the selected winner privately via whichever platform they used to apply, and they will have 1 week to respond. A different winner, if available, will be chosen after that time if no response is received.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI will ask the winner to provide me with any means of description they choose, whether written, photographic, illustrated, etc. Descriptions that are malicious and/or hateful and/or clearly in bad faith will be tossed out, and a different winner will be chosen. (No one would really do that, right...?)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI will create a character sketch based on the provided description. Estimated completion time for this is 1 week.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBased on the winner\u0027s feedback, I will revise the sketch to get it as close as possible to the desired outcome. This step will be repeated as necessary, though I reserve the right to decide what constitutes a reasonable amount of revisions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe final product of this process will consist of at least two full-body drawings (most likely one hypnotized and one lucid), several headshots showcasing various facial expressions, an easily-sampleable color pallet showing all colors used, and, if necessary, small diagrams showing any fine/hidden/complicated details. Estimated completion time for this is 2-4 weeks, depending on the number of revisions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI unleash the new original avatar forth into the world, to have many hypnotic adventures!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNotes: \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll genders welcome to apply!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf this project is successful, it may be repeated, possibly with the stipulation that anyone, regardless of whether they pledged or not, has an equal chance of being selected!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAvatars must be human, though \"accessories\" like animal ears or a tail are A-OK.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePhotographs submitted as part of this process may be screened for legitimacy.
