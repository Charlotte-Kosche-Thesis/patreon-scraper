    "summary": "Hello, and thank you for visiting my page, \"Basketball in the DMV\" podcast with Ben Standig. There\u0027s a decent chance you found this page because you\u0027re aware of my presence in the D.C. area sports media world, but here\u0027s some quick information for those less familiar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a native Washingtonian who has covered local college and professional sports since 2005 with college basketball a staple of\u00a0my portfolio throughout. That\u0027s meant deep dives and true beat writing work involving Georgetown, Maryland, George Washington, George Mason, American and others including the Big East and Atlantic 10 conferences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith media outlets cutting back on coverage or eliminated college basketball from their agenda altogether,\"we\u0027re\" going to try something different.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe plan\u003c/strong\u003e: Two podcasts per week. Expect interviews with players, coaches and college basketball insiders. Look for courtside analysis from Chinatown to Fairfax, from Foggy Bottom to College Park. Don\u0027t be shocked if there\u0027s some NBA talk as well. Each episode may vary in length depending on guests and availability, but assume between 30-75 minutes per.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, this is where you come in.\u003cstrong\u003e The content is free. Listen as you desire\u00a0and if you wish to support this project, the suggested donation is $4 per month.\u003c/strong\u003e There\u0027s a broader plan in the works for written content starting in January, but for now, I wanted to get this started/gauge interest with the podcasts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne last thing: \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ll make the choices of which practices and games to cover -- unless you tell me otherwise.\u003c/strong\u003e If you and your friends are supporters of one of those underserved colleges or even High School teams and desire coverage on the regular, contact me directly and we\u0027ll see what we can work out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your continued interest and support. Excited to see where this goes, both the podcast and the 2017-18 college basketball season.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
