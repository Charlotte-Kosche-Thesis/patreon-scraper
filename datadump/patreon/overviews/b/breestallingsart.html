    "summary": "I am very excited to begin my New Heroine series and share it with the world on what will hopefully become a year-long gallery tour!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What is the \"New Heroine\" series about?\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003eThe NH series is the brainchild of my experiences being in and around the comic world as a fan, artist and most importantly, a teacher. Currently, at Community School of the Arts, where I teach semester-long comic-book drawing classes, week-long intensive comic camps and one-on-one private instruction for illustrators in the making, I saw the same recurring theme: boys bringing in their sketchbooks full of the big, beefy superheroes of our own childhood like Batman, Superman, Captain America, etc. Which I get, who doesn\u0027t want to grow up and be super strong, manly and the good guy through all adversity? But then, the girls, MORE than half of my students, come in with sketchbooks that also have Batman, Superman and Captain America.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0When asking what they wanted to learn, they said to draw super heroines that looked like them. I thought I wanted to have a different option if they wanted to draw women, too. For some of my exercises, we would find a well-known artist whose style we liked, and try to closely copy their line, shading and composition. It always proved difficult to find women characters that were appropriate for for pre-teen and teenage students to draw. As many in the comic world know, even if I were to Google search \"Wonder Woman Art\", so much of what will show up is basically porn. Well-drawn porn, but still, I digress...\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0So what message does that send to our budding comic artists, that women are sexy first and super second? That protective armor has no meaning or use when you have tits and ass? That subplots and being a placard for a story line to simply advance is good enough? That if you want to learn to draw female anatomy in the comic world, you have to either learn on your own or are in for a scantily-clad surprise? And what does that tell our boys? That this is the norm and we\u0027re just gonna accept it?\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0I\u0027ve been inspired to make a small ripple in the huge ocean that is mis-representation. As a woman, I know how important it is to see examples of strength and beauty in the images that surround us. I intend to develop characters of various racial and cultural backgrounds, body shapes and ability levels to show that all women can be super.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How do you plan to execute this project?\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eSimply put, the New Heroine series is a big group of large paintings that I am hoping to take on a gallery tour in 2016. Ideally, the images, their sketches and snippets of the process will be published in a book that can allow the works to continue to circulate and create more dialogue in more communities. The first stop will be Gallery 27 in Lincolnton, NC in January and more will be announced as details are finalized.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What\u0027s the money for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0As the video above explains, Patreon not like what we are used to seeing in big, one-time project Kickstarter campaigns. It\u0027s more like a \"tip\" of appreciation for someone\u0027s creative work and journey. The amounts are small and are only taken out once a month, and support can end at any time with no obligations. Yet! Like Kickstarter, there are perks for each donation tier.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0Instead of one large check for one small project, this will act as a continual support system for at least a year\u0027s worth of artistic adventure. Afterwards, if and when I choose to disembark on another journey with my artwork, my supporters will be the first to know.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0As with all large undertakings, sacrifices must be made. After September of 2015 I will no longer be taking commissions of specialized, unique artworks in order to have the time, energy and mental capacity to give this project the attention it deserves. As it stands, currently, my commission work makes up almost half of my income. Cutting down on that so drastically does have me worried but I have faith in my aspirations that they will come into fruition with abundance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0Yes, the paintings will be up for sale. But under the circumstance that the price tag will be higher (hand-built canvases, much more time invested) and the fact that they must travel with me to the shows, leaves the proposition of selling them a little less opportune. So how do I support myself until then? That\u0027s where you come in, dear supporter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
