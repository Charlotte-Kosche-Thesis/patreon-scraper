    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHello and welcome to the b4nny Patreon Page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen Patreon pages in the past, but I thought I\u2019d still start by explaining how and why I am expanding into this platform. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of the content that I create is on Twitch, where there are plenty of methods for supporting the b4nny brand through watching ads, subscribing, cheering, donating, buying signed weapons, merch, etc., and the support there has been phenomenal and is greatly appreciated. But Twitch is obviously only a portion of what I do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, on YouTube the only real option for supporting my content has been through watching advertisements. I\u2019d suspect that there are some people that prefer my content on YouTube over my content on Twitch, for various reasons, but they can\u2019t support the content in the same number of ways as someone who prefers Twitch. That\u2019s a problem. The way I see it, Patreon simply gives those of you who prefer the YouTube platform the opportunity to support the channel to the same level as those who prefer the Twitch platform. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u2019ve been looking for a way to support through YouTube specifically, that\u2019s what this Patreon is for. If you\u2019ve been a supporter through Twitch and that works for you, great! If you just like watching and interacting with me, keep doing that too! If the idea of a Patreon campaign offends you, please understand that one key aspect of making a living as a small independent content creator/pro gamer/whatever is to have multiple small, but equally important, revenue streams, and Patreon simply represents another one of those. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYou may have noticed that I often refer to \"the b4nny brand\" rather than just referring to myself, and that\u0027s because it\u0027s not just me creating this content. Starting in November of 2016, shounic came on board as the graphic designer of the b4nny brand and as the editor/producer of my YouTube channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince his joining, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed, there has been a huge upswing in the aesthetic of my pages and the quantity of videos being put out on my YouTube channel. Shounic\u2019s work ethic is quite admirable and he does a great job with quality and consistency. I had always wanted to hire someone to do such a thing, as I knew it was an important step in taking my brand to the next level, but the problem was finding someone I could trust. With shounic, that is not an issue whatsoever and I trust him 100%. I am very thankful to have him working with me, and I hope you guys can all also recognize how awesome he is. That said, there is plenty more work to do, but the successes of the last couple months have given me the utmost confidence that we can keep building these channels into something great. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI don\u2019t normally like talking about money, but you should know that I believe that anyone who does work for me should be compensated, just as I would expect to be compensated for work I do for anyone else. Since the beginning of our parternership, all revenue from YouTube has been split between me and shounic, with him receiving 75% of it and me receiving 25% of it. As it is directly tied to the YouTube channel\u2019s output, this Patreon campaign will reflect those same splits as well. With an arrangement like this, there is much more incentive for both of us to equally put in the work to grow the channel to be bigger and better, and I hope you all will tag along with us for that journey. The ultimate goal would be to make the YouTube side of the b4nny brand its own sustainable occupation for both shounic and myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAs shounic is both handling most of the work on these videos and benefitting the most from the YouTube/Patreon revenue, he has decided to offer some perks for those of you that pledge to this Patreon campaign. I\u2019ll let him take over from here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\" And now for the juicy bits. The perks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e0.0001$\u003c/strong\u003e - okay Patreon doesn\u2019t allow you to contribute so little, but consider this. I don\u2019t \u003cem\u003e_just_\u003c/em\u003e make videos for b4nny. Attached to my name is also Backcap. A now pretty sizable group of selfless community contributors that work for free for the betterment of the competitive community. We produce a weekly news show. We produced the TF2 Spectator\u2019s Guide, that you no doubt have seen by now. We have collectively done a year\u2019s worth of work, all for free and for your benefit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd you\u2019re right, that\u2019s a lot of time spent for unpaid work, just to inch competitive tf2 closer to the limelight. Just imagine, how much money we would need to repay all the Backcap contributors? I have the answer for you. It doesn\u2019t matter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhat? Yes. Because by supporting me, you automatically support Backcap AT NO ADDITIONAL COST. Your money\u2019s worth just got doubled, and Backcap can keep working to help the community. Oh wait, AND YOU STILL GET B4NNY VIDEOS. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWith that out of the way, you\u2019re thinking \u201cnice, now tell me you\u2019re offering a steam group or discord channel that you will never use and i\u2019ll be on my merry way out.\u201d Fantastic, because you\u2019re going to be pleasantly surprised. These are the once in a lifetime perks you can redeem:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e--- PERKS FOR PATRONS AS A COLLECTIVE ---\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThere is no goal to hit for these, but as long as a reasonable amount of people are contributing then I will keep these going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeekly / Bi-Weekly Creative Twitch Streams\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eFrequency depends on my schedule and if there\u2019s worthwhile things to stream, but I will be doing streams of myself editing / creating art for Backcap, b4nny, or any other purpose. There is also possibility of a stream where I solely focus on the chat interaction, and I respond to questions, give advice and make some art from chat suggestions. Of course, the streams where I\u2019m doing work of my own will also have chat interaction, but I would want to focus on finishing my work first. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Video By You\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eA monthly video made from a collective idea from you Patrons! A community frag video? The perfect meme video? I got you. This perk is different to the I\u2019ll Make You Something ones because the video idea will be decided collectively, and it\u2019s open to all those who contributed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo clarify, anyone who donates any amount will be able to participate in the above. So in the case of the monthly patreon video, it means that even if you just donate a dollar you\u0027ll get to contribute or pitch in ideas to what the video could be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eContribution Level Rewards:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$1 I helped!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eHey, a contribution is a contribution.

You will be invited to the b4nny-shounic conglomerate discord, as well as a special patron only channel within it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also explain how the b4nny thumbnails come about, and versions of the thumbnails that never made it into the public.
