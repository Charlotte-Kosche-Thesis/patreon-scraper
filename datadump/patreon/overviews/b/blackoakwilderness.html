    "summary": "Black Oak Wilderness School is an Oakland, California based traditional skills and wilderness survival school for teens and adults. I am working towards accessibility to outdoor and traditional skills education for under represented communities in our area. My Patreon funds will go directly towards tuition and materials fees with the goal of offering two full teacher training scholarships and two full teen leader scholarships each year for women, POC, and LBGTQIA students.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been an outdoor educator for over 15 years and I have noticed an imbalance in both students and educators in my field that I am working to correct. Education about nature and traditional skills brings the student closer to our relationship with the environment and encourages a deeper understanding of how we affect that relationship. A simple skill like making soap becomes about respecting our resources. Learning to make fire teaches about the ecology of the forest and how we can protect it. These skills also connect us with a shared cultural heritage that transcends race, sex, age, ability, religion, gender, orientation, or borders. They inspire confidence, leadership, and teamwork. They create new and fulfilling employment\u00a0 opportunities in passing these traditions along. It\u0027s about learning what we share, what makes us human on a foundational level. I can think of nothing more important than that."
