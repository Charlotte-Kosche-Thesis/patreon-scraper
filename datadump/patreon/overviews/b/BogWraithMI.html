We began taking shows as soon as we could, starting out a small dive bars and eventually gaining enough traction to play Michigan Metal Fest alongside some other amazing Michigan bands. After the release of our 2017 \"Mire\" EP we got to work on our full length debut \"Omen\", which, like the\u00a0 two previous EP\u0027s, will be recorded at Marshland Studios, run by Julian and Mike. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the very beginning, we had two simple goals; create \u003cem\u003eour\u003c/em\u003e music \u003cem\u003eour\u003c/em\u003e way, and share it with the people who wanted to hear it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we also want to bring you more than just an album.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to bring you Bog Wraith.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur main goal is to take Bog Wraith from the swamp and out on tour.
