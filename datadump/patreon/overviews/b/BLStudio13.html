I grew up with a love of art (especially comics) they showed me how creative and amazing stories and art can be! I have always wanted to work in the comic book industry, but I didn\u0027t always have the confidence and I let myself be distracted by working regular jobs. My goals are to start with independent publication of 3 comic book series; Beneath The Seas, Man VS Monster, and Violent Jesus. I\u0027m also currently working on two horror movie scripts that I\u0027m writing and doing the story boarding. I\u0027m aiming to pitch my movie scripts in February As time goes on and hopefully with the right funds, \u00a0I hope to expand into an independent comic book publisher with other artist looking for the newest and coolest ideals out there. I have a ton of awesome projects lined up, and all I need is some help to be able to bring these comics and scripts to life! I\u0027ll be working to also create a series of cool comic T-shirts and awesome art to you \ud83d\ude03!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny help will be greatly appreciated, and that means even just spreading the word and sharing my page or comic series with people you know!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you you so much for taking the time to check out my page and work \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude4f.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Ben Langham"

I\u0027ve been passionate about art since I picked up my first coloring crown and have continued to draw with a desire to create amazing comics. Comics have brought a great deal of inspiration, joy, and wonder into my life since I picked up my first X-men and Ninja Turtles comics. I love to create all kinds of art, but have a strong desire to bring several comic series of my own. I would like to share my art with everyone and bring that same joy and wonder comics have given me over the years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0I\u0027ve spent most of my time working \u00a0office jobs, serving in the Army, Vacation rentals management, all while trying to pursue a career in the arts\u00a0and comics. With your help and support I can dedicate more time to these projects and other content. With your support I will be able to commit more of my time to my comic projects. Eventually my goal is to aim to be able to commit 100% to these comic projects. Your \u00a0support also means I can produce more amazing rewards and content for your enjoyment!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to check out my Patreon page and work! Hopefully with your help I\u0027ll be able to focus full time on these projects!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
