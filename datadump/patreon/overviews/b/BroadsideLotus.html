This study celebrates Idlewild\u2019s legacy of self-determination and resiliance over the long arc of its history, from its founding to the eve of its centennial anniversary in 2012. Drawing from extensive oral history interviews with several generations of Idlewild residents, the text weaves a collective story of the memories and communal aspirations of individuals, both those whose families have been rooted in Idlewild for decades, and those who have settled recently.\u003cbr\u003eIn their example of commitment to the preservation of their extraordinary cultural heritage while initiating essential revitalization objections, Idlewild leaders offer a powerful development model for communities throughout the United States.\u003cbr\u003e\"Home Sweet Sanctuary\" is yours for your donation of $20.00 or more.\u003cbr\u003e",
