    "summary": "The Brown Liquor Report was birthed at the intersection of friends reuniting over social media, heated and humorous discussion about politics and pop culture, chicken and liquor!In less than twelve months, it has quickly evolved from just an innovative way to catch up and share our thoughts on hot topics, to a hot weekly podcast with an ever-growing following. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have emerged as a unique voice for Generation Xers who find themselves straddling ratchet and responsibility. We are the podcast for those who want to learn more about social justice, pop culture, and politics while enjoying the best 90s hip hop beats and a pour of their favorite vice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the BLR crew thoroughly enjoys bringing dope content to our listeners on a weekly basis, unfortunately running a growing podcast takes quite a bit of time and resources. We rent office space where we record our episodes and host our guests, we have monthly subscriptions to various platforms need to share our content, we are looking to hire a social media manager, updates to equipment, and we will be expanding our show to video so you all can see our beautiful mugs in the very near future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo click that button, subscribe, donate, and share with your friends; you know you want to! Once we make it HUGE and we\u0027re a household name, you\u0027ll know that you had something to do with it and we\u0027ll forever be indebted to you!\u003cbr\u003e"
