Your donation can be as little as $1 a month, or maybe $2 or $3 a month, but please give $5 or more!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe convenience of giving monthly is that you don\u0027t have to remember to make the payment but it\u0027s consistent over time. If you are interested in making a one-time payment, please use this\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://paypal.me/tiffanytg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePayPal\u003c/a\u003e and add a note indicating the donation is for Black Trans Women and Femmes. Either way, your donations are appreciated and will get paid out on the 1st of the month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the money go?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money goes to local Black trans women and femmes and is used in whatever manner they decide. So that might be for health and healing. Or for emergency housing. Or for transportation. That\u0027s up to the recipient, and they are never asked to explain or justify this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe amount that is paid out and how many folks receive a payment per month depends on the needs that have been expressed and the amount of money in the fund.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho manages the fund? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLocal Black trans women and femmes provide direction and pass on and prioritize funding requests. Also involved in this process is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tiffany.guerra\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTiffany Guerra\u003c/a\u003e a genderqueer white person who manages the account and this page, and does part of the fundraising.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso please note: This fund is directly inspired by the teachings of \u003ca href=\"https://www.safetypinbox.com/\"\u003eSafety Pin Box\u003c/a\u003e and its creators, and also by the work of local Black trans folks and groups like \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/blaqtrising/?ref=br_rs\"\u003eBlaQT Rising\u003c/a\u003e who model radical compassion and activism.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut why?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause throughout history and presently, Black trans women and femmes are the first to put themselves on the line for the liberation of others and give their time and resources, yet when it comes to how money and resources flow through society and our systems, these folks are also the last to get paid or to receive the funds necessary to their health, well-being, and survival.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we are white, we have a responsibility not only to challenge and dismantle those systems, but to direct more of our resources to Black trans folks. This is an opportunity to pay economic reparations in a manner that is predictable and reliable,\u00a0and\u00a0we can begin this immediately.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease join and pledge whatever you can!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease contact tiffanytguerra@gmail.com with questions or thoughts."
