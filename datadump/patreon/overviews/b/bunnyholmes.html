    "summary": "My name is Bunny and I direct \u0026amp; produce immersive theater, experimental contemporary-circus tours, and construct other surreal experiential art. I do this compulsively. Sometimes I\u0027m able to build large self-sustaining productions - more frequently though my art happens within with pop-up shows and intimate experiences that I\u0027m not able to sustain with ticket sales. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of the work I\u0027ve been making for the last decade is too weird to channel through other conventional fundraising methods such as grant funding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of trying to solve this puzzle anew every time I build something like an 8-hour psychedelic Peter Pan production or an abridged immersive Romeo \u0026amp; Juliet on the streets of Ghost Town, I\u0027d like to thoroughly document those experiences and publish about them here, and, if you\u0027re excited to support the creation of more content like this (whether you\u0027re able to attend them in person, or just living vicariously and getting ideas of your own from the work I\u0027m doing), chip in a few bucks to help keep the ball rolling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is an experiment in attempting to make the breadth of my creativity (not just the \"Big Shows\") sustainable. Shall we give it a try?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the proposal: You buy me a shot of whiskey every time I decide to spend the requisite days/weeks/months constructing a show that tests the boundaries between actor and audience, party and play, and what is possible when we dive in to Neverland head first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen you\u0027ll be the first to hear about it, have a chance at attending the actual productions, play with any of my art that has an online interface, and beyond that, read about everything we did and everything I learned in the process. I\u0027ll take really good notes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also sometimes post the other artwork that ends up eventually becoming the fodder for these events (creative writing, illustration, costume-creation \u0026amp; portraiture) so you can see where I\u0027m coming from, because that\u0027s as much a part of the process as reciting lines on stage is. There you have it, the whole caboodle. What is going on inside Bunny\u0027s brain? Shit is about to get weird."
