    "summary": "I have recorded 22 episodes over the last almost six months and will continue recording. I feel that I stepped into a niche within the Malifaux podcasting realm that had yet to be filled and have produced some good content that is more focused on strategy and tactics before a game begins and some dabbling into actual game reports. I have had various guests discussing various masters and a few roundtable discussions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe equipment I am using currently is passable but I have aspirations of doing more. It has been brought up on my cast from time to time that my machine is a frankensteined PC from 2007 that was custom built for me. Since then it has received 2 overhauls but is still running Windows XP (personal choice), however all the screen sharing technology that I have looked into has required more memory, and a more recent operating system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis would be one of the first upgrades I would like to make in getting a new PC that will have the specifications needed to record games that are occurring between myself and guests, and for the guest on guest shows. I would love to record these games as they could provide additional content for people to enjoy. In addition to the recorded games I would like to get some video editing software to break the games down to about a thirty minute video with the highlights and some commentary over the top. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to this I would like to create some t-shirts, potentially some gaming aides that are branded, and the pie in the sky would be a fate deck. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOverall I am looking for some help to do and produce more. I am not looking to make a living off of this but at the same time I would like some help financing the improvements I would like to make to the podcast and various other medias I want to move into. The podcast will always be free, there will be no premium content, and the quality will continue to improve. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e"
