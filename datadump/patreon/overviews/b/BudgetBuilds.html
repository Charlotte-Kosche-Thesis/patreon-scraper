    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHello and Welcome to my Patreon\u2026Which is well where you can\nchannel, as its no secret that YouTube isn\u2019t exactly a goldmine of ad-revenue\u2026.Far\nfrom it when it comes to funding the channel, \nBut firstly a little more about us:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Budget Builds?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBudget Builds is a YouTube channel run mainly by me Hamish,\nI am currently 17 and used to hold down two jobs to fund the channel, one at\nMcDonalds, the other one as a Gardner. I have since quit working at McDonalds\nas it was one of the most gruelling and degrading things I have ever done, to\nthe stage where I even got underpaid for the amount of work I had to do, but I\nhave been able luckily to replace this job with YouTube. The money isn\u2019t\namazing, and it takes some long hours and a lot of work to get the video\u2019s all\nnicely done for the channel, but in the end its worth it knowing how many\npeople enjoy the content that I\u2019m making; as not only does it help everyone it\nlets people spend their money in a wiser way, buy buying some of the parts that\nI\u2019m able to cover.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a 17 Year old, money can be hard to come by, but not only\ndo parts cost money, so do the various improvements to the channel, as\ncurrently Patreon has part funded a new camera, a new microphone, and a host of\nnew parts, all of which have made the content way better, as I can afford new\nor rare parts to test out, and experiment with ideas that no one else on\nYouTube has covered, such as the HD5450 Crossfire or the 25p PC.  Your money goes straight back into the\nchannel and will help to make the video\u2019s better which each episode. I don\u2019t\nhave much money for the channel but everything given helps out somehow.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\u2019re going to start showing video\u2019s of each months haul as\na special thank you to each and everyone of you for donating, moreover you get\na special rank on the Discord, aswell as my thanks for helping us out, you also\nget previews, and pre-renders aswell as some unseen ideas should I have to\ncancel a video, this also includes previews of benchmarks upto 3 days before\nthe video is finished. If you have an suggestions aswell we will take Patreon\ndecisions into consideration when its time to vote for the next video\nidea\u2026.Something you guys get to do, usually consisting of 3 or 4 Videos ideas\nwhich you guys get to vote on to choose what you would like to see.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow much should I\ngive?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIts your choice, but everything you give will fund a month\nof new videos, I put a lot of my own money towards a lot of the parts, but this\nshould help us to get even newer or rarer parts, so it\u2019s your decision if you\u2019d\nlike to see this improvement. With how much you guys have made possible so far,\nand your generosity, I will leave it entirely up to you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for reading\nthis far, anything you give will make for some amazing improvements that I\nwouldn\u2019t be able to do without you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThanks\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eBudget Builds\n(Hamish)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
