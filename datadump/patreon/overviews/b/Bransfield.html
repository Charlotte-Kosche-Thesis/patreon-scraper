    "summary": "Hello, my name is Ian and I am a talented and hip upcoming\ncool dude from the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI used to be a full-time games journalist, which resulted in\nsomeone writing a hit piece about me and lots of people told me I should die\nbecause I gave a game 3% less than what they thought it should get. Now I\u0027m a full-time freelance... person... or something.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a portfolio and everything - look at it.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ianinthefuture.uk/portfolio/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLOOK AT IT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. The best things I ever did were in magazines, because magazines are cool and I could get away with doing short monthly comics using entirely stock photography. Better days...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnyway, instead of dying, I now make videos sometimes.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/iandransfield\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eALSO LOOK AT IT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. Isn\u2019t that\ncool? Told you I was a cool dude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI like making silly videos, and have done in the past, and\nwill do in the future, but more recently I\u2019ve taken to making longer retrospectives, short-ish reviews, list features and that sort of thing, because hush down there I like list features and if Cracked\nisn\u2019t going to do long-form video lists about games, I sure as shit will.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m not saying mine are as good as Cracked\u2019s would be, but\nthey\u2019re certainly not terrible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnyway, I\u0027m a freelancer, like an\u00a0\u003cem\u003eidiot\u003c/em\u003e, and\nhave a Real Life to live, so it\u2019s not easy to find time to do longer videos like these for no money. They take\na lot of time and effort, who knew?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(everyone who makes or has made videos,\never, knew, they really did)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs such, I thought I\u2019d re-engage this Patreon. If I do a video in a month, it charges you a bit of money, I get financial\nreward for my time, effort and ability,\nand I won\u2019t be holding back any content (hashtagcontent) behind the backer wall\nstuff right now \u2013 everything\u2019s free to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat may change in the future as I shift myself to entirely\nrip off\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Hbomb\"\u003eHbomberguy\u003c/a\u003e\u2019s approach. And if I don\u0027t manage to put up something good/substantial in a month, I\u0027ll make sure you\u0027re not charged. But whatever happens it\u0027ll probably be fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also toying with the different tiered rewards, and am open to suggestions on how to change them to appeal to folks more. The tshirt can\u0027t be cheaper though, as it takes bloody ages to make just one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHey! Thanks for reading this far if you read this far, and I\nhope you don\u2019t have a day that makes you want to rub a cheese grater over your\neyes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIan\u003cbr\u003e\nxx\u003cbr\u003e"
