    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Tom and I make videos. Sometimes they\u0027re funny, sometimes they\u0027re about things you never knew, sometimes I cook, sometimes I just tell you about me.\u003cp\u003eI love making these videos and I love you guys enjoying them, and with your help the process will be made much easier. I currently don\u0027t own a video camera, I borrow my housemates whenever I want to film so your support would first of all help me towards getting my own camera and other kit. I long for the time when I can afford to make video making the thing that takes most of my day, and also pay people to help me make even better videos.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll be aiming to make one video a week, the content of which could be anything. Silly games, hidden camera, interesting things, maybe even the occasional sketch. If you\u0027ve liked what you\u0027ve seen so far on my channel, you\u0027ll enjoy what I\u0027ve got coming up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e$1 - First Hour Bonus Whenever\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen a video of mine is published, it has an extra bit on the end which I call the First Hour Bonus. This bit only exists for the first hour after my video goes live, then I chop it off. Normally this means you have to catch the video early to see it, but if you become a Patron you\u0027ll have access to the First Hour Bonus for all of my videos indefinitely through my Patron Only feed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e$2 - Director\u0027s Cut\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor a number of my videos, particularly vox pop based videos or hidden camera, I shoot way more than ends up in the final video. I try and edit it down to between 3 and 5 minutes for YouTube but a lot of good stuff gets dropped in this cut. Pledge $2 per video and you\u0027ll get a much longer video than the final product you see on YouTube with lots more good stuff in it. This won\u0027t be on every video, but it\u0027ll be on most unscripted videos.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e$10 - Eavesdrop\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can watch me record my videos live in a Google Hangout. Obviously this will be impossible when I\u0027m shooting on the street but whenever I shoot somewhere where I have a computer with the internet you can watch, and I\u0027ll chat with you before, during and after shooting. If a video involves no shooting anywhere with computer and internet access I\u0027ll do another Hangout to make up for it.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n"
