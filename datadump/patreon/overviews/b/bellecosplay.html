    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHello and thanks for finding your way to my Patreon \u2665\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Belle and I\u0027m a passionate cosplayer who recently moved to the U.S.! I\u0027ve been cosplaying since about 2 years now, both buying and creating my own costumes of my favorite characters from anime and video games!\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027m not cosplaying you can usually find me playing games or livestreaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy name\u003c/em\u003e, Belle, I got from my childhood and teenage hero, Belle from the Final Fantasy spinoff Crystal Chronicles: Crystal Bearers \u2665\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy cosplayer life started\u003c/em\u003e back when a friend asked me to join her in a partner cosplay and I thought \"Sure, why not? This seems fun!\". I never stopped since then and have been getting more and more passionate about it.\u003cbr\u003eI might not be the best at sewing or even creating armors yet but I want to learn and try out new things, bit by bit, and would like to take you along on my journey!\u003cbr\u003eYou, the people who support me and have encouraged me to try my best and smile the brightest! \u2665 \u003cstrong\u003eWhy the Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e, you might ask yourself?\u003cbr\u003eI got the idea from a lot of people who messaged me on my page, asking how to support me or if I have a Patreon page. Until now I\u0027ve carried the costs of cosplay by myself, which is completely natural to me, I love what I\u0027m doing after all! I\u0027ve come to realize that many, many people following my work would like to give something back to me, though. And that is what this account should be for!\u003cbr\u003eOf course I want to give back what I am able to at the moment, slowly raising the rewards over time. As mentioned before I am currently in the process of getting used to my new home, the move drained most of my resources so I can\u0027t give back as much at the moment. In order to still provide a little \u0027Thank you\u0027 for my lovely supporters I want to give access to unique ways to contact me and take part in my cosplayer life! ^-^ Please look forward to it \u2665\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, thank you for visiting this page and thank you for even thinking about supporting me! I\u0027m endlessly grateful for your kindness!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHave an amazing day and don\u0027t forget to \u003cem\u003ethink positive\u003c/em\u003e! \u2665\u003c/div\u003e"
