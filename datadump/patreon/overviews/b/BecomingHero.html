We\u0027re going to have a rotating bunch of creators in this space, and it\u0027s gonna be awesome! The video above kind of tells the story, and the story of our successful Indiegogo--which is awesome, because our successful Indiegogo means there\u0027s actual STUFF available for all of you who join our page. Check out the rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSkye\u2019s an Asian-American comic book superhero with a gun in his hand and a gripe against his author. Every girl Skye\u2019s ever dated is either dead or trying to take over the world, and in the series finale, Skye\u2019s best friend kills him. \u2028\u2028Or so he thinks. The weapon meant to disintegrate Skye lands him in his author\u2019s universe. With a shot at revenge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSkye, meet Jace. Jacen Howard\u2019s a brilliant #blerd math whiz and comics aficionado\u2013but at his West Baltimore high school that\u2019s a bad thing, and if the bullying isn\u2019t bad enough, Jace\u2019s cop-father regularly pisses off the neighbors. Jace doesn\u2019t see himself as a hero; he\u2019s just trying to survive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJace might be just the hero Skye needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Skye won\u2019t open up when Jace tries to ease him out of PTSD, and the author\u2019s still torturing his friends. As Skye\u2019s mood swings and nightmares escalate, Jace realizes that if he doesn\u2019t uncover his roommate\u2019s real identity soon, Skye will hurt someone\u2013and Skye\u2019s still deciding if murder will save his world, or damn his soul.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
