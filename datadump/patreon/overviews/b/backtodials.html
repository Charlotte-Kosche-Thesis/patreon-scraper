The first goal was to make the X-Wing miniatures community better for everyone!\u00a0To that end, Back to\u00a0Dials has covered topics ranging from\u00a0prepping for World Championships to prepping for your first tournament. And we\u0027re not just a podcast!\u00a0Check out our Youtube channel, website, and the vibrant\u00a0community on the BTD facebook group!\u00a0No matter your skill level, the Back to Dials podcast has something to offer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now we need your help to reach even more\u00a0members of this great community!\u00a0As the podcast continues to grow, we\u0027d like to continue to ensure that we can provide the highest quality audio, video and download experience, and we\u0027d like to bring it to you more often! This means we need access to\u00a0faster hosting and\u00a0better equipment\u00a0and software to\u00a0cut down on production time.\u00a0In addition, we\u0027d love to sponsor more\u00a0giveaways and contests in order to give back to the\u00a0listeners! All funds collected will go directly into improving the podcast or be returned to the community in terms of prize support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u0027ve enjoyed the show, please consider helping us improve the X-wing community! Surely Tyson\u0027s accents alone are worth a small contribution... right?... anyone?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for listening! \u003cbr\u003e"
