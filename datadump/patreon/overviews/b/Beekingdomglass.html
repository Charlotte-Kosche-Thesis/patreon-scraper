    "summary": "Hello we are Ryan and Phillip, aka Bee Kingdom Glass! We are 2 Canadian glassblowers creating our art, full time, out of a self-built garage studio since 2006. Our passion is creating highly unique blown glass sculpture largely inspired by cute culture, technology, political satire, and Canadiana.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReal estate is expensive in our city and galleries often take 50% of our sales making it difficult to grow our studio and personal lives. In the last few years we have mostly in-housed all of our marketing, sales, exhibiting, and creating from inside our home studio. The zoning of our home studio vastly limits our exposure to new audiences. We aren\u0027t allowed to keep open hours and cannot freely advertise. We love hosting events at our studio to demonstrate the fascinating art of glassblowing but we are legally limited in how often we can do this and how many people can visit. One new strategy we\u0027re implementing is to produce an on-going series of videos of the creation process of our glasswork to share with our online community. Instruction and education is a primary mandate of our studio and introducing video content will be a powerful tool in exposing our unique studio practice and opening a dialog to a much wider audience!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur molten glass furnace is a 1150*C fiery beast that demands money every month, not to mention other fire-spewing equipment, annealing ovens, and base glass (pink glass has gold in it!). With your support we can better maintain equipment, pay the high studio overhead, be more free to create our artistic ideas, and share our experience with even more of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your generous support we offer many gifts of appreciation! Monthly memberships give you the opportunity to receive rewards ranging from exclusive glass designs, video content (creation vids, Q\u0026amp;As with us, etc.), voting on designs, and other studio art, plus knowing that you are a sophisticated supporter of artistic culture!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe look forward to you joining our community!\u003cbr\u003eRyan \u0026amp; Phillip\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.beekingdomglass.com\"\u003ewww.beekingdomglass.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003einstagram: @beekingdomglass\u003cbr\u003etwitter: @beekingdomglass\u003cbr\u003e"
