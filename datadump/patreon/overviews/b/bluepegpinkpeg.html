We are lucky to now count many of you as friends.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the fact remains, creating Blue Peg, Pink Peg is hard and sometimes expensive work. You may have noticed, we don\u0027t currently have sponsors and we don\u0027t take advertising. While we are comfortable with committing time and money to this passion project, we can not take Blue Peg, Pink Peg to the next level without your help. We want to produce more and better content. We want to improve our equipment so that we can provide you with a better listening experience. We want to provide more opportunities for PegHeads to meet and interact. We want to give our listeners chances to win more prizes. We want to help you declare your membership in the PegHead Nation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond covering our licensing and hosting costs: we want to improve our equipment so that we can record more easily and in more settings; we want to improve the look and utility of our website; we want to attend more conventions and host PegHead events; we want to give away more games; we want to develop more PegHead community; and we want to continue to improve our content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support us, we can commit more time, money, and energy toward improving Blue Peg, Pink Peg. We have many interesting programming ideas that we simply can not do because of expense. But with your help, we can nurture these ideas, and provide you with new, fun, informative, innovative, and entertaining content. Our milestones are keyed to providing the PegHead Nation with something new, at each level. The more milestones we unlock, the more content we will be able to provide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, we want to thank you for your support with tokens of our esteem and appreciation. The more you give, the more you get. Of course, we hope that the primary pledge reward is the continuation, expansion, and improvement of Blue Peg, Pink Peg. Great things are on the horizon, but we can only get there with your help."
