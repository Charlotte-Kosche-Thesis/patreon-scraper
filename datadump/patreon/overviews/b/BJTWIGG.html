Now with the dream of being a teacher truly shattered, and the hope to one day vanquish the dark evil that is lack of education in children, I hope to put my ideas out for those to read them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a writer I always felt compelled to put something out there that would change the world in some way. Something that would bring a reader to tears or have them discuss the minor details as to why a character would do such a thing. I wanted to create dialogue with people again, the thing I missed the most, about how we felt reading a scene. As a writer I wanted to make people feel something, but then one day as I was on the train home from work I looked up at a man in front of me, he won\u0027t remember this, but I saw him reading one of my favourite authors and I smiled at him, and he smiled back. we had a small exchange about the author and both gushed over our favourite books.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI realised then and there that it was that exact thing we were doing that I wanted to create in the world again. Something where people can share their thoughts and discuss plots and twists and possible theories. As a lover of fantasy and science fiction, I am drawn to stories where the landscapes are so vast and the characters back stories involve creatures from another universe or galaxy or even scenes that would make you weep in real life should you ever witness them in person.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I have chosen to be on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a writer of both of these genre\u0027s I want to place my mark on this world and I would benefit so much from your help. If you love stories where characters go on amazing epic adventures and slay the demon kings of Parshath, then you have come to the right place.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy favourite phrase in life is \"I don\u0027t expect anything from anyone however I am grateful for that I have and get\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome join me and be rewarded along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
