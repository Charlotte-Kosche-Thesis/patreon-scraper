    "summary": "For the past year or so I\u2019ve spent most of my \u201cafter hours\u201d outside of work time making art. The art I make isn\u2019t the traditional painting or drawing (I\u2019m terrible at both), but rather art made in collaboration with computers. I feel weird calling it that because people usually think that means I play with fractals, which are cool but not really my thing. Instead I use machines and computers as a part of my art practice\u2014its an ends to a means, not the end. This collaboration with computers allows my work to take on many final output forms: prints, drawings, cut collages, 3d prints\u2014the list is long and I want it to get longer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are a few images of the types of things I produce:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://payload441.cargocollective.com/1/21/673828/11138306/IMG_0669_600.PNG\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eA Trippy Twitter Bot\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://payload489.cargocollective.com/1/21/673828/12094675/res_mobot31753002930490_0097_avg_seed5093_1000.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagery influenced by science\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://payload512.cargocollective.com/1/21/673828/12545012/IMG_2268_1000.png\"\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eUnique Valentines drawn on a pen plotter\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne other thing about my work: I try to make it and sell it as cheap as possible. The use of machines and other computer-aided\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the beginning of this year I decided to do something a little radical: all of the money I make by selling work in my store (minus shipping) gets donated to an awesome organization. We need all the help we can get in the US right now and this felt like a great way to give back. I\u2019ve raised ~$750 dollars since January for some great orgs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I\u2019d still like to cover some of my material and art expenses, and that\u2019s where you come in. Backing me on Patreon will be my way going forward to make a small income on my work. In return I\u2019m offering original works to my Patrons. In a lot of cases you will get experimental things I\u2019m trying to figure out or play with. In other cases you will get early access to works I\u2019ve \u201csolved.\u201d"
