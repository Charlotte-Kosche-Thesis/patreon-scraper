There\u0027ll be safe images and there\u0027ll be cheesecake images, but pixel porn won\u0027t be the focus of the Patreon just yet - for now NSFW sprites will be extra bonus goodies for patrons. Any images I make and put on here will be timed exclusives - they will eventually be uploaded onto my Tumblr page, possibly my DeviantART and/or Pixiv accounts. I want to try pixelart imitating different generations of games, different artstyles and perspectives - this is a good opportunity to see that through.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease understand that this is a monthly campaign\u003c/strong\u003e - if you pledge money towards this Patreon, you will donate that money for every month this campaign is running (or until the Patreon shuts down). You can change your amount pledged or withdraw your pledge at any time. If you\u0027d rather make a one-time donation or request a commission, you can get in touch with me at endpiece at gmail dot com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/102567447/lingspritebWRAP.png\" style=\"float: right;\"\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Why should I pay you?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\nI\u0027d like the extra money to buffer my meager income, in case of unforeseen accidents or setbacks. The more insurance I have, the more time I can take to work on unfinished projects like comics.
