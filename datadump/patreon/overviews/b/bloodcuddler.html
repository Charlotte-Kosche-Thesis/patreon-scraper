That\u0027s my name. Or so they tell me. \"Bloodcuddler\" piques interest. And you\u0027re interesting, too. So thanks for becoming a Bloodcuddler. You already are one. But buying a thing I post is a nice way to say, \"hey, my laughter is applause spelled backwards.\" And by that, you mean, \"I agree this is funny.\" And you used currency to do this. Very kind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho knows what will be here to buy? Do you? I sure don\u0027t. It could be a pilot episode no one asked for but everyone wants. It could be a fake inspirational newsletter that makes Bloodcuddler seem like a cult... or worse, a religion. Either way, keep spending. The key is watching creative stuff as it gets made. Check out the Blogsloglier post 02-11-18, which chats you up about that. I\u0027ve even edited a post I\u0027ve already posted and edited a post and re-posted it, so you literally see the changes in the body of the document.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWARNING: Thanks for the following...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCommunity-building is the thing. I guess. Thanks for being a part of and sharing this with others. I say for sure. This would be written with confidence but I don\u0027t believe in words that start with \"con\". If I were sexy, a whole lotta prophylactic jokes would follow. \u003cbr\u003eThis space is safe. \u003cbr\u003eAny money that goes into this patreon will go back into this patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWouldn\u0027t it be cool to wear Bloodcuddler? But it\u0027s more than just \"Bloodcuddler\". Even though we all agreed that piques interest. The wearable is actually just neat on its own. How? Something new and fresh and freshly new. Let alone the whole Bloodcuddler deal. Which once more, we agreed is interesting. Or drive your vehicle with a decal? Or rock a sticker on your laptop? Or whatever. I\u0027m tired. Buttons. How about buttons? I hear those are great. So let\u0027s put a button on it until we can put a button on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHugs all around! Always enough energy for a group hug. Much love.\u003cbr\u003e"
