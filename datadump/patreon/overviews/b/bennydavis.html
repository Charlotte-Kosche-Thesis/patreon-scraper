    "summary": "Hey there, thanks for checking out my new\ncampaign! I need your help to make my new web\nseries, \u2018Better Than It Sounds\u2019.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWHAT IS \u2018BETTER THAN IT SOUNDS\u2019? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI love music. I love listening to it, I\nlove playing it, I love writing it, I love analyzing it, and I LOVE talking\nabout it. I want to do all of these things. In videos. For you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve looked around, and I don\u2019t think\nanyone\u2019s doing it quite the way I want to. Music literacy is diminishing these\ndays, and music criticism is wishy-washy at best. Film reviewers and regular\nfans alike will discuss movies with technical depth. \u201cOoh that was all one\ntake.\u201d \u201cWow the CGI is amazing.\u201d \u201cOh my god there\u2019s no CGI at all, those stunts\nwere real!\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dLEi3EbBOUo/VXYqJNi3WLI/AAAAAAAAA98/-XF-OT4mhhI/s1600/mad%2Bmax%2Bfury%2Broad%2B2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSure, they were dangling perilously, but it wasn\u0027t REALLY a dystopian wasteland now, was it? So fake.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNobody talks about music making that way. Critics go into huge depth about the meaning of songs, but no one\u0027s talking about chords, texture, instrumentation...and when they do they get the terms wrong or they make up their own. Rolling Stone\u0027s review of a Gwen Stefani album said the chorus was a \u0027big chewy bubblegum flavour\u0027. What DOES music taste like, Rolling Stone?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://previews.123rf.com/images/stocking/stocking1405/stocking140500084/27984861-Music-teacher-writing-notes-on-a-blackboard--Stock-Photo.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"I have no idea what I\u0027m doing\u003c/em\u003e.\"\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nthink there\u2019s a way to review pop music for the music, not just for the words and the culture.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd I think by doing so, I can educate\npeople about music so everyone can learn the language and know what they\u2019re\ntalking about. There\u2019s amazing pop music that goes unnoticed, because to the common ear it\u0027s\u00a0indistinct to\nregular radio trash. And there\u2019s bland music that tops the\ncharts just because of slick production value. Let\u2019s all become discerning\nlisteners!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://joyofsuccess.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/cartoon-characters-with-big-ears-337.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePictured: You when I\u0027m done with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo really I just want to keep making the kinds of videos I do now, and do it\nmore regularly. But with the funds I need to make them top quality, because you deserve better than me filming on my phone in my bedroom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve already got a bunch of new ideas for medleys and mash ups, and I\u0027ve been performing new comedy songs live around Sydney to compile a new album. Soon I can record them and make the film clips. Then YOU can see them without having to go anywhere!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePLUS I want to make them all part of an ongoing series where I\nexplain how it all works. Every video I make will have a \u0027behind-the-scenes\u0027 breakdown of what\u0027s going on with the notes. I want to share everything I know about music with\nyou.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou ever notice that there\u2019s three key\nchanges in Knights of Cydonia by Muse? You wanna know why some songs sound \u2018cold\u2019 and others \u0027warm\u0027? Why scary music sounds scary? How a minor chord can sound sad in\none song and angry in another? I want to teach you. And I can make it fun, by\nusing music you actually like.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI want to show you what\u2019s beneath the\nsurface of all the music you know and love. Trust me, it\u2019ll be Better Than It\nSounds.\u003cbr\u003e"
