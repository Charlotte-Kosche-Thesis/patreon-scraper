In between all that, I play ukulele and write little songs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not going to lie. I love creating and writing. Basically,the patrons supporting me help me justify the time and energy that goes into creating. There are so many hours in a day. And every hour I spend writing, every hour I spend working on a podcast comes at a cost of time from other projects. Having Patreon, and the kindness of patrons, let\u0027s me justify the time cost. That\u0027s right, there is a straight line from getting money to being able to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, thank you patrons for supporting me and allowing me to continue my quest to become a troubadour."
