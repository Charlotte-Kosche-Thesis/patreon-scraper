I appreciate you stopping by to check all this fun stuff out, and I hope you enjoy your stay!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://pm1.narvii.com/6306/12761a2a700750c7e9600b75f5583e4f084c3f3c_hq.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eAbout the Bug Catcher\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003eAs a cosplayer I love bringing characters to life through costume! Tall, short, powerful, soft... there are so many amazing fictional boys and girls I love and want to dress as! HOWEVER... this hobby is very expensive. It\u0027s like a leech sucking all money out of my wallet! Oh no! Not the kind of bug I like to deal with, no sir. By becoming a patron you\u0027ll be helping me take some of the pressure off, which means more costumes, more tutorials, more of everything fun and lovely! All for you, the kind soul helping me do what I love!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://pm1.narvii.com/6436/6a2d7dc2a44771596f56ddb304b7766f40cbbabf_00.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eBut... What Will You Get?!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003eYou\u0027ll get all sorts of great things for patronizing me! (As in... becoming a patron. Not like... actually patronizing me. Please don\u0027t do that.) Depending on the tier you could get anything from a nice, handwritten note to prints and tutorials of a costume that was made just for you! Even help planning and designing your own cosplay! This is a way for me to help people (like your fine self!) while also helping myself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://pm1.narvii.com/6521/74610f7358babd833be0b8ea78a2fa21a008972a_hq.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eDA RULEZ\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003eThis is the part where I sound a little too serious! Sorry about all the mom-ness that is about to come out right now. The rules are simple but quite important!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e-Depending on the tier you decide on, some of the rewards (such as the monthly tutorial, cosplay of the month prints, etc) are going to be released on a monthly basis. PLEASE provide a valid email and address, as these rewards won\u0027t be on the Patreon feed, but will be sent directly to you at the beginning of the month!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e-Depending on the tier you decide on, you may have access to special profiles, pictures, or applications. Access to these is per month, as is everything else!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e-Depending on the tier you decide on, you have the opportunity to choose a costume made/put together especially for you! Please think of this as a collaboration more than anything. Things that are NSFW or too far outside my comfort zone won\u0027t be accepted. If you\u0027re wondering if I\u0027ll do it, message me first! Overall, I want to make something that will make you happy! However, I won\u0027t make myself uncomfortable to do it. Let\u0027s work together to make something great!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/f0TzrOg.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast but not least...\u003cbr\u003ePlease respect the fact that lots of love, energy, and time goes into everything anyone on here will do, make, and send you. Don\u0027t share rewards with friends, but direct them here so they can be part of the fun, support, and learning too! Art of all forms is beautiful but disrespected so often. Please don\u0027t be the person who steals without regard for how it effects the person they\u0027re taking from.\u003cbr\u003e"
