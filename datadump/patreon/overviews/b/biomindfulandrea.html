My life\u0027s purpose is to educate,\u00a0inspire, and share how we can reconnect to and build relationships between ourselves, others, and the biosphere we share.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last twenty-four years of my life, I\u0027ve been studying, experimenting, inspiring and educating the public on how to build better relationships with themselves (through mindfulness) and the biosphere (through ecology). I\u0027ve worked, volunteered, created, and developed countless programs, talks, meditations, classes, and workshops to help tell a story about the ways in which we live in relation to the planet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThree years ago I started a nonprofit called Be Zero. Be Zero\u0027s mission is to inspire, educate, and activate individuals to dramatically reduce their trash and plastic footprint and to lead more simple and sustainable lifestyles. I\u0027ve worked endless building Be Zero\u0027s community. With over 100 volunteers across the globe sharing our mission, curated educational guides, outreaches, talks, and community gatherings and cleanups, Be Zero has become a global community voice on what it means to live \"zero waste.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the last three years, I\u0027ve grown my Instagram community from a few\u00a0hundred to over 75K followers across the world. I did this and continue to do this without any paid ads, sponsors, or third-party help. I want to what I share to be of value to others and to come from my heart and experiences. My Instagram community is my only social media where I educate through photos, words, videos, and live broadcasts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor three years, I\u0027ve worked tirelessly creating and educating without pay. I realize though that this is not sustainable. I can not do what I do without my community and now is the time to reach out and ask for your support so I can continue to educate, inspire, and activate others to rethink their trash footprint and rethink their relationships with themselves and the planet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was invited to speak at Tedx\u00a0Aruba in 2015\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G22DOQ0-Vn0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow your contribution supports me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution allows me to create, connect, and educate my international community on simple and practical ways to reduce our trash and plastic footprint and to curate biomindful\u00a0lifestyles.
