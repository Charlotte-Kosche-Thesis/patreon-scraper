    "summary": "Hi ducklings. My name is Chuck and I am a photographer, youtuber, podcaster, and aspiring film maker living in upstate NY while also being a fiance to a wonderful woman and  learning to be a dad to two wonderful kids all while trying to not screw it up too badly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I can hear yourself asking \u201cWhy is Chuck here on Patreon?\u201d Well I can certainly tell you and there are a couple reasons. First off, I love being creative. It makes my overall mood and life better. My day job goes better as does my home life when I can make new things.. Another reason is that having patrons, you wonderful loving people, I can grant you access to a behind the scenes look at my creative process and give you all a role in that process. So even if you arent a creative type, you can influence the content that I create. . \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what will you get by being a patron? Well I am glad you asked. Depending on your patron level, you will have access to feed posts, early access to projects I am currently working on, behind the scenes videos, exclusive images and videos not posted anywhere else, and much more as we go forward. All of your support will also help me create more and better content for you to enjoy so it is a win-win for us both! I plan on uploading videos bi-weekly, on Mondays and Thursdays.\u00a0"
