    "summary": "My name is Michelle Akin and I am a writer. There are actually a lot of things I could end the sentence \u201cI am a\u2026\u201d with, but when I take a look at my life and all the things I have been and done, writing is the through-line that is undeniable. For as long as I can remember I have been scribbling my thoughts into notebooks and dreaming of being a published author.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI originally started this Patreon to support my podcast, Naked with Clothes on. Podcasting was, for me, a solution to not \u201chaving time\u201d to make videos. After being a YouTuber for about seven years, I was burnt out on the production process and trying to find a quick fix for my need to communicate with the world. What I didn\u2019t realize was that the answer to my communication need has always been right in front of me\u2026 or\u2026 write in front of me ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDid you like that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this year, I have pulled back from podcasting and I have been focusing on writing as my main vehicle. It\u2019s been a struggle because I\u2019m so used to being scattered and having a million commitments at once. I\u2019m finding it very uncomfortable to have this much focus on one medium. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I have taken on more than one book at once (you can\u2019t teach an old over-committed creative new tricks, eh?) but due to the amount of focus I HAVE taken on, I\u2019ve actually come to a realization: I want to publish a book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot an ebook\u003cbr\u003eNot a self-published book\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want the whole shabang: a publisher, an editor, a marketing team, the works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut first, I need to complete a manuscript. In order to do that, I\u2019m going to need a lot of support. I\u2019m someone who has always made my projects short term (a few weeks to write everything). Instead, I\u2019m giving myself the next year to get this thing published.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so\u2026 I\u2019m reinventing this Patreon page to be focused around my writing. Patrons will get weekly updates on how the book is going and will get access to some of my writing that\u2019s still in process. I will also be very open to your feedback and ideas. It takes a village, y\u2019all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me bring this book baby into the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s my book idea:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTitle: I Blame My Husband!\u003cbr\u003eSubtitle: TBD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a non-fiction book about marriage and relationships, but really, it\u2019s about owning (and loving) who you are, all through the lens of relationship dynamics in marriages. Mainly: mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome chapter titles:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, how fucked up are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI have a headache\u201d and other intimacy avoiders\u003cbr\u003eSo Wrong, He\u2019s Right (aka you love how shitty he is)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this sounds like something you\u2019d be interested in, please stick around, there is SO much more to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for being here in support of my creative work. Because of you, I stay accountable and moving forward. In my coaching practice, I work with creative people. If I\u2019m not practicing what I preach, I begin to feel like a fraud and I stop getting clients. Having you all here keeps ME in integrity and has me able not only to continue my work, but to make a huge difference for a lot of people. When you support me, you support countless others. So truly\u2026 thanks for being here \u0026lt;3"
