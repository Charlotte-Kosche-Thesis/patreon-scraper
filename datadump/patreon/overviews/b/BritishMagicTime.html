With the recent cutbacks in WOTC\u0027s GP Coverage, there\u0027s all the more need for other sources of Magic coverage to step up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve honed our craft under our previous identity (2 Player Duelling), and now we\u0027re really proud of the level of quality our live Magic tournament streams achieve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, we are independant - the small LGSes that run tournaments in Northern England can\u0027t afford to contribute towards the significant costs of audiovisual hardware - not to mention the hundreds of hours of work involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that\u0027s where you come in! With your support, we can continue to invest in making the UK\u0027s Magic scene better through better tournament coverage. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
