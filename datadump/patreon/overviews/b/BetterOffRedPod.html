    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs.\"\u003c/strong\u003e Those words were written by Karl Marx more than 150 years ago. It\u0027s also our motto for how to produce and share this podcast, and we hope you\u0027ll be part of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eWe\u0027re producing a socialist podcast in a capitalist world. Each week on Better Off Red, we\u0027re getting behind the headlines to offer a deeper analysis from a socialist perspective. We\u0027re bringing you interviews with some of the best writers and activists out there. And we\u0027re doing it all while continuing to dedicate our time to the fight for a better world\u2014and working some day jobs. Which also means we\u0027re doing it on a shoestring.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron, you can help make this project a success. We\u0027re proud of what we\u0027ve done so far. We\u0027ve had some great episodes that show who we want to be. An in-depth, personal, but also sharply political discussion with immigrant rights activist Lupita Romero. Discussions about the new movement against gun violence, Trump\u0027s war cabinet, and the police and mental health. A feature episode on the teachers\u0027 rebellion. And fantastic interviews with Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, Dave Zirin, Brian Jones, Eric Blanc and Paul Heideman. And that\u0027s just in the first three weeks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we know we can do better and more. Some immediate things that your support will help make possible:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eClearing the debt we\u0027re carrying for start-up costs for sound equipment, website hosting and an email service\u2014\u003cem\u003eeveryone hates debt, right?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe ability to spend some money on promotion (web ads, postcards, maybe a few ads in publications) so more people can hear about us,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdditional gear to make us sound even better and help our call-in\u0027s.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eLet\u0027s say lots of people want to support us. Then we can start to dream a little bigger:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRenting recording space so we don\u0027t have to schlep ourselves or our equipment all across NYC on the notorious subway system,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMoney for travel to conferences where we can do live recordings, meet guests we\u0027d want to interview, and get the word out,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd this is probably the biggest one\u2014the resources to record and offer more frequent episodes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re not sure about a rewards structure. Right now, we prefer not to put anything behind a paywall. But we do want to think about ways to bring our patrons more interviews, more commentary\u2014just more. We\u0027d love your feedback, and we\u0027ll keep communicating. We promise to keep bringing you the best in socialist politics, news and analysis each week. We\u0027ll always punch up, never down. We\u0027ll make sure there\u0027s always a ray of hope to help you face this world that is teeming with injustice. And with your support we\u0027ll keep getting better.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
