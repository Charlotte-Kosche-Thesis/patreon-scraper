    "summary": "I started woodworking in 1991 and have been passionate about the craft since the very first day. Over 15 years ago, I picked up a hand plane for the first time and things have not been the same for my woodworking since. When I started out woodworking with hand tools, there was little information on this niche of the craft, so I learned primarily by experimenting and making mistakes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTraditional woodworking with hand tools is a craft that takes hands on time to learn. You can\u0027t just flip a switch and be off and running. However, having a source of good information can go a long way toward shortening the learning curve. My goal is to help you along your journey and hopefully keep you from making some of the same mistakes that I made. Maybe we\u0027ll even have a little fun along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write my blog and produce the Woodworking Hand Tools \u0026amp; Techniques podcast because I want to share what I have learned in my almost 3 decades working in the craft. I do so free to everyone because I want the information to be available to anyone, regardless of their financial situation. So I\u0027m proud to offer this Patreon campaign as a way for readers and listeners of my content to support my efforts to keep things going and keep the content free for everyone. I appreciate every donation, no matter the amount, and even if your situation does not allow you to offer a donation, I appreciate you reading and listening all the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy sincerest thanks to all of you for all of the support you have given me through all of the years that I\u0027ve been doing this!"
