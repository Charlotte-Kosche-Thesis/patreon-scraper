My name is Madeline and I am a self taught artist who is currently in high school!\u00a0I\u0027m sure many of you can relate to how satisfying it is to fulfill your personal calling. For me, I love writing compelling stories but also etching out emotions and colors through drawing. It was then that I realized that there was a way to combine these two passions- comics! I realized that the flow of a story through art was ingenious! Many years ago I had tossed a few ideas around, but it wasn\u0027t until the creation of Bittersweet Tales that I realized this truly was my personal legend. I found myself growing deeply attached to my characters and laughing or crying as I drew out panels in the story. It was because of this that I really wanted to start sharing my stories with the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think everyone can agree that money is a great motivator. It would be nice just to earn even a few extra dollars for doing the thing you love. That\u0027s why I would deeply appreciate if you could take even a little amount to help me with my creations! I would be able to buy better software, tablets and drawing supplies that would improve my comics even more! You also get little rewards the more you help donate so it\u0027s a win-win situation hee hee...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd also, if there is anyone that is reluctant on pursuing their dreams-whether it be drawing or anything else, I encourage you to go for it! No matter what struggles may come your way...just remember nothing can truly stop you from following your dreams!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
