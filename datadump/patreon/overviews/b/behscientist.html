In our pages, you will find analysis of current events by leading scientists, reports on developments in the field, interviews with experts, coverage of recently published books and papers, and a curation of some of the best behavioral science writing online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve been working on building and launching this magazine for over a year, but really the \u003cem\u003eBehavioral Scientist \u003c/em\u003ewas long in the making. Over the last decade, interest in the behavioral sciences and their application has grown tremendously\u2014in governments, non-profits, businesses, schools, and start-ups. Despite this growth, there exists no single, mainstream platform devoted to reporting on and discussing developments in the behavioral sciences. So we decided to create it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho are we? Our editorial board comes from three institutions\u2014ideas42, the Behavioral Science and Policy Association, and \u003cem\u003eThe Psych Report\u003c/em\u003e, with key support from the Center for Decision Research at University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business. Before we joined forces, each of us was trying in our own way to fulfill the mission of the \u003cem\u003eBehavioral Scientist\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe recognized we could do so much more if we worked together. We knew we wanted a site that was engaging to the largest possible audience while staying true to the science. We also wanted our writers and contributors to come from business, government, and non-profits, in addition to academia. Over the past year, we\u2019ve assembled a remarkable group of \u003ca href=\"http://behavioralscientist.org/columnists/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efounding columnists\u003c/a\u003e who shared our vision and agreed to lend their expertise to this cause.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether, our columnists represent over 40 organizations from across the United States, Europe, and Australia. They have backgrounds across a wide range of disciplines\u2014psychology, economics, design, organizational behavior, public policy, political science, sociology, network science, philosophy, engineering, and neuroscience. Their expertise touches on a diverse set of topics\u2014education, health care, politics, business, environment, law, immigration, and technology. This site is organized around these two categories\u2014fields and topics\u2014with the aim that it will be easy to navigate and useful for a diverse audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat brings us to the most important question: who is the Behavioral Scientist for? In short, everyone. We know policymakers, educators, entrepreneurs, managers at both enterprises and nonprofits, and journalists can all benefit from the insights of behavioral science. We want each of our articles to have something that readers will find valuable in understanding the world and perhaps worth applying in their own lives. In William James\u2019s words, \u201cTruth in our ideas means their power to work.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo let\u2019s get started.\u003cbr\u003e"
