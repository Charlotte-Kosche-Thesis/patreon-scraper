    "summary": "This podcast will be of interest to anyone with an interest in companion dog behaviour from the layperson companion dog owner to the interested in being a dog trainer, to the been training for ever and you can\u0027t tell me anything dog trainer. :) (Listeners will have to learn to put up with my off-beat sense of humor.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve personally been working full time with dogs for close to 30 years and as happy as I am to share with listeners my experience, a good part of this podcast will be interviewing experts in a variety of fields. Fields that do, or should be influencing how we think about companion dogs and companion dog training.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my training experience, I wrote the dog behaviour column Ask the Dog Guy with John Wade for many years and it grew to be the largest syndicated pet behaviour column ever. I also hosted a radio show Pet Talk Live for a year as well. I\u0027m told I have a voice but especially a face best suited to radio. :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast topics will range but I especially want to dig into the pseudoscience of \u2018might is right\u0027\u00a0training and it\u0027s prolific evil twin \u0027all positive\u0027 all the time dog training. I want to avoid the typical hysteria surrounding these topics and instead, offer a respectful, measured, rational critical eye based not only my own experience and research but with guests that actually do the research\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of respect. I do expect, in fact, I\u0027m looking forward to exploring some sensitive even polarizing issues that influence companion dog training. (prong collars, e-collars, clicker training, \u0027all positive\u0027 training, \u2018might is right training, regulated dog training, breeding, show vs work, nutrition, various approaches to resolving common and uncommon behaviour problems). As a result, there will be guests with controversial outlooks that I and some listeners may or may not agree. Agree or disagree, all guests will be treated with respect. There will be no gotcha journalism. I believe that you should have a respectful and intelligent dialogue with people you don\u0027t agree with as often as possible. If for no other reason to learn where I might be wrong?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not set on an overall format. I\u0027ll let that evolve organically. Some segments may be mere minutes and some may be a few hours (I met with a few excellent dog breeders last week and we talked for a few hours over a kitchen table - would have made a great podcast.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to do everything I can avoid having to take on commercial sponsors. I very much want to fund this podcast only through patrons like you. Many people kicking in very little making it possible for me to not interrupt segments for a message from our sponsor would be wonderful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result, my goal is to fund this podcast entirely through sponsors like you. The closest I will get to have a commercial sponsor is through my dog training collar business\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.wadecollars.com\"\u003ewww.wadecollars.com\u003c/a\u003e which will be laying out the initial funds to make the purchase of the equipment needed to operate a podcast and other than from time to time at the beginning or the end of the podcast mentioning the business helped to fund the podcast. In other words, no commercials interrupting\u00a0the podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like the format that Joe Rogan uses where at the beginning of the podcast he lists his sponsors and what they have to offer. If I\u0027m approached by potential commercial sponsors satisfied with that format then I\u0027ll give it a whirl.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I have a few additional patron sponsors on board, I will be investing in a second and third microphone/headsets for guests. As a result, the sound from the guests\u00a0may not for the first few shows be the greatest but everything in its time. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can afford to do so without putting a strain on your budget, please support this podcast financially. I promise to provide exceptional content and value for your $1.00/podcast averaging a podcast per week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso send me your ideas (whether you can afford to sponsor or not) regarding what you\u0027d like to see as far as format, recurring segments, suggested guests and topics. Send your ideas to \u003ca href=\"mailto:john@askthedogguy.com\"\u003ejohn@askthedogguy.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo learn more about me and the direction the podcast will take, visit my website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.askthedogguy.com/puppy-and-obedience-train-your-dog-with-john-wade/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAbout John Wade\u003c/a\u003e or watch the promotional video for my website included on this page (until I make something promoting the podcast.)\u003cbr\u003e"
