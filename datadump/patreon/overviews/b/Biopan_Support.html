    "summary": "** \u00a0A Message To All of My Sponsors **\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs human beings, I think we have an\nincredible opportunity to unite and affect real change in this world. I know\nthat I only have a limited amount of time on this earth to do this, so I\u2019m\ngoing to make every effort I can to learn, grow, experience all that I can and\ninfluence others in a passionate, meaningful and enduring way, so that when I\ndie, my life will have counted for something and I will have contributed to the\nevolution of our species as a whole. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs far as we know, there is nothing\nbeyond this life that we will experience in the same coherent way (by all\naccounts it is a pretty well-established fact that our consciousness does not\nsurvive after physical death) and I accept that, so I wish to pass on my\nthoughts and ideas to any and all who will listen.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will never have children, so this will be my\none and only legacy. I want to affect as many people as possible, in a\npositive, uplifting and inspiring way. My chosen method of doing this is\nthrough my writing. I have a total of eight unpublished books currently written\nand I need HELP to publish them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have one chance at this life, one shot to do\nsomething profound and meaningful. I eat, sleep and breathe Pantheism, because\nI believe that when properly understood and applied, it will lead to a\ncollective shift in consciousness that could revolutionize the world. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI only espouse one thing- the glory\nof reality and the love and respect for Nature and all of Its interconnected\nsystems. Everything I teach and promote flows from this, from my own love of\nNature and the deepest desire in my heart to see a world united in love. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt is our shared biology that binds\nus; the web of Life, our common thread. The Omnia is real and It is everywhere,\nimmanent, pervasive and embedded in all things. A veritable light that shines\nthrough the darkness of ignorance and deceit. We have only to tap into that\ndivine wellspring of knowledge and let It guide us.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThese things motivate me, they push me to evolve\nand continue moving forward\u2026 and I long for a day when people can see\nthemselves in each other and do away with all of the ignorance, bigotry,\nhatred, violence and greed that separates us and threatens to dominate our\nworld. It is not just a dream, we can make it happen, but we HAVE to work\ntogether. There has to be cohesion and a unified, singular vision. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAmong the Pantheist community,\neveryone seems to \u2018intellectually\u2019 know that \u201cGod is everything\u201d ..but how many\npeople really comprehend and understand the ramifications of this statement and\nlive by it and apply it to their lives? How many consider it on a daily basis\nand keep this awareness at the forefront of everything they do? It is my\ncontention that if more people truly understood this concept and allowed it to\nresonate in their hearts and guide them in their lives, it would literally\nchange the world. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs for me, I\u2019m going to continue to\ndo everything I can to make a difference, through my writing and through forums\nlike Facebook. Pantheism will spread, in one form or another\u2026 it must, because\nthe time to act is now and our future depends upon it. We need to adopt a\nunified, biological system of morality, founded on a practical, Earth-based\nform of spirituality, wherein we recognize the interconnectedness and\n\u201cinter-being\u201d of ourselves and all things.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis is one of the main reasons why I\nteach and promote Biopantheism, and why I am so adamant about seeing it become\na full-fledged, organized and coherent movement, because I see this attitude as\nthe ultimate solution to all of the problems we face in our societies and in\nour ecosystems. Do you see any other group or movement that embodies the\ncollective spirit of our best and brightest? Where is the voice of reason in\nthe world, holding out the standard, making biological Life and the welfare of\nhumans, plants, animals, the environment and the planet, the highest priority?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have written about this extensively and I am\nconfident that Biopantheism (or something like it), is the quintessential\nanswer to everything that threatens to destroy our civilization and our\nprecious biosphere- because it is, at its core, a most necessary, needed,\npoignant and profound philosophical outlook that contains within it, the power\nto transform lives and set things right once and for all, on a global scale. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt \u003cu\u003ecan\u003c/u\u003e work and it\u2019s entirely\npossible, but first we need to cultivate this awareness in ourselves and\ninspire an accurate and practical knowledge/understanding of it in others, with\na clear comprehension of its principles, minus all of the abstract rhetoric and\nuseless fillers so common in other philosophies. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy only concern is the truth about\nthe nature of existence, what matters in terms of our daily lives and what will\nbenefit humanity, living organisms and the planet at large. By stripping Pantheism down to its most fundamental\nethic and simultaneously developing and establishing it in a practical way, we\ncan offset the manipulative powers that be, who only wish to profit and prosper\nfrom our stratification, discontentment and misery. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy incorporating into our lives,\nthose habits and activities that work best to keep us perpetually motivated and\nconscious of these truths, we can dispel the darkness and pave the way for a\nnew and glorious future. Won\u2019t you stand with me, as I attempt to share this\nmessage of inspiration and unity with the world? Visit my website, read my\narticles, join my Facebook page, share this philosophy with others and help\nmake these noble dreams become a reality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
