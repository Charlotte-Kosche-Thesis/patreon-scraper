I\u0027ve also been involved in videogame development, composing soundtracks, and writing and directing a number of videogame projects of my own. The most popular in-development title I currently have to my name is Erah: The Guardians. While jumping back and forth between commercial and non-commercial projects, I also created an experimental album during this time called Lycanthropy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eAll of my non-commissioned work had been available for free during this time, and I want to continue with this trend in the future. I believe art should be available to as many people as possible, but it is harder and harder to create content without any sort of fan support. That\u0027s where YOU come in.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, it\u0027s not as easy as it was meant to be anymore. Even with the accessibility of sites where you can share your content, you\u0027re basically cutting it off from the people - the people it was meant to be shared with. Patreon is the perfect way to not only share your content with the world, but also to be in direct contact with your old and new fans. I can hear what you really want, I can provide all the content you want, and I also have the chance to thank you for your support using this one convenient platform.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eHow will I spend the money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the money (all of YOUR money) will be spent on creating new content, improving my assets and skills with the ultimate goal of financially stabilizing myself. I did my best in choosing the tiers so you won\u0027t feel like you are either left out, or you won\u0027t get anything for your money. Not only sneak peeks, but regular sessions will be included for the higher tiers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy highest priority right now is to quit my current job, so I won\u0027t have to travel in between two different cities daily. If I can achieve this goal, a lot of time will be freed up, allowing me to take on more commissions AND provide extra content for Patreon. That, in turn, will be more than enough to support my living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhat else can I say?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a journey we all embark on in life. The purpose of this page is that I can share my journey with you, and we can create something that lasts, together. Something that has a positive influence on both our lives.
