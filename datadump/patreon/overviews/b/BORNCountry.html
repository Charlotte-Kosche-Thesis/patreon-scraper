We offer an online home for fans and artists alike while the mainstream pulls further and further away from the traditional sounds of country music.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Situation:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want BORN Country to last for a very long time.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0With over 25,000 fans on Facebook, there is simple proof that you LOVE BORN Country. That makes me love what I do more and more with every single post. Not only am I able to bring back country music memories for our fans, but also provide support for those artists that no longer receive play on mainstream country radio. If we as fans aren\u0027t fighting for them, who will?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBORN Country MUST become self-sustainable.\u003c/strong\u003e When I first started BORN Country as a simple blog for my friends and family, I ran the website out of my pocket and it didn\u0027t amount to more than a few dollars here and there. Two years later, a LOT of money and a LOT of time has gone into iwasborncountry.com. With that being said, this blue-collar guy\u0027s day job paycheck only goes so far! I hate internet ads just as much as you do and I am dedicated to keeping our website ad-free so you aren\u0027t bothered by pesky random pop-ups for male enhancement pills or dating websites. With no advertisements bringing in an income to run the website, we turn to those whose input matters most.
