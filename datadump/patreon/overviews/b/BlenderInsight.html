This of course means that I like to make my own material in Blender without using any images at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also love to share my material and knowledge to others, so I have started my page\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.blenderinsight.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlender Insight textures\u003c/a\u003e, where you totally free can download procedural textures. They then belongs to you without any limitations. The downloads are no pictures, but the raw .blend file. This also means that you easily can do small changes and fine tune the setup to get similar material with a different appearance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy focus on this specific area started when I saw the huge need of explanations on forums on how to use the cycles nodes. I then started the YT channel \"Blender Insight\", the FB group \"Blender Procedural Textures\" and also wrote the documents I mentioned above.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHopefully it have helped many of you that wanted to understand how the cycles nodes worked and I will continue to help as much as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I now teach everything I know about the nodes to all that wants to listen, why should I have a \"Patreon\" site?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main reason is of course that I would like to be able to do this full time, but also to afford to have extra web pages as showcase for all the materials and textures you can download. Right now it\u0027s just on my spare time and I don\u0027t have that much time to help all of those that want a fantastic material to their projects. If this is a success it will give me more time and you will get more materials to use as you like (even change or sell) and absolutely free :).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if I teach you all I know of this subject, I believe that you like to have a library to pick from rather than doing things from scratch. I also believe that I have some eye for patterns and are able to produce high quality stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, support me... and I will be able to support you more :).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLink to all the textures:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.blenderinsight.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.blenderinsight.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
