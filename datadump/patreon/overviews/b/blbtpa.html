Blue Lotus Temple Pennsylvania does not yet have a physical address and that\u0027s why we need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeginning in 2012, Bhante Soma spent three years under the study and guidance of his teacher and mentor, Bhante Sujatha at Blue Lotus Temple, IL. Bhante Soma was then sent here to Central Pennsylvania to build a Buddhist community and teach his practitioners to reap the powerful effects of a daily meditation practice. The benefits of meditation include peace of mind, stress reduction, spiritual growth and wellbeing, and compassion towards all people including oneself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the short time that Bhante Soma has been in Central Pennsylvania, he has worked hard to build a spiritual community. Bhante Soma brings wisdom and humor to his Dharma talks. His message of Loving Kindness resonates with people on a deep level, and has helped them to find something in their lives that they didn\u2019t know was missing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBhante Soma is traveling all around Central Pennsylvania teaching over 20 meditation classes a month. He performs many house blessings and baby blessings, and is available to officiate at weddings and funeral services. He makes himself available to anyone who needs spiritual guidance, at any time of day.\u003cbr\u003e",
