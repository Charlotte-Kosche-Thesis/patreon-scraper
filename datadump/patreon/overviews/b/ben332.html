Every penny goes towards living expenses, and if you\nlook at the goals, the more support I get from my patrons, the more\ncontent I can afford to put out in a month! Every penny gives me more\nmotivation, and security in knowing I won\u2019t suddenly go homeless\ndue to financial worries. Make no mistake, I\u2019d still be doing this\neven if I never got a single cent, and have been, too. With that\nsaid, I look forward to seeing the things my patrons enable me to do,\nand the life they help me build. If you read this far, I thank you\nfor reading my ramblings, and hope you consider becoming my patron.\u003cbr\u003e"
