I\u0027m pissed off about so many things - about homophobia, about racism, about sexism, about transphobia... the list goes on and on. \u003cstrong\u003eAnd when I get pissed off, I draw political cartoons.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.leftycartoons.com/wp-content/uploads/concise.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo How Does This Patreon Thing Work, Exactly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon\n is a way for ordinary readers to support creators. It\u0027s a bit like Kickstarter, except instead of making one big donation \ntowards one big project, you make \n\u003cstrong\u003erecurring small donations for ongoing creative work\u003c/strong\u003e. \nIf you sign up to support my cartoons - to \"become a patron,\" as we say around here - you\u0027ll be able to change or cancel your patronage at any \ntime, and you\u0027ll only be charged once a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, for example, if you pledge to give me $2 per \npolitical cartoon, and I create two cartoons in a month, then at the \nmonth\u0027s end you\u0027ll be charged $4. And \u003cstrong\u003eyou can set a maximum on how much you can be charged per month\u003c/strong\u003e, so even if I go on a \u003cem\u003eWILD CREATING SPREE\u003c/em\u003e and post ten comics in a single month (and wouldn\u0027t that be awesome?), \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u0027ll never be charged more than you want to. \u003c/strong\u003eSo if you have a maximum of $1 a month, and I post ten comics in a month - you\u0027ll still only be charged one dollar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\n are a few perks for my cool Patreon supporters (see below for more on \nthat!), but the main reward is, you get more political cartoons to \nenjoy. And whenever you see one of my cartoons on Facebook, \u003cstrong\u003eyou get to think \"oh, cool! I helped make that!\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/3/e30%3D/patreon-posts/su0J7VgxXptGKr6O-nBOEJljWZMjZhs5_-ntSuZn9bjs9NknuVYHyu1JsILU9a6A.png?token-time=1505520000\u0026amp;token-hash=g5nZL7sXnWmVtm_XyMHhYKsT_QLsl48IUT6MzJZ22sU%3D\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Who Is Barry Deutsch?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a lefty cartoonist whose political cartoons have won two Massachusetts Newspaper Association awards, and the Charles Schultz Award.\u00a0 You\u0027ve probably already seen some of my cartoons passed around on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr.

I wanted to create many\n more political cartoons, and to cover topics that don\u0027t always fit into \"Dollars and Sense.\"\u00a0 And that\u0027s where you - and Patreon - come in. \u003cstrong\u003eSince I began this Patreon, I\u0027ve been able to increase my output from once every two months, to once a week. That\u0027s the difference reader support makes.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut although Patreon support is great, it\u0027s not yet a living.
