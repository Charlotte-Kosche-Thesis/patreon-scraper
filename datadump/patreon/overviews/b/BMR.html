The forum is \nhosted on the same hardware that \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eElliquiy\u003c/a\u003e is and, between these two \nmassive sites (with over thirty million posts and messages between them)\n takes a fair bit of hardware to run, as well as even more to provide \nreliable backups - both offsite and on.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are a friendly and tight-knit writing community \ndespite its ever-growing size, boasting corners for people garnering all\n sorts of interests: from gaming to anime, from art to music. It even \nhas areas for those who like to engage in intellectual discussion or who\n just wish to mingle whether privately via PMs, post-by-post on the \nboards or even in real-time via the chat feature. It\u0027s a wonderful \ncommunity where writers can come together and share creative ideas, hang\n out and just escape daily life for a little while.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat said, your support helps keep us running, and helps me keep some \nfree time to make sure things continue to move smoothly. Every little \nbit helps and is greatly appreciated, though your life comes first and \nif money is tight, wait for a better time to donate.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNote: Becoming a supporter of one forum is good for both. You don\u0027t need\n to become a Patron for each unless you really want to. : )\n\u003cbr\u003e"
