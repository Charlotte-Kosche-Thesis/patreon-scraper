    "summary": "Hey I\u0027m ToToM, a.k.a. Thomas BOIVIN, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou probably already know me from the Kanye of the Stone Age album that has had insane media coverage by the end of 2015, everywhere from England\u0027s The Independent to Consequence of Sound or Onion\u0027s AV Club. The feedback has been amazing. Unless you remember With Boots, a mashup album based on Nine Inch Nails\u0027 With Teeth from ten years ago, you may not know I\u0027ve been making mashups for over a decade at \u003ca href=\"http://www.totom.eu/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.totom.eu/\u003c/a\u003e . \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal has always been to create mashups that weren\u0027t either bad mixtapes or simply slamming two tracks together, as far as I can from either EDM and Top 40. From a starting point that can either be hearing one song while listening to another one or using another particular song, it\u0027s about making a new opus that feels like a natural song ultimately, whereas it just happens to be a mix of two different songs or more from more or less far-fetched genres.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhereas I barely made any revenue from this activity -- I consider a few paid DJ gigs in ten years don\u0027t really count --, it\u0027s really time-intensive and processor-intensive. That\u0027s why I\u0027m setting this page up as a mashup services portal to ultimately fund myself new hardware basically, in order to replace my already 13 year-old Powerbook I\u0027m still using for DJ gigs and an almost equally old laptop PC for my current productions. For your information, I also have a job so this activity has always been spent on my spare time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason this isn\u0027t just a standard donation campaign to beg you for money is because I want you to get something in return and let you feel involved whatever the amount you\u0027re willing to give. I\u0027ve usually produced mashups based on what I feel like will sound best, and I want you to join me in making my next batch of tracks or albums because I also always loved being challenged to use on particular track (remix contests, artists), sometimes that didn\u0027t appeal to me at first and it very often ended up sounding very good. I\u0027ll still make sure whatever comes out sounds great - even if that means disagreeing with you on some things or forcing myself to use a song I don\u0027t like, which will become a challenge to take it as far as possible from the original, whether it\u0027s taking it to the foreign lands of silliness or just an extreme clash of genres.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be completely transparent, all the money will be put into audio hardware, first it\u0027d be a new Macbook Pro, then the renewal of my Ableton Live license... The goal isn\u0027t to get money for rent or gadgets - it\u0027s to make sure I can keep doing what I\u0027m doing with the best tools possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny intermediate contribution superior by at least 20 \u20ac to the price set up (starting from the 50 \u20ac reward) will give right to a t-shirt of your choice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for supporting my work over the years and into the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe video posted is just an example of my recent work.\u003cbr\u003e"

It gives you the right to ask me three full mashup albums (or six EPs, or 40 single mashups) related to your entity. At least six months must separate two releases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI allow myself the right to decline if I think the original material doesn\u0027t fill my requirements or if I think I can\u0027t fill my part of the deal. For that reason, you should contact me before getting this one, I\u0027m open to discuss about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou should notice that the amount set is way below market prices in terms of what a remixer could ask to a label or an artist, I guess I just set a minimum I think it is fair to ask.\u003cbr\u003e",
