This is such a unique and powerful tool to connect with my audience, and it can only be possible and successful with YOUR help!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re on this page, you\u0027re likely familiar with me and what I do, but if not, check out these links:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/BrutallsYouTube\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBrutall\u0027s YouTube Channel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/BrutallsTwitch\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBrutall\u0027s Twitch\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/BrutallsTwitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBrutall\u0027s Twitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/BrutallsFacebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBrutall\u0027s Facebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo who am I exactly? Well, my real name is Ryan, but I\u0027m best known as Brutall online. I am a full-time Twitch streamer who absolutely loves connecting with my audience. I primarily play WoW, as you probably know, but more important than anything else,\u00a0I\u0027m a husband and a father. Quite frankly, becoming a father is something I\u0027ve always wanted, and it\u0027s finally a reality.\u00a0I couldn\u0027t be happier with who I am and how my life has turned out, and my hope is you see that joy each time you tune in to my stream, or watch a YouTube video of mine.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy passion lies in gaming and being a part of this community we\u0027re building together. I hope you find my streams and videos entertaining, but most of all, I hope you find inclusion and a family wherever you watch my content, as that\u0027s priority number one to me and those who believe in what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo, What\u0027s This Patreon Thing All About?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis page allows me to receive monthly contributions for providing consistent content on Twitch and YouTube. For me, I treat it more like a Twitch subscribe button than anything due to the fact that I am not currently partnered with Twitch (one day...hopefully). Essentially, at the beginning of each month, Patreon will contact you and ask if you want to make your monthly contribution. You either say yes, or you say no, and that\u0027s that. It\u0027s simple, convenient, and works like a charm.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Next?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEither you elect to lend your support, which would be awesome, or you don\u0027t, which is okay, too. I\u0027m just happy to be able to do what I do each and every day, and it is wholly because of YOU. Thank you for trusting and believing in me and the community we\u0027ve built tirelessly these past few years. I hope to see you on my Twitch stream quite soon.\u003cbr\u003e"

I see ~90% of what you donate, as Patreon does an amazing job ensuring I see most of the money that is exchanged through their website.\u00a0Remember, you can donate ANY amount of money, not just what is listed below. Feel free to be creative should you feel inspired.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you want to donate anything more than $25 a month, please consider\u00a0donating directly to my PayPal.
