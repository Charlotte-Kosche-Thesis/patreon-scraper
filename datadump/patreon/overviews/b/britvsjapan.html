    "summary": "Hi there, my name is Matthew Hawkins. I am an undergraduate software engineer from the UK. I acquired \u201cfluent\u201d Japanese in 18 months while studying Software Engineering full-time at University.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started learning Japanese around June of 2015 but I knew nothing about language learning at the time and was unsure as to how to go about this mammoth of a task.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter spending about a month researching the different aspects of the Japanese language, and language learning in general, I stumbled across a blog known as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/\"\u003eAll Japanese All The Time\u003c/a\u003e (or AJATT). Using the philosophies of AJATT I ended up reaching \"fluency\" in \u003cstrong\u003e18 months, \u003cem\u003ewithout stepping foot in Japan\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXBgK4a3FWQ\"\u003eHere\u0027s a video of me speaking Japanese.\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003eI am by no means perfect, or anywhere close to a native level speaker, but I\u0027m continuing to use AJATT as a base along with everything else I\u0027ve learned to constantly improve my Japanese to a higher level of fluency while also sharing what I learn with you guys along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince I started learning I\u0027ve been tracking my progress and creating content on YouTube and on my website:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blog.matthewhawkins.co/\"\u003ematthewhawkins.co\u003c/a\u003e to help others\u00a0learn languages faster and in a more enjoyable manner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve noticed that a lot of other content on the internet isn\u0027t that good at getting people to fluency and I want to change that.\u00a0I want to create useful blog posts to help people learn languages and use what I know about search engine optimization to spread this content to a wider audience so that more people can \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eactually \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003elearn how to learn languages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to turn my website into a resource that has everything one needs to go from knowing nothing to knowing everything they need to do to reach \u201cfluency\u201d in the quickest time that is reasonably possible by sharing everything I know so far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to help me make a difference to the language learning community, and in turn help people to learn languages, then feel free to support me. The more support I get, the more time and effort I can put into exclusive content here on Patreon as well as posts on my blog and videos on my YouTube channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to take this opportunity to say thank you to all of you who have already donated on my website.
