    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003eWhat is Blood in the Gutters?\u003c/h1\u003eBlood in the Gutters is a bi-weekly podcast created and hosted by Sarah Camp,\u00a0that looks to delve into the nuances of comics and graphic storytelling; while the show will summarize, discuss, and review comics, the point is to examine their influence within a larger cultural context.\u00a0Each episode will feature one singular comic for discussion, and also contain a \"creator spotlight\" in which I spend a few minutes hyping up an independent artist, illustrator, or cartoonist.\u00a0While most episodes will be hosted solely by yours truly (Sarah), occasionally I will bring on guests and co-hosts, and in some cases give up the reigns entirely for special topics hosts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those with accessibility concerns -- fear not! Full episode transcripts will be made available here at no cost!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h1\u003eIt takes a lot of time and energy to properly research each episode, to write up scripts, and to record and produce the audio at a level of quality that you all deserve. All of that time spent researching, writing, recording, and perfecting each episode ends up being the equivalent to a full-time job, so Patreon helps me pay the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to this there is also the hard costs of running the show -- website and podcast file hosting, audio equipment, and the cost of comics themselves gets expensive. Your Patreon support helps cover all of that as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e"
