And its only thanks to all those people in my life who had supported me as an artist, those people who looked at my art and asked \"Why didn\u0027t you draw a comic yet?\" and all those\u00a0awesome artists who inspired me to finally go back and give it another try. And boy does it take time and effort\u00a0to do this! But also a lot of fun and the rewarding feeling of holding something finished.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI would love to see other people enjoy seeing my work"
