If you want to help water the flowers of life, and support the blossoming of conscious music, consider supporting Bloom music!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout Bloom: Bloom (Robin Liepman) is a bright budding beam of luminosity dedicated to dream-weaving, co-creating and pollinating a vibrant world that is thriving, just, sustainable, harmonious, and equitable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBloom is an earth activist musician and new paradigm pollinator. His soul\u0027s purpose is to actively re-weave the dream of the modern world into a vibrant, harmonious, regenerative and equanimous existence.Bloom was born from the warm coastal womb of central California in San Luis Obispo, educated by the fairies and tree people at the University of California Santa Cruz with a degree in Psychology and Cognitive Science, (and a special focus on life, the universe and everything,) and initiated into the intergalactic tribe of awakening beings during his six months of travel through Central America, becoming initiated into the modern day mystery school via volunteering at an endless stream of transformational festivals. He then went on a spiritual pilgrimage through Peru and Bolivia, emerging with a strengthened sense of life path and purpose, re-visited Costa Rica, and is now on Vancouver Island in Canada for his Permaculture Design Course/Earth Activist Training with Starhawk and friends. He is a co-founder, co-organizer, and co-creator of the \"Blooming Biodiversity\" permaculture tour (www.BloomingBiodiversity.org), which in the Fall of 2015, toured the North American West Coast with a team called \u201cSolutionary Productions.\" It was a journey of healing the world through holistic integrative permaculture activations worldwide. The tour has taken him to Hawaii, to Peru, where he was planting gardens and working with Shipibo children through the Arkana Alliance organization, and back to the U.S. West Coast. He now lives in Maui and will be diving deep into musical creation at the eco-community he now lives in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBloom is a free spirit and can often be found free styling and generating group singing experiences around the sacred fire. He is dedicated to co-creating solutions to global challenges, and actively actualizing avenues for vibrant exist-dance to unfold.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSend him a message to see how you can get involved in creating positive change right from where you are.\u003cbr\u003e"
