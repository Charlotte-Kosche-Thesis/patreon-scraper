    "summary": "I make art. There will be a graphic novel, and comics, at some point. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy genre is scifi/religious comedy/fantasy/tradgedy/horror. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI sometimes enjoy delving into nonsense genres like metafiction.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI love dank memes and I cannot lie.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor now, whatever I upload is whatever gets put here. I am sort of melencholy, so, sometimes it will just be character sketches of the same character over and over again. That character is usually LCig or Alt.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut sometimes it will be fully rendered scenes or image sequences, maybe full comics, and it will be really cool and awesome, or horrible and naughty.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere will be public stuff, which I intend to compile into an ongoing, running storyline which I will release for free, always, for as long as it runs. That is what I am working on now, so if you\u0027re on the fence about pledging a dollar, follow along for a while and see what developes. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThen there will be more elaborate paid storylines which will definitely be awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere may even be amazon ebooks. I don\u0027t know.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI hate writing summaries, so if you want a summary of Honeycomb, my working titke for the novel I\u0027m on right now, message me, please, and I will happily attempt a summary. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDISCLAIMER: my work is not for everyone. It contains high doses of subtextual nonsense and other big words, heavy concentrations of self loathing and angst, and undulation on the street corner of Culty Zealot str. and Nihilist Rd. There will be attempts at philosophical discourse which might entertain the amature but make the learned reader puke. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I hope those who it is meant for will find some truth and direction in it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnyways, I get better every day. My favorite medium is graphite and charcoal, with a special place for chalk pastel, sharpie, and colored pencil. Some inspirations of mine are Lovecraft, Stephen King, David Firth, Teh Bible, Daoism, Budhism, Islam, Africa, medieval litterature about the black death, qigong, pirates, Star trek, Star Wars, Fifth Element, Event Horizon, Dark City, V for Vendetta, Judge Dredd, and many more. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf anything I make strikes your fancy and you want more, please consider pledgeing a dollar or more.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

But here in michigan we have something called Deer Tracks icecream and I don\u0027t know what hipster got paid for renaming a perfectly good flavor.\u003cbr\u003eI studied writing for a long damn time at Western Michigan University. I was in all the honors English I could possibly be in. So much so that I didnt bother getting a degree in it, which I should have done. But, that aside, I am a writer, will always be a writer, and also like to draw. I learn from my mistakes and try not to pout about them. I improve.\u003cbr\u003eI also studied French for a while, studied Chinese in Beijing for a year, decided college wasnt for me, and now Im doing a welding cert program. If I cannot find a way to make money as a writer/illustrator, then I will get a job welding until I can go back to to school for art and animation. If I make money doing this patreon thing, I will still go back to school for art and animation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a coffee addict and am currently drinking gallons of apple juice in an attemot to quit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy life is going to be like breaking bad, except instead of cooking meth Im going to make art. And brew coffee. And drink apples. Swag.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been interested in horror, creative writing, philosophy, and dank memes on deh internetza for my whole lifes. I listen to dank meme compilations on youtube. While drinking microwaved chocolate bretzle icecream. And drawing more wonderful terrible things to show you here, on line.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
