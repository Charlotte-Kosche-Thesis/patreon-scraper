They were spaces designed to help people to think more deeply about life. Spaces where people could question without fear, embrace their doubts, their concerns and weaknesses. Communities where new ways of thinking about age-old questions could live and breathe and turn into practices that would bring change.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027ve come to Patreon, to create an online space where people can join me in exploring those ideas and more. Through lecture courses and seminars, book studies, discussions, and weekly reflections we will discuss theology, philosophy, culture, technology, the arts and so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eIf you\u0027d like to support my work and contribute to its future, then I hope you will consider joining me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
