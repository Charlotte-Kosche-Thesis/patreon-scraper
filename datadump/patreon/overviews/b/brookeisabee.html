I started taking interest in conventions in 2010, when my anime club decided to take a fieldtrip to a \"small\" one near my hometown. Anime Expo was my first and ONLY convention (beginning in 2011), up until 2014, when my best friend and I decided that this was definitely the hobby for us. From there, my passion for costuming has grown more and more, to the point I am going to school to be a theatrical costumer! I do have a job (I am a full-time waitress) and am a full-time birb mom. Yes, taking care of two precious angels can take a lot of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PLEDGE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour continuous support means the world to me, whether it be on here, my social media pages, etc. However, if you do choose to pledge here, funding will go straight back to costumes, art, rewards for you guys, learning new techniques for builds, and so much more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs an added bonus, I am combining my cosplay with my digital art, so pledging to me will not only support cosplay, but also my fun \u0027lil artsy fartsy goodies! I have been working digitally since around 2012, and traditionally since I could hold a pencil. Art and cosplay are definitely my favorite hobbies, and getting to share that with you is such a treat~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSeriously all, thanks for stopping by \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3 Hope to see you on the pledge list!~\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u2019ve had sooo much over the years, and I\u2019m excited to keep learning more and create even more fun stuff, for myself and for you guys! I do have a full time job as a waitress, and I currently am paying for college, so Patreon is a huge help with my cosplay adventures!\u003cbr\u003eI am also a digital artist, who loves to create silly little knickknacks, like keychains and enamel pins!
