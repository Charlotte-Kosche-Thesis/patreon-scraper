Well, with me, \u00a0I try and make the things I like to do into things I\u0027m good at doing. Even if I fail tremendously, I believe that in sharing my journey, I can inspire everyone to do exactly what makes them the most happy, and nothing less!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/bretony\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emaking videos\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://BretonyBoheme.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewriting my blog\u003c/a\u003e over 10 years ago. \u00a0My content ranges from personal stories and societal philosophies to travel and tourism. \u00a0Currently, I am on a very strict regime of putting out a brand new blog post every single Monday. \u00a0Rain or shine! \u00a0I put out new videos whenever I am able, but would like to be much more consistent with that as well. \u00a0I like to remain casual, down to earth, and ultimately true to my free-spirited hippie happy self. Over the years, I\u0027ve been fortunate enough to reach hundreds of thousands or people all over the world (I think). \u00a0My goal is to reach an even MORE broad scale of viewers through my visual, musical, and literary artistry, as well as any other art form I may come to know and love. My website currently has not a single advertisement, nor one single paid promotional post. \u00a0I like to give away my art for free! \u00a0Alas, you do get what you pay for, so with no income or support, higher quality and more frequent content is quite rough. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a patron of mine will mean you support my artistic endeavors, would like to see more, and would also like to see them improve. \u00a0I will for sure keep my site free, but for those who (can and do) go the extra mile to support me, you will be helping me out GREATLY and receive access to even MORE content. \u00a0Most importantly, having supporters will give me a greater sense of accountability. \u00a0I wouldn\u0027t just be doing this for me, I\u0027d be doing this for all of you too. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for believing in me and sharing this journey to living my passion! \u00a0Isn\u0027t it awesome to be a personal patron of the arts?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
