I\u00a0 appreciate the opportunity to get to sing\u00a0 and play for you live in all the shows on this side of planet Earth, but even more, I love the fact that you are singing MY songs right along with the other favorites that you\u0027ve always known. I have always- for my whole life- wanted to write songs that moved people; touched them in some way. . . whether that was their wistful nostalgia, their imagination, or even their funny bone. It have been my privilege to tour and play these songs, meet yourselves\u00a0 . . .and find a better outlook about life. Your support gives me justification, and credibility. I absolutely love it. I hope the songs all meet your high standards in all areas that you would expect from my music; whim, wit or wisdom. Put on the \u0027phones and crank up the Heavy Folk Rock.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Amazing.\nPhenomenal. Unbelievable. These are the adjectives most commonly used to\ndescribe the Singer/Guitarist from New Mexico, whether they are talking about\nhis voice, or his guitar playing. Now in his fourth year as a Solo Performer on\nthe National stage, Bat leaves quite an impression wherever he plays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bat grew up in\nZion, IL, a little North of Chicago on Lake Michigan\u2019s shore where Illinois\nbecomes Wisconsin. His brother Steve and he started playing bluegrass tunes on\nbanjo \u0026amp; guitar when Bat was eight years old. Singing around the campfire\n\u0026amp; entertaining at family parties was a typical occurrence for the boys.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe family moved\nto New Mexico around the time Bat was in High School, and meeting other\nmusicians with largely different styles gave him a whole new world of\ninfluences to practice on and draw from. A musical sponge, Bat soaked up every\nnote of these new sounds and began applying them to his music. Bat wrote his\nfirst compositions as a teenager, one of which, \u2018Playground\u2019 has been recognized\nInternationally and is currently used in rotation on Jazz radio stations in the\nUSA.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIn addition to\nguitar \u0026amp; banjo, Bat learned to play drums, piano, and bass. After high\nschool he easily found enough work as a Bass player to keep him employed (as\nwell as simultaneously doubling on the Keyboards) for the next 20 years.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHe spent a period\nof time hitchhiking across the US and ultimately landed in San Francisco, where\nhe began polishing his amazing ability to cover almost anything from the Rock,\nFolk, Country, Soul, Metal and Oldies catalogues, playing on the wharf there\nfor tourist tips.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n1986 Bat met\nBrenda while in New Mexico, and they were married. They raised three children\nin the Rio Rancho and Albuquerque area.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLooking for a way\nto serve his country, Bat began a series of letters to the United States\nDepartment Of Defense, and after a year of being directed to this office and\nthat, found himself in a traveling position as an entertainer for US Troops\noverseas for all branches of US Armed Forces, performing what most people know\nas USO shows for active duty forces in bases all over the world. Bat has\nperformed for Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, Ambassadors and Statesmen not\nonly for the US but also the Emissaries of many lands in over 50 countries. One\nyear became nearly ten, and the touring went on without letup until 2002. Once\nthe Second Gulf War had started, the USO schedule became too choked with\nCelebrities wanting to go to Iraq to be with the Troops, that Bat decided to leave\nthat Arena to the big shots, and go home for a while.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDuring all this\ntime of travel and performing with bands, Bat had become the Lead Singer in the\nensembles he was performing with and, gifted with an incredible voice range,\nlearned to use it in every style, learning to copy with uncanny accuracy the\nvocal tone \u0026amp; style of the greatest of singers from Journey to Johnny Cash.\nTouring non-stop, audiences are still awed nightly by his unbelievably\nversatile voice.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\n\nReturning home and\nperforming much less, Bat found other work for a time in a number of ways, but\nmostly helping Brenda to run her advertising Business in Albuquerque. After a\ncouple of decades of National and International performing, Bat felt he was\ndone with the music business and told Brenda that he was ready to get out.\nBrenda, however, had other ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe children\nhaving grown up and moved away, Brenda was eager to get out on the road and see\nthe country. She convinced Bat to pick up his old 12-string guitar again, and\ntake a run at the music business as a solo guitarist, and she, his manager.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat can I say?\u2019 admits Bat. \u201cShe was right.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBat returned to\nhis guitar playing with an intensity that was unstoppable. In all the years of\nbass playing, Bat had always been practicing on the guitar and doing solo gigs\nhere \u0026amp; there, but now turned his attention to the instrument with a\nvengeance.Practicing day \u0026amp; night,\nBat wrote \u0026amp; recorded the first solo CD \u201cWaiting For Zavala\u201d on only two\ninstruments- 12 String Guitar and voice. The result is what he refers to as\n\u201cHeavy Folk.\u201d Most others call it acoustic music on steroids. The guitar\nplaying is flashy and impressive, and the melodies are beautiful. Catchy tunes\nthat stick in one\u2019s mind immediately, while studiously avoiding the sound of typical\npop radio formula songs.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe second CD\n\u201cDigital Sculpture\u201d takes folk music to a whole new level. While still recorded\nstrictly with acoustic guitar \u0026amp; voice, the production is more lavish with\nvocal arrangements and percussion sounds- all of which are produced from\ndrumming on the guitar body in various ways. Digital sculpture features Bat\u2019s\nMagnum Opus for acoustic guitar called \u201cLast Stand In Texas\u2019; a three-movement\nmasterpiece of 12 String guitar virtuosity that leaves the audiences standing in\nthe aisles at the shows. This is the current CD that Bat is touring in support\nof.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBat has been\ntouring North America solo now for 3 years from Coast to coast in the USA \u0026amp;\nCanada. The CDs have been acclaimed worldwide, and have been featured on\ntelevision shows in Europe. He has been awarded back-to-back songwriting grants\nfrom ASCAP for his compositions, and the performances of them. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe latest CD \u201cTone Poems\u201d was released in late 2015, and is an entire\nvolume of instrumental compositions for Solo Guitar, which includes, in\naddition to his world renowned 12-String playing, pieces for standard 6-string,\nand compositions on nylon string classical guitar. There are many short and\ncatchy guitar ditties, one outrageously spoofy character tune, and some very\nserious pieces. . .topping the list is\nBat\u2019s newest masterwork for Classical Guitar \u201cMathematics,\u201d a spellbinding\nlabyrinth of Musical corridors. The main thrust of this work is impressionism,\nand each piece is crafted to evoke images through sound- hence the title.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe songs\nthemselves range in style from one to another. Bat uses his knack for versatility\ngenerously, covering ground from Big Band Jazz to Country, Doo Wop to Rock. He\ndoes not like to have two songs of a similar style on the same CD, and is\nalways searching for a melody better than the one before it. The lyrics are\nintelligent and sometimes silly, but always poetic \u0026amp; thoughtful. The guitar\narrangements while obviously very difficult to compose and perform flow\nbeautifully from his fingers and paint a rich atmosphere of sound and\nimpression.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amazing Guitar,\nIncredible Voice, Absolutely Delightful Music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWARNING: THERE ARE \u003cu\u003eNO\u003c/u\u003e EXPLICIT LYRICS IN THIS MUSIC.",

It may not seem like much but I have begun making bracelets out of my guitar strings after they have been broken or replaced. Typically a guitar string will survive 12 hours of Bat aggression. Many don\u0027t survive- if you\u0027ve seen me, you know this to be not only true, but common. I will be thrilled to make one of these VERY COOL bracelets for you. They sell out at the shows, and are becoming very hard to get.\u003cbr\u003e",
