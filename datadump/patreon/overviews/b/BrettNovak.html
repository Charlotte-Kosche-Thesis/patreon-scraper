Filming, VFX, sound, color, everything. On top of that, the often months of raising funds for a trip, the weeks of shooting and the month or two it takes to edit one of these pieces has made consistent content quite the challenge. The new weekly \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbbTR2wVh7rFN6XDpwaedwPQHuavp8b0o\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eShortSided series\u003c/a\u003e, while still very much my style, has allowed me to shoot in faster, local situations and thus be able to bring content to you on a weekly basis.\u00a0 This has lit a fire under me wanting to push my channel further and further.\u00a0 More content, more often, without a lowering of my production standards.\u00a0 This Patreon is an experiment in pushing myself forward in an effort to bring you more of what goes on in my head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNot everybody can afford to help support me\u003c/strong\u003e, but I don\u0027t want those same people to miss out on something that may inspire them.\u00a0 Your pledge would not only be incredibly appreciated by me, but the young kids that, like myself, had the opportunity to make a connection with a piece of wood that would ultimately change their life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration, even if you\u0027re just clickin\u0027 through.\u003cbr\u003e-Brett-\u003cbr\u003e"
