My passion for this field began in my sophomore year of high school, where the absence of Black history propelled me into a journey of self-exploration, spirituality, and a life of leadership and activism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Caribbean immigrant, living in the United States while surviving with a severe disability \u00a0and pursuing a passion for social justice, I have a unique perspective and a powerful voice. The underlying impetus driving my commitment is a feeling of duty towards my community(ies).\u003cbr\u003eAs an intellectual and spiritual activist, I am finding freedom for myself and other intersectionally marginalized peoples by utilizing tools of resistance (self love, writing as activism, and artistic expression) to foster self-development, growth, and healing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBusy melding disparate scholarly frameworks, cultural expressions, and spiritual doctrines submerged in an unmistakable Blackness, my hope is to construct a means for us to learn our history and utilize this knowledge to empower ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy theoretical perspective is framed by the field of Black Studies. In addition to a thorough understanding of intersectionality and the interrelated nature of all oppression underlies our experience. Below you can read about some of my perspectives that I will share with patrons. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch1\u003e#blackstudiesbae:\u003c/h1\u003e\nBringing a unique perspective to discussions about race, intersectionality, and oppression that relies on connectivity. A socio-historical lens puts the spotlight on imperialism, colonialism, and the plantocracy in any analysis of contemporary inequities. There is also love, beauty, and honor inherent in the Black experience which frames how I tell the stories of our plight and our triumphs. \u003cbr\u003e\nCritical analysis of contemporary expressions of Black culture. From music to movies and cultural icons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
