    "summary": "Thank you for seeking me out here. I feel like I\u2019ve been cast into a whirlwind, and that makes it very difficult to know how to bring important material to the public. That said, the chorus of voices asking me to do that, over email and social media, has been completely overwhelming. Thank you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBecause that call has been so clear and nearly universal, I feel compelled, though the dust is far from settled at Evergreen, to move forward on this platform, despite the fact that it\u2019s bound to be a little rough at first. I will be posting videos on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi5N_uAqApEUIlg32QzkPlg\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e, and writing on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@bret.weinstein\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMedium\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s what you can expect:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe Evergreen story is the tip of a very large and important iceberg. I am quickly going to move off of the details of Evergreen\u2019s absurd descent into madness, and shift to discussing the larger implications for academic institutions, and the breakdown in discourse across civilization that it mirrors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMany are also telling me that you want to hear deep, evolutionary analysis. My wife and I have been hearing from students for 15 years that this material must be brought into public view, because it is transformative. I don\u2019t believe in fate, but I am a huge fan of serendipity. If you want to know why living things, including humans, are structured as they are and behave the way that they do: Stay tuned. The story is a surprising one, and many Evergreen students have found it revolutionizing of their world view. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s my \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjNRtrZjkfE\"\u003eTEDx talk\u003c/a\u003e on the personal responsibility vortex and you can visit my website here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://bretweinstein.net\"\u003ehttps://bretweinstein.net\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere we go.\u003cbr\u003e"
