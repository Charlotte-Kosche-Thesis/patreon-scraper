I\u0027m running this Patreon to fund my sci-fi webcomic Heliosphere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHeliosphere is a story about a young inventor named Maya who gets trapped in the future. She meets an underground organization called uplift that is trying to overthrow the ruling elite.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b51aaa13809653f87e6dc092fbfd2f5/tumblr_oau1fkcg1v1qlkrqbo1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I really like conceptual sci-fi and surrealism so this story will contain a lot of elements of both.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will get access to a lot of work-in-progress pictures and pages that give a more in-depth explanation of the world. There will also be interesting side stories that expand on the world and feature guest artists. Patrons will also get all of the pdfs of the comic that I would otherwise be selling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rrkaT0XqT9Q/VYw9zBkJQMI/AAAAAAAAMm8/0UxCIeFuTzk/s1600/3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe project is called Heliosphere because it takes place entirely within\n our solar system. At the time that the story takes place, the \ntechnology exists to colonize other planets but interstellar travel has \nnot yet been accomplished. I think of the project as bio-punk because a \nlot of the technology in the story is a result of genetic engineering \nrather than traditional electronics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bYdf2iB6arM/VYw_Px5ZUII/AAAAAAAAMnU/ePqXz1IhjKg/s1600/2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to update Heliosphere a lot more frequently!
