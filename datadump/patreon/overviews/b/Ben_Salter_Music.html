My first album \u003cem\u003eThe Cat\u003c/em\u003e came out in 2011..

Last year I played over 150 shows. People say it is to my detriment, as far as my reputation is concerned. I am too available they say. Over exposed. I\u0027m not sure about that as it \u003cstrong\u003ebeats cleaning toilets\u003c/strong\u003e but as I get older, my priorities are changing. I\u0027m away from my new home of Tasmania and my wonderful partner an awful lot. I\u0027d like to be a little more sedentary, but the need to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7t8eoA_1jQ\"\u003epay the bills\u003c/a\u003e keeps me on the road constantly, or else doing small shows that I probably shouldn\u0027t be doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what I\u0027m hoping this Patreon will enable me to do is \u003cstrong\u003estay home a little more often\u003c/strong\u003e, set up a home studio (which I have spent 20 years avoiding) and come up with\u003cstrong\u003e songs, movies, multimedia explosions, newsletters, or combinations of all of these things\u003c/strong\u003e for you, the patrons. \u003cstrong\u003eEXCLUSIVE CONTENT\u003c/strong\u003e. Hopefully you\u0027ll sling me some dosh to stay at home rather than constantly harassing you to come to my shows. And then when you do come to the shows, it will be a little more special.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s about it. I feel a bit embarrassed going down this route but I also feel like I have something to offer and I do enjoy sharing. So maybe this is perfect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully you\u0027ll get on board!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the best\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBen Salter, TLDR\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
