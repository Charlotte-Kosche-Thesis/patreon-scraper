If not look me up online silly! \u003ca href=\"http://www.bryonykimmings.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.bryonykimmings.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an award winning, feminist, common as muck, international performance artist who has made a name for herself spreading her secrets and flashing her truths.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePast shows have seen me retracing an STI to its source, drinking for 7 days with neuroscientists and becoming a pop star invented by a 9 year old. More recently I have just directed a show at The National which is a musical about cancer. Bosh.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is what papers say about me (among other things!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Bold, Brave and very brilliant\"\u003c/em\u003e The Independent\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"One of the funniest, most charming things i\u0027ve seen in an age\u003c/em\u003e\"Time Out\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"An unabashedly wacky sweetheart with a delightful anything goes air\u003c/em\u003e\" The Times\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have decided to try patreon because it seemed like an excellent way to do two things I love... earn money and make art. No, but seriously... the idea of having patrons, super fans or just jolly good bods who like me enough to want exclusives, performances, videos and photos etc... seems great and if its a mutually beneficial, adult, non harmful relationship then its not seedy pimping right?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have cracking ideas a lot, I write a lot, I have many songs in my head desperate to get out, a vaguely weird and wonderful nomadic existence and lots of secrets to splurge. Why not come and live vicariously through me. Double Vom. Sorry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut seriously...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts been a tough year. I haven\u0027t worked as much as I hoped. And for a while I lost my art mojo and wondered if after having a baby I would ever create prolifically again (lol, but seriously, baby steal your brain!) Click here if you want more juicy details about my private life and mental health this past year, hey why not!\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thebryonykimmings.tumblr.com/post/152462036927/overshare-catch-up\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://thebryonykimmings.tumblr.com/post/152462036...\u003c/a\u003e But I would like to get back in the saddle, keep being experimental, never become part of the normal crowd... and because of that I am concentrating my non baby hours on re-learning how to be an artist again. Writing, exploring and learning new things from excellent people for a year or so. So need to make a lot of stuff. I have a couple of commissions but also want time to play. You can be a big part of that and also see inside the studio!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know my super fans have always been keen to get more, know more etc. So maybe you would like to join the club.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think we will call the crew the BK Knights. Makes most sense to me. That or the Kimbolites\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSingle mum. Art Warrior. Soothsayer and regular cunt. Join.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will let you in on my inner thoughts and give you exclusive content and tell you how I make art etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBry xxxx"
