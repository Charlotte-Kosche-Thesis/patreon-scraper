    "summary": "Since 2009, I\u00a0have been creating funny and honest written blog content about what it is like to have breast cancer, first early stage, now terminal. I\u0027ve described every test, all the surgeries and illnesses and my thoughts about this disease. Over 3 million people have read my blog. I also have a Facebook page, where I post things like new cancer treatments, inspirational photos, updates on my life and host chats about things important to cancer patients.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal has been to support and help women understand what may happen to them during breast cancer treatment. \u00a0I\u0027ve been through it all: 8 chemos, 3 targeted therapies, many surgeries including mastecomy, reconstruction liver resection, even sepsis. \u00a0I have also done SBRT radiation.... and finally hit remission. \u00a0Of course, cancer came back worse than ever, spreading all though my abdomen and chest, but a new drug helped me hit remission again!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I can do it, so can you! \u00a0If my family can do it, so can yours. With my blog, I can help you stay positive and find the funny side of cancer. \u00a0And yes, terminal cancer is funny. (Just not always for very long.) \u00a0it is also sad and terrifying and frustrating. But, I believe it is better to enjoy life while you have it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy now, I\u0027ve written enough words for four books, literally. I have written to hundreds of scared women. It will always be free, and I will continue to write until I die. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI haven\u0027t worked in years. I have tried things to make money, such as crafting, but my health is too precarious to be consistent. In the past few years, insurance costs have gone up, the cost of living has gone up, my youngest is in college, my husband retired and our income has lowered. We are not starving or on food stamps, but are starting to feel a pinch. \u00a0So while I have received wonderful emotional support over the years, I\u0027m now asking for financial support too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI felt bad bad about this until Somebody told me-my blog is essentionally a comprehensive and free book, one that I keep adding to. So if people want to pay for it as if it were a book, they can. And if they don\u0027t want to, that is fine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I get any patrons, will use the money to keep my blog ad-free. No ads in between posts, no ads so intrusive that you can\u0027t find out where to even click to the next page. \u00a0Smaller goals include paying for increased insurance and medical costs, giving me some fun money so I don\u0027t have to worry, and larger goals include a blog redesign, and new computer as mine us old. I also want money to boost Facebook posts so people can see them. I also hope to recover lost data off a dead iPhone, which is incredibly expensive!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you you so much for having read my blog and Facebook page over the years. I\u0027m so grateful for all of you.\u00a0"

Aside from it just being nice that my husband\u0027s retirement doesn\u0027t go to medical costs, I could not only redesign my blog, but look into hiring an editor so I could turn my blog into a book. Many have asked for that, and an editor is what I would need to fix the grammar and form it into a book.",
