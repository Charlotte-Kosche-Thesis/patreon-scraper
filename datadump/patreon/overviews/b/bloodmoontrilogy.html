Assuming it could live, what would happen if you put a werewolf on the moon?\" The answer? Well it\u0027s complicated and it involves space elevators, the reboot of the Apollo missions, vampires, and a live-streaming event on the moon gone horrifyingly wrong.\u00a0 The political landscape of Earth, but especially in the USA is thrown into tumult. The conflict between vampires and werewolves that had gone undetected for ages would then be front and center. The vampires assert that werewolves are uncontrollable beasts, and paint themselves the savior, and werewolves struggle to change that perception and show the horrors that vampires are also capable of.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this Patreon is twofold. I\u0027m creating short fiction that world builds towards the first book and expand and combine hard science fiction with fantasy. It\u0027s also a vehicle to kickstart my dream. I\u0027ve wanted to be a writer since I was 12. I used to daydream about going on talk shows and being interviewed for a book that I had written. I never had the guts to actually pursue it until now. With your help, I want to become a full-time writer and help make 12 year old me proud.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to everyone who\u0027s currently supporting me and helping me to achieve my dreams. I am eternally grateful for the support I\u0027m receiving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers, and happy reading!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Born in Florida, and transplanted to Washington State in 1993, I now call the Pacific Northwest Home. \u00a0I\u0027ve had a passion and love for reading and writing since I was kid. \u00a0When I learned how to write my name I wrote it on the walls, piano keys, tables, dishes if a crayon could write on it, my name was on it. \u00a0As I grew, I became a voracious reader and got into science fiction/fantasy when I read The Golden Compass when I was 12, and in high school my absolute favorite class was Creative Writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an adult, I work as a massage therapist, and had some struggles with alcoholism in my twenties that stifled my writing and creativity. \u00a0I\u0027ve been 2 years sober and I have never felt more incensed to create as I am now. \u00a0It\u0027s why I chose to dive headfirst into this project and had the courage to begin to pursue my dreams of being a writer. \u00a0I\u0027m thrilled (and terrified) to finally be able to share my work with the world and continue to foster the creativity that turned a silly question into a trilogy. \u00a0Cheers!\u00a0",
