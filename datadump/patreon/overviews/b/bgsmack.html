I\u0027m Ryan Vollmer and I run BGsmack.com!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU\u003c/strong\u003e to everyone who supports us and our future supporters! We have a wonderful community and it really makes me feel appreciated for the work I do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLove Board Game Deals?\u003c/strong\u003e Well, every day I scour the web to find the best ones and then post them to our website, facebook group, and twitter. Our facebook group in particular is a wonderful board game community that I am very passionate about. I love the fact that I am able to put great board games into the hands of the people who love them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, \u003cstrong\u003ethis takes a lot of time and energy\u003c/strong\u003e. Everyday averages around two to three hours of work; on a day there are a lot of sales (like Black Friday) the number of hours can easily triple.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where \u003cstrong\u003eI need your help\u003c/strong\u003e. By becoming a Patreon and subscribing to a monthly pledge, you help contribute to the continuation of these deals. You help me devote more time to focusing on helping people with the hobby we all love: board games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much should you pledge?\u003c/strong\u003e Well, that is up to you. My thought is, if you feel I help you save $50 a month on games, you might pledge $10 a month. More or less is really up to you. Either way, know that even $1 is extremely appreciated and that it helps keep these groups and posts running.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the bottom of my heart, \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU\u003c/strong\u003e - Ryan Vollmer\u003cbr\u003e"
