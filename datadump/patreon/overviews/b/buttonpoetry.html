We are so excited to be here, and excited to have you here too. Check out what it\u0027s all about below!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe story so far:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eButton Poetry is an artist-run organization founded in 2011 with the goal of broadening the reach of contemporary poetry, and particularly of performance/slam poetry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs poets ourselves, we were constantly witnessing live shows where folks who had never seen poetry before are blown away. And we thought: If a hundred random people can see these performances and fall in love, what if we could show them to a thousand? To ten thousand? To a million?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve just recently posted more than 1,500 videos. Our videos have been viewed over 175,000,000 times by people in over 150 different countries. We hear from people all the time about the first poem they ever watched, or the first time they heard or read their favorite poem. We hear from teachers who share Button poems in their classrooms, and how it helps their students finally feel comfortable sharing their own voices. We want to keep making those moments possible, for as many people as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning an arts business is always challenging. When Button was launched, it was a passion project funded with YouTube revenue. But with internet advertising becoming increasingly unreliable and inconsistent, we\u2019re looking for a more stable, ongoing income so that we can not only continue to broadcast the poems you know and love, but expand the work we do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we\u2019ll use the money for:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePriorities:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdequately compensating staff\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePaying artists better\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGreater accessibility\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBringing Button shows to you\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, we want to make sure we can adequately pay our staff and our artists so that we can keep putting this content out into the world. Beyond that, as our milestone goals show, we\u2019re looking to dramatically increase the accessibility of our content so it can reach more folks who need it. In addition to English captioning on all videos, some of our dreams include adding multilingual captions, having an ASL interpreter at every Button Poetry Live show, creating better print resources for students and teachers, developing an app for writers and viewers, an RV tour to bring Button directly to you in cities around the country, and more! We\u2019re open to suggestions of what you\u2019d like to see from us as well; see below for details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe understand that not all our fans can afford to support us monetarily.\u00a0If you like what we\u2019re doing, but can\u2019t afford to help directly, please take a few minutes and share this on social media so we can gather support and keep going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour involvement:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the rewards for each tier, all our Patrons (our Buttoneers as we like to call you all, because we are cheesy sometimes) will have the option of being part of our community advisory board, which we\u2019ll use to get feedback on potential projects and more\u2014cities to bring a Button tour to, for example? :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of the day, Button is about you. It\u0027s about bringing this art to you, and it wouldn\u0027t exist without you, so\u00a0we want to know what you\u2019re thinking and what we can do to make Button a better resource. (Note: if you simply want to support us and don\u2019t want to be more involved, that\u2019s fine too, and we appreciate you!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuestions? Difficulties with the page?
