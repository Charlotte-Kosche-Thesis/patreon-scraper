I\u0027ve got an addiction to roleplay (both live action and tabletop), celtic music, folklore, mythology and anything fantasy actually.\u003cbr\u003ePleased to meet you if you\u0027re new, happy to see you here too if you\u0027re a hardcore follower of mine! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FotomaniaPhoto/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/2hquedt.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Scarys\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/epqfj4.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave you ever had a love so strong it keeps you up at night, gives you a costant warm feeling in your chest and a bright light in your eyes? That is art for me.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a model for years, but I also like creating any kind of stuff, especially costumes. I love to act and I\u0027m a dancer. \u003cbr\u003eCosplay puts everything together. I can \"live\" as a character for a couple of hours, I can pose, move or speak as she would, and even before that I can spend a happy time entwined between fabrics, paint and scissor working on an exciting new creation.\u003cbr\u003eOf course, this whole wonderful hobby costs money. My job barely covers my livings (rent and bills are bad bitches), so doing what I love, creating new costumes, gives me worries and stress along with the wonderful feeling of making art, tainting it. I must count every cents and often feel guilty when I spend \"too much\", so my costumes are always half of what I would like to do if I had enough time and money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I can dedicate myself to what I love to do with less worries, creating more and better stuff: intricated gowns, armours, big ass props, and also new smashing photoshoots in awesome locations for your viewing pleasure\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I will return your endless love and support by posting always-new and fresh contents, and putting more than ever my heart in my art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ILMATTIALUNARDI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/2eykhoh.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/flx0z7.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLet me make something clear, you don\u0027t have to pledge me on Patreon to show me your support and love. I won\u0027t stop posting cool stuff on my other social media.\u003cbr\u003eStill, if you decide to be this awesome, here\u0027s some of the perks you\u0027ll get by becoming my patron:\u003cbr\u003e-You\u0027ll support a creative crazyhead as me follow my dream, keeping me excited and motivated to create new stuff!\u003cbr\u003e-You\u0027ll get exclusive content, for your heart\u0027s joy only! Do you like pretty costumes and cosplay pictures? You\u0027ll get them, as long as blogs on convention, construction tips and crafty stuff. Do you like boobies? I have a NSFW tier for you too! As well as prints, videos, backstage shots, exclusive previews and a ton of sillyness. I\u0027ll do my best to keep all my patrons happy and satisfied. Feel free to suggest me what you would like to see, possible rewards and ways to keep this platform interesting and exciting.\u003cbr\u003e-You\u0027ll help me make even more photoshoots\u00a0even bigger and awesome costumes, attend events and reach more and more people like you who could have their day even a little bit enlighted by my art!\u003cbr\u003e-You can help me purchase craft materials and tools, higher quality fabrics, try new techniques, get studio lights for my shootings and generally make my creative life a bit easier!\u003cbr\u003e-Good Karma, yay!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GothicNarcissusPhotography\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/hrdb88.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThanks for sticking with me so far with your endless love and support, and enjoy your stay!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i67.tinypic.com/2j3sdpx.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
