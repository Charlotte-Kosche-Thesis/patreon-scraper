     "about": "Hello everyone!!! My name is Chris Langan. I am a professional Drummer \u0026amp; Instructor from Northeastern Pennsylvania. I have been playing the drums coming up on 32 years!! This instrument is my entire life! When I\u0027m not playing in one of the many bands I\u0027m in, or recording drum tracks for artists, I am teaching students of all ages. With any extra time I have, I film Drum Lessons, Drum Covers, How To\u0027s, Gear Reviews, and much more for my Youtube Channel!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTeaching the Drums on Youtube is a wonderful way for me to interact with people all over the world. It also serves as a great supplement to the students I already teach privately. In addition to teaching, I also film drum covers, gear reviews, song tutorials, and just about anything drum related!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe one drawback to Youtube Drum Lessons, is that I spend twice as much time on a lesson as I would if I was teaching it in person. The filming, editing, uploading, etc.. take up quite a bit of time. The real kicker is....Nobody has to pay for it! This limits what I can do on Youtube, because let\u0027s be honest...Why would anyone pay for private drum lessons, if they could just open up their phone, and watch it for free?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith your support, I would be able to invest in better cameras, better editing software, better recording equipment, a better studio, and any equipment I would need to offer the best quality online drum lessons on the internet!!!!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough becoming a Patron, you will have access to every single lesson I teach, plus all of the free content on Youtube!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome of the rewards include:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBehind The Scenes Footage of the making of Drum Lessons\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMonthly Student Reviews of YOUR drumming, to help you advance in your playing\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMonthly Live Lesson for Patrons ONLY!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to Unreleased Material from one of the many bands I play with.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eVote on what Lessons, Covers, Reviews, Etc..
