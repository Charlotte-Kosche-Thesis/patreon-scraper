I\u0027m a lover of pugs, cute things, rock/metal music, anime, games, and food.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Your Support Matters:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will help me be able to invest my time into developing my skills as an artist, afford college classes to improve myself both artistically and intellectually, and frequently post more of my work for you to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Much Can/Should You Pledge?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere are currently no rewards for pledging a specific amount, or donating more than someone else. It is required to at least pledge $1 to gain access to my Patreon, but you can pledge as much as you would like, one dollar, two dollars, even a million dollars if you would like! (That would be super freaking awesome)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do I Get For Pledging?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor pledging any amount you gain access to my Patreon, which will include source files for all of my artwork, except for commissions that clients did not want posted. I\u0027m not the biggest fan of exclusively paid content, so currently there is no exclusive content. In the future I plan to include speed paints, and tutorials, as well as other widely requested rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Can I do With Source Files?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything you want as long as you\u0027re not selling them! Download them and use them as bases, enjoy them as you like, redraw, trace, or edit them, or color them. Artwork that I have posted with source files for patrons may be used in any way you would like, unless it is specified under the description. I would highly recommend that anyone that does use my art to please edit them enough to where they do not look like blatant copies. I would hate for any patrons to be accused of stealing artwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to be able to make enough money from pledges to cover my cost of living. Once this goal is attained I will be able to dedicate all of my time pumping out more artwork, commissions, tutorials, speed paints, and do things to better myself as an artist. The closer I get to this goal, I will also be able to work on setting up a better reward system to show my appreciation to all of my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much to all of the patrons who help support my artwork!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
