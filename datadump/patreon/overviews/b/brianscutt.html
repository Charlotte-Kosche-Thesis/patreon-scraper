I am inviting you to become part of my world and take part in the creative process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me be honest: being an indie author is a horror story itself, trying to do it full-time with a family and limited resources = nightmare! The cost of editing is the biggest hurdle, and I want to make bloodcurdling work that shines, so editing is a must. I also want to put out a product that not only excites me, but also you as the reader. That\u0027s where you come in: become part of my team. Let me know what you want to read and help me craft something that makes your skin crawl!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeriously, thank you for stopping by and taking the time to check this out. If it wasn\u0027t for fans and readers, I wouldn\u0027t be able to do this at all!\u003cbr\u003e"
