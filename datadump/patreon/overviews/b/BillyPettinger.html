    "summary": "Hi!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Billy. I\u0027ve been writing songs and sharing stories for as long as I can remember. Above anything else, though, I am a learner. I love learning and I\u0027m passionate about all the different ways that people learn, and sharing what I\u0027ve come across. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether it be how to play \"cheater chords\" on the guitar, how to amp up your creative output or how to write and register over 200 original songs and then get them on television shows, it\u0027s likely there is something that we can learn from one another. I\u0027m definitely not the best songwriter in the world (or the best guitar player, or singer, or painter etc etc etc) but I have been lucky enough to meet some people who I really looked up to, and who shared some great information with me. I would love to share what I have learned...with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my heart there are several avenues that I\u0027d like to focus on through Patreon. The first being \u003cstrong\u003ehow to get us all to be more creative people\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027d like to let you in on \u003cstrong\u003emy day-to-day process\u003c/strong\u003e, and show you how I\u0027ve managed to released 18 musical releases in the last 16 years years. This would be good for not only songwriters but writers of all types...even if you\u0027re in school and working hard on essays. I\u0027d also like to show you \u003cstrong\u003ewhat projects of my own I\u0027m working on\u003c/strong\u003e. That means clips from the studio, works in progress and advance views of new songs. As some of you may already know, at times in my life I have been known to paint, and I\u0027ll be posting \u003cstrong\u003eprogress on paintings\u003c/strong\u003e as I paint them and giving my supporters the first chance to buy originals and prints.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a casual fan and you\u0027d like to keep up to date in ways similar to past Pledgemusic and Pre-Order Campaigns, then you are a \u003cstrong\u003eLevel One: The Fan\u003c/strong\u003e. If you\u0027d like to level up, that must mean that you are a\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eLevel 2: Super Fan\u003c/strong\u003e Patron, who wants all that and more...including but not limited to: behind the scenes and making-of videos plus the whole new album as it is created, one song at a time. Last but certainly not least, we have our Seekers. \u003cstrong\u003eLevel 3: The Revolution \u003c/strong\u003epatrons\u00a0\u00a0want to know my favourite chords and how to play them, how to amp up their creative output, plus voice, guitar, piano and voice lessons...cause why not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you for supporting me through it all, and ending up here today, right now. Most of all I am looking forward to what we can all endeavor to create, and sharing it all in a way that I\u0027ve never been able to do before!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love,\u003cbr\u003eMiss Billy"
