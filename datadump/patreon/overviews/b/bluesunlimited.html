    "summary": "Hello Friends,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs many of you know, we\u2019ve been producing episodes of Blues Unlimited for more than seven years now, and during that time -- even in the best of times -- it has been an \u201ciffy\u201d financial proposition at best. In the past, in order to keep the lights on, our website hosting fees paid up, and new episodes in the pipeline, we\u2019ve had to resort to fundraisers, just to keep things moving forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuite frankly, there have been times when we thought about just hanging it up and calling it a day. But every time we did, there was always an encouraging note from a fan... someone who told us how much they loved this program. Someone who reminded us of how important this is to them -- like the fan who once told us, \u201cdon\u2019t ever even think about stopping.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, we\u2019ve kept on. But keeping on keeping on requires time and money. Time we have. Money, quite frankly, is in short supply. That\u2019s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor our long term fans, we hope it goes without saying that we do this for the love of it. But, to paraphrase an old saying, if love paid the bills, we wouldn\u2019t be here right now, asking for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we do is guided by one basic premise -- one that was central to the pioneering visionaries Mike Leadbitter and Simon Napier, who founded \u003cem\u003eBlues Unlimited\u003c/em\u003e magazine back in 1963 -- from which our program derives its name, and who we attempt to pay homage to in each and every episode we produce. And what is that founding, guiding principle, exactly? That there is no such thing as a blues artist who is unimportant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo every week, when you tune in to Blues Unlimited, it\u2019s our way of telling the story of the blues, one chapter at a time. By sharing with you the stories and the music of the men and women who lived that life and made that music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTime and again, people tell us there\u2019s no blues show that compares to what we\u2019re doing. And each week, we delight in getting to share with you our passion and our love for this genuine and uniquely American art form. And with your support, we\u2019ll get to keep doing that for the foreseeable future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we often like to remind our listeners, none of this is possible without you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith undying thanks,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSleepy Boy Hawkins."
