    "summary": "Hey there, I go by Blondeguygamer (or Blondy for short). You\ncan imagine how long the creative process took to come up with that name, but I have put more thought into what I do online, which is mostly in-depth reviews of video\ngames that aim to inform and entertain. For several\nyears, I\u0027ve been covering games from various platforms and\ngenres and as time went on, I turned my focus onto showcasing more lesser\nplayed spinoffs, sequels, or whatever I feel is unique. As of now, my videos mainly\nfall onto these categories:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBlack Sheep Game Reviews:\u003c/strong\u003e These cover games that stand out\ncompared to the rest of a series or are simply just different from usual games.\nThey also come in \"little\" variations that are around 5-10 minutes\nlong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThey Made a Sequel?:\u003c/strong\u003e Reviews going over lesser known follow\nups of games. AKA, ones that may make people go \"They Made a Sequel?\" when brought up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNorth American Tales of Retrospective:\u003c/strong\u003e A retrospective\nreview series covering Namco\u0027s Tales of series (Tales of Symphonia, Phantasia,\netc.) that were released in the North American region and in the order\nof when they released.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKick Back: \u003c/strong\u003eShort reviews covering games that were funded through Kickstarter and other crowd funded sources. (These won\u0027t be charged as full reviews on Patreon since they are the most simple of them)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my Youtube, I also contribute these shows to \u003ca href=\"http://rivercitygamers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRiverCityGamers\u003c/a\u003e on a fairly consistent basis. While I enjoy making these, I\u0027d be lying if I said they weren\u0027t taxing. I\u0027m essentially a one-man team doing all the footage capturing, scripting, filming, and editing, which is why I\u0027ve decided to join Patreon to help ease the process with proceeds going towards improving video output and quality. Any Patrons that wish to contribute will be rewarded with early access (even earlier than RiverCityGamers), exclusive streams, and the ability to decide what games will be reviewed next. But keep in mind, this is all voluntary and all videos will still be free to the public regardless. In the meantime, if you would like to give a little boost towards my productions, I assure you won\u0027t regret it.\u003cbr\u003e"
