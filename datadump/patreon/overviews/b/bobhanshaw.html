I was born and raised here, but only got to know the music scene as an adult. I\u0027ve realized that it\u0027s worth documenting as much as any scene in any city, and more so than most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy plan is to write one in-depth profile, accompanied by photographs taken by the fantastic Niccole Radhe, every week for a year. Enormous changes will take place even in that span; the scene will be very different between the beginning and the end of this project. But it\u2019s the best I can do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy interviews are with some of the people who drive Tucson music: people who are the most visible, the most ambitious, the most knowledgeable, the most representative of our town. I aim to cover a broad spectrum:\u00a0from rock to folk to metal to hiphop to DIY/punk. We have active communities in all those genres, and I aim to cover them all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often do you update \u003cem\u003eTucson Portraits\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery Tuesday, a new Tucson Portrait will be posted. It is possible that I might do a special article in addition to the regularly scheduled ones, but that will be rare.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often am I charged?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have set it up so that you will be charged at the end of every month. Patreon keeps track of the content I post. So, in months with four Tuesdays, you will be charged for four times the amount you pledged per article, and months with five Tuesdays will charge you for five times that amount.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also set a cap on the amount you will be charged each month, so even if I post fifty times in one month (not gonna happen), you\u0027ll stay within your budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoes YabYum get a cut? Does Niccole?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI asked them, and they both declined. If I get in a position to insist, though, I plan on doing so.\u003cbr\u003e"
