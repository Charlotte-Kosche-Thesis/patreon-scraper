We\u0027re now at 73 regular subscribers\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNEW TIER AND REWARDS ADDED!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0And remember once we hit that 200 patreon subscriber mark we\u0027re gonna roast the truly awful episode 1 of Dumb White Guy, back when it was The Brendon Burns Show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere for just $5US+ A MONTH!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get \u003cbr\u003e1) Exclusive content. Weird shit never to be released anywhere.\u003cbr\u003e2) Full remastered bootleg sets: Sometimes I go to a place just after something has occurred ie: Manchester after the MEN Arena reopening after the bombing and stuff just flows out of me in front of that crowd. It\u0027s unrefined stuff in its infancy. Or there\u0027s similar sets that kill one night wind up in an argument the next.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e3) Old Albums\u003cbr\u003e4) Old specials\u003cbr\u003e5) Old lost episodes\u003cbr\u003eBut best of all:\u003cbr\u003e6) You ask everyone gets. This is a great place to support the podcast, tell me what you want and generally be part of the show. Essentially, one of you asks and you all receive. Just\u00a0 scroll through the posts and I\u0027ll get stuff to you whenever. If I get slack just give me a kick up the arse and I\u0027ll post it sharpish. There\u0027s no tiers so if you only can afford 2 quid a month then fine. If you\u0027re willing to pay more for all the stuff we do between here and youtube by all means have at it. If you\u0027re a millionaire and I\u0027m your fave comic (how the hell did you find the time to become a millionaire and find my online stuff?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$3US a month gets you some of the above but not all and you can\u0027t make requests so you\u0027re at the mercy of the 5 dollar bunch\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$10US+ a month All of the above, plus once a month BB will do something personalised for you. Want a pic signed (doesn\u0027t include P +P)? A birthday message for a friend, an answering machine outgoing message that says \"you\u0027ve reached___ this is Brendon Burns they wanted me to say____\" or y\u0027know, whatever. A skype call wishing you your cancer gets better? (Does not include cure for cancer or any other pre-existing conditions) For just 10 bucks a month you can reach out and make BB your bitch! Hurray! (Disclaimer: BB will not be your actual bitch. He\u0027ll just reach out to brighten up your or someone you know\u0027s day) Once a month, just DM him via your patron account and he\u0027ll get right on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$20 US+\u00a0 All of the above + BB will give you his xbox one gamertag and we can play GTA or COD zombies or if you really really have a game that you want to hear a 47 year old man struggle to learn and you\u0027re willing to gift it. Sure, he\u0027ll have a go.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027m the host of the Dumb White Guy podcast. for the most part, I travel the world and interview comics of different ethnicity, sexuality and gender and ask them dumb white guy questions. And I try, wherever and whenever possible, to broadcast stand up sets where I\u0027m the ethnic minority in the room. As the show has progressed I\u0027ve changed. It\u0027s a big commitment but if you listen from the start you kinda change with me too. I never meant for it to be like this. If I did, it probably wouldn\u0027t have worked. But no real change comes about by thinking you know best and only you alone can fix things.",
