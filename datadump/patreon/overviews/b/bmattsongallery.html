    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Britani, I\u0027ve been photographing the world since I was 13 (11 years and counting!). But for the past six years, I have tried to do work that doesn\u0027t resonate with me by forcing my way into the world of weddings and portraits. Honestly, I haven\u0027t loved it all. In fact, I was starting to doubt my talents and\u00a0love for photography. I needed to find my way back to the passion that pulled me to photography in the beginning.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in 2011, I traveled to Africa and captured what I consider to be my best work. Like seriously, phenomenal. Every day after that experience I\u0027ve thought, \"Did I hit my peak? Was that my best and now I\u0027m done?\" It was heart-wrenching. Then, it clicked: of course my forced work wasn\u0027t as good, I wasn\u0027t in the same realm. What was I thinking? Staged portraits and weddings cannot compare to the authenticity captured in the real world. So, I set out to do what I love: photojournalistic street photography. It\u0027s what\u0027s in me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what\u0027s my plan? Leave the world of staged/portrait photography and dive in to the work I love. I will: travel, submit my work to be published, have gallery showings of what I\u0027ve done, put my work up for purchase, develop and print it myself, teach others, upgrade my equipment (I mean, who doesn\u0027t want a Leica?!), and travel - oh, did I already mention that? I will improve and sustain myself from the photographs I create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your monthly help I\u0027m going to: purchase film to shoot more; pay to have my film developed, printed and framed; purchase the items needed to develop and print my own film (enlarger, developing chemicals, printing paper, etc.); purchase film cameras; create a logo; update my website; take courses and go to workshops; and, of course, travel. These ventures all\u00a0mean more content for you cute folks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut how will I make this shift to make my career a true passion project? That\u0027s where you come in. If you help me turn this fire for capturing the authentic world into my full-time career, I\u0027ll show my thanks to you through the benefits of some really cool shit: viewing of all my work, printed pictures, framed pictures, limited edition and self-printed prints, \u0027how-to\u0027s, behind the scenes info like settings and film used, Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s, requests from you (like where to travel, what events to go to), and more as these opportunities grow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for supporting me on this journey to represent the beautiful world we see every day on film.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
