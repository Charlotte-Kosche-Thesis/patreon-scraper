    "summary": "Hi. Hello and stuff!\nYou\u0027ve wandered in and found me-take a look around and stay awhile!\nI\u0027m always up to something, namely: portraits and the\nPost It Note Gallery. I\u0027ve been doing some versions of these things\nfor all the years I can remember and probably in all the years I\u0027ve\nbeen alive. But I also art in all sorts of other ways! Sometimes with photography, often with jewelry, more and more zines! You never know, I try and follow wherever my creative process takes me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I want you to\nsee it! I want you to interact with me and become a part of my\nprocess. Too much art stays hidden, trapped in sketch books and\nclosed studio walls. Lets party on the internet! And, if you like it,\nbecome a patron! It\u0027s easy and it\u0027s fun! It lets me continue to art\nand eat and drink coffee and hum without the crippling fear of\nstarvation and homelessness! These are good, good things and good\nthings lead to more art, which leads to more sharing! Group hugs and\nstuff. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo a little about my\nprocess starting with portraits: \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do portraits in\ntwo different ways~blind contour drawings, which are exactly what\nthey sound like, I look at the source material and not the paper till\nthe initial sketch is done. From there I clean it up and get all\nobsessed with the line work and pile on the color. Mixed media. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe second way I do\nportraits is when I want them to look like the actual person. I look\nat the paper, but I also try and keep the blind contour feel. And,\nyou know, sometimes I draw them with my left hand despite my\nrighty-ness. But always the obsessive line work. It\u0027s kinda the\nthing. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Post It Note\nGallery: \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always love a good\ndoodle! It\u0027s one part doodle, one part journal. Sometimes it\u0027s free\nassociation gone wild! A lot of my current favorites came from my\nseries \u201cSurviving a Call Centre\u201d. The call centre job is done and\ndusted-hopefully never to return-but the Post It Note Gallery will\nnever die! \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo help me out. Help\nme make art and bring it to the masses. I figured out some stuff and\nthings to make it worth your while! Let me know if\u0027n there\u0027s\nsomething you\u0027d like to see or if you have a question or a picture of\na kitten-anything! I\u0027d love to hear from you! \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU SO MUCH!\nYou are all so appreciated. \n\u003cbr\u003e"
