This place is for those of you who want to help support what I\u2019m doing in ways that allow me to continue to support what you\u2019re doing: taking care of yourself in your daily health, fitness, life and daily struggles or maybe just put a smile on your face. :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not familiar with Patreon, the concept is that you support a creator financially for each piece of valuable content they create for you. In my case, it\u0027s videos and blogs on being vegan, recipes, fitness, fighting cancer, being a toddler Mom as well as a bereaved Mom and running my own businesses and non profit from home. Basically sharing my BIGGEST passions with you in hopes that it can inspire you to live your healthiest and BEST life. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in this concept with all my heart. It\u0027s helping creators (like you and me both!) bring more value to the world by making it financially sustainable long-term. Please consider supporting my work with a dollar (or however you much you like) with every YouTube video that I create for you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eEvery week I tend publish 3-5 YouTube videos to my Becky Bakes channel.  Each time I do so, I share 2 of my favorite YouTube videos here and mark it as a piece of content that you\u0027re supporting. The number of YouTube videos I publish every month determines how much you contribute. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, if you pledge $1 per Patreon video and that month I publish 8 videos you\u0027ll contribute $8 for that month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, you can easily set a monthly contribution limit when you\u0027re entering your payment info. That way there\u0027s no surprises at the end of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, you can pledge $5 per YouTube video I upload, get access to the rewards at that tier, but cap your monthly contribution limit to $15, thus supporting 3 videos that month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd don\u0027t worry about missing out on any content either. You will still continue to get my YouTube videos even if I publish additional YouTube videos that go beyond your maximum contribution limit for the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere does my money go?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eYour support enables me to invest into producing free YouTube videos and \u00a0for the YouTube community of creators who have a big mission behind their work online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know, it takes time and resources to create content, both which require money. Your support lets me focus on making the most valuable content for you that I possibly can instead of spending as much time focusing on the financial side of how to deliver it to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt helps me get equipment for better lighting, supplies and food to make your all those recipes and also to replace broken equipment, produce higher-quality videos, and free up some of my time to do more important things, like investing time into my husband, daughter, non profit organization and health like taking care of the hospital bills for all my expensive cancer treatments and of course RESTING! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking videos like I do and continuing to inspire through the videos I create, which is an absolute blast for me) is A HUGE passion of mine and I wish I could do it every day. BUT it doesn\u0027t pay the bills.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill you help me create this passion into an income for myself and my family? :)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
