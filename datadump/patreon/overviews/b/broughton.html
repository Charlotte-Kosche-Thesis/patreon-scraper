You\u2019d know that creating worldwide events for connection is what brings us immense joy.  You\u2019d have seen how we graciously make space for one another to shine while supporting, rooting, cheering, encouraging, triggering, pushing, and poking one another to always be the best versions of ourselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you? What brings you joy? How do you wish to show up in the world, for the world?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese questions come from a desire to know how one could impact the world. We are nourished by the answers that breathe life into our world.  We\u2019ve seen faces transform and brighten, heard deep thoughts digested through uncertain words, witnessed second guessing and complete bewilderment, and felt the sense of empowerment, liberation, freedom, confusion, despair, and questioning. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we step into this unknown area of how to be our full self, how to show up powerfully in all of our glory and be the person we deeply desire to be, so many occurrences start to unfold. Fear and doubt are culprits that rob us of these dreams. Reasons why one can absolutely not have all the things they\u2019ve ever dreamt of. Confirming answers that give justice to why it couldn\u2019t possibly work, at least not right now, and yes maybe some day. But, I, this, that, would have to change drastically. Ya, maybe another day, month, year, years. To take the step into the fire and actually be pursuing the dreams you always knew to be there\u2026now THAT takes courage. We\u2019ve seen many laugh at the question and seen many take actions in pursuit of their calling. The latter, whether it has much to do with us or not, is a gift that is living out it\u2019s greatness into the world and is shining with full passion because that person actually wishes to do this with all of their heart.  They\u0027ve made a commitment, a choice.  They have chosen the magic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell truth be told, our fears have inhibited us and we\u2019ve continuously stepped into this discomfort to pursue our dreams. It\u2019s taken everything we\u2019ve got to drive in the directions of things much bigger than ourselves.  We are committed to blending the full palate of our backgrounds, skills, and experiences to create events for people to shine, share, explore, and feel \u003cem\u003eseen\u003c/em\u003e.

Our mission is to continuously be creating connections to increase happiness and share community.  We live to support the dreamers, and in doing so, we fulfill our dreams to create a world full of life that is inspiring, passionate, and empowered.  Our bond inspires people to show up for themselves, for their relationships, and their communities.  Collecting and connecting dots to empower a creative world.  We have a knack for activating and connecting in a prolific way.    \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love getting know the \u0027why\u0027 behind what someone is up to and what inspires them to be.

We are communication ninjas that love listening, reflecting, and understanding through our curiosity and unassuming intentions.
