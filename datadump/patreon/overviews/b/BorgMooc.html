It makes learning through MOOCs easier, as it manages your downloads, downloaded videos, video playlists and notes. It also reminds you to take a break. \u003cbr\u003eBorg supports downloading and watching videos from Coursera and edX. It also supports NPTEL, MIT OCW, Khanacademy and more from Youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBorg makes studying from \u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e from online and offline video courses completely seamless, with text and voice notes tightly integrated with the videos.\u003cbr\u003eIt also has full featured download manager, for course videos and resources as studying via online streaming videos is not possible in many countries, where bandwidth is low and expensive during day time and better and cheaper bandwidth is available during night. So students can download their videos at night and study during the day, keeping themselves in good health.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSave whole courses in the library for quick access in the \u201c\u003cem\u003ecourses\u003c/em\u003e\u201d section.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nreate combined playlists, called \u201c\u003cem\u003ecollections\u003c/em\u003e\u201d \nusing videos from various online and offline sources \u2013 Local Hard disk, \nCoursera,  edX, NPTEL, MIT OCW, Khanacademy and more. Making it an excellent study/research tool.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are some more features also planned and I am working to \nincorporate them.

But after the response and \nrecommendations from my beta testers, it was decided that a\n plain downloader will not be of major help. What was needed was a \ncomplete and seamless study experience, between online and offline \nvideos + Playlist management combined, with\n a tightly integrated downloader and downloads manager, therefore all \nthese features were later incorporated.\u003cbr\u003e\nSupport for edx courses was also included. Youtube is a huge resource of\n educational videos, so support for downloading, viewing and managing playlists from youtube as courses was also added.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBorg will soon be in your hands, making studies easier. And to make this possible I need your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of time and effort has gone into making this product and I intend to keep it free for all. So that it can reach all learners, Borg will require regular maintenance and updating as the providers keep updating and modifying their structure every few months. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
