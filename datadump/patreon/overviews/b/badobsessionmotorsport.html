    "summary": "Creating one of the world\u0027s fastest Mini\u0027s takes an awful lot of time, tea, biscuits and thinking. And swearing. Lot\u0027s of swearing... Creating the car along with filming the build, producing and editing it takes an awful lot longer. Since we started this project back in June 2013, the response has been nothing short of mind-blowing. Two \u0027normal\u0027 guys from Shropshire with no video production experience whatsoever but with a penchant for creating crazy cars have garnered over 11 million views on YouTube and more than 169,000 subscribers from all over the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d like to be able to do this full time and bring episodes out every month as opposed to 3-4 months. The reality of paying the bills means this is a weekend only project at the moment and progress can be slow as we work through all the many problems associated with shoe-horning a mahoosive 2 litre turbo-charged engine and 4 wheel drive system in a 1980 Mini 1000 shell.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage means we getting close to being able to bring videos out much faster. It doesn\u0027t mean that the jokes will be any less corny, it will mean however that we\u0027re almost certain not to run out of tea. And that in itself would be a huge weight from our shoulders.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, it does mean that all Patrons get the latest episodes 24 hours before anyone else!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s absolutely no obligation. We\u0027ll continue to build Binky and bring episodes to you as often as we can but we\u0027ve got our eyes on the next project already and your patronage could make Series 2 even more special."
