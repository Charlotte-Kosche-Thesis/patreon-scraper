We intend to start off as a quarterly, and, logistics willing, accelerate from there. Think the \u003cem\u003eVillage Voice\u003c/em\u003e, plus fiction, poetry, art, and longform essays. Think \u003cem\u003eBrooklyn Rail\u003c/em\u003e, but playful and accessible. Think the \u201860s underground press meets \u003cem\u003eTin House\u003c/em\u003e. Think zines, but copy-edited. Think \u003ca href=\"http://BlunderbussMag.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBlunderbussMag.com\u003c/a\u003e, except you can use it to mop up your spilled coffee.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBut isn\u2019t print\u2014\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDead? Yeah, so we\u2019ve heard. We are well aware that print is unprofitable and expensive (as opposed to digital, which, at least, is unprofitable and cheap). Our business sense looks even shoddier when you consider that we\u2019re going to give our publication away for free.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo why do it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause we believe that literature, art, and criticism have an important role to play in the often messy, occasionally inspiring, always important dumpster fire we call the public sphere. Creative work can broaden perspectives, create empathy, and build solidarity. It can reconfigure the imagination, a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for reconfiguring society. But to fulfill its public promise, \u003cem\u003ethat work must enter the public sphere in the first place\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n In the age of filter bubbles and endless online \u201ccontent,\u201d the people who frequent a given website are almost always exactly the people you\u2019d expect. We love our readers\u2014you\u2019re our lifeblood, our contributors, our donors, our family. From you we came, and to you we shall always return. But we feel that the literary/arty/lefty space we have all carved out together should be a home base for expeditions outward, not a members-only clubhouse. Otherwise, the best we can do is passively hope that the values we hold dear will somehow percolate out into the body politic.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\tTo do more, we need to do the work of meeting people where they are, both physically\u2014subway stations, street corners, bars, coffee shops, and beyond\u2014and metaphorically\u2014in language that doesn\u2019t mistake opacity for nuance. To do more, we need to offer ourselves up at a price that\u2019s no barrier to entry\u2014for \u003cem\u003eBlunderbuss\u003c/em\u003e, that price is free.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIf it\u2019s free, will you still be paying writers and artists?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAbsolutely. Paying contributors is the moral duty of any publication. Unless we\u2019re comfortable with a publishing industry that\u2019s the exclusive domain of the already-wealthy, we have to make sure writers and artists can get compensated for their labor. And as \u003cem\u003eBlunderbuss\u003c/em\u003e grows, we anticipate that the fee we pay contributors will grow as well.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWill the print version \u003cem\u003eBlunderbuss \u003c/em\u003e publish the same kind of work as the web version? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003ePrint \u003cem\u003eBlunderbuss\u003c/em\u003e will be the same publication you\u2019ve known and loved, and more. It will run work from all of our web genres\u2014essays, fiction, poetry, art, comics, and shrapnel\u2014as well as special columns, features, and pull-outs that are particularly suited for the print form. Plus, the politics that were always in our hearts... those are going to show up on our sleeves a bit more.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAnd will you keep posting work on the website?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eYep! \u003ca href=\"http://blunderbussmag.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBlunderbussMag.com\u003c/a\u003e will continue to be updated with new online-only work, though we\u2019ll be posting a smidge less frequently in order to focus on the new project. We\u2019re still figuring out how exactly how we\u2019ll translate the print publication to the web, but it\u2019s our goal to remain accessible to as many of you as possible, whether on screen or on newsprint.\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, I\u2019m sold. Is there some way I can help?
