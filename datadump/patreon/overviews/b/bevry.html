To do that, we need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy help? We\u0027ve created over 200 open-source projects between the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/bevry\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBevry\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/docpad\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDocPad\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/browserstate\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHistory.js\u003c/a\u003e GitHub communities - together they make up some of the top 100 JavaScript projects in the world. Our main focus is our over\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/~balupton\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e180 node.js packages\u003c/a\u003e which accomplish a lot of everyday node activities,\u00a0\u00a0along with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://docpad.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDocPad\u003c/a\u003e, a powerful static site generator with around 500 daily users.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow we accomplish this? When our workload was just that of a side-project\u0027s demands, it was possible to accomplish this through the occasional consulting arrangement, however as our eco-system has grown dramatically to now supporting users, companies, and enterprises, it now demands a full-time workload in order to be maintained sustainably.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. By having yourself or your company donate to our Patreon page, we will be able to better fulfil these intense full-time demands. Not only will your donation or your companies donation make your job easier, but it will also make the lives easier for all those which our many initiatives touch - that\u0027s a win-win for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what will your donations get you? Here are some things on our roadmap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMigration from CoffeeScript to ES6+ for radical Performance improvements and increased Accessibility\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe originally switched to CoffeeScript in 2011 for the features and consistency it provided over JavaScript in that time. In 2015, JavaScript has come a long way with ES6/ES2015/ES6+ and now contains those benefits that CoffeeScript in 2011 provided, allowing us to remove the tediousness of CoffeeScript and embrace universal JavaScript once more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to your support, we recently converted\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/bevry/taskgroup\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTaskGroup\u003c/a\u003e, a foundational project of ours, and\u00a0have seen these two major a benefits of this conversion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerformance: We have accomplished a steady improvement of 13 seconds down to 3 seconds for running 10,000 tasks, which is a 75% reduction and is just 1/4 of the time it took previously - a massive improvement. We are expecting to see similar performance gains for most of our projects due to the inefficiency of CoffeeScript\u0027s compiled code compared to the source and babel compiled ES6+ code, as well as more control over performance through better profiling and minimal code conversion. As DocPad depends on a lot of our other modules, such conversions and optimisations should bring similar performance improvements to DocPad - something that took a minute, should reduce to only 15 seconds. Details on how these performance enhancements are actualised are\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discuss.bevry.me/t/move-from-coffeescript-to-es6/30\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccessibility: Moving from coffeelint to eslint, then from biscotto to jsdoc has provided better tooling for developing for providing consistent styling and error prevention as well as better tooling for documentation, which both increases accessibility to non-owners. For instance, compare our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://rawgit.com/bevry/taskgroup/v4.3.1/docs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eold documentation\u003c/a\u003e to our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://rawgit.com/bevry/taskgroup/v5.0.0/docs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enew documentation\u003c/a\u003e and you\u0027ll see the great accomplishments in API browseability and detail now possible.\u003cbr\u003eEventually we will also see greater adoption and use of our projects through the more popular tooling and language making the projects easier to contribute to and incorporate, which should lead to increased third party support and contribution to the projects furthering increasing adoption and quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll in all, we started with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/search?q=language%3Acoffeescript+user%3Abevry\u0026amp;type=Repositories\u0026amp;utf8=\u2713\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e~60 Bevry repositories\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/search?q=language%3Acoffeescript+user%3Adocpad\u0026amp;type=Repositories\u0026amp;utf8=\u2713\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e~65 DocPad repositories\u003c/a\u003e to convert from CoffeeScript to ES6+, and have still a while to go. Converting the remaining should take about 2 months to accomplish for the different Bevry projects and DocPad plugins, then a while longer for the DocPad core, documentation and eco-system to move along. This should be possible while maintaining compatibility with DocPad version 6, being only a series of incremental minor version bumps for DocPad. Work will be spread over a 6 month period.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDocPad v7\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you wish to support this item specifically;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.codefund.io/view.php?id=4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere is the crowd-funding campaign for it\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs demands for DocPad increase, technologies upgrade, and more people use it for bigger and bigger projects, it\u0027s evident that we need to keep up pace with these demands in new ways. We know what we need to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBreak the DocPad Core into Smaller Modules to Increase Maintainability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently the DocPad core, while enabling a powerful plugin eco-system, should also be modularised. Things like the server is still based on Express.js v3, whereas v5 is around the corner. Abstracting out things like the server functionality, will allow us to have a backwards compatible plugin for express3 as well as one for new versions of express and even other server software. The same applies for our watching library, and other parts of the core. By breaking apart the core, users of DocPad will be able to mix and match the right foundations for their project, while at the same time, maintainers of DocPad will be able to work with smaller modules, rather than having to learn the entire core infrastructure. A win for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbstract out the powerful DocPad Plugin System into its own Independent Plugin System.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis means taking the powerful and time-tested DocPad Plugin architecture, and abstracting it out into an independent system that can be used for any project to implement it\u0027s own plugin system easily. Existing functionality allows plugins to listen to events that can even be asynchronous which are executed safely an in prioritised order\u00a0either in parallel or serially by the mediator\u0027s choosing.\u00a0New features will include semantic versioning support for plugins, as well as automatic installation of the correct plugin version for your existing peer dependencies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMake DocPad Super Fast.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDocPad while it brings magnificent power, this power can also be a source of slow downs. In short with the worst case scenario, DocPad can spend hours rendering 10,000 documents \u2014 we hope to bring that down to less than a minute. This is due to two major paint points. The first and most common is having\u00a0a layout that is used on every page which includes a dynamic content listing? Well that requires all pages that use that layout to regenerate when a document changes to ensure the content listing on each page remains correct with the changes information \u2014 this sounds fair, but what if the content that changed isn\u0027t actually used in that content listing, well everything is still regenerated, we will fix that. The other and less common, is when you have a huge database size (either of a few 100MB+ sized documents, or thousands of smaller documents) will force DocPad to occupy a large memory footprint that must be reloaded and discarded on each shutdown and opening of DocPad. We will fix this by providing the option of using a persistent database.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll in all.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe are thankful for all donations, big or small, as they will all add up to making a difference, be it covering our bills, funding development, or expanding our mission to new initiatives.
