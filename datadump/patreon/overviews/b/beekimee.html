    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHey chump, thanks for checking out my patreon page where you can find out about all my current projects before they are released publicly. I am working on them as passion projects but they are not cheap to fund. If you like what you see, I would really appreciate your support so that I can continue working on my game. Based on the pledge amounts you will be receiving the game considerably early, participate in polls for future builds, and get sneak peaks of upcoming content. Its early in development so I\u0027ll keep things basic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current public project is \u003cstrong\u003eMilfshore: New In Town\u003c/strong\u003e. The game is inspired by Urban Demons, Summertime Saga,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eElana Champion of Lust,\u00a0KsT\u0027s The Twist,\u00a0Umichan Maiko Classroom Havoc, Myster\u0027s The Long Vacation, SIMSEH: Hornbrook, The Inseminator. That is a long broad list but if you fancy any of those games, you may be interested in my game. Their will be more projects in the near future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mega.nz/#!JmhDHCRJ!-c59ym92h5EmrHyWI-piE1EBbeMmRsY1ACG-idGarhk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE MOST CURRENT PUBLIC VERSION\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mega.nz/#!hyQUXaIB!khic0Gto4nP1M_9vliC3HvdLVRXc4s0Qq41vEnrWsD4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE HELP FILE\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMILFSHORE v0.1(NOV 30)\u003cbr\u003eIf you have trouble opening the game:\u003cbr\u003e-open the game with the browser of your choosing\u003cbr\u003e-click and drag the file into an open browser of your choosing\u003cbr\u003eOr visit this post\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Milfshore?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThe story will be laid out in the next upcoming build. At the moment, you can travel around the main characters house and have small interactions with his mom, dad, and sister. The next build will add the main character\u0027s school and will get the real gameplay going. You will take control of the player through everyday of the game and work to build relationships with the characters. The game plays as a visual novel dating sim. I think the best description based on other games would be it plays like summertime saga but with the theme of Urban Demons and relationship progression of The Twist and The Long vacation. The game wont use any mind control, mystic powers, hypnotizing artifacts to have a character have sex with the player. I don\u0027t want the same trope of the player giving a character an item and then they all of a sudden want to blow the player. It also won\u0027t be a grind fest every time the player wants to level up or get a new scene. The player will sill have to work for the scenes to get their reward. I will add cheats for those who just want to fap and get it over with in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eFetishes of the game include\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStraight Shota\u003cbr\u003eMilfs\u003cbr\u003eIncest\u003cbr\u003eMuch more to come when other characters are established\u003c/div\u003e"
