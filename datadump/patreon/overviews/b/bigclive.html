    "summary": "If you enjoy my technical videos, then this is an opportunity to show your appreciation by buying me coffee and cookies (I like cookies)\u00a0 One of the most important things about Patreon is that it gives me an independent communication channel from YouTube so that if things go wrong or I\u0027m VERY naughty and YouTube pull the plug on my channel then we can still stay in touch and you still get to see my videos on a different platform.\u003cbr\u003eSince the great Adpocalypse of 2017 the YouTube advertising algorithm has not favoured \"dangerous\" technical and scientific channels and has given priority to trendy vloggers and fashionistas.\u00a0 For the technical and scientific creators Patreon offers greater independence from YouTube, allowing us to make more interesting videos without fear of being punished.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy videos will always be available to view free.\u00a0 I\u0027ve no intention of ever putting them behind any form of pay-wall and specifically only allow YouTube to put ONE skippable or pop-up advert on my videos.\u00a0 (Because multiple adverts are just plain annoying.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll Patreons get early access to my videos as I make them, and sometimes encourage me to re-record specific videos with improvements.\u00a0 This also lets you grab particularly good gadgets on eBay before the rush if I find a particular gadget to be very good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease only contribute what you can comfortably afford, and feel free to adjust it down at any time if things get a bit tight.\u00a0 I\u0027ve been through the \"living off noodles\" era myself and know that every technical career has its ups and downs.\u00a0 No matter what you pledge you still get full access.\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to be extremely generous because I\u0027ve helped launch you into a new career or inspired you in darker times then I\u0027m fine with just a few dollars and would rather you used the cash to buy yourself some new test gear or components.\u00a0 The biggest reward you can give me is to tell me that I helped you.\u003cbr\u003e"
