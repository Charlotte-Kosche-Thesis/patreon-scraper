    "summary": "Thank you for supporting my art career here at Patreon! I am a professional fine artist and illustrator, with a great love for comics and independent publishing. One of my longest projects has been my \"Big Boss\" series. I started printing and self-publishing and distributing my first Big Boss graphic novel, while I was still in High School (that was 20 years ago). Since, I published a 130 page graphic novel titled \"Big Boss: Gun For Hire\" which can be found on Amazon and Comixology. In 2016, we premiered a live-action short film based on my comic, called \"Big Boss: Night Out.\" Now, I want to entertain my fans and audience, with a NEW DAILY comic/graphic novel strip that continues the trials and tribulations and deadly encounters of the worlds most notorious assassin: \"Big Boss!\" The new series will be released 5 days per week on Instagram and Twitter @bigbosscomic and you get bonus meetings, chats, and videos, and rare artworks here at Patreon. With your support, you are essentially helping me to afford the time to produce great work of art that will entertain you and fascinate you, and perhaps educate you. \"Big Boss\" is an original creation and I have other really cool characters and villains that will appear in his storyline. Also, as an art teacher, I will love to share art lessons and insights along the way here on Patreon. So come along for the ride! Don\u0027t wait for \"Big Boss: Assassin\" to come for you; Become a Patron TODAY!"

     "about": "I am a Romanian-born Canadian Artist living in the US. I self-published and self-distributed my first graphic novel, while still in High School.\u00a0I followed that by studying Animation in College and Creative Writing and Art History in University, both in Canada. I worked in the Animation field for a few years, with notable creators like John Kricfaluci (\"Ren and Stimpy\" fame) and then worked online as a freelance artist since 2002. I had a brick and mortar Art School in Canada, before moving to the States; now I offer classes online or locally (www.MasterpieceArtSchool.com). I worked hard to have some great fine art exhibits, mainly in Canada and the US, and I have some of my work in museums, such as the Gallery of Canada. Also, after publishing the 130 page graphic novel \"Big Boss: Gun For Hire,\" I self-produced and co-wrote a short live-action film called \"Big Boss: Night Out,\" which has had several screenings and has premiered at a New York Film Festival. On the heels of those two projects, I am continuing my Big Boss graphic novel series with a daily Instagram and Twitter comic strip (follow it at @bigbosscomic) and that brings me here to Patreon for your support!",

You are helping me ENTERTAIN YOU with my creative vision and you are helping me develop independent comic book characters that can replace the over-produced Marvel and DC Universe characters in comics and film, or at least give the comic market options for readership and viewership, with my characters that do not have storylines based on corporate objectives or demographics. I want to go back to the age of Will Eisner and Joe Kubert, where artists would do everything on a graphic novel story and it was creative, relevant, experimental, funny sometimes, educational, entertaining, and (of our time) immediate!
