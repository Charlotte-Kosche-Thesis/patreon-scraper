Once a year, during the Harvest Festival, the doors of this secret and marvelous village are thrown open for one night only, under the black of the new moon. Brave and foolhardy lads from neighboring villages seek out the strange wares of the marketplace... but beware! They must convincingly dress as women, or face the wrath of the amazonian village guards.
