But the reality is that doing something you love isn\u0027t always economical or conducive to supporting a family. The art gets pushed off to focus on jobs that pay the bills. This takes up valuable art time. That is why I am here. My passion for art is too big to be side tabled. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://bunnymaelstrom.com/img/portfolio/sp-attack-on-titan.jpg\" style=\"width: 50%;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goal, with your help, is to be able to create my art and my comics with more freedom and with more time. Ultimately, this means you get more content, better stories, more convention shows, and a warm fuzzy feeling knowing you are a big part of making that content a reality. Plus, it also means I\u0027ll be able to create more content faster. It means being able to make that content available on posters, t-shirts, postcards, and much more. Not only that, but with a comic already in place, your help will enable me to continue the story and print out new issues on a more frequently and regular basis.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://bunnymaelstrom.com/img/portfolio/freehugs.jpg\" style=\"width: 260px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://bunnymaelstrom.com/img/portfolio/doctor-carter.jpg\" style=\"width: 260px; margin-left: 10px;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo I invite you to check out my work, read my stories, if you like what you see, help me support my passion to give a little bit of humor and light back to this world. \nOh and if you don\u0027t... there might be a Karp in your future.. *shifty eyes*\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
