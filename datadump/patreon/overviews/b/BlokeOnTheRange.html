    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eBloke on the Range...\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n...is a YouTube channel started in late March 2016 with an old borrowed camera, and a burning desire to make exactly two videos: one about the mechanical and ergonomic reasons why Lee-Enfield rifles are fast, and one about various nonsense myths about the M1 Garand. Mostly for a laugh, but also to dispel a lot of the sheer, utter, credulous nonsense commonly believed on these topics. These videos were picked up by The Firearms Blog, and a small following started.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThen, in the Autumn of 2016, a couple of popular videos went mini-viral and the viewership expanded. As of 25.05.2018, we\u0027re at over 56k subscribers, and YouTube terminated us without warning but reinstated us after a very fraught 20-odd hours. So we\u0027re multiplatform now:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.full30.com/channels/BlokeOnTheRange\"\u003ehttps://www.full30.com/channels/BlokeOnTheRange\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://bitchute.com/channel/O4Kf7qlwoeFh/\"\u003ehttps://bitchute.com/channel/O4Kf7qlwoeFh/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://videos.utahgunexchange.com/@Bloke_on_the_Range\"\u003ehttps://videos.utahgunexchange.com/@Bloke_on_the_R...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny potentially non-YouTube friendly content will be posted only \"elsewhere\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWho are The Bloke and The Chap?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThese two have known each other for more than a decade, and used to work for the same employer in Holland. Neither of them are Dutch though (but do like a nice stroopwafel)... By a kind of convoluted set of circumstances, they both ended up moving to Switzerland within a couple of months of each other, and are both installed in neighbouring valleys in the Bernese alps.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Chap participates in a number of videos, and also has some of his own to his name. He\u0027s also a bit of an artiste, and his handiwork features on the official Bloke on the Range merchandise, sometimes available here: \n\u003ca href=\"https://teespring.com/stores/bloke-on-the-range-store\"\u003ehttps://teespring.com/stores/bloke-on-the-range-st...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNeither of them take themselves very seriously, and The Bloke is possibly the only gun youtuber to have appeared in his own videos in drag... More than once... Anyway...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Bloke started competitive shooting aged 13, shooting mostly British-style target rifle from 300 to 1000 yards, finishing as a junior International and touring to Canada. He expanded his horizons into all manner of things that go \"bang\", particularly anything pre-1945.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Chap started shooting at University, and is a black powder fanatic. Luckily, his missus likes the smell of fireworks, rotten eggs, 150 year old wood, and Ballistol.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSo what makes BotR unique?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFirstly, their fruity British baritones, something rather unusual in GunTube world. Apparently some find it soothing. Others find it grating. \n\u003cem\u003eChacun \u00e0 son go\u00fbt.\u003c/em\u003e Also, they\u0027re both multilingual so can address topics that are \u003cem\u003eother than English.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\nSecondly, their attention to detail in explaining the whys and wherefores of mechanics, ergonomics, history and so on in an accessible way. Plus, they have an absolute obsession with putting commonly-held beliefs about certain firearms and shooting to the test, going back to the original sources, and taking nobody\u0027s word for it.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs an example, everybody knows that the old Swiss 7.5x53.5mm ammo for the Schmidt-Rubin 1889 rifle is semismokeless, right? The Bloke was flicking through the old 1892-dated manual for the rifle, and spotted that the original German said \"smokeless\". There was only one way to find out for sure, so they went to the range and shot some original cartridges (which are fairly plentiful in Switzerland). Spoiler: it was proper smokeless.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy support BotR on Patreon?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you like our content and want to see more of it, Patreon is a way to ensure that we\u0027re in a position to keep improving the channel. Switzerland is an expensive place, and we can\u0027t just go out into the sticks and put up some targets. Some of the cheaper ranges we have access to have significant limitations on what we can do there, so we have to pay for private ranges to film certain types of video that we want to do in the future.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso, due to the way firearms licensing works, we can\u0027t just easily borrow firearms to take to make videos - the legal owner has to be present. While we exploit this as far as possible by bothering our friends, it\u0027s often easier to buy the firearms in question. Up to now, 100% of all YouTube revenues so far (after tax...) have been used in this way, or on ammo, or on travel and range hire.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nShort term, all Patreon donations will be (and have been) ploughed back into range hire, buying firearms and ammunition for use in our videos, equipment, travel, relevant books and so on. For instance, we\u0027ve been doing comparative \"Mad Minute\" videos, and have made a trip to shoot with SBAM in Italy (see their channel here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_7GHCVbjCdwWMQWueqTu2A\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_7GHCVbjCdwWMQWu...\u003c/a\u003e) and more. The rapid fire videos can cost a significant amount each to film, just in range hire and ammo costs....\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLong term, The Bloke would like to be able to take one or two days a month off from his day job to spend on this project. This would enable him to take more time over filming, editing etc. so as to improve the quality of the channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut don\u0027t worry, there is no risk of this ending up as a full-time project. Much respect to Othias, Ian and others for having made their channels their day jobs, but that is just not on the cards here. This is a nice hobby project that hopefully adds to the total sum of human firearms knowledge and gives people some pleasure.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso, as a point of principle we won\u0027t be holding back \"normal\" content for Patrons - The Bloke detests paywalls for main-channel content. But, there will be small amounts of Patreon-only content that\u0027s not suitable for the main channel - behind the scenes, early launches, outtakes, regular channel news and so on. Also, we\u0027ll try to do a regular Q\u0026amp;A for which Patrons can ask the questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA final important point is that YouTube revenues are a) not very high, and b) highly variable. It\u0027s really Patreon - i.e. you - that keeps this rickety barge afloat, and we would be enormously grateful for your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
