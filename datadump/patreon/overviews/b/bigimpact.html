If someone desperately wants to find negative, trashy, hollow, pointless drivel, the search will be a short and easy one.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe created the Big Impact Podcast to celebrate the positive thinkers, innovators, givers of wisdom and insight - some of whom are famous and some you\u0027ve never heard of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are we doing with these people?\u003c/strong\u003e Simple. Talking to them. Learning. Listening. Improving. Appreciating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Big Impact is a weekly podcast featuring\ninterviews with people of insight influence intelligence and inspiration, some\nof whom are well known and others who, though fairly anonymous, have a powerful\nand encouraging story to share. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s so special about that idea?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eThere are plenty of interview podcasts.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrue, but none like ours. As a unique feature of the Big Impact, we will\nconclude each program by asking our guest to name a charitable cause important\nto them - and then we will make a donation to that cause. We\u0027ve recorded a couple episodes in advance of our launch and that \"on-air\" request has blown away our guests. They have become accustomed to being asked for their time and wisdom without anything being offered in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur hope is that our\naudience will help grow the Big Impact impact by joining us on Patreon and sharing the team effort with others close to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine being part of a team that doesn\u0027t just sit idly by and listen, but actually invests in the causes our guests present (after they share their insight)!"
