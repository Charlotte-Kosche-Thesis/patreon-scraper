At the heart of all of my efforts is the fantasy world of Revilo that I explore when I close my eyes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI first imagined the concept of Revilo in 2009, just months before my son Wyatt was born. I envisioned a world that the two of us could build upon and escape to together. The name Revilo is taken from Wyatt\u2019s middle name Oliver spelled backwards. As Wyatt has grown he\u2019s added more and more of his ideas to our world. He has created the volcanic region known as the Fiery Pits, conceptualized the lizard-like Burnadazi creatures, sketched out a \u201cfire turtle\u201d which I then sculpted into the Chelonid, and added to the pantheon of gods. Collaborating on Revilo with Wyatt has been amazing, and I can\u2019t wait to see what his little sister Ruby dreams up as she gets older!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf my creatures and the world I am creating \u003cstrong\u003eput a smile on your face\u003c/strong\u003e, or \u003cstrong\u003espark something in your own imagination\u003c/strong\u003e, consider \u003cstrong\u003ebecoming a member of this exclusive group\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://creaturecuration.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gallery2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://monsterhunteracademy.com/patreon/whats-for-you.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe adventurous joining on this epic quest will be greatly rewarded! I truly enjoy sharing my art and want your help in determining the direction in which Revilo grows. You will see how everything is made, be able to ask questions, and influence my imagination as creatures are born. The more people who join us, the more time I will be able to spend building this world and the greater it will become. It will also allow me to experiment more with different mediums and styles. If you decide to become a Patron physical rewards will be mailed at the beginning of each month to the address you provide.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://monsterhunteracademy.com/patreon/what-patreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with Patreon, it can seem a bit odd. Think of it as a tip jar. If you like my art and enjoy what I create, then help to further my endeavors. If you love what I make and want me to keep making more, this is a great way to help me get closer to supporting myself through my art. As a thank you I will do my best to provide insights and content with you a Patron of the Arts that I don\u2019t share with anyone else.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://monsterhunteracademy.com/patreon/find-me.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://briancolin.com\"\u003ePersonal Website\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/briancolin/\"\u003eInstagram\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thebriancolin/\"\u003eFacebook\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitch.tv/thebriancolin\"\u003eTwitch\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/theBrianColin\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTwitter\n\u003c/a\u003e"
