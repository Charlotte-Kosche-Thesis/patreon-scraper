    "summary": "Hello, future patrons! I create the comic strip Best In Show, a humorous tale chock full of story arcs that resonate with the kid in all of us. It will update three times per week and deliver a dose of nostalgia, insight and fun and it\u0027s guaranteed to make your day better. You will appreciate your spouse/partner more. You will look at your dog differently. You will wonder how a pet could have a zombie as a best friend. You will wish that you kept all of your vintage Star Wars toys in their packaging and locked them away in an offshore savings account. You will have the chance to relive your childhood and rewrite your own personal history. With the funds that I receive, I will be able to maintain the web hosting, fund comic strip collections and justify the time that it takes to deliver ten seconds of entertainment to you every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Let me make you laugh!\u003cbr\u003e"
