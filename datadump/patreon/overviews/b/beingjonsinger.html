    "summary": "Jon Singer is a long time fan, famous for how many friends he has. This isn\u0027t surprising, because his friendliness and boundless enthusiasm make him a delight to know. For years he was funded by a tech boom millionnaire just to be himself, to create pottery and lasers and whatever struck his fancy. Jon had a real life patron. Now that patron isn\u0027t able to support Jon any more, so Jon is looking for other patrons -- us, his friends. By all kicking in a little, we can support Jon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJon makes lasers, and food, and pottery, and glazes, and fake ukeleles out of thrift store guitars, and other weird and wonderful things. He\u0027s interested in tea and plants, and going to science fiction conventions to see his friends. He needs money to live on and keep being Jon Singer, and to keep on doing what he does.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon will feature one of Jon\u0027s photos every month, sometimes with a short description of what it is and what he\u0027s been doing. At the end of the year, they\u0027ll be collected into a Jon Singer calendar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(This description of Jon written by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bluejo\"\u003eJo Walton\u003c/a\u003e)"
