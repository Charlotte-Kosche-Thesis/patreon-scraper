I am truly inspired by every email, Facebook post, and tweet that lets me know how much my music means to you!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal from the beginning of my career was to connect with people and make great art. Patreon is the perfect place to make that happen. I\u0027m ready to roll out a book of poetry called \u003cem\u003eMom, INTERRUPTED,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0new recordings,\u00a0children\u0027s books, and other creative things! All of which I can share with you. With your collaboration, I can get all these cool things into the world by publishing, releasing and sending directly to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way Patreon works is - a supporter can donate whatever they want per month and the donation is recurring each month after that. There are gifts of music, writing, and song that go with different levels of patronage. Anything, from $1/month up, is hugely helpful to the cause. You can check out the levels on this page as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT\u0027S NEXT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eMy initial goal is $500/month.\u00a0 Enough to support music equipment and studio time.\u00a0 There are so many moving parts; investing in equipment for recording and live shows, tour costs, studio time, video editing, musicians, and promotion of books and music. My next-level Patreon goal is to focus FULL TIME on creating work 100% supported by YOU. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU!!!\u00a0 for joining this project at ANY level.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLET\u0027S MAKE SOMETHING.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBren\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY STORY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eFor those who \u003cem\u003edon\u2019t\u003c/em\u003e know me, I\u2019m Brenda Kahn, singer/songwriter, poet, and writer. My career started in the early nineties when I signed a record deal with a Brooklyn indie label (Community 3 Records) and released my first album, \u003cem\u003eGoldfish Don\u2019t Talk Back\u003c/em\u003e. After the release of \u003cem\u003eGoldfish\u003c/em\u003e, I moved to Minneapolis and toured all over the Midwest and the East Coast. My songs BLEW UP (\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eKa-POW!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e) on College Radio, and I started playing to bigger and bigger audiences.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn 1992, I returned to NYC, and worked as a waitress at CBGBs. But then (\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eBAM!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e) I was signed to Columbia Records, and released my best-known album, \u003cem\u003eEpiphany In Brooklyn\u003c/em\u003e. I continued to tour \u2013 but now instead of sleeping on couches and floors, I was sleeping in hotel rooms. I opened for Bob Dylan, and the Kinks, and David Byrne, and became friends with - and toured with - Jeff Buckley who was also signed to Columbia.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn 1995, my third album (\u003cem\u003eDestination Anywhere\u003c/em\u003e) was dropped \u003cem\u003e2 weeks before the release date. (\u003c/em\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(151, 72, 6);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eOUCH!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cem\u003e). \u003c/em\u003eShanachie Records stepped in and released it a few months later. I continued to tour, and to make records (Hunger, Seven Laws of Gravity and Rocket to the Moon) and videos through the mid 2000\u2019s.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOver the next ten years, I started a family (two boys), and started teaching kids guitar, voice and writing. Life with kids took over, but in the background, I continued to write songs and poetry, digging into the beautiful chaos of life as a mom. I started chronicling my mom thoughts in verse and I\u0027m working on the release of my first book of poetry entitled \u003cem\u003eOde To Chores: The Good, The Bad, and the Laundry. \u003c/em\u003eI\u0027m back playing live shows, writing songs and still driving kids to flag football and art class. Patreon is making it all possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
