More specifically, writer of books (including \u003ca href=\"http://www.sheofthewild.com/books\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNIGHT CYCLES\u003c/a\u003e, a poetry collection, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.sheofthewild.com/books\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTHE LIGHT BETWEEN US\u003c/a\u003e, a new adult romance), staff writer for The Phoenix Soul Online Magazine, former columnist for Still Standing Online Magazine and Secret Rebel Club, anthology contributor (TO LINGER ON HOT COALS, WILD GOSLINGS, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.sheofthewild.com/writing-credits\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emore\u003c/a\u003e), creator of the MADE art e-course, and the mixed media artist behind \u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/epiphanyartstudio\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEpiphany Art Studio\u003c/a\u003e. I do all of this in between mothering two very small humans. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nthink deep, in the crevices where most people are afraid to go. I\nbreak the conventions of what you\u0027re \"supposed to\" talk\nabout. Someone once told me that there are two kinds of songs -- love\nsongs and pirate songs. I listen to the pirate songs.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nam creative. I am authentic. I am emotional and awkward. I am\nhealing. I am a writer. I am an artist. I am Beth, and I am (not) a\nproblem.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nbelieve in trusting the process, without needing to plan it all out.\nI believe in women, reclaiming their true selves. I believe in hope.\nI believe in leaning into the wilderness. I believe in rainbows.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nbelieve in showing up, even imperfectly. Especially imperfectly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write because I have to, because it\u0027s my lifeblood. But I also do it for you, you amazing readers, because words are meant to be read, savored, digested, enjoyed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an independent writer who author-publishes her own books because I believe in holding all of the process in my hands, of owning both the failures and the successes. And I love it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut of course author-publishing a book takes money (oh, money, how complicated you are). Each book I write costs me about $500 in cover design fees, editing fees, ISBN fees, expanded distribution publishing fees, marketing fees, and more (coffee not included). I pay these fees out of pocket, and am happy to, but if you\u0027d like to help, that would make me happy, too. Art is heart-level collaboration, and I\u0027d love to collaborate with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ve asked me for more (thank you and thank you and thank you!) -- more stories, more poetry, more videos -- and I want to give them to you. So let\u0027s do this!\u003cbr\u003e"
