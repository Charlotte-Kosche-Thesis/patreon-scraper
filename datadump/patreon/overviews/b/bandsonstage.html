I\u0027m a music photographer from the county of Kent in England. I\u0027ve been photographing bands for over a decade, and over the years I\u0027ve put a lot of time and energy into documenting gigs (and developing my personal style along the way). I try to show people the excitement and energy of a live show in photos, in the hope that what I do will get more people going to gigs, supporting musicians directly and helping to keep music LIVE. In the course of doing this, I put a tonne of images online on\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.bandsonstage.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.bandsonstage.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e and share lots of my work on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/bandsonstage\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esocial media\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.bandsonstage.co.uk/img/s6/v134/p1041630035-3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe downside is that getting to gigs, taking and editing photos, maintaining my gear and simply getting the end results out there can be a time-consuming and expensive labour of love, and despite having a few brilliant clients, a lot of what I do in this world of shrinking budgets is still largely at my own expense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me through Patreon, you\u0027ll be helping me to keep afloat, keep creating, and keep sharing, with a little less worry about how I\u0027m going to juggle everything. My goal is simply for my photography to move a little closer towards funding itself.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat can I offer you?\u003c/h3\u003eAll patrons gets my patron-only activity feed and a digital reward (hi-res download of a music, travel or nature photo) every month, plus early access to new merch items and occasional giveaways. Other tiers include prints, mugs, discounts, tutorials, access to a private Q\u0026amp;A group, me editing your photos, photo shoots...so whether you\u0027re a consumer of concert photography or want to learn a little more about it, hopefully there\u0027s something there for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you choose to support me with a subscription, or just a virtual hug and a link share, it\u0027s all hugely appreciated.
