It will probably take a few months to perfect the process, so I beg you to be forgiving if you choose this tier while I work out bugs in the process. My intention for this reward is to send each patron a beautiful envelope containing some original art in the form of a letter, perhaps a doodle or a small craft, and whatever printed goods I have on hand EACH MONTH! No reply is necessary! I\u0027ll be personally writing each letter on a pre-chosen theme, almost like a blog post, but drawn by hand and sent directly to you, but if you DO chose to reply, I will of course acknowledge that, further personalizing your experience! I know this is a higher price point than most people can manage, so I am perfectly happy to write you for a single month, and then you can choose to either drop down to another reward tier, or simply spread your love to another creator.
