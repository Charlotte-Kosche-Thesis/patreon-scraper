    "summary": "Hi there, thanks for stopping by. We are BookBox :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a social enterprise that innovated the concept of \u201cAniBooks\u201d or animated books to support emergent literacy and language skills.  We overcome the distribution challenges of print by piping reading to children on digital and electronic media.\u00a0In our conception a \u201cbook\u201d is a reading experience that can travel in print and other audio-visual media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe produce animated stories that are powered by Same Language Subtitling (SLS) a scientifically tested and proven approach to help improve reading skills and language learning, ultimately promoting a love for reading. We create content for any audio-visual media platform such as broadcast TV, DVD/VCD, mobile phones, handhelds, internet, and last but not least, print.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAniBooks flow from a simple fact \u2013 children love to watch cartoons. Thus, AniBooks are animated stories for children, with the narration appearing on-screen as Same Language Subtitles (SLS).  BookBox was founded in 2004 after winning a business plan competition at Stanford University, called, the Social e-Challenge.  BookBox has so far produced close to 50 AniBooks in over 40 languages (from all over the world) and aims to create sufficient content to, eventually, mount TV programs. See www.bookbox.com to sample some stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn an AniBook, every word is highlighted in perfect timing with the audio, thus reinforcing reading skills, automatically and subconsciously.  SLS is a pedagogically sound and proven technique, with known application in early literacy and second language instruction, innovated and pioneered by our partner non-profit PlanetRead (\u003ca href=\"http://www.planetread.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.planetread.org\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are here because we want\nto create a lot more AniBooks that can help children improve their reading\nskills. In India alone, around 200 million children in the 0-10 age group are\nbeing deprived of a children\u0027s reading experience. There is a lot that needs to\nbe done for these children in India and around the world. We are committed to creating\na \u2018book\u2019 for every child in her/his language. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe also believe Patreon is\nan exciting platform that will help us leverage the passion people have for\ncreating quality content. With over 30 million channel views and close to 150K\nsubscribers on BookBox\u2019s YouTube channel, we are confident our supporters will\nhelp us create more AniBooks through Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere your money goes?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour money will help us bear\nthe cost of producing the AniBooks. We have a small but highly dedicated team\nof project managers, editors, language experts, animators and programmers who\nare committed to the cause BookBox has taken up. We also work with freelance\nmusicians and voice over artists who are passionate about creating quality content\nthat will make a difference in children\u2019s lives. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eDon\u2019t worry about becoming a\nPatron if you cannot afford it, we know how that feels. You can still help us\nby just spreading the word among your friends and family. On the other hand, if\nyou can, please do support our campaign and donate as much as you can. We will\nmake sure every penny you donate is worth it! We will be making this AniBook completely\nfree on our YouTube channel.
