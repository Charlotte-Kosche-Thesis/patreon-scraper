Most of the stuff I release will continue to be free, but Patrons will get extra content and all sorts of awesome stuff as a reward for sponsoring me here. (Check the Rewards section below to see what you\u0027ll receive.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be making music videos, performances, music tutorials, sample packs, virtual instruments and a lot of other music or sound-related content. For every piece of content that I release, all Patrons will also get access to extra goodies. For instance, if I release a music video, you guys get a tutorial. For a live 2-hour jam, you might get to download an Ableton Instrument or Effect rack that I used as part of it. Or I can make a video, and you might get a piece of music made with whatever technique I show in the video, which nobody but you will hear!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI usually release something new about once a month. However, if I release anything more often than that, I won\u0027t label the new content as paid, and you won\u0027t have to donate for it! Either way, you can set a monthly donation maximum amount, so you can definitely pay exactly as much as you want and afford. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a video where I make music using nothing but processed recordings of me hitting and destroying a soda can.
