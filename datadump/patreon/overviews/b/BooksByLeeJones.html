Help me re-shape the debate on global warming.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qMepRY8Qil0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy did the U.S. pull out of the Paris Climate\nAccord? Blame Michael Crichton. You heard me right. Michael Crichton,\nacclaimed author of\u00a0\u003cem\u003eJurassic Park\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eand\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Andromeda Strain\u003c/em\u003e. Don\u2019t\nget me wrong; Crichton was one of my favorite authors. He had a huge fan club. But\nCrichton was also known for his denial of global warming. In 2004 he wrote\u00a0\u003cem\u003eState\nof Fear\u003c/em\u003e, an action thriller in which he presented his case that\nglobal warming is a hoax perpetrated in large part by compromised scientists\nusing bad science and a pro-global warming agenda. The novel\u2019s theme is an\nelaborate ecoterrorist plot to wreak havoc on the planet by creating massive\nglobal catastrophes and then blaming these on unchecked global warming. Of\ncourse the heroes of the novel are global warming contrarians. Those other characters\nwho defend the science of global warming are surprisingly na\u00efve and uninformed,\nblindly adhering to a cause they know little about. Naturally, they become easy\nconverts. They are, after all, Crichton\u2019s straw men and women. In the end they\nbecome contrarians too, and help the heroes foil these sinister plots at the\nlast possible minute and expose the ecoterrorists for what they are.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAnyone who\nis not a serious student of global warming, which would include most of us,\ncould easily be swayed by Crichton\u2019s compelling anti-global warming message,\nand indeed that was the case. Like\nmany of his books,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eState of Fear\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ewas an instant best seller and reached\nmillions. It became the\n\u201cbible\u201d of the global warming naysayers. \u003cstrong\u003eLesson\nlearned: People don\u2019t read scientific treatises on global warming. They read\nfiction.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to the present. Donald Trump\nrecently decided to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord. He did\nthis despite the concerted efforts of industry (yes, even Big Oil), leaders of\nnearly every country in the world, scientists of all stripes, and members of\nhis own family. He did this because of a remarkably ill-informed commitment he\nhad made to his base while on the campaign trail. Make no mistake about it: the\nglobal warming contrarians are winning the battle of public opinion. Thanks,\nMichael Crichton.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut what really appalls me is that 13 years after \u003cem\u003eState of Fear\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ewas published, no one has used fiction\nas a medium for reaching the layperson with the truth about global warming. As\na lifelong scientist with a PhD in biology, and as a recent convert to fiction\nwriting, I intend to do something about it. My third novel in \u003cem\u003eThe Many Faces of Fee \u003c/em\u003etrilogy,\u00a0\u003cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eInch by Inch\u003c/em\u003e, is that book. It promises to\nbe more\u2014much more\u2014than just an action thriller. It will have depth and plot\ncomplexity not found in\u00a0\u003cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eState of Fear\u003c/em\u003e. Readers will be more engaged with the characters \u003cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e the plot. And Crichton used a sledgehammer to cram the global\nwarming hoax down the throats of unsuspecting readers. In \u003cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eInch by Inch\u003c/em\u003e I use a more subtle approach. The last thing I want is\nto turn away the skeptics before the plot even begins to unfold. Thus, the\nreader is held in limbo as Fee Finnegan and her adversary Hal Sorenson, the\njunior senator from Texas, argue their opposing cases, first before Congress\nand later in private, well into the future. But facts are facts. You can debate them all\nyou want. You can run from them, hide from them, pick and choose among them.\nBut you can\u2019t deny them. In the end, Planet Earth provides the unambiguous answer to the global warming\ndebate in a hair-raising spectacle forty years hence that alters the face of\nhumanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eResearching and writing\u00a0\u003cem\u003eInch\nby Inch\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ewill be an\nexpensive undertaking. Much like a scientific treatise on global warming, it\nwill require exhaustive research as well as interviews with leading climate scientists\nand politicians on \u003cem\u003eboth\u003c/em\u003e sides of the\nissue. I will need to visit Greenland (I don\u2019t write about places I\u2019ve never\nbeen), not to mention Washington, DC. But, unlike in a lofty scientific paper, the\nscience will be wrapped seamlessly within the pages of an action thriller full\nof intrigue and suspense, unexpected plot twists, and characters who bleed just\nlike you and me. And to have maximum impact, \u003cem\u003eInch by Inch\u003c/em\u003e must be published before the next presidential\nelection. That\u2019s a tall order. I will need to work full time and then some to\nmeet this demanding schedule. That means \u003cem\u003esayonara\u003c/em\u003e to the day job! But, with your generous assistance, I can do it. Global warming is one of the most serious issues facing mankind in the 21st century. Will you\njoin me in rescuing the planet from the impacts of unchecked global\nwarming\u2014inch by inch?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
