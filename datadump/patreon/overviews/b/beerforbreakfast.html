    "summary": "Hello there travel lovers! We are Micha (29) \u0026amp; Justina (25), a couple from Lithuania \u0026amp; England. Our story begins in Oct 2014, when we first met on a Halloween night in our home city of Peterborough, UK. As cheesey as it sounds, it was love at first sight and within the first 3 months of meeting each other we travelled to Paris for Valentines Day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat trip certainly ignited our shared passion for travel and adventure and as we celebrated our 2 years anniversary, we had successfully travelled to\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e10 European \u003c/strong\u003edestinations. Each country that we travelled to felt like the beginning of something greater and so we eventually decided to quit our jobs to travel the world. \u003cstrong\u003eLIFE IS JUST TOO SHORT.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy quit?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe wanted to travel further and for a longer period of time. Travel is about changing your perspective on life, making new connections and keeping your mind sharp. Europe was always a fantastic getaway but still felt very safe and familiar. Being completely out of your comfort zone, trying new foods and exploring new cultures is probably the best thing that anyone can ever do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo prior to leaving the UK we had planned and we saved for 18 months. Feb 2016 marked the date of 4 adventurous months in \u003cstrong\u003eSouth East Asia\u003c/strong\u003e. This is also where our YouTube channel was born. It is sometimes hard to explain why we travel but when moments, feelings and experiences on video is somehow easier to understand. Just see for yourself in our compilation video for 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X5dazrc98ZA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe knew in advance that these 4 months still wouldn\u0027t be enough to cure our wanderlust appetite. So we had applied for a \u003cstrong\u003eCanada Working Holiday Visa\u003c/strong\u003e, whilst still in the UK and we were granted our permits before setting off on our world adventure. This would allow us the freedom to travel and work at the same time. Perfect!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter an amazing year in Canada, we could definitely say that we fell in love with this country. In such a short time, we had made a life in Canada. We both worked in jobs we adored, lived in a beautiful house, met incredible people and were constantly surrounded by nature. We wanted nothing more than to extend our time here but unforeseen circumstances meant that we could not get an extension on our work permit and we had to leave Canada.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis outcome certainly came as a surprise and we only had 2 months to make a quick decision about our future. To rebuild our lives back in the UK would require a lot of savings. So we sat and discussed the possibility of moving to South East Asia, where the cheap cost of living would allow us to travel and work online as freelancers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe entered Malaysia on Feb 2nd 2018 and this was the start of becoming \u003cstrong\u003eDIGITAL NOMADS. \u003c/strong\u003eWe\u00a0are\u00a0currently working overtime to build up our online presence and increase our passive income every month (currently estimated 60+ hours per week). Predominately our earnings will be generated teaching english online and working as a freelance designer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main battle with creating travel content, is \u003cstrong\u003eTIME. \u003c/strong\u003eSo with every pledge is a step closer enabling us to have more freedom to create content that is meaningful for us and creates value to \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e watching at home.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how can you help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your contribution (big or small), we will be able to\u00a0create more frequent travel content. All money will go directly into either travelling to new places, investing in better equipment, improving the quality of our videos and diversifying our content (blog, ebooks, infographics). Our aim is to constantly create content that is \u003cstrong\u003eINSPIRING\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eINFORMATIVE. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur biggest aim is to show how affordable travel can be and how ANYONE can follow their passion.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe couldn\u0027t thank you enough if you decided to become our \u003cstrong\u003ePATRON\u003c/strong\u003e and join our \u003cstrong\u003etravel community. \u003c/strong\u003eYour support means everything to us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers to freedom!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rwvUjAv6pxg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
