    "summary": "It\u0027s not easy making a living as a writer. If you get published, sure, but until then, there\u0027s rent, food, clothes, physical therapy, cat food, gas, turtle wax for the solid gold toilet I bought with my trust fund--the bills just pile up. So if you enjoy my writing, here\u0027s a way to show some appreciation while also getting more writing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange, you\u0027ll get to help determine the direction of these stories with Choose Your Own Adventure votes. You get to decide pairings, what paths the characters take, what stories get updated, and what subplots get focused on. Just look under the CYOA tag to find a list of posts you can vote.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the beginning of the month, we also choose which celebrity will be featured in the RPF story of the month. And on the fifteenth, patrons vote on one story to be updated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd for people who pledge even more than that, you get short stories written specifically for you. And \u003cem\u003eeveryone \u003c/em\u003ewho pledges is entered into a monthly raffle to win a full-length story, absolutely free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way it works is that you simply pledge a small amount--one dollar, ten dollars, whatever--per story. I write the story, I get the money. So if I get just seven people to make a one dollar pledge, and I spend an hour writing a story, I\u0027m making minimum wage and I don\u0027t even have to wear a uniform. *Or anything at all...* Okay, maybe you\u0027re worried that I\u0027ll write a bunch of hundred word \u0027stories\u0027 and bang, you\u0027re out fifteen bucks for no more content than you\u0027d get paging through Gone Girl for free at Barnes \u0026amp; Noble while you drink a hot cocoa. Well, that won\u0027t happen--for one thing, you can trust me. I\u0027m on the internet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor another thing, you can set a maximum on your pledging. Let\u0027s say your pledge is one dollar and your max is five. I write five stories, I get five dollars, *that\u0027s it*. This is also very handy if your thoughts are my writing are \"I like this, I want to see more of this--but just, like, five more. Not six.\" The Steven Moffat Reaction, as it\u0027s called. And in exchange for your pocket change, I\u0027ll be setting you up with some cool stuff like previews of what I\u0027m working on, free chapters of my original work, and the truth about what really happened to your wife that night. Don\u0027t you want to know the truth, detective? Wouldn\u0027t you do... *anything* to know?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, you won\u0027t be charged for every single story I write. I wouldn\u0027t dream of actually demanding money for, say, me writing two hundred words about how soft [subtexty female character A] thinks [subtexty female character B\u0027s] lips are. So it\u0027ll go like this. I\u0027ll only be counting a story upwards of a thousand words as a pledge. That\u0027s what people get excited for on Yuletide, so that seems a pretty good line between well-sized story and disappointing story. And I\u0027ll try to make it worth your while by digging into the backroom for some fics people have been demanding, DEMANDING, to see finished. So if you\u0027re a Patron, be sure to let me know what you\u0027d like to see continued. It\u0027s your dollar, after all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the rewards, I\u0027m available for commissions. For fifty dollars, I write a story to your specifications, over four thousand words in length. PM if you\u0027re interested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, we have some comics that I\u0027m putting out, thanks to an artist and colorist I\u0027ve commissioned. Two comic pages are available each month, and depending on how much you pledge, you can get one page, two pages, one \u003cem\u003ecolored \u003c/em\u003epage and one in black and white, or \u003cem\u003etwo \u003c/em\u003ecolored pages. Check the reward tiers for more information.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Being a cop, the only people who really have your back are other cops. Your partner isn\u0027t just a friend--he\u0027s a brother, a wife, a God. When some two-bit thug leaves him painting the alley floor with two extra holes in his back, someone\u0027s supposed to do something. Maybe the courts can\u0027t see justice done, but I can. Yeah, the gun is heavy--the bullets are even heavier. But the heaviest thing of all is the look his wife gave me when I told her that the father of her children wasn\u0027t coming home.
