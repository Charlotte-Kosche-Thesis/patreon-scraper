I really like doing this stuff, though, so it would be cool if I could do it full-time for the foreseeable future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few disclaimers. First, I\u0027m fortunate enough to be able to monetize the vast majority of my videos. If you watch my stuff, you are already supporting me, and nothin\u0027 else is required. Second, the money you give me here won\u0027t like, go to a special \"make my videos better\" account. It\u0027s just money to me: It might go to buying better equipment or it might go to buying a set of small dogs. There\u0027s no way to tell. Third, I charge for every video, but I will never charge for more than two videos a month. I won\u0027t make you give me money for a bonus video if I end up making any of those. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, it\u0027s super rad that you\u0027re here, reading this, right now.
