Be ashamed for a minute.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll wait.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, now that we\u0027re all filled with our recommended daily dosage of self-loathing, let\u0027s get on with the show, shall we?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to Bakuhaku\u0027s little corner of degenerate hedonism! The only place on the internet where you can pay me to not only \u003cstrong\u003eget\u003c/strong\u003e your mind in the gutter, but have me \u003cstrong\u003eshove\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0it down in there so hard your brain will be permanently saturated with all that filthy, disgusting, depraved pornography that your sunday school teacher always warned you about back when you were a kid, never to be washed clean.\u003cbr\u003eSounds fun, right? Of course it does.\u003cbr\u003eYou know you want in on this. C\u0027mooooon, it\u0027s fun, I swear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut why support Bakuhaku, huh?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, there\u0027s no explicit reason to, If I\u0027m being perfectly honest. I never put any of my content behind a paywall, and every single commission or comic page I post on here goes up on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://baku-my-hakus.tumblr.com/\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e, my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/bakuhaku/\"\u003eFuraffinity\u003c/a\u003e, and/or my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.hentai-foundry.com/user/Bakuhaku/profile\"\u003eHentai Foundry\u003c/a\u003e, as well as other various places on the internet. There is very little content aside from the occasional doodles or test images that I do to test out new stylistic approaches that is exclusive to Patreon. I would never demand that someone pay me just to see the artwork I make.\u003cbr\u003eThis page is here for people who are fans of my art. People who want to help me continue to do what they already love about my art. If you take a look to the right, you\u0027ll see a few reward tiers for various pledge levels, but I don\u0027t want anyone pledging to me just to get a product or a special perk; I want you to contribute because you care about my content, rather than for any specific reward.\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s... partially because I can be slow and/or inconsistent in doing the things I say I\u0027m going to do. I\u0027m not gonna lie to you and say I\u0027m always perfect and always get my rewards out on time. I try my hardest, really: The people here on this page supporting me are my livelihood. Without them, none of this would exist, and I owe them absolutely everything. However, I wear a lot of hats, juggle a lot of projects, and sometimes just can\u0027t fulfill every promise I try to make. I\u0027m always working to get better about it, but the last thing I want to do is be disingenuous and try to tell you guys I\u0027m always perfect at everything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you scroll past those initial rewards, you\u0027ll see all my commissions are handled on here as well. A lot of times this can be intimidating or confusing to newcomers, but I promise, it\u0027s not as scary as it looks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you select the Level 3 Smutlord tier:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvery month you get to send me 3 \u0027tags\u0027. The same sort of tags you might find on an imageboard site like Gelbooru or Sankaku channel; these can include things ranging from characters to poses to props to activities. Rarely ever more than 3 words, most tags should be just 1 or 2. Then you get to kick back, relax, and let me handle all the think-y parts. I\u0027ll interpret your 3 tags in an interesting and fun way, and give you a whole drawing that you can call your own!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you select the Debauchery Dabbler, Nookie Nobleman, or Lascivious Legend tiers:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eyou get the whole shebang; give me a full description of your desired image from characters to outfits to environments, and I\u0027ll follow your lead in making a fully painted illustration to your specifications.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u003cstrong\u003ef you select any commission tier:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour pledge will be processed at the beginning of each month. Once the payment has gone through there is absolutely \u003cstrong\u003eno\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0obligation for you to keep it going for another month. If you want to be a regular and get continuous images one-after-the-other, then you can do that, but if you just want a one-off commission from me, then you are free to do that as well. After the pledge processes, you have all the way until the end of the subsequent month to reduce your pledge down to whatever you feel is appropriate, or remove it entirely, before you\u0027re charged again.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I do it this way is to keep myself on a schedule, and make sure you guys get the art you pay for in a timely manner. Trust me; I tried doing commissions the old-fashioned way once. It wasn\u0027t pretty. If you have any questions whatsoever about this process, please feel free to shoot me a message; I\u0027m happy to help anyone who\u0027s new to this method to understand it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd... that\u0027s about it. You have my sincere thanks for stopping by; whether you become a 1$ patron or you get a 3-character commission every single month, you are becoming an integral, indelible, and invaluable part of my career as a creator. Even if you\u0027re just looking around and you can\u0027t afford to pledge, It was great to see you, thanks for stopping by; You\u0027re welcome back any time."
