    "summary": "\u00a0First things first, Thank You. Thank you for appreciating my work enough that you have ended up here at my Patreon page. Whether or not you decide to pledge you have most likely helped me by subscribing to my YouTube channel and sharing my videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e I never thought I\u0027d be here on Patreon. I wanted the YouTube channel to be self funded. I was making enough from ad revenue that I was able to improve my videos by getting a better camera and a microphone set up. If you watch my early videos you will notice a huge improvement in video quality from then until now. I bought two Zoom H1 recorders and 2 of the RodeSmart Lav+ microphones with adapters to run with the Zooms. I was able to get a couple of cameras including a GoPro and a Nikon DSLR with a Rode Video Mic. I also used my ad revenue to invest in a couple of good sturdy tripods and upgraded my editing software. In fact I was always looking for things to improve my video and audio and invested every penny I earned from YouTube plus a lot more of my own money because I believed that ad the revenue would be there. I was naive and I was wrong.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e As most of you are well aware early this year the \"Adpocolypse\" struck. Some of the larger advertisers boycotted YouTube and of course YouTube\u0027s reaction was to be sure that their advertisers\u0027 ads didn\u0027t play on controversial videos. Gun channels were hit hard. This is when I first heard of Patreon. I was reluctant to create a page though. I thought that the YouTube ship would right itself and the ad money would eventually come back. It still hasn\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e I had to come to terms with reality. I basically had 3 choices. 1- cut my losses and quit- I hate giving up, I\u0027ve never been one to quit and after nearly 6 years on YouTube I couldn\u0027t just walk away... Plus part of me still believes that\u0027s what YouTube wants... For us channels that promote and\u00a0 educate about firearms to walk out. 2- continue on until the video equipment I have wears out. I\u0027ve already broke one of my Zoom H1 recorders and with no ad money I can\u0027t replace it. I also wouldn\u0027t be able to put my heart into it knowing that the end of this video creating trip could come at any moment that my next piece of equipment gives out. 3- I could start crowd funding with Patreon and allow the people who are really into what I am doing to pitch in and keep me funded until when and if ad money ever returns to a self sustaining amount. So that\u0027s where I am at right now. Right here. Pushing on. I want to bring you the best quality videos with the most information about guns and gear that I possibly can and you can help be a part of it. Today\u0027s date as I write this is 12/04/2017 and I am brand new to this. It will take me some time to learn how Patreon works and what all I can and can\u0027t do. I do plan on setting up some goals and also some rewards for those of you that choose to become a patron. This will take time as I am much more gun savvy than computer savvy. Please be patient. Thank you for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0"

     "about": "Rural living, Appalachian, family man with a passion for firearms and producing short videos. I\u0027ve been shooting for as long as I was big enough to hold a rifle and I started making videos for YouTube in 2012 after following many other firearms channels for years. I felt that the \"average Joe\" firearms owner and shooter wasn\u0027t represented much on YouTube and decided to join in. I found out that making videos is a hobby all it\u0027s own and now that is my second favorite activity right behind shooting firearms. I would like to see how far I can take this thing. YouTube has been cracking down on gun related content and having community guidelines so vague and enforced in such a way that I do not know what they consider acceptable or not anymore. That leads me here. Welcome to my Patreon.\u00a0 \u00a0",
