Also, pledges will help me be able to afford to travel to and from auditions, in a hope to make something more of my music carrer, as I live on a very small island, cut off from the rest of the UK and travel is expensive. \u003cbr\u003eI am also hoping I can make enough money in pledges to buy the rights to some original material from people (As I cannot write songs or music) and then be able to afford some studio time to be able to record them, so that I can start selling my music on iTunes and maybe start to make a living from my music, which is what I would love to do. \u003cbr\u003e"
