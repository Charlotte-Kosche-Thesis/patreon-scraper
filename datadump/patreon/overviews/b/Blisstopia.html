    "summary": "This Patreon started off simply as a way to support the ongoing shenanigans of Drunkblogging, but it turns out people want to support so much more; therefore, this is now a generalized Patreon page. (If you\u0027re here just about the Drunkblogging, the original welcome regarding that is below.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"But Bliss! What is the point of a general Patreon page? I want to support something specific!\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell now, Convenient Anonymous Internet Strawman, that is super awesome of you! I\u0027m glad that I make something awesome enough that you\u0027re interested in supporting it. The thing is that I am not a one-woman pony. No wait. I\u0027m not a one-trick show! No, that\u0027s not quite right either.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe point is that I, as the saying goes, contain multitudes - and I put them forth into the world. Circular Gallifreyan art, left-handed doodles, snarky mugs, Drunkblogging, Nightmare Fuel writing prompts, non-seasonal writing prompts, flash fiction... I do all this and more. To support one of them is to support me, and thereby to support all of them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"But Bliss! What does \u0027support\u0027 even \u003cem\u003emean\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0in that context?\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for asking, CAIS! It means that all these things take time, money, materials, brainpower. To produce so many things also means that I need to have my basics covered - food, shelter, gas, internet connection by which to share them with you. In becoming a Patreon contributor, you become a Patron, as of the patrons of the arts of old! Your contributions, be they one-time or ongoing, help make sure that I\u0027m not scrambling trying to make ends meet, and therefore am able to keep producing the cool things that brought you here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"So what do I get out of this?\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, CAIS, you said you want to support me, or at least some of my work... so you get that! You also at any level get access to my Patreon blog, which means things like behind-the-scenes info for my WIP, as well as the chance to see my new work before it\u0027s available to the public. Various levels have various rewards of their own.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlus, you\u0027re keeping Bliss blissful. Everybody wins!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u0026lt;hr/\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDrunkblogging\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMovies. There are so many of them, available to us so many ways. What\u0027s more fun then just watching one? Watching one with friends! Seeing their reactions! Hearing what quotes they latch onto! Enjoying the squeal-and-flail as the twists and turns hit the screen - or the groans and complaints when something turns out to be massively trashy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, what do you do when, through a series of unfortunate (and some fortunate) life events, you end up living far away from the people you\u0027d do this with?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, if you are me, you start regularly watching movies and live-blogging your reactions, questions, commentary, cheers, and boos. Even better, because the you-me in this question is so awesome, you do this on social media where people who know what\u0027s coming can chime in at their favorite parts, and where folks who haven\u0027t seen the flick yet get the option to throw anti-spoilerism to the wind and enjoy the strange, wonderful performance art that is a stream of reaction to something that is, to them, unseen. (Cue nerdy vague reference to Plato\u0027s Cave)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd for extra fun and digital tongue-loosening, this is done with a drink in hand."
