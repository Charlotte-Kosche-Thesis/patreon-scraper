The fact that you\u2019re on this page let\u2019s me know you believe in me and want to know how you can help push my music forward. That means a lot! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eOffering Your Support is Secure and Easy\u003c/h4\u003eMy Patreon campaign is easy and simple. You can support my music by pledging at least $5 per month and in return you\u0027ll get my lofi hip hop album Optique for free plus a monthly live stream concert on Facebook Live that is only for my patrons. I also have a lot of new music available that you\u0027ll be able to listen to before anyone else. There is no long term commitment and you can stop donating whenever you choose. If you wish to pledge more than $5 per month there are additional rewards available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eI Want You to be Inspired\u003c/h4\u003eMy calling in life is to inspire and uplift people through music. I work day and night to live up to this calling. Creating music comes natural for me but as you can probably guess, the only way people can be inspired or uplifted by music is to actually HEAR it. That\u2019s the tricky part and is where I need your financial support. Your pledge will help me continue to do three important things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e1. Build relationships with my audience online\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I heavily rely on tools like Facebook and Mailchimp (email marketing) to help me connect and build relationships with the people who are interested in the music I make. There are monthly costs for Facebook ads and as my email list grows so does the cost to send messages.\u2028\u2028\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e2. Tour new cities\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I love loading up my car and traveling to new cities to create a live music experience for people who enjoy what I do. I can remember going to shows that inspired me to the point of changing the course of my life when I was younger. It means everything that I pay it forward and do what I can to inspire other people with live music.\u2028\u2028\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3.

     "about": "Born and raised in the rugged city of Gary, Indiana, independent producer, beatmaker, arranger and bassist Brandon Meeks is gaining steam in the crowded world of Hip-Hop and creating a genuine lane that fans describe as \u201chip hop at it\u2019s finest\u201d and \u201ca breath of fresh air\u201d.\u003cbr\u003eChoosing to follow his own path over the enticing allure of popular trends, Meeks uses his years of working with noteworthy jazz and soul artists to create hip hop music that fuses authentic, high-level musicianship with clever sampling techniques, funky drums and haunting melodies. His sound gives listeners an alternative to trap music and mumble rap.\u003cbr\u003eAs the primary producer for the Indianapolis hip hop crew Native Sun, Brandon has created 2 magnetically soulful albums plus a series of sharp, compelling videos that have earned the attention of influential cultural tastemakers such as AFROPUNK and Team Backpack. His iron-willed efforts to share Native Sun\u2019s music and build his audience has resulted in over 500 thousand views,10 thousand shares and over 1 million people reached around the globe.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn 2014 Brandon got a taste of life as an actor when he was cast in Don Cheadle\u2019s directorial debut film, Miles Ahead\u2014a movie about iconic musician Miles Davis. Brandon worked directly with both Cheadle and jazz artist Robert Glasper during the film\u2019s production. As the character of legendary bassist, Ron Carter, Brandon was able to bring his talent to film-goers everywhere and further expand his fanbase.\u003cbr\u003eToday, Meeks is working to release 2 albums simultaneously entitled Optique and Red.Black.Green. Moved by the bitter struggles of black people in America, he is speaking to critical social issues through his music. Optique features gritty hip hop instrumentals combined with empowering spoken word, film clips and recorded speeches. Red.Black.Green is comprised of warm, soul-drenched acoustic jazz compositions. The two works are unified by the concept of liberation.\u003cbr\u003eBrandon is determined to give great music to hip hop fans who have been forgotten about by the mainstream industrial music machine. He strives to be an inspiration to artists who aspire to be successful while remaining true to themselves.\u003cbr\u003e",
