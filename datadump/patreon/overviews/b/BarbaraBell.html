    "summary": "Hello, my fellow art lover! Thanks for dropping by to check out my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve\u00a0been drawing pictures since I was old enough to hold a crayon without eating it (and who knows, maybe before that too). My wonderful parents, firm believers in developing early childhood creativity, encouraged my brothers and me to make lots of things, including art projects of various kinds. In my case, I became pretty good at drawing. By the time I was eight or ten I was drawing pictures for other people to color, too; I sold my first drawings-to-color when I was ten years old.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor most of my life, most of my work has been representational (portraying, or \"representing,\" actual physical things such as people, animals, scenery and so on). In fact, I\u0027ve spent the last twenty and more years doing portraits, working from life or from photographs. \u00a0But there was always the desire to sketch\u00a0pretty shapes and lines on the edges of things, on scrap paper, even on paper tablecloths and napkins at events where these were present. In the past few years, drawings such as these have become popular among \u003cstrong\u003eadults\u003c/strong\u003e as \u003cstrong\u003ecoloring pictures.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-nikki-martinez-psyd-lcpc/7-reasons-adult-coloring-books-are-great-for-your-mental-emotional-and-intellectual-health_b_8626136.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCheck out this article which describes seven of the known health benefits of coloring.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRecently, I\u0027ve begun to make videos of my drawings as I\u0027m creating them. \u003c/strong\u003eMy\u00a0drawing videos are posted publicly on YouTube for the world to enjoy (although as a subscriber or \"patron,\" you get early access to these - see below). Even more recently, I\u0027ve branched out, from ink and colored pencil on paper to glaze on pottery. This is a kind of art I\u0027ve always wanted to make: the kind you can use in daily life. You can see pictures of my meditative drawings on pottery in my Patreon posts. (I also enjoy creating the kind of art you can wear, and expect to post some pictures of my work in this medium soon.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor a $1 per month subscription,\u003c/strong\u003e you\u0027ll get early access to these videos via a link I\u0027ll share with you 24 hours before the videos are posted on YouTube to the general public. \u003cstrong\u003eFor a $5 per month subscription,\u003c/strong\u003e you\u0027ll have access to a gallery of images--some you\u0027ll have seen being created in the videos, plus more--which you can download, print, and color as often as you like. And it just gets more interesting from there...check out \u003cem\u003eall \u003c/em\u003emy reward tiers to see what other goodies are available!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/DviYVUnNj8E\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHere\u0027s a video of one of my drawing sessions to give you an idea of what I do.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eAnd again, thanks for taking the time to check out my art on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027m not a tourist, but I hear interesting things about what artists and craftspeople are doing in other parts of the world and I would love to check these out in person. (How about the Faroe Islands, with their Google \"sheep view\" project? I spin my own yarn and this concept fascinates me!)\u00a0 http://visitfaroeislands.com/sheepview360/",

When I reach this goal, I\u0027ll post a picture of the next month\u0027s offered bowl. Meanwhile, you can see a picture of an example (not the actual bowl) on my March 4 2018 post.\u003cbr\u003e",
