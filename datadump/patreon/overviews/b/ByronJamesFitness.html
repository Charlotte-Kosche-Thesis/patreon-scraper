    "summary": "Here\u2019s an overview of what Byron James Fitness is and how Patreon is going to help BJF accomplish its goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Situation:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eByron James Fitness is a professional training company owned and operated by Greg Lomason. Greg is a Certified Cancer Recovery Specialist with the National Federation of Professional Trainers and BJF specializes in cancer rehabilitation. The idea of Byron James Fitness came about in August of 2014 after Greg received a call that his dad had been diagnosed with cancer. It\u0027s not as morbid as it sounds, to him it was another diagnosis in a long string of medical issues embedded in his family and family history. To explain all of them, it would take a textbook. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe plan for Byron James Fitness was for it to be a company like LA|Fitness or 24 Hour and name it after Greg\u2019s dad. The spin? BJF would have a feng shui \"retreat\" feel that would cater to clients who need a total fitness makeover. Not unlike Chris Powell\u0027s \"Extreme Weight Loss\" on ABC, BJF would help clients, physically, mentally, and nutritionally, change their outlook on life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter talking to a business banker and a few more key players, low-ball estimates to get started would have been $100m dollars...not the easiest sum of money for a young entrepreneur to come up with. Instead, BJF\u2019s business plan was reimagined into a traveling business model, and here we are!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eByron James Fitness has experienced a phenomenal 2.5 years!! BJF\u2019s own strategies and its partnership with local apartment complexes have allowed us to change hundreds of people\u0027s lives. We\u0027ve helped people fit into their wedding dresses, go on dream vacations they would never have been able to experience, visit family they hadn\u0027t seen in years, live long enough to see their grandkids born, helped clients compete in bodybuilding competitions, get drafted into the NFL, etc. Even with all this success, Byron James Fitness is still a small startup and unable to sustain itself independently. We\u2019ve mostly relied on savings to produce the YouTube content and other numerous benefits we include with our programs. We truly want to continue to help people achieve their goals  and two things are very clear:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) \u003c/strong\u003eWe want BJF to continue to grow and be successful in the future. The beta test is over. It works. We have success stories and we get results. Our founder, Greg, is obsessed with getting people into shape\u2014he says, it\u0027s the most fun he\u2019s ever had and it\u2019s his life goal to continue to help others succeed in their wellness goals. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2)\u003c/strong\u003e The BJF brand needs to be self-sustaining for this to work. The plan to \"fund BJF with savings + other company\" was fine for Phase 1, but it\u0027s not sustainable. The company\u0027s savings are unimpressive and the revenue from the other company barely covers business expenses. If BJF is going to endure, and continue to grow and improve, it must be able to support itself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThinking about the long-term self-sustaining plan, the decision, at this time, is to not rely on ads. Ads are annoying and detract from the user experience, and we know there are better ways for long-term sustainment. So far, BJF has acquired clientele and generated revenue with two methods:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) Online Programming\u003c/strong\u003e. This method has helped, but it\u2019s going to take a lot more to get to self-sustainability. Maybe when we have time to further develop the online programs or have more time to work with people face to face, it\u0027ll do the job by itself, but, at this time, there aren\u2019t enough hours in the day for this method to accomplish our goal of sustainability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) Word of Mouth.\u003c/strong\u003e We\u2019ve achieved a great reputation in the local area through the momentous results we\u2019ve produced. Our reputation has given us many opportunities to help family and friends of current clients. We excel in more areas than just cancer recovery and many of our new clientele is acquired through client referrals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, online programming and reputation alone won\u2019t get BJF to where we need to be for independence. We\u0027ve heard from family, friends, and clients that Patreon is a fantastic way to fund any project, so we\u0027re giving it a try!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow does Patreon work? Patreon works via a monthly subscription and is a way for people just like you to help BJF build a better fitness channel. Even just $1 a month will help us create the best content available for anyone who\u2019d like to get in shape. Or if you\u2019re like our namesake, cancer recovery is what you\u2019re looking for and you can find all that here through your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best part about Patreon is that you\u2019ll get fantastic rewards in return for your subscription. Patreon will help BJF continue to publish content on our YouTube channel because your patronage will allow BJF to purchase better quality cameras, better microphones, better software for production, and everything else that goes into creating high-quality videos. Patreon is an effortless way for you to contribute monthly as BJF releases videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Your Money Helps BJF Do:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur initial goal is $12,000/month. This goal, plus any additional income, will be enough to keep BJF going, indefinitely. Here are the areas of Byron James Fitness where your subscription contributes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHosting:\u003c/strong\u003e BJF needs a space and facility big enough to support all the clientele we currently train and any new clientele we obtain. Because apartment gym only have a small amount of equipment we\u0027re limited in the workouts we can show you; so hosting also includes a larger location for our YouTube Channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpecialized Training Equipment:\u003c/strong\u003e To give people the best results, we must be able to provide equipment related to their needs; 99% of our clients have very specialized needs for which BJF does not have the equipment. To fully help these clients to the best of our abilities, we need this equipment available to BJF. Your donations will help BJF provide this equipment to achieve the best results.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideography\u003c/strong\u003e: This service is a must when it comes to helping clients both in and out of the gym. There are too many \"bro-science\" tips that have hurt our clients. It\u0027s a necessity for them to have great certified information to access when they\u2019re performing exercises on their own. To help more people, we plan to expand and continue to better this video recording withnew lenses, more videographers, various locations, travel, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContinuing Education:\u003c/strong\u003e \"You\u0027re only as strong as your weakest link\". To continue giving people better and better results, we need to reinvest into the business. That means reinvesting into education. Unfortunately, right now, there isn\u2019t enough time with all the other commitments of BJF to attend classes or certifications.  Your contributions will allow time to accomplish this goal and provide clients with the latest in health and wellness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook post \"boosts\": \u003c/strong\u003eBoosts help when we announce a new post on Facebook,  by making sure that the announcement gets onto 1/3 or 1/2 of our Facebook followers\u0027 News Feeds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFitness Apparel Line: \u003c/strong\u003eTo reach more people and continue to grow, we need to develop and create something that lasts a lifetime. An apparel line that focuses on high quality and durable athletic wear will help clients and viewers stay cool, confident, and comfortable in the gym and in everyday life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose are the basics. With those pieces covered, Byron James Fitness can continue to grow and become a self-sustaining, independent company with all the tools needed to support our clients and provide the best in fitness and health.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
