We love our fabulous fans, and we love hearing from you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBitch Team Alpha was created by Katey Lee in April of 2014 and launched in May of 2014 with the help of Amanda, Jessica, Katie Leone, Katie Tregs, and Robin. BTA started as a network of podcasts created to carve out a space for women to talk about geeky stuff, and we began to include editorial and review content, as well as a few contributors who did not identify as female.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of 2015, Katey Lee decided to step down as Queen B to work on other projects, and now, Jessica and Katie Tregs are co-Queens. Bitch Team Alpha focuses on delivering awesome audio, video, and written content with a focus on pop culture, gaming, and fun nerdy things from a feminist perspective for everyone to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe pay all of the costs of website hosting, equipment, etc. out of pocket, and we\u0027re hoping you\u0027re willing to help us with some of that if you love our content! Our first goal focuses on getting us to a point where we\u0027re not paying the monthly upkeep costs of BTA out of pocket; after that, we focus on how we can improve our content and get our awesome fans some fabulous swag! If we can, we\u0027d like to be able to pay our contributors for their hard work, which will also help us bring in more contributors--which will mean more awesome content for you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love being bitches, and we hope you love it, too!"
