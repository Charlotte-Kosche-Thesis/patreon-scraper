    "summary": "How do Bodhi Path Buddhist centers, based on a 900-year-old Buddhist lineage, blast into the future with streamed classes? We plan on doing it with the same standards of quality and authenticity that our students have experienced in the past, and the sense of community that our centers have always sought to engender. Enter the Bodhi Path Online Content Initiative (BPOCI). Still, it takes a bit of thinking, experimenting, wiggling, waggling, and yes, some expenditure. That was when one of our devoted students thought about using the Patreon platform that we are now on, as a vehicle to collect financial support for this initiative. It doesn\u0027t take much; even a modest, monthly recurring donation will make a difference to us, between being able to sustain streaming Bodhi Path content or not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe impact that the Bodhi Path streamed classes can make is tremendous. Although we have many physical centers where students receive live teachings from our esteemed teachers, with this online channel we are better able to share content of all of our different teachers across the whole community. In addition, there is a whole segment, including some who are already connected to Bodhi Path, who do not live near our centers. For example, the Bodhi Path Virtual Center (BPVC) and its email list has been one avenue for students to stay informed of online programming. With your monthly gift, you are making it possible for these people to hear the teachings, and even participate in Q\u0026amp;A sessions. We wish you could hear the many who say, \"\u003cstrong\u003ethank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for participating in this initiative: as a teacher, as a viewer, as a financial supporter, as a resource for technology know-how, or however you participate. And may we express gratitude to all the\u00a0genuine supporters for helping us get the word out. We really appreciate it! Our plan is to post timely news about upcoming online class series from our teachers and special one-time live lectures, as well as post interesting, sometimes rare, videos, right here for our patrons to experience. Keep in touch!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eOrganizers of the Bodhi Path Online Content Initiative (BPOCI)"
