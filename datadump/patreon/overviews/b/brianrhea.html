This has been my life\u0027s long ambition and I am at a place now where the opportunity to impact a much wider audience is right at my fingertips.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love sharing my perspective, it is my passion. And my favorite way to do that is through my music.\u00a0I have over 19 years of public performing experience and have made some amazing relationships along the way. I have also learned some invaluable lessons: In particular, talent alone will not support you. Your dreams CANNOT come true if you are alone. You need help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. Your support will help me to continue to make my brand of music and content for those who need a laugh, a good cry, inspiration to do something great or maybe even just dance their hind ends off. Your support will make that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e For example: It will enable me to take the music that I already have (over 200 songs) and get them professinally recorded (and in your playlists). Your support will help me pitch my music to Record companies and market my music to a wider audience. And it will help me get the equipment I need to create content and continue to play out...maybe in a town or city near you?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently write and play music full time in addition to taking care of 3 kids and two grandkids (yes Grandkids....it\u0027s a long story) but on a shoestring budget. Much of the money I have used to create content and make my music has come out of our personal funds. My family has made great sacrifices and I would like to be able to have some residual income to not have to touch our personal finances so I can use that for what it\u0027s supposed to be used for...my family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider a monthly pledge of any amount to help me continue my pursuit of making my brand of music and art. You will not be disappointed. And on behalf of Kelli, Michalea, Paige, Greyson Baylor and Easton I want to say Thank You from the bottom of my heart! Godspeed!"

     "about": "With deep musical roots that span across many genres including Gospel, R\u0026amp;B and country, Brian Rhea has been honing the craft of communicating through his music to a wide demographic of people for quite some time. From churches to street corner\u0027s, Brian has been bringing his brand of inspirational music to \"sinner\u0027s and saint\u0027s\" alike for nearly two decades.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginally from Central Florida, Brian cut his teeth on a rich heritage of Gospel music at the little country church he grew up in. After a life changing experience at 17, Brian began to sing and speak in churches all across the state of Florida which would ultimately span the nation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA singer by trade, a childhood friend and Nashville recording artist Josh Helms would later inspire him to begin to write his own songs instead of just singing other\u0027s. This would prove to be a pivotal moment in his musical journey as he began to play guitar and write his own material. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a growing catalogue of songs, Brian continues to write and share his unique perspective and is establishing himself as a south after performer. Brian currently resides in Nashville, Tennessee with his wife Kelli, daughters Michaela and Paige and son Greyson.\u003cbr\u003e",
