    "summary": "First of all, thank you for popping in and having a look. I know that there are many choices for people writing fiction and we here at me appreciate that you took a moment to look at I.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u2019m Adam. I write, or rather I used to write, fiction. I\u2019ve had a couple of starts and stops. In college I wrote a lot, started selling some stories, dropped out to become a professional writer (ignoring that even my favorite fiction authors do it on the side of the job that pays for their homes, usually as a teacher, it seems) and then got intense writers block and that was it. I got a job, joined the high paced word of moving boxes in warehouses to other places in the warehouses and then eventually into the cars of the sorts of people who purchases boxes from warehouses. Was it exciting? Absolutely. Was it fulfilling? Not really.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago my very supportive wife encouraged me to start taking classes to finally finish my degree. As a part of this I ended up taking a number of creative writing classes. This lead to me completing my first two NaNoWriMos (which, as anyone who has completed a nanowrimo knows, is not to say I completed my first two novels, just my first two parcels of 50k words on one subject) along with writing a lot of other snippets of fiction for a grade. This, along with the dangerous habit of running a MUSH, lead to my second time really writing a lot. But since then I\u2019ve had kids and gotten a much better job than box-moving (even better than box-managing, guys!) and my time to write has become limited.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I want to write. I want an excuse to write. I want a responsibility to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI primarily (I mean, honestly? only) write genre fiction. Science fiction, fantasy and fantasy\u0027s ugly child, modern fantasy. My hope is to eventually write and complete something long form, though these days I mostly write out scenes around which I might build something bigger, but have yet to do so. My hope is that I eventually get my shit together and create the connecting tissue to turn scenes into chapters into arcs into stories.\u00a0"
