The tour de force no one asked for and everyone is going to hate! Regular high school guy Chuck is finally going to have sex with his new girlfriend Becky, a cult survivor and general ing\u00e9nue. He\u0027s planned it all out for their camping trip (thanks, Goblinboy!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBUT! OH NO!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the way, the blooming couple become entangled with the former King and Queen of their high school, graduated and out on a epic tear of indiscriminate sexual aggression. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan Chuck squash the undeniable attraction Becky has for these feral, possibly enlightened, sexual demigods? ... Probably not! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill he get into a series of farcical sexual mishaps trying? Count on it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll you have to do is download the file, prepare to feel happy for a bit and then sad for a while, and then just click and click and click! \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e-\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBad Luck Chuck\u003c/strong\u003e is an adult visual novel with both branching narrative paths and an underlying point system that informs the reactions of others to the choices you make. The game is programmed in Renpy and the sprites, backgrounds, and renders are all done in Daz3D studio.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I\u0027ve watched the western adult-game scene grow these last few years, I have been disappointed at times by render quality, writing quality, and buffet-style focus on fetishes, which are put on display but rarely ever explored in any depth. The goal for Bad Luck Chuck is tell one story with a clear focus and to execute the telling and presentation of that story as best as possible. This will not be a game that seeks to please everyone and I cannot stress enough that while I appreciate any tips/funding that people may wish to give, this is not a transaction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not selling anyone a game. I am just making a thing for my own enjoyment because why not make the game you always wanted to play if you have the capability to do so? If you wish to make that process easier because you enjoy or respect the work, by all means do so... but if I do this whole Patreon thing right, the end product will look the same regardless, just maybe faster.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut seriously, thank you for everything and anything you happen to be kind enough to pledge. I\u0027ve laid out some goals and rewards. They are tentative and if they do not function as intended, I will do my very best to make changes in order to accommodate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy watchwords as a \"developer\" are \u003cstrong\u003etransparency\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003ehonesty\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eautonomy\u003c/strong\u003e. I know what I\u0027m doing and why I\u0027m doing it. I will never pretend to be anything else. I will work with as much diligence as my life reasonably allows and will do my best to touch base with patrons on this blog to feature, workshop, explain, and tease progress and releases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBad Luck Chuck Demo (v.0.0.2)\u003cbr\u003ePC\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mega.nz/#!6R5EQSiK!wf-Nc0C-6wB6VLkLV8f50bh3erEyprHq2OsZxN5mOoY\"\u003ehttps://mega.nz/#!6R5EQSiK!wf-Nc0C-6wB6VLkLV8f50bh3erEyprHq2OsZxN5mOoY\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMac\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mega.nz/#!mcQwxA5D!FhvICnIl_Mgate2OcN4FRlY8gsgI-Nq1_wjQUrwg3v8\"\u003ehttps://mega.nz/#!mcQwxA5D!FhvICnIl_Mgate2OcN4FRlY8gsgI-Nq1_wjQUrwg3v8\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
