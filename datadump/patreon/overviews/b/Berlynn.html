I have quite an unhealthy obsession with true crime and would give both my legs for some really good pizza. Oh, I also love animals, play music and am quite terrible at talking about myself. That being said, let\u0027s jump on into it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/10981911_1605006996404885_4426684805127320505_n.jpg?oh=ae4d14214ea4f4bcc738c1b3ee39a6ec\u0026amp;oe=5A370867\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been a performing artist for years. Since I was eight years old and involved in local theater, all the way through high school as a drama club member. (Yeeeeeah, I was THAT kind of nerd.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd in the course of the last three (almost four) years now, I\u0027ve been quite involved with several other musical acts in Scranton, PA\u0027s local musician scene.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough faults of my own (and some fall outs with others), I became completely alone in the realm of doing the one thing I totally am passionate about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I had to take it upon myself to teach myself how to play an instrument and sing totally original songs (\u0027cause, like, covers are fun but my ego says I need to make my own tunes.. -inserteyeroll- I know. I know.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/19756598_2023907794503922_3000854174259401556_n.jpg?oh=c5fd615177cc803e55aad357103b2b33\u0026amp;oe=59ED6F33\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I did. It took me a year and a half to be decent enough at a guitar to be able to sing and play at the same time. And now here I am. I play as often as I can and for as big or as little as a crowd I can. The number of people in an audience doesn\u0027t really affect how I play. I\u0027m just glad to be on a stage.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo YOU (if you are still reading this) are probably wondering why I exactly set up a patreon page. Long answer, short: I\u0027m broke. Artist lifestyle really doesn\u0027t pay. I know -SHOCKHORROR- -le gasp- -faint-.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-cough-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEh.. yeah, anyway, I made this to help with the extra little stuff. Gas money to get to shows. Saving up enough dollah dollahs to buy merch for my more loyal fans. I want to travel further than my home town. (I guess that ties into gas, but whatever.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy biggest goal for the end of this year is to get an EP out. Just four songs, fully recorded with backing instrumentalists, totally mastered and printed. I want to use this money I gather to employ other local artists and to give them support in their own thing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t need to make it big. I just want to know that I can do something.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you have any belief or any pity or whatever may inspire you to help out a soul like me, I do have a rewards tier set up. You\u0027re certainly welcome to take a gander. But if it all comes down to only a dollar \u00a0donation per person, that\u0027s more than I could ever expect from anyone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks a million for taking the time to read this. \u0026lt;3\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Ber Lynn\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/20429995_1882084468779213_2298185010626163950_n.jpg?oh=81eef478938a50adf9fef1a76dc0b659\u0026amp;oe=5A187A84\"\u003e"
