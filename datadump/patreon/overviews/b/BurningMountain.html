Yup, we are a husband/wife team!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur style of fight choreography is a bit different from much of what you see out there. We\u0027re primarily fight directors for stage\u00a0where the actors perform all of their fights, so safety is our first concern at all times. This is different from stunt work for film where you can bring in a specialist to take calculated risks instead of your actor. Having studied Eastern martial arts in our teens, we gravitated towards martial viability in our scene work. This means that the fights are based on what COULD happen, and are not simply a series of drills and cool moves strung together. Over the last 10 years we\u2019ve added various Western and European martial arts to our studies. We endeavor to create fights that are an exciting blend of storytelling and accurate fight technique, while maintaining the utmost safety for the performers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s surprising to us how many people don\u2019t realize that fight directing is a specialty, or that you can make fight scenes without having to injure people!
