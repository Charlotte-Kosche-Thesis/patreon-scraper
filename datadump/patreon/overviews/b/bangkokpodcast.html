    "summary": "The Bangkok Podcast first came online in 2010, hosted by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/anthony.joh\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTony Joh\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.gregtodiffer.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGreg Jorgensen\u003c/a\u003e. But after Greg got married and Tony left for further adventures in Japan, the show came to an end in 2013 after 76 weekly episodes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut nature abhors a vacuum, and people were still downloading old episodes. A chance 2015 meeting between Greg\u00a0and O.G. podcaster\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://evoterra.com\"\u003eEvo Terra\u003c/a\u003e led to Season 2 of the Bangkok Podcast premiering in October 2016. Once again exploring the absurdities and foibles of Bangkok with love and awe, the new season ran for 72 weekly episodes, shutting down in February 2018 when Evo moved back to the USA to embrace his new role as podcaster/grandfather.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut with listenership growing and a small (but awesome, faithful, and good-looking) group of Patrons, Greg asked an old friend, Ed Knuth, to co-host Season 3. Ed agreed, and they were off! Season 3 premiered in March 2018, and is going strong, thanks to your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of that...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy We Need Your Support\u003c/h2\u003eAs you might imagine, it takes quite a bit of work to put together a weekly show - actually \u003cstrong\u003etwo\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0weekly shows, if you count the bonus episode. Planning, recording, and editing are the sexy (?) parts, but we also need to work on the website, create the graphics, do a bit of marketing, and spread the show far and wide to keep growing our audience. We also need to maintain and upgrade our equipment, improve our recording spaces, and start doing more live, interactive episodes. All those things take money. And that\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth of us love podcasting about expat life in Bangkok, and we hate it (loathe is a good word) when the podcasts we listen to are jammed full of ads and promotions. We don\u0027t want to do that to you, and that\u0027s why we\u0027ve decided to use Patreon. Your financial support -- only a buck or so a month -- really makes a difference and can help us continue to explore the weird and wonderful things about living in The Big Mango.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to give us $1 a month, that\u0027s fine. $100 a month, we\u0027ll certainly encourage that, but honestly, any amount is greatly appreciated. The more you give, the more you get, and we\u0027ve come up with some pretty cool extra swag and content, which we think you\u0027ll dig.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut most of all, thanks so much for listening to the Bangkok Podcast. We hope you love listening to it as much as we love making it. \u003cbr\u003e"
