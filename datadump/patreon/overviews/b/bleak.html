    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003ehey all! i am currently safely housed for the time being, but still not getting enough money to be able to pay for moving or monthly expenses such as food, toiletries \u0026amp;c, let alone be able to save up for an emergency, disaster, or sudden medical expense that me or those i\u0027m close to might incur. in addition, should i need to secure housing in the near future i\u0027m still making far too little to reliably pay for that. at the cost of personal comfort and perhaps safety, i set aside a lot of these funds to support those in need around me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei need patreon to get by because i\u0027m currently waiting for my disability claim to process, which i have been doing for *three years*. initial application, denial, appeal, denial of that appeal, and now i am at the point of needing to go to a hearing before a judge so i can get this cleared up. god only knows when that day will come, so i need some help in the meantime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei\u0027m struggling to reach my original goal of $300 a month, which to be honest is probably still going to leave me in a situation where i have to choose between necessities each month. i don\u0027t deserve that. today i\u0027ve been sitting in my bedroom for six hours waiting for the energy required to *eat breakfast*.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eif you don\u0027t feel comfortable or able to provide a recurring monthly expense via patreon, you can contribute in other ways -\u00a0\u003cbr\u003emy wishlist has the most pressing needs on it and is generally a good indicator of where my patreon money goes.\u003cbr\u003ewishlist:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/1H17HRRTRLVUP/ref=cm_wl_huc_view\"\u003ehttps://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/1H17HR...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003epaypal: \u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/bleaky\"\u003ehttps://www.paypal.me/bleaky\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eyou can also share these links, and/or vouch for me and what i am doing, why i am doing it. essentially, selling myself by persuading people to contribute to my continued existence isn\u0027t really something i have the inclination, ability, or resources to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGOALS\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003enow that i\u0027ve got that out of the way, let me tell you a little about my goals and dreams. what i want for myself isn\u0027t really important. i have desires of my own, of course, but i\u0027ve lived so long unable to indulge them that i don\u0027t see them as relevant. the short term plan is to remain in the bay area until the disability process finalizes, at which point it\u0027ll be harder for me to be financially attached to any place. as that\u0027s happening, and as circumstances permit, i\u0027m teaching myself linux, and once i\u0027m done with that i\u0027ll learn network topography, protocols, that whole area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethe next goal out from that is getting one or more security certifications, which will pave the road to starting an infosec career. if i can earn enough money off of that i can start an infosec/networking worker\u0027s co-op with the aim of equipping people with the tools or skills to make and maintain their own public or private networks, and i\u0027ll also use that opportunity to proselytize mesh networks. creating new avenues to pay people in the community is a really nice bonus to this as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewithout going into minute technical detail, a mesh network is essentially democratized internet. our internet is currently routed through several very thick bundles of wire right now, and a mesh network does away with that. meaning, ideally, no more ISPs, no more wondering if your connecction is private enough, and no subscription fees. with this technology in place, one could easily create a free and widely accessible central repository for resources and information. contact directories for services, for a start: housing, food, healthcare, legal aid, you name it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ein particular i see a pressing need for such a central repository for trans healthcare and other related topics, and that is the driving force behind these plans as described here. a meshnet can integrate with the regular internet by piggybacking atop it, but not only that, it can leapfrog it entirely. i fully don\u0027t expect that to happen, but it\u0027s a nice thought anyway. i\u0027ve grander plans but they lack feasibility.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003euntil i can position myself toward those goals i\u0027m working with local community/political orgs and structures to support and strengthen my community\u0027s ability to thrive, prevent or mitigate incidences of state violence, and have our political voices be heard. statecraft and political actions are only a couple aspects of how i\u0027m working towards this but i\u0027m only one (heavily disabled) body with limited resources, and activism doesn\u0027t pay the bills. that\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTRANSPARENCY:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eso, here\u0027s what\u0027s happening with your money. it is going to feed, house, clothe, teach me, as well as help me to remain web connected. it will keep me safe, or safer, at least. i\u0027ve found it\u0027s nearly all i can do to convalesce from the fresh traumas arising and still manage to take a shower often enough to resemble humanity. it will provide tools and supplies to me and the people i work with in order to provide and protect where the state fails and exercises malice and neglect. on top of enabling me personally to pursue my goals, it will enable us, collectively, to pursue our goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewhile i\u0027m doing the above work i\u0027m free to explore my hobbies, which are studying critical theory and working with audio- music, editing, and some voice work even, various and spontaneous art projects as the spirit moves me. i also plan to teach myself python, not with any particular project in mind, but i\u0027d like to be able to make my own tools at some point. all this stuff will be freely available, and it is so far, though all i\u0027ve really put out besides a stray academic-sounding thought are a handful of lugubrious ambient selections, a short twine, and of course all the stuff i mentioned in the paragraphs above.\u003cbr\u003e"
