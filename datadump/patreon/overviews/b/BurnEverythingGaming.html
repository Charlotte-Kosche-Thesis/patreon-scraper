We also would like people to enjoy these adventures. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently we are putting out 1 episode about every week:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://burneverythinggaming.podbean.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://burneverythinggaming.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven with this one adventure it still costs money. Helping cover the costs of websites would be great. It can ensure that we keep putting out content that people really like. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe would really like to make more exciting adventures and even show off new RPG systems for people. The more you donate the more adventures we can produce and the more systems we can try out and our listeners can get a better idea about systems before having to invest.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe editing that has to take place for each episode is very time consuming. We like to make sure our episodes have good background music/noises/ambiance to help immerse listeners into the world. We think this helps make a great adventure even better. To ensure our listeners get a good experience we have put extra time and effort into this cause.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more ways we can help bring these stories to life to better, and a good way to do that is to bring on artist. And artists time is expensive, and it should be, and donating can help us get some really great artist to add more life to our stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, getting people free at the same time can be complicated. There are many things happening in real life that can keep us from making a good adventure. With your help we can take care of real life situations like getting baby sitters, not having to work that extra 2nd shift, etc. With these things covered we can bring our listeners even more adventures and added bonuses. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to help us make more exciting adventures just send us ALL THE MONEY. You can\u0027t do ALL THE MONEY? Okay, how about some of it so we can at least cover the cost of internetting, recording, eating, sleeping, and all those other important things. \u003cbr\u003e"
