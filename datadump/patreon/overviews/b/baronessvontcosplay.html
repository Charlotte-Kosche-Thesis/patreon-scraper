Because of my background with makeup, a lot of my cosplays involve intricate makeup looks!\u003cbr\u003eI specialize in horror/gore type special effects. Zombies, blood \u0026amp; guts, the works! I also love to create Glam/Gore looks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/h4zmGJ7.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been cosplaying since 2013!
