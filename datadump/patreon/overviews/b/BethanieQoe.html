Specifically for kids going through chemo. For a few years now I\nhave knitted hats (hundreds of hats) and sent them to a charity called \u0027Commonwealth\nCares\u0027. The above picture features some of the hats I\u0027ve designed and delivered. I relied on my own stash, my own extra cash, as well\ndonated materials and monies from friends and family to keep me afloat. Now I\u0027d\nlike to expand and offer my abilities to other charities. However, I\u0027m outta\ncash and outta stash and I think it may be time to reach outside of my circle to ask for help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here I am. I will still accept natural fibre yarns and whatnot from folks who would rather go that route as I\u0027ve always done, but overall I am hoping that this venture will allow me to provide for more people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this works, I will chronicle my progress and the products of everyone\u0027s generosity and efforts here and at my tumblr\u00a0 page: \u003ca href=\"http://bnpqoe.tumblr.com/art\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://bnpqoe.tumblr.com/art\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
