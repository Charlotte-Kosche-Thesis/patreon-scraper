     "about": "Hi there!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m BLAZE AUDIO , the person responsible for most of the Eminem \u0026amp; Linkin Park mash-ups, that you\u0027ve heard as of late on YouTube and such: i.e \"Collision Course 2, After Collision, Collision Course 3 and After Collision 2, etc\".\u003cbr\u003eI started out on YouTube in 2007, doing fan-made videos to my favorite songs in windows movie maker and throughout the years I gradually drifted more and more towards audio editing. Thus in 2012, I released my first mash up project that featured two of my favorite artists. My only goal at the time was to just have fun and do the best I could. The reception I received from it was astonishing, so I just kept going over the years and started making more and more mash ups and even learned how to produce my own music to accompany those projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can imagine, almost all of my work is non-profit due to the nature of the projects. I never aimed to get a money out of this, but the amount of time and effort I have been putting into what I do, has had me stretched quite thin. I\u0027m not saying I\u0027m entitled to anything, but it would be nice to receive at least something as sort of reward. No matter how small. Just to keep me motivated and so that I know that I am not doing this in vain.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you to everyone who\u0027s visited my page and checked out my projects. I hope you enjoy my work.\u003cbr\u003e",
