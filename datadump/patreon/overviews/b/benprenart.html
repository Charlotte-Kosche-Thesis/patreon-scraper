I have been a comic book colorist and production artist for nearly 20 years! \u00a0Throughout the years of working on many amazing projects and with many highly skilled and talented people I have found that I am a creator at heart and I need to make my own worlds and characters to share with you! \u00a0The doorway that I have left sealed and that I have feared for so long is now open!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 242, 202);\"\u003eMy first creator-owned comic book series!\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nThe first book I am sharing with you here on Patreon is a middle-ages, fantasy story. \u00a0It is a mature, drama-adventure set in a fantasy world. My book is currently in early development and I would love to have you follow along and play an important part as my patron while I create my books from concept to completion and of course \n\u003cstrong\u003eread\u003c/strong\u003e the book as I share pages with the Patreon community! \u00a0Watching me at each step, from thumbnails to final pages, will be like a \u003cstrong\u003ehow-to course in creating a comic.\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0Everything in the book I am doing myself; the writing, concept art, storyboards, pencilling, coloring, lettering, and packaging for print and web. \u00a0I also plan to commission my professional artist friends to make bonus pinup art and alternate covers. I very much \u003cstrong\u003eencourage fan art\u003c/strong\u003e of my creations and will share it here and on my other social media accounts linking back to you. \u00a0I always welcome any questions, comments and discussions and if I have any helpful advice to give I am happy to share it with you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not only create comic book art. \u00a0Most may actually know me from my portrait illustrations and paintings and I will love to share my portrait process and final pieces here on Patreon as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 242, 202);\"\u003eThank you!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nBuilding this community on Patreon will, I hope, allow me to chase down and catch my dream of creating my own books and artwork full time. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThank you from the bottom of my heart \u0026lt;3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides being an artist, I also really love cycling *really love*! \u00a0Road bikes, mountain bikes, cruisers, single speeds, all of it! \u00a0And oh yes, I have a fairly severe croissant addiction!? ;) \u003cbr\u003e"
