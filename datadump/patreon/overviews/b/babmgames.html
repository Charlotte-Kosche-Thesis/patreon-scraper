    "summary": "Hey there! My name is \u003cstrong\u003eBen McMullen \u003c/strong\u003eand I like games. I \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e like games. I also really like making me some games. A little while ago I decided that maybe I should start sharing these games I make and see if other people like playing the things I make as much as I like making them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTabletop RPGs are my \u003cstrong\u003ebread and butter\u003c/strong\u003e, and I have a very long history with them. I\u0027ve been playing them since I was 6 years old, starting with AD\u0026amp;D (I\u0027m a late twenty-something, in case you\u0027re wondering). I\u0027ve grown up with RPGs and watched the industry grow up- a hell of a lot- with me. We have so many awesome, experimental, and creative systems these days that it\u0027s honestly a little intimidating to try to break into the industry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I still feel like I have something to add, and hopefully you think I do too. Read through what I\u0027ve got up for sampling, and see if you\u0027re interested in buying into my projects. I promise to assiduously and diligently work to bring you the best settings, lore, crunchy core rule sets, and delicious splatbooks I can for these mad, mad worlds I\u0027ve been creating for the past twenty years of my life. \u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much\u003c/strong\u003e for dropping by and taking a look. Even if you can\u0027t contribute, it\u0027s just great to have you here."
