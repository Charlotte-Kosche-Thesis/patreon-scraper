    "summary": "Hello. \u00a0My name is Steven Doughty and I make videos on YouTube as ballerscuba. \u00a0I make Let\u0027s Plays, primarily focused on RPGs and 100% completion, although I have played several genres throughout the years. \u00a0Publishing two or three videos a day, my channel has become an archive of completed Let\u0027s Plays with a wide range of completed games. \u00a0Ranging from RPGs like the Final Fantasy and Elder Scrolls franchise to RTS games like Warcraft and Starcraft to platformers, classics, and newer indie titles, I am always on the look out for interesting games with compelling stories, unique gameplay, and games that have influenced the industry throughout the decades.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have come to Patreon because of my desire to expand. \u00a0On top of the normal gameplay videos, it is my desire to also take the time to start doing streams of games that don\u0027t necessarily work as well as Let\u0027s Plays (i.e. SimCity and Civilization), vlogging about things that are happening in my real life, and starting a podcast where I delve into the deeper topics of nerd culture, gaming, and life in general. \u00a0Due to the time investment and additional expenses involved in getting these other forms of content out on a consistent basis, Patreon seems the best option to make these things happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that said, I have no plans of making content exclusive to YouTube. \u00a0Patreon will be a way to help me create content, but will not be a platform for my content. \u00a0My content is free for everyone to enjoy and will remain that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank my fans and viewers deeply for all the support they have shown me throughout the years. \u00a0Whether you are able and willing to contribute or not, I hope that you will continue to enjoy the videos that I am able to make. \u00a0Without the people that have supported me, I would not have been able to produce all the videos that are on my channel. \u00a0Thank you."
