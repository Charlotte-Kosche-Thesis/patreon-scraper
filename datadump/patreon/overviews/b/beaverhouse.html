It\u0027s a headset microphone, the headphones don\u0027t work, I have to wear earbuds underneath them and they block out the sound of my own voice in my head so they\u0027re really uncomfortable to talk while wearing. The casing on the right side of my headset is actually physically collapsing and I\u0027m afraid that might stress the wiring and damage the microphone. This thing isn\u0027t going to last for long. I think I must have sat on this at some point. For now, I need to just quickly buy the cheapest replacement I can so I can simply continue being part of the show, but there will be a later goal to upgrade to a higher end microphone that won\u0027t break when I sit on it. It might not even break when I throw it at other cats. Meow. :3",

My microphone troubles were obvious, less obvious is Joe. He sounds completely different on every microphone he uses, clearly somethings up there.
