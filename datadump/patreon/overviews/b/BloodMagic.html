WayofTime here, to tell you all about my new Patreon campaign!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you all probably know, Patreon is pretty much like a constant kick-starter campaign designed to help content creators focus on what they love to do while allowing them to accept donations from those that love their work. It allows the creator of the content to keep something truly free while still getting a nice payday at the end of the month! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am WayofTime,\u00a0the developer for the Minecraft mod, \u003ca href=\"http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1899223-\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBlood Magic\u003c/a\u003e. Blood Magic focuses on using a player\u0027s or entity\u0027s life essence to fuel an arcane magic that increases the user\u0027s power dramatically. It aims to make sure that the player has the most amount of fun possible while maintaining a constant feel of balance. What I bring to the table is over 2 years of Minecraft modded adventure experience and a year under my belt of modding itself - since a lot of modders started coding without having a thorough experience in actually playing the game. I know what is fun for the player mainly because I know it\u0027s fun for me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest not to just take my word for it, however, since I only wish for you to donate if you want to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will you get in return, though? That\u0027s a good question! All of the rewards are listed to the side and below, however some gifts shall include things like early Beta access to the mod, a group chat once a week, and even items or rituals named after the donator! \"Global\" milestones will also include stuff like myself streaming on the Forgecraft 2 server every week for an appreciable amount of time, and maybe even create a few Youtube videos for those that wish to view them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I hope that Blood Magic shall continue for a long time! The mod shall forever be free, even if no one donates at all, but your contribution would be very much appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e"
