Yes, like the animal, the buzz one. That\u0027s me. I am a 20 year old Southern California cosplayer who resides in San Diego. I am a full-time Theatre Arts student, specializing in Costume Design! Woo! I also work full-time as a hostess, cause, y\u0027know, gotta make that monaaaayyyy so I can pay my rent and eat food. Cosplaying and art are my two hobbies that I stick my entire heart into. It\u0027s such a beautiful feeling, being able to bring a character you love/relate to/feel for to life, being able to express how you feel through a canvas, or on paper, or even on your body (I like to draw on myself and pretend I can get tattoos, which I can not. Thank you genetics). As a lover of many things, I love to dabble in anime, Disney, Pok\u00e9mon, video games (mainly MMORPGs, I suck at everything else, but I try anyways~), cartoons, more Pok\u00e9mon, and all that good stuff!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14359260_332063097145814_3157239353448768886_n.jpg?oh=cc3f81a4d560fd1478f387111a7bb3dc\u0026amp;oe=586CC726\" style=\"width: 132px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14355735_332063083812482_2579839650687270072_n.jpg?oh=a84ed21b8355a579b8df7cceda375ccb\u0026amp;oe=586A4BF6\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo... Why Cosplay/Drawing/Artsy Fartsy things???\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWell, I have technically been going to con (singular, because it was just Anime Expo for one day every year) since 2011. I saw people in costumes, and I got soooooooo excited, because I love Halloween and dressing up and stuff. Fun fact, and I joke about it with my mother to this day, I blame my mom for my cosplay addiction because she would not let me dress up and wear my costumes to Disneyland like the other kids. ANYWAYS, starting in 2014, I really broke out and started officially cosplaying, and I have never looked back because I have never had this much fun doing anything else before! Arts/drawings/farts have always been a past time of mine, and I always have a sketch book with me on hand. When i\u0027m bored, I doodle. When I hate listening to lectures at school, I doodle. When i\u0027m asleep, I dream about things that I doodle in the morning. Most of my doodles turn into crafts, such as my Pok\u00e9Cubes and Pok\u00e9Sacks (pictured below). Sadly, I\u00a0have not given as much love to my arts and crafts like I have my cosplays, BUT WE ARE GONNA CHANGE THAT WITH ALL THE COOL ART PRIZES YOU CAN GET. OHHHH YEAAAA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14370338_332086853810105_5554145215567218563_n.jpg?oh=7321ea2de3a86f4675746776e1838809\u0026amp;oe=587ABB58\" style=\"width: 144px;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14369993_332087017143422_4290802262847847115_n.jpg?oh=b3e2b4e058b431229cb1a966df74cfec\u0026amp;oe=588170DF\" style=\"width: 212px;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14358642_332086883810102_866649512355106819_n.jpg?oh=4230ac2f20d2fd35647acafd80f07808\u0026amp;oe=58746BD7\" style=\"width: 141px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eOkay You\u0027re Kinda Cool...

HOWEVER, if you do become a patron, you will receive prints of exclusive Patreon photoshoots, art prints, Pok\u00e9Sacks, Cubes, stickers, and anything I can think of! You will also have access to my Patron-Exclusive feed, behind the scenes tours, tutorials, exclusive sneak peeks at costume renderings, even google hangout chats!\u003cbr\u003eI will be making a theme for each month, so no month will be alike!
