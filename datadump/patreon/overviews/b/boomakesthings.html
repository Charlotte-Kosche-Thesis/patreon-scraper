While I make some money from selling the physical products, I would like to spend more time and money on things like digital content, which requires a decent camera for starters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking new products is much more satisfying than remaking the same things over and over again to replenish stock, both for myself and for my followers. However, it takes a lot more time (as I create the patterns myself) and is more financially risky. Relieving a small amount of the pressure there would give me more room to explore my creative potential. I want to keep doing this for as long as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of all that, knowing that people like my work and want to support me is an *excellent* motivator!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Patreon is set up on a pay per month basis so whatever tier you pick that\u2019s the maximum you\u2019ll pay for the whole month. Rewards start with access to exclusive Patreon-only content and go all the way up to a personal Skype chat with me where I can express my gratitude and talk everything crochet, or whatever you want! Middle tiers also include random surprise handmade items delivered to your door every month so it\u2019s like having 12 birthdays a year!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQs\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is like an ongoing kickstarter. You can choose to contribute a set monthly amount and in return for supporting me in my craft I will send you exclusive content and even surprise handmade items every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are! I would not be able to continue making things like I do without the consistent support of people like you. Anything you contribute is extremely gratefully received and used to purchase materials and cover costs so that I can keep making awesome things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I get my item(s)?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll you need to do is pick the reward tier that corresponds to the type of item you want. Unfortunately this isn\u0027t currently offered if you are outside of the UK due to increased shipping costs. You will be prompted for your shipping address when you become a patron and then each month you will be sent your item(s)!"
