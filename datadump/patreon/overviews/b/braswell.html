    "summary": "As an author of fiction and non-fiction books,\u00a0my\u00a0primary cash\u00a0expense\u00a0is printing, followed by marketing, distribution, and public relations.\u00a0For projects where I am the\u00a0publisher and not the author, some of the current difficulties with my business plan\u00a0can be\u00a0mitigated. So,\u00a0potential clients who are interested in publishing through Braswell Communications\u00a0are as important as investors; In\u00a0such\u00a0instances,\u00a0extra capital, if there were any,\u00a0would be rerouted to marketing/distribution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015,\u00a0Braswell Communications Inc.\u00a0published two\u00a0in-house novels, one\u00a0in-house non-fiction book, and a book\u00a0project\u00a0submitted by a\u00a0third-party client. Currently, there are two more in-house novels in pre-production, and an additional third-party manuscript on my desk. As general rule of thumb,\u00a0as a small publishing house increases its\u00a0title count, larger distributors take more of an interest in direct business relationships.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGenerally, my effort here is to protect my ability to keep functioning as a publisher and content carrier while increasing\u00a0the archive\u00a0of both my\u00a0own intellectual property as well as the number of titles published by\u00a0my company. At this time, I remain the only member of Braswell Communications\u0027 staff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe audio programming effort (The Odelay Show) is far\u00a0less cost intensive as the equipment is already in-house, and there are no third-party necessities such as\u00a0a printer. It is\u00a0mainly a matter of\u00a0making the time to\u00a0find and schedule guests, prepare and\u00a0record the interviews or editorials, and post the digital content. I would\u00a0need to publish\u00a0at least one program per week for a period of six months, for example, in order to be considered for syndication\u00a0by the gatekeeper of\u00a0one particular online community for example; I am\u00a0increasing efforts\u00a0at finding good\u00a0interview subjects, which\u00a0has proven to\u00a0be challenging at times. Historically, I have not let such \"quotas\" govern the frequency with which\u00a0The Odelay Show runs at the expense of content quality and\u00a0novelness.\u00a0The show\u00a0is a potential revenue vector as well, although I have only been giving it away so far (both content and advertising carriage). I do have a proper journalist\u0027s credential and large body of written work therewith.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAppearing at Pennies Thrift \u0026amp; Gift, 5237 S. Highway 92, Sierra Vista, Arizona, on December 19.\u003cbr\u003eAppearing at Hastings Entertainment, 3758 E. Fry Blvd., Sierra Vista, Arizona, on January 23.\u003cbr\u003e"
