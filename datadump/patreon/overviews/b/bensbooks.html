     "about": "\u003cstrong\u003eI was born in Reading, England, and struggled through school academically. I was diagnosed with dyslexia at an early age, which meant being removed from class to attend \u2018remedial\u201d lessons. As a child,\u00a0I did not enjoy reading or\u00a0writing and left school fifteen to work with my father as a builder. It wasn\u2019t until my mid-twenties that I persisted in teaching myself to read \u2014 and finally read my first novel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI emigrated to Perth, Western Australia in 1990, where I now live\u00a0with my wife, Michelle, and our two adult children, Chelsea and Zac.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo pass the hours working as a bricklayer,\u00a0I would think about writing a novel. However, it took me many years to pluck up the courage to turn my dreams into words. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dyslexia, combined with my informal knowledge of the English language and grammar, made my first book a real challenge. Luckily, I had plenty of people around me to help with my journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy love of scientific facts, futuristic possibilities, and fast-paced action infected my plots and writing style. I thoroughly enjoy pushing myself creatively, which means venturing into many types of storytelling. As a consequence, my\u00a0catalog is a mixture of sci-fi, speculative, and horror fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e",
