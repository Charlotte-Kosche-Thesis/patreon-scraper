    "summary": "Heya! Erika here. \u003cstrong\u003eBristol Video Games Social\u003c/strong\u003e is a free, regular get-together to meet people and play great games, and is open to all. It seemed that local multiplayer games were dying out over the past few years in favour of online multiplayer and single player campaigns, but thanks to a number of dedicated indie developers we\u0027ve seen a resurgence in games that are accessible, simple and downright fun that you can all play together on the sofa (or table, floor or whatever works for you).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince July 2014, our community has let people get hands-on with the best multiplayer games of the past and present, as well as upcoming of the new indie hotness. Since the start, the reception to our events has been overwhelmingly positive, and now that I\u0027m no longer supporting the costs of running these free events by my salary, I\u0027d like BVGS to continue being free of sponsors and adverts, so I\u0027d like to ask that you keep us going by contributing yourself - as much or as little as you\u0027d like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis Patreon is for supporting our main video games events, up to twice per month\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll have plenty more going on outside of those, though! Your donations will go to the following, roughly in order of priority:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eVenue/setup costs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGames!

To date, we\u0027ve hosted the developers of Friendship Club, Sky Scrappers, Gang Beasts and Codex Bash and let the audience be the first ever to out brand new, unreleased builds of their games. I\u0027d like to continue giving indie developers the chance to show off their latest multiplayer game and give their games the word-of-mouth publicity needed to get their game out into the world. To give you an idea of the kinds of games played, here are some of the games we\u0027ve had so far, from sole indie developers to AAA smash hits:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eStreet Fighter II -- Divekick -- Barabariball -- Hokra -- Saturn Bomberman -- Geometry Wars 2 -- Super Smash Bros Melee/Wii U/3DS -- Super Mario Kart -- Mario Kart 8 -- Lethal League -- Nidhogg -- Samurai Gunn -- Towerfall: Ascension -- Super Bomberman -- Timmy Bibble\u0027s Friendship Club -- Codex Bash -- Street Fighter IV -- Windjammers -- Metal Slug -- Micro Machines V3 -- Mount Your Friends -- Gang Beasts -- Jackbox -- Johann Sebastian Joust -- Super Pole Riders -- N+ -- N++ -- Broforce -- Sky Scrappers -- Skullgirls -- Trials Evolution -- Rocket League\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to become a BVGS patron, you\u0027ll get (along with a ridiculous amount of gratitude) a regular update giving you the lowdown on future events before they\u0027re announced!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/nHT0kGF.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eJohann Sebastian Joust, Goldeneye 64, Mario Kart 8\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU! \u0026lt;3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
