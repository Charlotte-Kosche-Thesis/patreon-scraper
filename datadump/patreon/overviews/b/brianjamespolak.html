    "summary": "In the history of \u003cstrong\u003eart\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003earts\u003c/strong\u003e patronage referred to the support that kings, popes and the wealthy provided to artists such as musicians, painters, and sculptors... and playwrights. This provided artists with the financial support they needed to do their thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat was history. The times we live in now are quite different...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is great:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI find this Patreon thing to be a pretty cool experiment in supporting the artists in our lives. You may not have the opportunity to support me in person because you live so far away, but now you have the chance to support from a distance. Perhaps somebody out there has discretionary income and is looking to use it to support the arts. You\u0027ve always had the opportunity to make a donation and help sustain an institution, and now you can make a donation to help sustain an artist directly. That\u0027s pretty great for us artists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe arts, I believe, are what make our little planet worth living on.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost people know writing plays is not a way to pay the bills. Most playwrights have day jobs. My day job happens to be at a non-profit theater. So, not only do I not make much $ as a writer, but I also make a fairly low salary relative to a person my age. The challenge this creates is in being as authentic and successful a writer as I can be. Oftentimes that means travel to do research, or travel to meet with other theater people with whom I hope to collaborate. I earn enough vacation time from my job to allow me the time, but I often don\u0027t have the funds. That wasn\u0027t true in my 20s, before I became a writer. I was able to travel all the time, but now that I need it as much as I want it, I can\u0027t often do it. That doesn\u0027t mean this is a Brian James Polak Travel Fund. I consider this a subsidy to ease the burden of survival. Ultimately, I made my bed full of debt and low income. So I sleep in it. I suppose it just doesn\u0027t need to be that way. What\u0027s important to me is helping those around me as much as I help myself. I can\u0027t do that with money (currently) so I do it in other ways, such as through advocacy, making connections, giving feedback, attending events, etc. I\u0027m hopeful there are others out there who share my spirit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a challenging and humbling endeavor. I hope the passive nature of a page like this, and the anonymity it allows you (if you wish) will make it less icky. It can be humiliating to ask for support. And some people feel guilted into supporting others. \u003cstrong\u003eLet there be no guilt here.\u003c/strong\u003e I will never know you even looked at this page if you never tell me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re still interested, here is some more about who I am as a writer...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Artistic Statement:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI go to the theater because I want to be moved. If something clever tickles my brain, or if I learn something new, that\u2019s gravy. I do enjoy a good intellectual exercise from time to time, but theater is an emotional place for me. That\u2019s why I write what I write. I am less inclined to write a play that yearns to be clever, provide a twist you never see coming, or teach you the way something was. I am more likely to show you the way things are from where I stand. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI find inspiration in the political, but prefer to tell stories from a micro point-of-view. I like to write about America, being an American, who and what America is to the rest of the world, but my preference is to tell the story through the eyes of the lowly and downtrodden. I love characters who want to live a happy life, but can\u0027t quite figure out how to achieve that seemingly simple goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cannot relate to people in positions of power, people who are incredibly successful, wealthy, or amazingly intelligent. So I write characters who struggle. They struggle to achieve the mythical American Dream, they struggle for unattainable greatness, they struggle for impossible love, and struggle to simply be understood. These are my struggles as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery single play I write is biographical, even when it takes place on an island 10,000 miles away, 30 years before I was even born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI measure my personal success by how high I can lift myself while simultaneously lifting others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this."

     "about": "I was born and raised in New Hampshire, that little chunk of a state shoved between Maine and Vermont. For the uninitiated, it\u2019s where aspiring presidential candidates come to campaign every four years. I grew up as a mediocre athlete sitting on the football team\u2019s bench in the autumn and pole-vaulting poorly on the track team in the spring. After coming to terms with my lack-of-athletic-prowess and graduating from high school, I went to college at Marymount University in Arlington, Virginia because 1) they accepted me and 2) I needed to get away from New Hampshire. I majored in Philosophy because I thought it sounded cool at parties. When I graduated I learned how impractical that choice was. An early life existential crisis caused me to take an acting class, which triggered a series of events that would eventually send me to Boston, enroll in improv comedy classes, and eventually become part of Improv Asylum\u2019s fledgling Touring Company.  A couple years later I helped start a theater company with some friends. I spent a few years acting in plays and improv shows only to learn I was a pretty terrible actor. It\u0027s not that I was terrible, it\u0027s that... no I was terrible. This was an important realization for me because it triggered my writing itch, which I haven\u0027t stopped scratching since. I eventually moved to Los Angeles and got my MFA from USC.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have had many jobs over the years including assembling furniture, selling foam fingers at Fenway Park, corporate training, marketing, paralegal and customer service consultant which had me traveling between Boston and Detroit a little too often for my taste. I spent many years working for a small theatre in Los Angeles before moving to Chicago and becoming the Artistic Director for Jedlicka Performing Arts Center at Morton College in Cicero, IL\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy plays include:\u00a0HENRY AND THE HIPPOCAMPUS (The Kennedy Center\u2019s Jean Kennedy Smith Award), WAR PROFITS (The Kennedy Center\u2019s John Cauble Award, Road Theatre Summer Play Festival), TALES FROM TENT CITY, inspired by the photo project \"Raised by Wolves,\" by Jim Goldberg, and many others. Several of my short plays have been published in Smith \u0026amp; Kraus anthologies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently writing: COAT OF ARMS, an investigation of Polish identity, and NASHUA, a play about the fracturing of a family (can you fracture a thing that was never whole?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMFA: University of Southern California, School of Dramatic Arts. \u003cbr\u003eHost of American Theatre Magazine\u0027s \"The Subtext,\" a podcast by/for/about playwrights and playwriting.\u003cbr\u003e",
