    "summary": "Let\u0027s be honest, it\u0027s not often you can pay credence to what a person writes about themselves on the internet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s all too easy to conjure up an idealistic version of yourself and project that onto an audience who wouldn\u0027t know any better than to take what you say at face value.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s actually why I\u0027m here.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not the person I was a year ago. In fact, I\u0027m not the person I was 6 months ago or even yesterday for that matter. And you aren\u0027t either.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery day, you learn new possibilities and develop new tendencies that constantly shape you into who you are; the person you choose to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in a future where all people are in touch with their unique self-development journies and actively pursue a life of understanding and purpose in both their professional and vocational occupations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith an unwavering desire to help people understand themselves and their goals, an unshakeable air of positivity and a no bullshit approach to the lessons I teach, I aim to inspire others into taking action and encourage those who think they can\u0027t to make the changes in their lives that I know they can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m determined to show that self-education and breaking convention is the way of the future and hope that by sharing my art, others will feel compelled to share theirs, too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why Patreon?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d be lying to you and myself if I didn\u0027t acknowledge that I thrive on instant gratification. It\u0027s something that always felt kind of wrong to me (it didn\u0027t help that I was being told \"this isn\u0027t how life works\" left, right and centre,) but I\u0027ve learned to embrace it. It\u0027s a part of who I am and it\u0027s what makes me so consistent in my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGetting a $20,000 publishing deal is great and all, but there are a few reasons why this doesn\u0027t necessarily work for me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. I have to justify the art that I create to a corporate entity that sees me as a walking bag of money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an artist/engineer (Of which we are all, both) we should not be held at the mercy of a third party. The connection economy allows for us to build meaningful relationships with our fans, followers and subscribers in a way that negates the need for anyone other than you and I to be a part of this experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. It goes against some of the core values that align with the mission statement I literally base my lifestyle around. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d be compromising my integrity if I encouraged people to live unconventionally and then preceded to live mine by the books. Pun enthusiastically intended. Here\u0027s an opportunity for me to prove that it CAN be done. You CAN find financial confidence in a way that suits you and you CAN be the person you WANT to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. It\u0027s simply not sustainable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m in this for the long-haul and the only thing that really succeeds a great book are more great books. Believe me, I love a good book but I\u0027m all about that instant gratification and that\u0027s something you just don\u0027t get from spending a year writing 300 pages of word vomit. I\u0027ve tried and, I\u0027m not ashamed to admit, I failed. How do I combat this? I write shorter, more precise and, actually, more accessible eBooks as well as daily blog posts over on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://brynsblog.com\"\u003e brynsblog.com.\u003c/a\u003e These are designed to target a specific problem that you might be experiencing and give you a range of tools to use in your efforts against them.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also believe in independence and this platform allows me to do what I do in a way that suits us both. I see it as an amazing opportunity for me to connect with the people who like what I do and it gives you guys an opportunity to support me in my mission. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s part of why I love this place so much. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re not obligated to pay me anything. In fact, most of what I do can be found for free on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://brynsblog.com\"\u003ebrynsblog.com,\u003c/a\u003e various social media accounts, Youtube and Soundcloud. If you decide you\u0027d like to change your mind, you can opt-out at any time. No hard feelings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing\u00a0is, not everyone wants to pay for art. That\u0027s fine, once it\u0027s published/shipped it\u0027s no longer my art, it\u0027s yours to take and give; to keep and share. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut for those of you that are willing to donate, it\u0027s not unreasonable for you to want to know where your money\u0027s being spent. Ideally, you want to know that your money, the money that you choose to share with me, is being used to benefit this project in a way that is evident in the quality of my work. At least that\u0027s what I would expect. After all, that\u0027s what this is all about. That\u0027s why I\u0027m so committed to creating a series of pledges that will accurately define the changes you\u0027re making to my life\u0027s project. I hope to make these pledges fair and as rewarding for you guys as much as it is for me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think it\u0027s important for me to note that this is a huge experiment. Having watched Amanda Palmers \"The Art of Asking\" I felt it appropriate to do just that but whilst I\u0027m quietly confident that this experiment will be a success, I\u0027m sure there are still plenty of lessons for me to learn. Isn\u0027t that exciting?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyone who knows me knows that I\u0027m a keen listener. I don\u0027t just listen to respond, (I hate that,) I truly listen in order to grow and develop. Even if you pledge $1, I want to know what you\u0027re loving and loathing about the work I present and the art we share. Don\u0027t hesitate to get in touch via comments here, on Twitter and Facebook, and on videos and podcasts wherever you happen to stumble on them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery single one of you is important to the community we\u0027re building and I\u0027m so grateful that you\u0027ve spent your time getting to know me and my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter how much you choose to donate, thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s prove that art is worth investing in and let\u0027s start by investing in ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e_____________________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0FAQ\u0027s (frequently asked questions)\u003cbr\u003eIf you have questions, please submit them on Twitter or Facebook or here on the patron stream once you sign up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: \"I have a question about your Patreon, who can I contact?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Any questions can be sent to bryn@bryndunwell.com and I\u0027ll personally answer any and all questions as quickly and as effectively as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: \"does Patreon accept PayPal?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: yes, PayPal is accepted!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: \" I want to join your Patreon, but I don\u0027t have any idea how much to donate. What is your recommended donation?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: That\u0027s awesome! I would invite you to join whichever pledge best suits your financial situation:generosity ratio. I would NEVER ask anyone to pay more than what they can realistically afford in order to support this project. That\u0027s why I\u0027m doing it this way instead of selling books conventionally. That\u0027s not to say real physical books will never be made, though.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: \"when are you going to put out an actual book? Call me old-fashioned but I like to have the physical product in my hands or on my bookshelf.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: I\u0027m exactly the same. There is a lot to be said for the feel of a real book and although I don\u0027t have plans to publish one yet, I\u0027m not ruling it out for the future. Whilst my books generally tend to be smaller in size, I like to think they ooze value on every page. Perhaps a series of smaller books or even a compendium? We\u0027ll see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: \"I\u0027m not sure I can commit to monthly increments. What if I just want to donate money to you once?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: That\u0027s no problem at all! Firstly, thank you! Secondly, you can donate on the store page of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://brynsblog.com\"\u003ebrynsblog.com\u003c/a\u003e OR you can e-mail bryn@bryndunwell.com and we can have a chat beforehand.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_____________________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
