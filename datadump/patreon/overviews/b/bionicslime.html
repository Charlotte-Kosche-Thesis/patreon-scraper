Now\u0027s your chance! At the highest level of donation rewards, I will review (or do another special kind of video) about the series or movie you want me to see. In regards to Anime series/Films, there are some RULES that MUST BE READ BEFORE DONATING:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e 1. The Anime series must have a dub, I am a dub reviewer and will not review an anime series/film that has not been dubbed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e2. No anime that are classified as hentai will be reviewed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e3. The requested anime CANNOT be longer than 26 episodes. I cannot handle any donation order on a series that is over 100 episodes or so UNLESS I have already seen it before or I currently own it (you can always ask on these kinds of series if interested in having me review a series that\u0027s over 26 episodes that I already own or have already seen).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e4. If you ask me to review an anime series movie (like say Inuyasha movie 3) and I have not seen the series, I will review the movie as is on it\u0027s own merits.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e5. I will give my honest opinion/review. Just because I receive a donation/reward to review an anime series, anime film or regular movie DOES NOT mean I will automatically give it a positive rating. I review things honestly and if I really like it then I will say so, if I do not then I will say so; donating/rewarding with a review does not guarantee I will love or hate the film/series in question. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
