    "summary": "If you are reading this it\u2019s because you are a true hockey\nplayer. Since you are a true hockey player you probably already know what Beer\nLeague Talk is. For those that might have been sleeping or drunk for the past\nyear and a few months Beer League Talk is the greatest hockey show in the\nworld.  We do a weekly podcast that\ncovers topics mainly about adult hockey but we also talk about other things\nlike tater tots (world cuisine), running for Presdient Prime Minister (world\npolitics), and other current events (RIP Harambe).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe hosts of Beer League Talk  (Nick, Dani, April, and sometimes Brett) are\npeople who are immersed daily in the world of adult hockey. They are ordinary\npeople just like you that love playing some puck but think their views \u0026amp;\nopinions are so awesome that they need to be shared on a weekly basis.. well\nmaybe that\u2019s just Nick. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur goal is to continue to make this podcast better.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe growth of the show has been incredible. We love getting\nto connect with Beer Leaguers from all over the world. It\u2019s been awesome for\npeople to find the show and then get to meet them at a tournament in places\nother than our hometowns. Through this show we truly have made life long\nfriends. Not only us as hosts but listeners have connected at tournaments and build\nbonds between them that are awesome. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are using Patreon for a couple reasons.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n1: One of our listeners told us our podcast \"was popular AF\" and we should use it so people could give back to the show. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n2. We want to\nmake this show better. We want to upgrade lighting, sounds, and even a camera\nto make us look way more professional\u2026 and handsome. We could also use someone\nwho knows how to edit or maybe even a videographer. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe goal of using Patreon is to give viewers a chance to\nsupport making a show they love better. We not only want to improve things,\nsuch as the audio and video of our weekly podcast \u0026amp; facetime live videos, we\nalso have \u201cA DREAM.\u201d  Our dream is to\nmake a biweekly or monthly Beer League Web Series! Something that all of our\nlisteners, fans, and friends can be proud of! \nUnfortunately this takes time and money. We are willing to put in the\ntime for all of you beautys but the $$ part is a huge undertaking for 3 (and\nsometimes 4\u2026 f\u2019in Brett) Beer League Dreamers.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you want to support our show here is your chance. We\nwon\u2019t forget you when we are ultra famous super adored beer league hockey rock\nstar celebrities! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou guys are awesome! We appreciate you for being a part of\nour family! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBLT Crew \u003cbr\u003e\n\nNick, Dani, April , and sometimes Brett\u003cbr\u003e"
