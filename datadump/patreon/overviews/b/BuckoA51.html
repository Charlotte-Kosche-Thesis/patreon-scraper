    "summary": "Greetings potential Patreon backer! First of all thank you for even considering backing me, it\u0027s a big internet and there\u0027s a lot of great stuff on it. So why should you back me? Well, I\u0027ve been making websites for nearly a decade now. My aim was always to make content that would help and educate people. My first site, Top-Windows-Tutorials.com, came about because I was encountering an awful lot of people who had spent good money on computer hardware but weren\u0027t getting anything near the full potential from their purchases. Anyway, that site\u0027s doing okay, not amazing, but certainly not too shabby, but it\u0027s not Top-Windows-Tutorials that I hope to get your backing for, it is my three gaming related sites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a passionate fan of video and computer games. I believe they are culturally significant and worthy of the same attention and study as other forms of popular media, such as film and music. With that in mind I decided I\u0027d like to write about games and gaming, but I didn\u0027t want to be just another blogger, let\u0027s player or reviewer. The internet already has lots of those. Instead, I have aimed to create content that is useful and unique about all aspects of gaming, but largely retro gaming. My current websites are:-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlay-Old-PC-Games.com\u003c/strong\u003e - I started this site as I frequently found myself writing notes on how to get my favourite older PC games working again. This often involved a mixture of trial and error and tedious searching around the web on dozens of different sites for clues or for patches or updates to software the original publishers had often abandoned. Since its launch in 2012 it has grown into the most popular site in my network, as far as page views go anyway, with thousands of unique visitors daily. As often as I can, I\u0027ll find and install an older PC title and document what I had to do to get it working. I\u0027ve also written replacement installers and simple patches to help users get otherwise incompatible software installed. This site is never finished, of course, since there are always more games to document.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideogamePerfection.com - \u003c/strong\u003eI take games as seriously as I take films or music, both when discussing them and when playing them. When I started to plan my new games room, there was plenty of information on what to buy to get the best picture and sound quality for my blu-ray player, but little good advice for my games consoles and my PC. I started this site to fill that niche and advise gaming enthusiasts all over the world how to best connect their systems for optimal picture and sound performance. Since then I\u0027ve added dozens of guides and reviews and helped gamers around the world. I\u0027ve consulted on Youtube videos and invested in innovative hardware projects and helped bring them to the market. Thanks to the help of a number of skilled engineers, I\u0027ve been able to offer hardware repairs and modifications too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVirtualDreamcast.com - \u003c/strong\u003eThis site came about in exactly the same way as \u003cstrong\u003ePlay-Old-PC-Games.com, \u003c/strong\u003ewhile setting up and configuring Dreamcast emulators I noticed I was taking a large amount of notes. Thinking this information would be useful to other gamers I started the site and began transferring the contents of my Evernote notebook onto the web. The site is a work in progress but I hope to add much more content, including guides on transferring save games and content between PC and Dreamcast console and playing Dreamcast games in true widescreen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I need your help - \u003c/strong\u003eMy sites are funded by advertising and through a small number of hardware and repair service sales. Things have got much more difficult since the rise of Ad-blockers and related technology. While I\u0027ve tried to diversify, I will not compromise the sites reputation by engaging in some of the more nefarious monetisation models that are around these days. I will not take up schemes such as so-called \"sponsored\" posts where the sponsor is never declared, or promote downloads that come bundled with spyware that you cannot uninstall or opt-out of (yes, I\u0027ve been offered money to do both of these things). I do not run my websites just for financial gain, but we all have to eat and pay the bills and the more income my sites generate, the more time I can spend working on them, the more money I can put back into them and the more money I can invest in other innovative retro-gaming products.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
