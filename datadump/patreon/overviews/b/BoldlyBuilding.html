    "summary": "I love to create things. In my earlier days, I loved to draw. Since 2008, I have learned 3D modeling mostly through self-teaching, and more recently I began creating for video games. One project I work on is Titanic: Honor and Glory, which is my main passion. However, I love creating things outside of Titanic, and the one other video game for which I love creating detailed assets is Cities: Skylines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy recreating real-world landmarks and fictional classics, as well as more subtle works, completed and planned, to help people build bigger and better in Cities: Skylines. I pride myself on the level of detail, accuracy, and realism I try to put into the assets I create. As you can imagine, it can often take a great deal of time and effort to make these buildings and other assets, be it the World Trade Center or Empire State Building, which each took a month of work, or my American Eclectic homes, which each took a day to make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I enjoy creating these assets, I can\u0027t fully justify the time I put into them unless it helps me financially. As such, your support would provide a tremendous boost to my work and provide the justification and motivation I need for the continued creation of new buildings and other assets for Cities: Skylines, as well as updating older assets and keeping up with new expansions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on the size, complexity, detail, and level of accuracy of each asset or group of assets, and how occupied my time is by other matters, it can take anywhere from one/two days to a month or more to create a building or other asset for the game. With your support, I would like to put out at least one building per month, more if possible, as well as other assets here and there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find my existing assets for Cities: Skylines here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/id/BoldlyBuilding/myworkshopfiles/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://steamcommunity.com/id/BoldlyBuilding/myworkshopfiles/\u003c/a\u003e"
