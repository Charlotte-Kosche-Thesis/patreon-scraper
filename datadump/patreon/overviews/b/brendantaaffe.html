    "summary": "Oh man, making music and art is just the best thing. It is the moment when I feel most alive, most centered, happiest to be here at this moment on this spinning ball. When I was studying mbira in Zimbabwe, I learned that Shona people believe that when you play, it is actually the ancestors who are playing through your fingers. Whatever your cosmology, I think this is beautiful way to encapsulate how music connects to each other across time and space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making music and art full time for ten years now, and those of you who have been following me along the way know that I get interested in lots of different things. I love composing choral music, singing jubilee gospel with the Waxwing Four, playing Irish music, playing Appalachian string-band music on banjo and fiddle, and making crankies. I love playing Zimbabwean music on the mbira, writing essays, and making cut-paper art to hang on a wall. Sometimes I love combining different strands of the above and sometimes I like it straight-up. I\u0027m envisioning this new platform as a way to indulge my creative curiosity and to bring you along on the journey. Sometimes I\u0027ll record a banjo tune or a ballad from my archival research, maybe a video of a new crankie or the scratch track of a new song. Since it\u0027s new, I imagine that what I do here will evolve. I\u0027ll share thoughts about the music that\u0027s exciting me, the projects I\u0027m dreaming about, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the ten years that I\u0027ve been doing this music thing, the external environment has changed a lot and I think all of us are trying to figure out how to move forward in this new reality. We\u0027ve shifted from CDs to downloads to streaming, art has become \"content\", and mostly folks seem to think that it all comes for free. I\u0027m grateful to the folks at Patreon for providing an alternative model and am excited to explore it with you. Thanks for being a part of the journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
