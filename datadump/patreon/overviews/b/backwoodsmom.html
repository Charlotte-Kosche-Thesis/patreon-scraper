    "summary": "This site told me to post a\nvideo introducing myself, so I\u2019m giving you this little gem\u2026my first ever selfie video from a few years ago. This is why I hide behind a keyboard. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m Keri Ann Riley. I live in Alaska. Some of\nyou know me as \u0027Backwoods Mom\u0027 on the internet. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ve landed on my Patreon page...which is a simple way to support my work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor years I shared my writing, my photos, my life, with thousands of people from\nacross the world via my personal blog and Facebook.\u00a0 It was sincerely one of the most awesome\nexperiences of my life. I didn\u0027t make a dime. The whole project was out of my\npocket. And that was ok!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd then\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAbout two years ago, due to the privacy and\nsafety needs of some of my foster/adopt children I was forced to suddenly and\nwithout explanation, pull back from blogging and posting on my site. And then I\npurposefully disappeared. It was crushing to leave something I enjoyed\nso much. But it was a no-brainer decision when it came to the safety of my\nfamily. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, if you wondered where I went...them\u0027s the facts, only the\nfacts. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd then I came across Patreon a few days ago and discovered\nhow I could post privately to only subscribed readers. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut it\u2019s a pay site\u2026you might be thinking. Yes,\nyes, it is.  And you have the absolute\nfreedom to hit the \u2018back\u2019 button and get out now. I won\u2019t even know you were here!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBasically, for half the\nprice of a mocha per month ($2) you can be a part of helping me move forward\nwith my writing career! I have over 12,000 Facebook fans. If 1/4 of them pledge, I\u0027ll be able to write full time without financial worries until I can sell my first book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSee, I\u2019ve been parenting for\nnearly 30 years. I\u2019ve had over 20 kids come through my home, most of them long\nterm. Now\u2026with only the three teens left at home, I have more time then ever to\nwrite! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo my\nthought is...this is my year. This is the year I\u0027ll finally finish a novel (or\ntwo) and make an actual income with my BA in creative writing\u2026which to this\npoint, has been virtually useless. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m not asking anyone\nto \u2018donate\u2019 to the cause. This isn\u2019t a fundraiser. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019m just saying I\u2019m going to post some of my new writing on this\nsite and if you want to read it, simply fill out the pledge form and read to your hearts content.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, since I\u0027m being super honest, I admit, the\nidea of being PAID to write is quite appealing. And I do occasionally get paid.\nIn October I had a two-page article in Alaska Magazine...which was like a dream\ncome true. They\u0027ve asked me to send them some more work. And I will. But self-confidence,\nor lack thereof is a funny thing, isn\u2019t it? \nI\u2019ve never submitted anything for publication or to a contest that wasn\u2019t\neither published or won\u2026and yet I still am terrified to move forward. The goal\nis, of course, to make an actual living doing what I love. Isn\u0027t that what\neveryone dreams of?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI figure if you all are supporting my success, I\u0027ll have no choice but to put myself out there...far past my comfort zone...and see what happens.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo here I am, on a new site, ready to share my\nwork with you, my patrons, my peers, my friends. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat Am I Working On?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027d like to continue\nto share my family with you all, if you\u0027re interested, via posts and pics, complete with our off-grid home and the trials and benefits of choosing to live this way.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m writing a fiction\nnovel highlighting the plight of older children in the foster system. The\n\u0027unadoptable\u0027, if you will. My characters are five teen foster kids who run\naway in search of a family to call their own. It sounds cheesy, but really it\u2019s\nnot. (think Hunger Games/Little Orphan Annie, without all the violent death and singing) I\u0027ve been writing this story inside my head for many years.\nI\u0027ve been typing on it for just a few months. I\u0027d love some input.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m working on a\ncouple of ChickLit novels (think Nora Roberts, maybe Jodi Picoult on a good\nday) that show a lot of promise as income. Not my life\u0027s dream work, but\nhey, somebody\u0027s got to pay the bills.  Input would be awesome.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027ve upgraded my\nphotography skills and began to use Instagram to share my Alaskan pics. I\u0027d\nlove to share more on here.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI splurged on a GoPro\nBlack and oh my gosh, how fun.  I\u0027ve been making some videos of Alaska,\nour life, our travels.  I\u0027d love to share some on here and have an excuse\nto get out to video more often.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\nI\u0027m committing to do this for one year. If it works as planned\nI\u0027ll be on my way to publishing and I will no longer need this avenue of\nincome. If it doesn\u2019t, you all can drop me like a hot potato because I\u0027m not\nworth your two bucks. Also, there is no contract, so you can pretty much drop\nme any time you want. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u2019d like to be a part of all this and it\ndoesn\u0027t take food from the mouths of your own family to do so...please join\nme.  I can use all the motivation and support I can get.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
