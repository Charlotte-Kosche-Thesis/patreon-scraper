    "summary": "Why am I doing this and why should you be my patron? Being creative is what I do, and I love it. I want to keep making stuff! I want to keep writing songs and poetry and blogs. I want to keep drawing and painting. I want to keep making jewelry. I want to keep inspiring others to create. I also want to do neat human things like eat food and live in a house and have an operational mode of transportation. It would be really awesome if I could do all of those neat human things AND make art AND help people too! So if you like the art that I make and/or you support the work that I do to help the homeless (\u003ca href=\"http://www.takerootgeorgia.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.takerootgeorgia.org\u003c/a\u003e), or you just have the wacky opinion that artists like me should be compensated for the work they do, then YOU would be a GREAT PATRON! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat it boils down to is that this is my job and just because I love it doesn\u0027t mean I shouldn\u0027t make a decent living doing it. Art has value. So, if you agree with that sentiment and you enjoy the things I create, I\u0027m falling into you, I\u0027m trusting you to catch me, and in return I promise to do my best to produce great art. When you become my patron, you become my lifeblood. You become part of the creative process. Thank you for your support. Thank you for reading. Thank you for listening.

My art is inspired by experience, exposure, and witnessing other people\u0027s amazing art. Mostly I write songs, poems, and blogs, but I venture outside of those lines on occasion and until now, those adventures have been private, but I\u0027m excited to share them with you now! I love a challenge, so if you can think up something that you\u0027d like to see me try, don\u0027t hold back. Dancing probably won\u0027t happen, but other than that I\u0027m wide open! I\u0027m grateful for the opportunity to take this journey with you. Thank you for seeing the value of my art and of art in general, and thank you so very much for choosing to support my creativity. As I become financially able, I\u0027ll pay it forward by becoming a patron for more and more other artists. I truly believe this is a revolution and I\u0027m glad we\u0027re all taking part in it. \u003cbr\u003eXOBC\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "If I hit $500, I will immediately get into the studio and get moving on the new solo project. It will happen either way - we\u0027re in preproduction now - but if I get to this level of support, I can move forward more confidently. I have some great friends who are willing to come in and capture photo and video footage which we\u0027ll share with Patrons as things progress. I can\u0027t wait to get this fully under way so we can get music in your hands and ears! Thanks, y\u0027all!\u003cbr\u003e",
