The beginning of an epic adventure, a journey to learn, develop and challenge the way in which we deal with violent extremism and terrorism \u2013 to truly find out the most effective means of ending what to most of us seems like senseless violence.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe journey has taken me to meet and collaborate with other world leading experts. I\u2019ve met with people involved in terrorist organisations and with a massive amount of formers, people who used to be in some of the most violent movements in the world \u2013 who turned their backs on their pasts, who reformed and who now work for peace. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u2019ve assisted people in getting on the path to leaving violent extremism behind. I\u2019ve worked to prevent people from getting into violent extremism in the first place. I\u2019ve stood on stages in front of thousands of youth, world leaders, politicians and regular people who have found power through my story to make changes in their own lives. It\u2019s been inspirational, it\u2019s been empowering, but it\u2019s also been draining \u2013 that\u2019s why I now need you, my fantastic friends and supporters, more than ever.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMany of you have been following my path from the start. Others have joined along the way, and I greatly appreciate what you have done, the shares, the likes, the assistance in getting me on stages, in front of cameras, in touch with people to share my story and spread my message, to help where help was needed. I have at this point however exhausted my resources. Even when travels are covered there are additional expenses, tickets that needs to be covered, cab fares, food. I\u2019ve covered this for the last six years from my own pocket. My work takes time. It needs time. Preparing for a talk takes days, hours I\u2019m not getting payed to work. Speaking to formers, working to deradicalse others, speaking to classroom after classroom of teenagers vulnerable to radicalisations, educating teachers about how to ensure their students don\u2019t end up in the hands of violent extremists takes up unpaid hours. Advising and speaking to students, and activists working to create campaigns, working with media, writing articles and op-eds, developing projects, technology, narratives and solutions, speaking to the press to educate the general public, advocating for changing strategies while putting days into researching how to be even more successful in preventing and ending violent extremism takes hours, currently at no pay. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vPOWQ7CPONQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\n\tI\u2019ve so far funded my work with the reparations I received after the 2011 attack.\u003c/strong\u003e It was about $30k, it ran out years ago, \u003cstrong\u003eevery penny of that money was spent trying to end the terror that killed my friends, that still kills, every day\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u2019ve funded it by being a full time student next to my work \u2013 when I last year was forced to leave Turkey my scholarships and loans ended. I\u2019ve borrowed money from friends and from family, living off of scraps. Right now I have a full time job to fund my more-than-full-time-work in countering violent extremism. It has all been worth it. However, at this point I\u2019ve drained my funds, I\u2019m stretching myself too thin, and it\u2019s draining my energy and ability to work to end violent extremism.If I am to continue I therefore need your assistance.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eSo how can you become an ally and assist me in my work to counter violent extremism?\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe easiest way is by supporting me here on Patreon. \n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tPatreon is a platform where you can support creators and activists on a monthly basis. If you can spare even just a little bit of your hard earned money, perhaps even less than what you spend on Netflix, on a monthly basis, and want to support my work it\u2019d be awesome! The great thing about Patreon for me is that it gives some predictability, I know how much I\u2019ll earn next month, which is great for covering bills and making ends meet! If I manage to get enough small donors on a regular basis on Patreon I could be working to counter violent extremism around the clock, and that would be really great, both for me, for the field, and for the world \u2013 at least the world I want to live in, where violent extremism is history.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tPlease note that I\u2019ve done a lot to cut my costs to a minimum, and I do not plan on living a life in luxury, all ask for is an ability to cover the bills, and perhaps get a meal or two on occasion, and perhaps not be as out of pocket as I am right now when it comes to being able to do my work.I\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tf you can\u2019t support me on a monthly basis but have a lot of cash right now a one time donation would also come in really handy. You can check out my website:\u00a0\n\t\u003ca href=\"http://www.bjornih.co.uk\"\u003ewww.bjornih.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e for information on how we can organise that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIf you, like me, don\u2019t have much cash there\u2019s also a bunch of ways in which you can support. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eFirst of all you can share my work, and my Patreon page with your friends. \u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dOOtM7ZpA_8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tSecondly you can help me get in touch with organisations, businesses, schools, churches, mosques, community centers, book-clubs, libraries, you name it \u2013 that could benefit from some of the things I do:\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tOne of the things I do is to give \n\t\u003cstrong\u003espeeches and lectures\u003c/strong\u003e. These can be informative, and inspirational, focusing on both my work, and how I came from the position of having just lived through the worst day of my life, to where I am now, able to work to counter what lead to the attack in 2011. If you know someone who could use a talking-to by me, and who would be able to pay a little bit for it, it\u2019d be great if you could put us in touch.I also lead workshops founded in what I have learnt, both to create, to develop narratives, to counter violent extremism, to build more peaceful, thriving communities, to write, to think in new directions when it comes to ethics and to ensure better collaboration in groups and workplaces. If you think your workplace, or a group could benefit from a workshop get in touch. I also work with a team of others who can give workshops and lectures on a range of topics related to peace work and non-violence. We would even be able to host a pretty large group of participants at our community in the Swedish woods. Do get in touch for that, I\u2019m excited!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"476\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"476\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tFrom my work and education in addition to countering extremism I have a fairly broad background as a photographer and media/video creator, animator, designer and web-developer. My background is in designing video elements for the stage, so I also have a good understanding of theatre productions, technology and design. I have worked on a range of digital platforms, and designed and developed websites and infrastructure for companies at a range of scales and sizes. I have also worked a lot with media, and hope I come off as half decent at writing. I also have a good understanding of politics, both at a global and local scale. \n\t\u003cstrong\u003eIf there are consultancies, advisory roles or other short-term or one-off jobs you think I would be suited for that\u2019d be a great thing we could do to fund some of my other work.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIf you\u2019re really rich (as some of you might be), and would like to get even wealthier, you should get in touch to learn more about \n\t\u003cstrong\u003ehow you can invest \u003c/strong\u003ein\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003esome of the projects I\u2019m developing in the intersection between peace work, work to counter extremism and technology, particularly focusing on how to ethically utilise data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence in order to effectively deradicalise radicalised groups online. The tools and theories developed in this field would also have applications in other fields and could make for a good business opportunity should you be interested in investing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIn addition to doing this I\u2019m working with a number of partners to develop projects that might be able to get funding on a shorter term basis through grants and public funding \u2013 however, that can be a turbulent game, that also involves long periods of waiting, and living off of ramen.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eIf you have other ideas on how I should fund my work or how you and others can help out please do not hesitate to get in touch. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"http://bjornih.co.uk/contact.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYou can always get in touch with me here!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-1tVEw-mZp0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI hope this letter has been read in the way it was written; as \n\t\u003cstrong\u003ea genuine call for support from friends and supporters.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u2019m aware of my relative privilege. I\u2019m eternally grateful for all the stages I\u2019ve been given, all the opportunities, all the meetings I\u2019ve been able to have with fantastic people from all walks of life \u2013 I have however been burning the candle at both ends for quite some time now, and it\u2019s been exhausting, both financially, and largely because of that, mentally which in turn has a physical impact. I cannot continue like this, it\u0027s simply not sustainable. If I am to be able to continue working for the good of others I have to take a little bit care of myself too. And if you, like me think that this work is worth doing, then lend a friend a hand and enable me to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThank you all very much!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tBest wishes,\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tBj\u00f8rn Ihler\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
