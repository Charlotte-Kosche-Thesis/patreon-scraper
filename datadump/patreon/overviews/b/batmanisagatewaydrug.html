    "summary": "hello everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eyou may know me as Makenzie, or as Tumblr user batmanisagatewaydrug. or both. I hope both! I contain multitudes, my dudes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also contain a lot of sex ed info, which you probably know if you\u0027ve followed my blog for any length of time. heck, it might be the reason you follow my blog in the first place. I\u0027ve been giving out advice about sex ed - and a miscellaneous number of other things - since about 2015, all of which you can see right here under my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://batmanisagatewaydrug.tumblr.com/sexedventures\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esex edventures\u003c/a\u003e tag. tumblr has been an absolutely amazing platform for getting connected with people who have questions as well as making friends and sharing ideas, and I honestly can\u0027t even imagine trying to transplant myself to any kind of \"professional\" blogging platform. I\u0027ve made a really great community right where I\u0027m at!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehowever, it\u0027s not enough to just be a sex witch in my online life. I\u0027m also hoping to make sex ed my career in my real life, and since I\u0027ll be graduating at the end of 2018, the clock is ticking. obviously I\u0027m not trying to make tumblr my entire source of income, but if you appreciate what I\u0027ve been doing and would like to keep doing here, as little as a dollar a month can help me dedicate more of my time time to reading, writing, researching, and answering your questions instead of worrying how in the fresh heck I\u0027m going to pay for my groceries.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003elet me be absolutely clear: I have no intention of making my tumblr exclusive to people who give me money, especially not the sex edventures. I\u0027m trying to make sex ed MORE accessible here! \u003cstrong\u003eeveryone will always be able to get their questions answered for completely free\u003c/strong\u003e. but absolutely any and all money will be extremely appreciated, and rewarded. what are the rewards, you ask? I\u0027m not exactly sure yet, although I\u0027ve gotten some intriguing suggestions. I\u0027m very new to this and I would love your suggestions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethanks! you\u0027re rad \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
