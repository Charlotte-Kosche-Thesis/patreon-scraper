    "summary": "Heyya!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Zack Cambly and I write music in a one man alt metal band, Becoming The Dead.\u003cbr\u003eI play most of the instruments in my bad, but I also hire session musicians to help give my songs a little more flavor as well as make them better. Being a one-man band, I do not perform live and instead only record my songs in studio. This means since I am not on stage every night I am not attracting many fans, but it also gives me a lot more time to work on new songs and try to have release after release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been writing music on my guitar for about 10 years now, but it wasn\u0027t until late in 2016 that I had found a studio looking to book a few free days and decided to give it a try. By October I had a 6 song EP in hand and searched through my computer at old tracks trying to find something to use as a intro when I came across a very bare track of keys and screams, so I plugged in the guitar and added a few little effects and extra sounds and put it at the beginning of the EP, which then was released in November 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn December 2016 I messaged the studio drummer about recording some more tracks and sent a few demos his way. Every since I have been working on a new 5 song EP which I am hoping to release within the next few months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I joined Patreon is to try to help me afford to pay for my music creation. This being with hiring drummers as well as other session musicians to perform on my songs, buying new equipment to improve my home studio (which I have been slowly building up the past year), and to release my music with physical CD\u0027s and digital downloads on pretty well any site that sells music.\u003cbr\u003e"
