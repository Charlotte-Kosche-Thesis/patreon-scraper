    "summary": "Hello, thank you, and welcome to my Patreon Project! If you don\u0027t already know what Patreon is, take a look around and get familiar. To be brief, its a platform where you can pay a monthly fee to support a creator. If you look to the right, you\u0027ll see the reward scale for my Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I suppose you know who I am if you\u0027re here. In the event that you don\u0027t know me, I\u0027m Belinda. I\u0027m an author, I\u0027ve been published in romantic speculative fiction since 2008, prior to that I was a playwright and a (ugh) technical writer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I doing this? Well, some years ago, I was a busy and productive writer and doing quite well. Then one night, my mother was newly out of the hospital after knee replacement surgery. She put a topical medication on her knee and what followed led to the hardest three years of my life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe wound up in the ER, having vivid hallucinations, dangerous hives and delusional behavior. That episode passed, but led to several years of managing her health, which was precarious. There were weeks where I slept in front of the living room door to prevent her from leaving...following something that only she could see. There were emergency hospital visits, surgeries, a broken hip...on and on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeedless to say, my writing suffered. But I didn\u0027t stop. When I couldn\u0027t write, I read. I consumed books voraciously. And as I came to the realization that I was in the grips of burn-out, I turned my attention to continuing education. I attended classes, workshops and brainstorming sessions. I learned to meditate and manage not only my mother\u0027s life and health, but my own as well. I care-give for another profoundly disabled family member, so I learned to balance their needs with my own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, life is a little easier, but unfortunately, I\u0027ve lost ground in the publishing game. \u00a0I have a large catalog of books out of print that I want to self-pub. But that endeavor takes more time and money than I have. If I want to do this, I need education, I need assistance and I need funds.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is my goal with this project, to make enough to help me with editing and cover art, as well as with getting specialized education when I need it. For your sponsorship, I will do my very best to make the return on your money as rewarding as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve read this far, again, thank you. Because ultimately, what I\u0027m doing is producing a product from my heart, that is meant to be read. To write unheard, into a vacuum...there\u0027s little more frightening to me.\u00a0"
