    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003eWriter \u0026amp; Illustrator\u003c/h1\u003eMy name is Billy Wittenberg, and I am an aspiring artist that writes and illustrates graphic novels, comic strips, and cartoons. But for years, in order to keep a roof over my family\u0027s head, I have been working full time as a \u003ca href=\"https://www.billywitt.com/mechanical-designer\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMechanical Designer\u003c/a\u003e. So I have created this Patreon page in hopes that maybe, someday, I can make enough money as an artist that I\u0027ll be able to make it my full time focus. In the meantime, I have started a graphic novel named \"Thicker Than Blood\" (aka TTB) as well as a couple of webcomics that I host on my website, \u003ca href=\"https://www.billywitt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebillywitt.com.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.billywitt.com/graphic-novel\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGraphic Novel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eTTB is a story of two families living in Brownsville Texas near the US/Mexico border. One family is involved in the drug trade, the other is headed by a DEA agent. And, unbeknownst to them, they are tied together by a mysterious bond. The book traces multiple generations of these families, going all the way back to 1971.Obviously, it\u0027s going to be a long story with lots of characters so I\u0027m planning on making this a series of three books. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.billywitt.com/webcomics\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWeb-comics\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eThe first webcomic is called \"Millenium Man\". By day he\u0027s a dim-witted call center support tech. By night he\u0027s an equally dim-witted, bumbling super hero! \u003cbr\u003eThe second is called \"Lug \u0026amp; Skof\" and focuses on two homeless dogs looking for their place in the world.\u003cbr\u003eI also make assorted other comics as the mood strikes. But TTB is my focus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePatreon\u003c/h2\u003eObviously, since I am currently working full time (as well as an all-the-time dad), I can only devote 10-15 hours max to producing artwork every week. Therefore, I\u0027ve set a conservative goal of producing a new page of TTB every two weeks. And maybe one or two comics per month. So my donations are set for per release, instead of per month. You will only pay when I produce new artwork. Sounds fair right? But don\u0027t worry, as a patron you can always establish a maximum number of donations per month. So if one month I release 30 artworks, you wont get charged 30 times. But you\u0027ll still be able to see all 30 artworks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, because this is a one man operation, my rewards will also remain conservative. Over time, as the number of my patrons grow, I\u0027ll be able to able to add more reward levels. Please take a look at my goals to see what I\u0027m planning to do to add reward levels as well as increase my production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for taking the time to visit my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e"
