Like, \u003cstrong\u003eloads\u003c/strong\u003e of time!\u003cbr\u003e\nThen there was the voice-over; feedback on our first attempt was hilariously direct - it appears some thought we were \u003cstrong\u003ereading a ransom demand!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Hehe! \u003cbr\u003eBut honestly, we are new to this and we have a lot to learn. So again, it takes a lot of time...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt times we\u0027ll need to pause on the BelOmbre project to return to our day jobs - Alastair is a sparky while Jo-Ann translates admin paperwork and procedures for English speakers in France - both to save funds for the next phase and to keep the costs of life in general at bay.\u003cbr\u003eIt goes without saying (but we\u0027ll say it anyway), your subscriptions will be paused when no work on the project will be taking place.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut if you are enjoying what we are doing then we\u0027d love for you to lend your support, because it all helps us enormously - as motivation, as feedback and with funds to invest to make it even better!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nThank you so much for following our journey :)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCome and find us on Facebook (\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/belombre47\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@belombre47\u003c/a\u003e) \u0026amp; Instagram (\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/belombre47\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e#belombre47\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e"
