One of the biggest obstacles for an independent (solo) developer is that they aren\u0027t able to do everything themselves in the way that it should be. In my case, it\u0027s creating the art and sound assets for the game. I believe that Patreon is a great way to fund a project of this type because it allows you to invest very little and still be able to see the game come together. With the funds provided, I will constantly post updates and show off the new game content that you were able to bring to the final project!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://darkflamegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Logo_What_Is_DF.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDescription\u003c/h2\u003eA beautiful 2D ARPG throwback to retro greats. Dark Flame brings you the perspective of a knight who must battle the horrific conveyance of unknown evil that has overtaken his order. Featuring large, hand-crafted environments, tailored gameplay, and an armoire of weapons, armor, and magic, the game blends classic with new to bring a unique experience!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eStory\u003c/h2\u003eFor centuries, humanity\u0027s greatest willed champions, the Keepers of the Flame, have been tasked with containing the Dark Flame, an entity of unknown origins and purpose. Since its discovery, The Dark Flame has poisoned the souls of weak-minded humans, causing instant violent reactions and sacrificial behavior. Discovery of ancient texts gave humanity the tools, technology, and rituals to restrain the Dark Flame; mankind finally had the chance to protect themselves from the assumed destruction, and the Dark Flame was kept secret from all but the elite tier of Crusaders and the Church over the course of countless generations. After a bright light flashes from the fortress guarding the flame, reports of brutal slaughters in the neighboring town have the people desperate for help. The Church responds by dispatching Taharial, a potential candidate for the Keepers of the Flame, to investigate and protect the townspeople. The mission is clear: Find the members of the Keepers of the Flame, investigate the nature of the light flash, and save the townsfolk from the raiding monsters that have started appearing; the way, however, is not so well lit. When a young man steps into the ranks, his exceptional skills and ability to withstand the temptation of the Flame have his peers heralding that he, Islude, may be the person to eradicate the flame.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://darkflamegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Logo_Game_Features.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eUtilize the Pyre to modify the powers of your weapons and spells\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eManipulate the unique level system to suit your style of play\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eImmerse yourself in the diverse storyline of Dark Flame where you struggle between the lesser of evils\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdorn powerful weapons and armor to customize your appearance\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDiscover hidden chambers and uncover dark secrets\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnlock unique talents and channel hidden powers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlayable via Steam on PC/Mac/Linux (with hopes of consoles after)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e \u003cimg src=\"http://darkflamegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/pyreEquipping-small.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://darkflamegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2b.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003eTaharial gazes into the Pyre while it attunes one of the magic crystals\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eThe ancient texts gave men the knowledge and ability to forge weapons and spells at Pyres.

There is an ancient writing on the use of Pyres. They contain much power of which the source is unknown. This power can be contained within \u201cMagic Crystals\u201d after attuning the crystals with the Pyre. Once these Magic Crystals have been attuned, they can be carried and used by those who have the power to use them.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cimg src=\"http://darkflamegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SoMuchAwesome-small.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Pyres have also been known to imbue a portion of its power within other items as well. The most commonly used are weapons of the Keepers of the Flame. The ritual used to attune these weapons are another closely kept secret of the Keepers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://darkflamegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4b.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003eTaharial swinging a giant sword over his head to take down multiple enemies in one fell swoop\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eWhile front-swinging swords are the main weapon in the Pre-Alpha, they are most certainly not the only armaments you will get to use against the horde of horrors ahead. Tools such as crossbows, polearms, hammers, greatswords, daggers, and a slew of other forged steel arms with many different attack patterns and various sizes that will help you claw or club your way to victory. Yes, Shields will an addition to the game; We wouldn\u0027t want you to go around not defending yourself, would we? There will be an extra space for this kind of equipment on Tahrial, and a shield may be your best friend when defending from those poison-spitters! At the moment, the plan is to implement shield similar to Dark Souls; defending bleeds stamina, meaning you have to juggle attacks and protecting yourself with some care.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://darkflamegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1b.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003eTaharial wielding a shield to protect himself from the various types of hazardous projectiles\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eA future change you will see (Hopefully in the Alpha or Beta) is a revamping of sub-weapons. We wanted to do something that was a bit more in line with the theme of the game, so we are looking into changing the genre-standard items with glass fire bulbs. These little anachronisms will contain different elements, alchemy, and bric-a-brac and can be lobbed in different patterns depending on the bulb type. Once a bulb hits an enemy, it can break and spread the contents around, potentially doing more damage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://darkflamegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/earthSpells-small.gif\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://collective.square-enix.com/system/tinymce_assets/images/000/005/661/original/reworkBoss_-_small.gif?1463795042\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://darkflamegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Logo_Project_History.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eI started working on Dark Flame over 3 years ago when I first started building the engine. My initial goal was to create a custom engine that would run with both efficiency and performance! After playing around with some pixel art, I realized I would need something better than my less-than-mediocre art to really make this project come to life. That\u0027s when I invested over $5500 of my personal money to work with three artists and a musician to show off this amazing project! This sacrifice of both time and money is my investment to you, to hopefully gain your trust in knowing that I am fully invested in this project! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been a huge fan of video games since before I could pick up a controller. I was such a huge fan, I ended up teaching myself how to program and put as much effort into a game engine as possible. I am not merely making this game for profit - I\u0027m doing it because I have a passion to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://darkflamegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/LOGO_Project_Goals.jpg\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eDark Flame didn\u0027t always look this great...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://darkflamegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ScreenShot-2017Jun05-20-51-19.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...It took many years of dedication to get to where I am now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will continue to code no matter what happens, but with your help, we can keep adding these beautiful assets and finish this game!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donation will go purely to everything needed to bring this game to life!

I will also be able to go full time indie! Up to this point, I have been working on Dark Flame part time (while holding a job/going to school/etc). I\u0027ve had to stay up until 3am at times just to wake back up at 6am to go back to work. With this goal reached, it would allow me to focus on development (and probably be healthier for me too).",
