My name is Jason Shurtz, I\u0027m the creator behind the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/bartendingpro\"\u003eBartendingPro Youtube channel\u003c/a\u003e which was created after I had worked at a bartending school for a short while AFTER I had been a working bartender for nearly seven years, and realized the disconnect of what was taught in schools, vs what you really need to succeed as a working bartender. My career as a bartender spans over 15 years leading the front lines in some of the most consistently busy establishments in Southern California and the BP channel is basically me creating episodes designed to help those interested in the industry get started, without all the BS that can go along with learning this trade. By starting this Patreon page I am able to work directly \u003cem\u003eFOR YOU\u003c/em\u003e. By becoming a bartendingpro \"Patron\", you will enable me to work towards my dream of full-time creating of high quality, in-depth\u00a0videos delivered to you much more often. To say thank you, and to hopefully make it more than worthwhile for you personally, I have\u00a0special \u003cstrong\u003e\"Rewards\" for each Patron\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0video contribution\u00a0(listed to your right) above the $1 minimum. By becoming a BP patron, you will empower me to better help YOU become a true Bartending Pro. Thank you."
