    "summary": "Here\u0027s the thing. I write songs. I don\u0027t write songs of love and special things, I don\u0027t write songs that make the young girls cry, and I certainly don\u0027t write songs that make the whole world sing. I write songs for those select few who happen to share the exact same taste in music as I. So pretty much nerds. You know who you are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr maybe you don\u0027t. Have you ever baked a pie for Pi Day? Wondered what would happen in the world if friction suddenly turned off? Questioned Donkey Kong\u0027s sexual orientation? Had a best friend who was also a theropod? Have you ever wondered if your job could be compared to a monkey dancing to an organ grinder, or seen the 1977 Superman movie from Otis\u0027 perspective? These are the kinds of questions you ask in a Patreon description field when you want to tell people about your music but maybe try to make it look like you\u0027re a clever person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore continuing, by all means please familiarize yourself with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://briangraymusic.com/?toptab=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy catalogue\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHistorically, I think I\u0027ve averaged about one new song every 2 months. Mostly originals, a few of them either covers or parodies. Part of this project is to force myself to write more, maybe as much as one every 2 weeks, because there will be people out there counting on me to fill their empty, depressing lives with songs about how childhood dreams get crushed when you grow up. The other part of the project is to fund the means of making my music better. I\u0027ve learned so much these past few years, and things definitely sound better than they used to, but sometimes you just need the hardware.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs time passes, the plan is to improve my signal chain from source to output, starting with the physical environment (studio) and microphone, working forward through pre-amp and D/A conversion, and finally to all that stuff that resides inside the computer. Along the way I\u0027ll constantly refine my composition, lyrics, and vocal skills, and as a bonus you all get to hear new songs from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a bonus bonus, of course you also get all kinds of goodies depending on how much you pledge. I\u0027m really excited about a few of these rewards, like the monthly Skype concert and the ones where you can make me do songs of your own choosing. To wit..."

What the hell is wrong with you that you would pay $89 per song? If you\u0027re willing to pay this much, I will write an all-new, original song to your specification, once per year.

We\u0027ll work together to develop the theme, I\u0027ll run lyrics and music by you as I get inspired, and I\u0027ll record it. I do have standards though, so this whole thing will need to fit under the umbrella of \"not being a dick\" (i.e. not racist, sexist, homophobic, generally offensive). I\u0027m sure we can come up with something that makes us both happy and also ends in my not hating myself.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",

Now hear it recorded through a proper professional studio mic, modified by Michael Joly Engineering to recreate the response characteristics of the legendary Neumann U87. Specific mic selection TBD, as they have mods based on MXL 990 and 910, and Rode NT1a. Would need to audition them to determine which sounds the best for my voice. The models appear to run from $380-630 (the high end comes paired with a modded MXL 991 acoustic guitar mic). At $100 per song, I\u0027d have the mic(s) paid for within 4-7 songs.",

I have a space marked out in the basement, and most of a design/plan. Of course, the more I\u0027m making from music, the more I can hire out technical and specialized aspects of the construction, such as electrical, HVAC, and acoustic treatment of the finished room. Also, I wanted to start with this to establish a pattern of addressing my sound from room to computer, in that direction. No fixed budget yet, but I imagine the materials will cost around $2000-2500, out of my own existing pockets and not really having anything to do with Patreon. In fact, forget I even put this here, that was stupid.",

If things roll quickly and the dollars add up, I could consider swapping this one (at $545) for the 517 model ($850) that combines the same mic pre-amp with an instrument DI and basic hardware compression that I would almost surely use strictly as a limiter.
