    "summary": "First of all, hello world! We from Blaster Lizard are just a bunch of people with dreams and the desire to accomplish our goals. We are twelve in total, that together tries to build a new way to make games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe live in Campinas, Brazil and it\u0027s have been already three years that we are on the market. We are affiliated with other strong game developers. We have already participated on the creation of \u003cstrong\u003eKraven Manor\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0(Demon Wagon Studios) as the responsible to port the game with the PT-BR language support. We\u0027ve also helped amateur developers to make their own games through lectures around Brazil. We are currently working on two games, \u003cem\u003eAmnesia: Fear in Hands \u003c/em\u003e(a mod for Amnesia: The Dark Descent) and \u003cem\u003eCanis Lupus\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(An original and standalone game, being entirely made by Blaster Lizard).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason that we are here is justly because of \u003cem\u003eCanis Lupus.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0It\u0027s a very ambitious project and we are working day and night on it. It requires time and a lot of dedication, and most of the time, we can\u0027t spend much time making it, because of our leading jobs and main works in our home. Since we\u0027ve planned to create Canis Lupus as a commercial product, we tried creating a crowdfunding campaign for the game. Since we knew it would take time to finish both games with the team splitted in two groups, we find better to try \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0basically because it would serve as a ongoing crowdfunding alternative for us, that fits better with our policy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonating to us not only will provide the team to create better games with a cheaper price (or even free games for the rest of our lives, depending of how much support we\u0027ll have) but with much more quality. We won\u0027t stop making games if we get no support, and this is one of the main reasons that Blaster Lizard differs from the others. We still want our games to be different AND better compared to the most indie games out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main reason that has lead us to create this profile and to test \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0as a huge opportunity that it is to increase the quality of our products is mainly because the budget we have to\u00a0develop our games isn\u0027t enough at all to create what we want to make. It take us time, and every month, we have to pay our rent, food, water, energy and everything else that makes a human being live and work considerably well. Your help will be more than sufficient to make this not only a reality for all of us, but also in the near future, when it will be the time for us to compensate everyone that have helped us before. \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0was chosen exclusively for these purposes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s also important to say that, if we end up not achieving our goal at all, \u003cstrong\u003ewe will not pocket your money\u003c/strong\u003e, but instead, we will be \u003cem\u003econtacting every donator in order to get their payment recovered to them\u003c/em\u003e, in safe pace. We will only start using the money after reaching the milestone of $30000, that is exactly what we need to get started. From the moment you donate to us, we will keep 100% contact with you. You will get our e-mail, our number, Skype and Steam profile to be able to track us whenever you feel necessary. It is important that we want to make it clear and transparent to everyone that really are up to help us with our dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can get more information about our project in a lot of different ways. We are on YouTube, on Facebook and on Twitter (the main page of each one of these social medias are detailed on the left side of this Patreon page), but we also have a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.indiedb.com/members/blasterlizardgt\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eIndieDB Community Page\u003c/a\u003e and a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gamejolt.com/profile/team-blaster-lizard/44243\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGameJolt Page\u003c/a\u003e. With these websites you\u0027ll know basically everything that you might need to. We also have our games official website, such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.canislupusgame.com.br\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCanis Lupus\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.fearinhandsgame.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAmnesia: Fear in Hands\u003c/a\u003e. If you still have a question about us, you contact us in anywhere that you want, since we provide a \u003cem\u003econtact box\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0in each one of the websites and social pages that we have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for spending your time and trust with our project. It really means a lot for us and we are always determined to push ourselves to the limit to offer the best we can, if there is someone that believes in our potential. Soon, we will update this page with an \u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction Video\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0so everyone will be able to know a little bit more about us. Soon... We promise!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest Regards\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- The Blaster Lizard Game Team"
