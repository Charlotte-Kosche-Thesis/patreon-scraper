My goal is simple: to make indie rock as independently as possible. I try to do as much of it myself as I can - no labels, no merch deals, no sponsors.\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.scarftough.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStream my last album\u003c/a\u003e to get a feel for my music.\nYou might see the name \"Scarftough\" floating around.

Instead of relying on a record label to produce, market, and distribute my music, I go directly to fans. That means I rely directly on fans for support. That\u0027s you! Patreon makes that possible. You can pledge a dollar (or more!) each time I release a new, original song - about once or twice a month. And you can put limits on how much you contribute each month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I use the money?\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nNo surprise here: equipment and software. Making quality music requires quality tools. With my Patreon proceeds, I will continually upgrade my resources so I can continue to improve the quality of the recordings I make for you. And when I get new stuff, I\u0027ll show it off to you! It\u0027ll be fun!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the rewards?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nThis is where I get really excited! I want you to hear my stuff!!! I have different levels to help you find the value that feels right to you. Take a look at the rewards menu, select the amount you like best, and let the music come to you!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you from the bottom of my heart.
