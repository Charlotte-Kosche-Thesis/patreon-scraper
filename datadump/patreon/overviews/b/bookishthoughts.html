In addition to all of my bookish content\u00a0I use my channel to share my experiences of studying, pursuing an academic career and sharing my passion for Ancient History and Classics, in what I hope is a fun and accessible way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also create a podcast called That\u0027s Ancient History, which you can listen to and download on most podcast apps and iTunes. The podcast deals specifically with antiquity all the way from ancient history to classics in the modern world. It is intended to be accessible and enjoyable by everyone, whether you have a classics degree or have never been introduced to the topic before. You can check it out on soundcloud here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-591915376\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/user-591915376\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cannot express how grateful I am to all of my patreon supporters as you make finding the time to convert my experiences and knowledge into videos and podcast episodes just that little bit easier.\u003cbr\u003e"
