I\nlean towards slightly more realistic versus exaggerated style. My\nfavorite genres tend towards fantasy, shojo (girls\u0027 comics) style\nromance, humor/slice of life, and a little science fiction. Though\nreally, I tend to love a little of everything, and more recently have\nbeen considering dabbling a bit into horror art. I have several ideas\nfor print series, comics, and even a couple dating sim style games\nthat I would love to get to sooner rather than later.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight\nnow, I largely do character drawings that have very little focus on\nanything other than the character themselves.  My goals for the\nfuture include working on aspects like background and composition\nwhile also working towards better/more complex and interesting poses.\n (Basically, I hope to start making illustrations as opposed to\njust character drawings.)

We all love (or hate?) the classic busty blonde in a\nchainmail bikini or the equally stereotypical \"savage\" from\na barbarian society that wears a tiger skin loincloth and runs around\non all fours.  But I\u0027ve decided that I want to do art of other\ntypes of strong females.  Part of this will be exploring\ndifferent body types.
