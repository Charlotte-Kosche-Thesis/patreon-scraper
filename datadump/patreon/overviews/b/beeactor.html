    "summary": "I have a history of over thirty years writing for the beekeeping press, including publishing monthly newsletters detailing current developments tailored to those actively managing the western honey bee, \u003cem\u003eApis mellifera\u003c/em\u003e. My present activities involve a website, the Apis Information Resource Center\u003ca\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and a monthly newsletter (blog), the\u00a0\u003cem\u003eApis Information Resource News \u003c/em\u003e(2300 subscribers)\u003cem\u003e,\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ededicated to exploring a wide range of topics of interest to both beginner and advanced beekeepers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHistorically provided at no cost to the beekeeping community, the time has come for readers to actively contribute to the distribution of the above works. The products and other potential creative content that might come out of this effort are best characterized here as a \"digest.\"\u00a0 Although the content and labor has been free so far, the platform used to publish both the website and blog is not. Hosting and associated fees, security licensing, and routine maintenance to ensure URLs are current are all required. In addition, there may be future expenses if net neutrality is repealed. Some financial assistance is being sourced through advertising on the website, but that is not sufficient. As a consequence, I am creating this digest dedicated to the beekeeping craft.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis activity will allow fans to actively participate in developing a robust communal resource with a minimum investment.\u00a0 The model here will be a $1.00 per paid posting to begin the activity.\u00a0 Thus, only one reward tier will be available.\u00a0 A mixture of both free and paid postings will be featured as this digest develops.\u00a0 Thanks for considering this appeal, and do let me hear from you about how this unique endeavor might be improved going forward.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
