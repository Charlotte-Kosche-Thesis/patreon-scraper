I\u0027m the guy a little to the left in that circle.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere\u0027s never enough time in a day. We ALL know this.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nI never thought of myself as a circus act until I became an adult, when I suddenly found myself juggling:\u00a0I am a full time artist, tattooer, illustrator, and father of two and have unyielding passion for writing, reading, and travel.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s cut to the chase, what exactly will patronage support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my paintings are done in liquid acrylic or oil, but sometimes I mix other mediums like colored pencil, watercolor, or charcoal in as well. More artwork can be seen at\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.atramentstudios.com/artwork.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eatramentstudios.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003ePyrography (or woodburning) had always been an interest of mine, but I didn\u0027t actually try it until about a year ago. I absolutely love it. For more pyrography work, go to\u00a0\n\t\u003ca href=\"http://www.burngallery.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eburngallery.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI got my very first comic book (a Batman one) when I was six years old and I was hooked. From then on I used to make little comic characters and make them fight to the death. Well, I kept doing it into my thirties, because here I am making webcomics with a buddy of mine. Below is the comic I\u0027m currently working on called Goody Good, a story about a good guy that does good things\u00a0only to screw it up in tragic and hilarious ways. To read more comics for FREE, go to\u00a0\n\t\u003ca href=\"http://www.comicsandcognac.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecomicsandcognac.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e \nSimple. It allows \n\t\u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e to support creators directly. Other crowdfunding sites fund PRODUCTS while Patreon funds THE PROCESS. That\u0027s right, by supporting my Patreon, you are directly, literally and graciously offering me MORE TIME to create. You can also read more about Patreon \u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBut wait, what do I, the patron, get in return?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\tIn exchange for your selfless act, I offer an exclusive \u0027open door\u0027 invitation to what I\u0027m working on. I\u0027ll constantly be posting new sketches, scripts, tutorials, story ideas, paintings, random thoughts AND even reality-altering quips about life and love (or something). And please, drop me a line and let me know what YOU would like to see.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOh, and if I see you in person, I\u0027ll give you a hug. Seriously.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
