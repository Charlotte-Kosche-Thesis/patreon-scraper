For now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we\u0027ve had more than a few viewers tell us that they would like to support us, and with YouTube ad revenue being what it is, we thought we would finally take some of them (you) up on their (your) offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of the day, this is another part of the YouTube experience that we\u0027re exploring.\u00a0 If you want to send a few bucks our way, we greatly appreciate it.\u00a0 And if, for any reason, you decide not to send money our way, but you\u0027re still watching our videos, we appreciate that, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eedited to add: We\u0027ve also started posting some of our thoughts here on Patreon.\u00a0 Not everything that occurs to us lends itself to a youtube video -- and even if something does, we may not always get around to making a video with that content.\u00a0 So you might find posts that are sneak previews of upcoming videos, and some that are exclusive for our Patreon supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
