    "summary": "Hey guys! I\u0027m Alan, and in the spring of 2014, I started The Hammer Brothers, a video game \"Let\u0027s Play\" show on YouTube with my brother Matthew. ( \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/BishNetwork\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.youtube.com/BishNetwork\u003c/a\u003e ) We\u0027ve enjoyed minor but meaningful success since then, but now I want to take my channel to the next level. In addition to improving the Let\u0027s Play show with better gameplay recording equipment, I want to create more live action videos and on-camera gameplay series. Unfortunately, I am saddled with massive student loan debt and my job can only just keep my head above water. I have ideas for unique YouTube shows, but without support, I may never have the time or resources to get them off the ground. Support from Patrons will afford me equipment that won\u0027t have to come out of my own pocket, which will allow me to focus on eliminating my debts while being able to spend more time and energy on my passion of entertaining my viewers. Thank you for reading and thank you for supporting!\u003cbr\u003e"
