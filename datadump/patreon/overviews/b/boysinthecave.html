Among our objectives is to inspire listeners to be more conscious of reality and active in their reflections, with coverage of a variety of topics. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur show intends to be a platform that provides much needed exposure as well as accessibility of information and support to the struggles and concerns that the youth have while growing up and realising their Deen. We anticipate engaging with guests in order to explore perspectives, raise awareness, provide tools, or lay down authoritative opinions.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those that are curious about the name, the motivation comes directly from the first story in Surah Al-Kahf that brings to attention the young men who retreated to the cave, away from their community, fearing for their religion due to the corruption and oppression.",
