    "summary": "Bay of Islands Radio is a registered non-profit community radio station broadcasting from beautiful Corner Brook, NL, currently located at 40 Brook Street.  The station is operated entirely by volunteers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBOIR has been around in some form or another since 2009, broadcasting to the world strictly through the internet. Its origins tie to the East Coast Music Awards, where a temporary FM radio station was setup to provide coverage of the event. From 2010 to January 2015 the station operated out of a small DJ booth inside the Grenfell Campus Student Union. With limited space to work with, the station required a new home to further expand. In late January 2015, the station began streaming music from its new location of 40 Brook Street, and in April, was back to producing programming for the community. This was a huge milestone for the station.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn October 2016, Bay of Islands Radio was granted a license to operate an FM community radio station in Corner Brook by Canadian Radio-television Communications Commission (CRTC). This license will permit the station to broadcast over the air on the FM broadcast band at a maximum of 50 watts of power, serving most of Corner Brook and sections of the North and South Shore. Fundraising is still underway to help purchase the necessary equipment to begin broadcasting on FM radio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo keep Bay of Islands Radio on the air, approximately $100 a month is required to cover operational costs such as internet, telephone, and streaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e100% VOLUNTEER OPERATED\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13934627_1186702064713930_8143475797406138087_n.jpg?oh=7799aca1df8f2394c0f8025170a83605\u0026amp;oe=58E02946\" style=\"width: 492px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHigh school student, Coby Joyce, hosting his weekly music show \u0027The Gravel Pit\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLOCAL NEWS AND EVENT COVERAGE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14054197_1193852900665513_215768785817605801_n.jpg?oh=be767e07be871a7768f7fd37f0d2c9c4\u0026amp;oe=58EF4B01\" style=\"width: 481px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVolunteers Doug Whitehorn (left) and Ronnie Rowsell providing coverage of a local event.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14956533_1276857459031723_1937900738935482668_n.jpg?oh=44662cbca0c4409e983e0a108445525e\u0026amp;oe=58F1C2CB\" style=\"width: 481px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecording an episode of \u0027The Mayor\u0027s Inbox\u0027 with Corner Brook Mayor Charles Pender.
