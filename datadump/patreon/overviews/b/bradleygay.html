    "summary": "I\nhave no set process. I have no set plan. Intentions of the painting materialize\nthe moment the paint touches the canvas\u0027 fibers. Insight is drawn from the\njuxtaposition of natural mechanics; wind, light, space. Form is drawn from\norganized unfamiliarity. Precision is followed by destruction as opposing\nforces. Essentially, my work illustrates an internal conflict with credence and\nthe subjugation of regularity; each decision, significant, and each movement,\nof consequence.  These movements\nexemplify nonconformity and emancipation. Simply put, my tools provide the\nunpredictable evolution for the future progression and visceral perception of a\npiece. It is these fleeting configurations that become hidden yet represented\nelements within the painting. The paint coalesces, dictates the emotion, and communicates\nhow it would like to progress while catalyzing some external degree of internal\ndialogue. To further expand upon my process, I retain some of the raw canvas\nexposed in the background while incorporating these often forgotten elements\ninto my painting, often as shapes, because I value the fresh and often muted\nintegration of the utilized material. In such a way, these locations of tranquility\nprovide the beauty of simplicity and curiosity without over-complicating the\nimage.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe\nmotivation behind creating is simply the exploitation of imagination. Without\nimagination, reality becomes sterility. My art conveys fleeting moments of\ndespair complemented by accents of hope, the hope that provokes the subtle\ntruth of ignorance. Perhaps, it is by this ignorance that I have found\nhappiness. As an individual with much to learn, my goals are expansive. It is\nmy intention to further enhance my process and share my work throughout the\ninternational art community. Art is the language of the unspoken; therefore, my\njob is to communicate this paradigm in a personalized, abstract context and\nprovide an experience for the viewer, whether strikingly uncomfortable or\nprofoundly memorable. Inspiration is generated from the fusion of natural and\nurban minutia; the reflective color patterns of light upon asphalt and steel\nduring a rain shower, the variation of marbleized stone in shaded light, the\nlinear path of light in rugged landscapes. My work illustrates what I observe,\nand what I observe at every moment is profoundly illuminating. I invite viewers\nto speculate the significance and transitional connection drawn from my work.\nOver time, my portfolio evolved from rudimentary paint strokes to the\nintroduction of new methodologies and media, while the emergence of personal\ngrowth and experimentation kindled the release from the confines of theory.\nCurrently, I am expanding my process via media experimentation and\nappropriation in addition to color palette manipulation while exploring the\nfluidity and drama concerning metaphorical matter and scenes of isolation.\u003cbr\u003e"
