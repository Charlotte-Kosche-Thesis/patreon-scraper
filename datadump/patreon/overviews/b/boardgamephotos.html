I love practical special effects in movies and wanted the elements in this \nproject to exist in the real world and make people wonder how they were \ncreated. All effects in the photos you see are created in-camera with minimal \npost-production work in Photoshop. Each photo takes, on average, about 3 to 4 hours to complete, \nwhich doesn\u2019t even include the time for concept and development! The \ncreation process is very soul-satisfying and sharing the final images with you is gratifying.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://boardgamephotos.com/images/patreon/patreon-samples.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eSupporting artists directly lets them know you like what they are doing and you want to help them continue creating.
