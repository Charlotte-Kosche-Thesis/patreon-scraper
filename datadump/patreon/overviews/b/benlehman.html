I would like to be able to spend more time polishing and releasing my experimental games, and the money from this Patreon will help me do that, buying not only more of my time, but also allowing me to hire artists and graphic designers and pay them a fair wage for their work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is ideologically important to me that all my work be available and accessible. Because of this, I don\u0027t charge money for the electronic versions any of my game work, small or large, though I do request donations on a sliding scale to allow those that can pay to do so. All games produced for this Patreon (with the possible exception of one private, personal game) will be available for free or pay-what-you-like-even-$0, just like all my other work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eTo give you an idea of the sort of games I\u0027m producing, check out \u003ca href=\"http://www.tao-games.com/?p=30\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBeloved\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.tao-games.com/?p=99\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u0026amp;c Beatrice \u0026amp;c\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.tao-games.com/?p=35\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eclover\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI plan on releasing these games once every one or two months. To begin with, though, there will be a faster rate of releases, because I have a number of projects I have had to backburner for economic reasons that I\u0027d like to be able to release. I will try to keep releases less frequent than one per calendar month.\u003c/p\u003e\n"
