Every little bit helps, as it allows me to reduce the time spent on my day job and spend that time on Tiled instead. I have a lot of plans, ranging from fixing open issues and implementing often requested features to developing new and exciting tools like a tablet-enabled version of Tiled or even a generic UI editor in the same spirit as Tiled.

Please consider \u003cem\u003ejoining this awesome community\u003c/em\u003e to make sure we can continue like this! Also, any support I receive on top of my two-days-per-week goal will go towards setting bounties on specific issues (using\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.bountysource.com/teams/tiled\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBountysource\u003c/a\u003e), which has proven to be a successful way to encourage more people to participate in Tiled development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTiled\u0027s future depends on your support.

This means that for one day a week, Tiled will not compete with all the other things I\u0027m trying to do in my limited spare time. I could finally get around to many of the frequently requested features! I will also  summarize the achievements of each week on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e",
