    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWELCOME\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThank you so much for making your way to my Patreon page. I have\nsome really big plans for the future and I am hoping that you will value what I am doing and want to join\nin the adventure with me.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis year I have embarked on a journey/life long ambition to be a professional\nworking illustrator. There have been many detours along the road to\nreach this point in my career and I\u0027m really excited about the future of this new enterprise.  I have recently\njust launched my website show casing my portfolio and I\u0027m planning to create a fortnightly\nblog very soon which will provide the opportunity for me to share the abundance\nof information and resources that I have collected along the way and give some\ninsight into what it is like starting a freelance business. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L3VF1oeL66o\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo why am I on Patreon you ask?\nThere are many great reasons. Firstly this is my way to let you all in on what I\u2019m doing. I believe its\nimportant to share this with you as I have had so much support from so many\npeople over the years and tonnes of encouragement to pursue my creative\ntalents. It can be an isolating experience\nworking as an artist, and you often forget there is a whole community of people\nthat want the opportunity to connect with you and support your work.\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is such an amazing community because it allows people to be directly\nengaged in the production of creative work not just in the role of consumer or\nclient. I also believe it can be a fantastic resource to support and encourage young and\nemerging artists to get themselves to a position in their art practice where they can support\nthemselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY PLEDGE\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor those of you able to support me I will be offering exclusive insights into my creative content and working process which you won\u0027t see anywhere else. There will also be rewards for Patrons including exclusive discounts in my online store, digital prints and original artworks. \u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who would like to give a once off donation there is the option to change the amount you would like to pledge under each reward tier. If you are making a donation amount there is no obligation to continue pledging that amount each month you can simply convert it back to one of the basic reward tiers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for visiting my Patreon page and I encourage you all to browse through the many talented creators that are already members of this awesome community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
