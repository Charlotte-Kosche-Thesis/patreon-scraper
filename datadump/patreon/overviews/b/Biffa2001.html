In fact I expect viewers to have a cuppa to hand during all video viewings!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI LOVE making videos to entertain YOU! Put that hand-in-hand with all the fantastic Indie games I discover that allow me to show off my creativity in so \nmany amazing ways and you have a match made in heaven.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy support Biffa?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout 5 years ago I was watched other peoples videos on YouTube and I thought \"I can do that\", so I bought a $10 headset and just did it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI worked hard at my hobby and loved every minute of it. Along the way I met a lot of great people and my channel slowly grew. During this time I was working for myself, running my own business that had been going for around 5 years already and would carry on for about another 5...until:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward 4 years and I was diagnosed with an illness that meant I had to give up my Self-Employed business of nearly 10 years. This was a huge shock to me and to say it was life changing seems too short a word to describe the changes we had to make as a family, on top of being very ill. My YouTube hobby took a back seat for a while. Though as time went on my illness improved to a point where I could get back to doing what I enjoyed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though I\u0027d said to myself many times \"I will never rely on just YouTube for my families income\", I had to do something, I had to earn someway. I had a very long discussion with my wife, told her all about the great community I was building on YouTube and we both agreed that I should jump in with two feet and make it work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was about this time I was asked by some of you, my viewers, to start a Patreon page. I\u0027d had a page reserved but hadn\u0027t made it live, but then I was persuaded to do so by you and what a great decision that was! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of my viewers amazing support on Patreon, content creation is now my full-time job. There\u0027s a long way to go to be comfortable, but your amazing support on Patreon has enabled me to work again to support my family AND to do something I love doing, providing laid back, Tea drinking, fun Let\u0027s Plays \u0026amp; Reviews on YouTube (and occasionally Twitch!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all started with a $10 headset and the will to just get stuck in and have fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat can I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. I am not just making videos. I am building a community of like minded people. We want to have fun together. We want to discover new and interesting games together and we want to drink Tea (this isn\u0027t a requirement but I will be checking when your last cuppa was) ;-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me on Patreon you are helping me to continue with my aim of working to support my family: Mrs Biffa, Biffa Boy and Little Biffa. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy reaching the goals I have set it would enable me to continue to grow my channel, offer more fun servers for you guys to enjoy (we have two Minecraft servers at the moment, one Vanilla, BiffaCraft, and one modded, BiffaTech) so we can have fun together, but most of all support my family financially which is always my main aim.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhether you are able to support me in this way or not (I know many of you want to but are unable to, that is OK), please continue to watch and listen to my insightful commentary, witty remarks and story\u0027s from my life whilst learning and enjoying my content...and drinking Tea of course! :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
