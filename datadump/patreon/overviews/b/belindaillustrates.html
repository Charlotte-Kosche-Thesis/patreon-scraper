I love to paint beautiful things mostly with a lot of colour. I love reading Fantasy and Sci-fi and incorporate these themes into my work. One day I would love to have a book (or 2...or more) written and illustrated by me and published. I have a couple of story ideas... Australian magpies dressed in Tudor styled clothing...small dragons kept as pets by Edwardian ladies who like a good cup of tea...a king who can\u0027t see faces but can only recognise his people when they wear a mask... My hope is that through Patron I can make this happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/878/39657522570_56be387956.jpg\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eI decided to join Patreon as a chance to connect to a wider community and give them more insight into the creation of my work - why I do it and how I do it.

I will share my art processes - how I go about creating an artwork from rough sketch to finished painting. I will also share my art techniques which I have developed over the last decade which includes drawing with Prismacolor Col-Erase pencils, painting in watercolour and touching up final art in photoshop using digital painting techniques.\u003cbr\u003eI have 20 years experience being an artist and can share all the knowledge I have gained from that time, including having to work a day job to make ends meet. As someone whose day job is working as a retail assistant at an art store I can also help with advice on art materials - from printmaking to sculpting to digital painting to painting in watercolour and everything in between (if I don\u0027t know something I can usually know where to look or who to ask to find out). So feel free to ask me anything about my art, my techniques or even some art material/technique you are struggling with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/821/41466307491_25fc529d61.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will get as a reward for patronage firstly my thanks and gratitude for helping me along my creative journey, patrons will have an opportunity to offer input and feedback on story ideas, sketches and paintings.
