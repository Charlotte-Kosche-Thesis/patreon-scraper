At a young age, I developed a deep love for storytelling, a passion that I carried into adulthood. I studied New Media Communications at Oregon State University, where I specialized in audio and video production.

That\u0027s right! All you\u0027ve gotta do is pledge to support me a small amount (you can get some of the best rewards for less than the cost of a single latte at Starbucks) and I\u0027ll provide you with some of the best content on the internet (in my humble opinion. Then again, I am a little biased...). All exclusive content will stay exclusive to my patrons for at least a month, so if you want to see some of this stuff as early as possible, support me today!"
