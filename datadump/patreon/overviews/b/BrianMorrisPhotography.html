    "summary": "Hello Patrons, The Time is Now and Forever! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease leave your ego and comfort zone at the door. Become something other than the old you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I am proud to present to you, The Tinfoil Muse Collection, a fine-art gallery of images for the study of women\u2019s health. It is my intrinsic passion for female equality that has fueled this very personal project and it is my hopeful dream that my art unabashedly illuminates the subject matter. The theoretical aim of this project is to bring awareness to the female condition as it exists today in our societies. The practical goal of this project is to help combat the stigmatism that women face in our societies and to promote fair discussion. I invite you to join me on this photographic journey for your own appreciation and for the women in your life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 The Tinfoil Muse Collection is a multigenerational, multicultural, and multiethnic collection of women. Brave women from all walks of life will share their stories of adversity and triumph with you. Each image will be the reflection of an intimate aspect of a woman\u2019s life and experiences that have molded her essence. The subject matter of each image will be subjective to each woman\u2019s biology, character, and other self-defining conditions. The images are designed to intrigue its audience and create a desire for passionate but respectful discussion. The Tinfoil Muse Collection will include but not be limited to the following topics: cancer survivors, vegan/vegetarianism, body shamming, anxiety, depression, motherhood, rape survivors, women\u2019s health access, aging, healthy living/fitness, trauma, and joy. Some of the above-mentioned topics are currently controversial and therefore it is my desire to give them an equitable platform to share much-needed insight on the matter.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Tinfoil Muse Collection was created as a form of awareness and advocacy for female equality. My lifelong appreciation for the feminine has compelled me to create works of art that empower women and elicit strong emotions about contentious subjects. It is my belief that if art evokes strong emotions then a discussion should follow. My experience with classical art as a young man proved to be a life-long experiential and transformative part of my life. I witnessed a regard for women that was not rooted in sexuality but instead one based independently of gender. Since then it has only seemed right to be an ally for a population that has been oppressed for so many years. I have been fascinated with the art of womanhood for so long that The Tinfoil Muse Collection was born of my deep-seated empathy for all women. It is my wish to contribute to the understanding, respect, and appreciation of women. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 The complex nature of women has been my main inspiration. The epithet \u201cTin Foil Muse\u201d draws its influence from the adaptability of a woman\u2019s strength. Women just like their counterpart, aluminum aka \u201ctin foil,\u201d possess exceptional malleability. This versatility can be seen in physical and emotional capacities. Aluminum is the Earth\u2019s third most abundant element and therefore it is of zero toxicity to the prosperity of humans. It often seems that women are deemed dangerous or inherently illicit, when in fact, they are not, just like aluminum. The ability of women to exist despite the constant attacks that attempt to undermine their worthiness is a valiantly remarkable strength. This project is intended to evoke feelings of strength and vulnerability and highlights the delicate, yet strong nature of women all over the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 The Tinfoil Muse Collection is a celebration of women in their most basic and pure form. The nude style has been chosen as a means of stripping away the distractions from what a woman is and is not. In this project, nudity is meant to be seen as a vision of purity and not lewdness. The nudity of the subjects is a celebration of women at a fundamental state. While the flesh is not the core of womanhood, it is the vessel that must be recognized as well as respected for it carries the soul of the individual. Therefore, it is crucial that we protect its autonomy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Your donation helps fund this informative psychosocial project that aims to reform how we think of and treat the women in our lives. Subjects are paid for the contribution of their time. Production costs will be kept to a reasonable minimum. In return for your donation, you receive access to awesome content respective to the tier which you have pledged. It\u2019s totally in your hands! Pledge today \u0026amp; let\u2019s level the playing field!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is not my movement. It is \u0027Their Movement\u0027 and I stand with them!\u003cbr\u003eWhat about you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is with all my love that I say thank you for stepping up.\u003cbr\u003eBrian \u003cbr\u003e"
