South Korea, he studied Taekwondo, was beat down, then got beat down a little more by the five year old grommets he was trying to teach English to. New Zealand, a van was bought, inspiration was found, then the van was sold for the same price nine months later. Australia, where he really fell in love, became familiar with summer under the Harbor Bridge, and watched giant fruit bats squeak across a dusky sky. Colombia, he traded his life for a graphic novel, became a hermit, and butchered the little Spanish he never knew. He is currently in Portland, Oregon hoping blackberry picking season lasts all year long. Throughout the years and across all of the miles, two things have remained constant \u2014 his love of art, coffee, and comics.",
