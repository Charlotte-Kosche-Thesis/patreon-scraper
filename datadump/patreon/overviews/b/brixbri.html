As well as starting my cosplay adventure, I am teaching myself how to make concepts, designs, \u0026amp; animations for videos games!

I enjoy drawing, painting, and sculpting with all mediums, and I even do some 3D sculpting. I am a beginner to cosplay with only a handful of characters under my belt but I am so in love with the craft! I love streaming artwork live, game with my viewers, and sometimes make cosplay live!

As long as I\u0027m making something no matter what it is.. that is what really makes me happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had a full time job in the tech industry, with amazing people. But I had been laid off in March 2015, and since then decided I wanted to do something I LOVED. So I took the jump and sacrificed a lot of things and start my self-employed adventure. I want to feel like I\u0027m doing something that will inspire others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can I help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport me in anyway you can or want. Make sure to follow me on social media and here on Patreon! I love interacting with viewers while streaming and playing video games. Please don\u0027t donate or pledge if you cannot afford to do so.
