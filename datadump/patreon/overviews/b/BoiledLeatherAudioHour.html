Of course, you can attribute this to our six-hour timezone gap and be done with it, but there\u0027s more to it than that. Sean works as a full-time freelancer to support his family, and scraping time out for podcasting is a daunting proposition that often means giving up time reserved for paying work. What\u0027s more, we want to give you better quality podcasts, and for this, having better gear is important. But that stuff is expensive too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here we are, asking you for support. With your pledges, you can help the Boiled Leather Audio Hour generate just enough income to commit to it more fully with extra material and research and to produce more and better podcasts, every month. There are rewards for various levels of pledges, but any amount at all helps. Thank you so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
