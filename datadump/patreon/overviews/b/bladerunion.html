Our\nsmall global community has numerous outlets and sources for content to surface,\nand we don\u0027t have a central way to help promote that content. Our idea was to\nbecome a neutral party to all of this and help grow everyone by giving a\ncentral location to explore everything inline skating has to offer. The\nlandscape has shifted from physical media of the past, to virtual media of the\nfuture. Message boards have shrunk in both size and popularity. As information\nbecomes more quickly and widely available, finding all of that information\nbecomes a larger challenge. Some content overcomes these hurdles and gets wide\nspread to the masses, but many great pieces are left only to the locals to\ndiscover and share. Blader Union is home to the best content from the\nbiggest professionals and best cinematographers. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur largest goal with Blader Union is to reinvest\neverything we have back into inline skating. Through our Patreon campaign and\ndonations, we reinvest nearly 100% of the money we take in through the site,\nback to the industry as a whole. The funds we collect will be transparently\ndisplayed, accounted for, and redistributed back through the form of payments\nfor our Crowd Funded series, interviews, contest sponsorships, purchases for\nVODs, and other avenues we can find to help grow every reach of skating. Our\noverhead costs are near zero, and the time spent on the site is 100% volunteer\nbased. We will never take a paycheck, payment, or cash out for our time on\nBlader Union. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy backing our Patreon you are helping us grow inline\nskating internally to in turn increase our value to the outside world.\nInvesting in our Patreon give us the ability to pay riders and creators for\nprojects they want to do. Our goal is to back 4 major projects per year,\nlaunching 1 per quarter. We also have the ability to back great content from\npodcasters to content creators. And lastly these funds help us sponsor contests\nacross the globe to help increase the overall purse and value for athletes to\ncompete for the top spot. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince creating this Patreon in May of 2017 we have collected\nover $1,000 that has been returned back into the industry.  We have paid out Eugen Enin for his Crowd\nFunded project, backed the Truspin Podcast for the last 5 months, and paid out\na winner of the No Pain, No Gain contest back in September. This coming year we\nare looking to even further that footprint with the Crowd Funded Series,\nsponsoring even more contests, sponsoring more podcasters, and finding ways to\nreturn back to our backers in the form of free contest entries, product give\naways, VOD download codes, and more. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAn absolutely massive thank you to the people who believed\nin us since day 1, and those who are still supporting us today. This has been a\ntough road filled with unforeseen hurdles, challenges to overcome, tense late\nnights, and long conversations trying to bring you the best of inline skating.\nOur further promise to our backers over this next year is more communication,\nmore clarity, and more of your investment having a larger and more visible\nimpact. Expect to see more posts directed to our backers, more returns on your\ninvestments, and more exposure in the coming weeks. These are exclusive\nincentives for our backers and we intend to keep being a service worth\ninvesting into. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBlader Union is run entirely by Travis Stewart and Daniel\nNodzak. Our emails addresses are \u003ca href=\"mailto:Travis@BladerUnion.com\"\u003eTravis@BladerUnion.com\u003c/a\u003e\nand \u003ca href=\"mailto:Daniel@BladerUnion.com\"\u003eDaniel@BladerUnion.com\u003c/a\u003e. If you\never have questions, complaints, compliments, or would like to work together on\nany project large or small, do not hesitate to reach out. We are always\nevolving, always growing, and always bettering the site and ourselves daily. Your\nfeedback is always welcome. Join in and support inline skating because\ntogether, we can shape this and make it brighter for everyone still here and\neveryone who\u2019s yet to arrive. At the end of the day, this is a labor of love\nfor us here. Nothing matters more than the skates on our feet. - Blader Union\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

With a mix of in-house filmed and edited, and professionally done outside of our hands, we should be able to deliver a new video every 1-2 months with 100% of the payout going to the rider and videographer. We are now sponsoring most major contests throughout the year, and our presence will be at many of them. If we cross this goal, we\u0027d look to onboard someone else into our ranks to help maintain the site and day to day operations, continuing to volunteer our time and never ask for anything in return. All of our backers will be able to purchase in-house made clothing and goods at cost, and all in-house VODs will be free for every subscriber.\u00a0",

Your voice determines who we pay, who we work with, and who can properly be elevated to a real professional level. Our backers will be granted quarterly rewards for backing with us in the form of free contest entries, free clothing and goods, and free VODs. We are now hosting contests for people around the globe and adding to the purses of existing ones. We still will never take a cash out or paycheck for ourselves. 99% of all funds each month are being payed out to people in the industry. Your backing continues to ignite the flame of growth in the industry, and we are proud to help shape that future along with you. If everyone who believes in this work and the labor we are doing here donated $1 a month, together we could make this a reality and be the change inline skating needs.\u00a0",
