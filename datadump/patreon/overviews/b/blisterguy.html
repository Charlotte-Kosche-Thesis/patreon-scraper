Any support you can offer is greatly appreciated, and will help me produce more content for everyone to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince January 2016 I have released 3 episodes a week of Walk to Work - A Mobile Hearthstone Podcast. Each episode is around 20-30 minutes long and is me talking about and playing Hearthstone on my walk to work. I really enjoy recording these episodes I hope to continue for some time to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn January 2017, I created an Infographic breaking down the popular Reno Mage decks at the time and it was surprisingly popular. So a week later I did another one, and then another one, and I\u0027ve produced an average of 1 Hearthstone Infographic a week since then. I would love to keep that up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan to continue producing this content as well as building a regular Twitch Stream schedule. If you could spare even the cost of a coffee once a month, your contribution would go a long way towards helping me cover the ever increasing costs associated with creating this content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading,\u003cbr\u003eRay \"blisterguy\" Walkinshaw"
