I make creations with heart and whimsy. They are more than wool sculptures. They are souls that are forever protected in the forms they create for themselves through my hands.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeedle felting is an expensive and time consuming craft. Because of lack of resources and time, I am simply unable to put as much time as I would love to in creating or sharing my progress.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWith your support and assistance, I can focus more of my time, stress free allowing me to be able to create more and to be able to create freely.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBat n`Bunny not only includes needle felted creations, but also accessory designs, illustration and so on. my dream is to bring to life BnB gifts, such as stationary, stickers, home wares and even the absolute dream of fashion and jewelry!\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy honorable hunbuns on Patreon will have access to behind the scenes exclusives that I do not share anywhere else. Work in progress photos, voting or opinion polls on future BnB projects or merch, first looks on all BnB felting and illustration designs. Daily life adventures with Tom and Toulouse.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePledges $5 and above will receive a hand written update letter every time new postcard designs are developed. As well as major holiday greeting cards. This allows me to be able to have a more personal relationship with my honorable hunbuns, something that is very important to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eGold Bunny pledges will also have exclusive access to needle felting tips and tricks! these will ONLY be available to my Gold Bunnies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that rewards will be acknowledged after first payment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really cannot do it without you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ewith Lots of Love and Bunny Binkies\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eGabby\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
