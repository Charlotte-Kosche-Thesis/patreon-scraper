My patrons can expect to be charged on a steady monthly basis. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-- INTRODUCTION--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey everyone! Some of you may know me as BlueZone, some of you may know me personally, but I want to set aside my identity as a competitive player and content creator for a minute and talk about the real me for the people who don\u0027t know. My name is Shaydon, I\u0027m 21, I\u0027m an Albertan dude who\u00a0takes interest in video games (most notably Smash) and makes video content for it. I love making cool things, and that doesn\u0027t apply to my video edits alone, I also create digital art and sometimes animation, which are skills I definitely plan on applying into my video content in the future. But as a matter of fact, I\u0027ve been hopping from job to job, trying to find some financial stability in my own life which isn\u0027t very fun (it sucks a lot), and Patreon is the extra support I\u0027ve been needing. All funds through here help me directly with bills, investments, and other life stuff. I appreciate any and all support given whether it be through donation or just sharing my page and/or videos. :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS: If anyone is having trouble connecting to the Discord server after donating, please message me personally and I\u0027ll take care of it for you!\u003cbr\u003e"
