Some of this is my Spoken Word poetry, which is how most people in Trinidad know me. And recently, I\u0027ve discovered an interesting idea for a story that I want to tell in serial form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost importantly, I want to build a small community where I can tell stories, experiment with different kinds of stories, and share about why I tell them as I endeavor to tell more. All of this is why I\u0027m on Patreon. So, here goes...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"125\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5726/30563833824_2da79f4152.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEvery month for as long as you\u0027re with me, I\u0027m going to write/produce one Spoken Word piece and one episode of my serial\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u0027That Which Fools Call God\u0027\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0The serial is an interesting, horrific adventure that I want to figure out chapter by chapter, hopefully just as much with you as for you.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eAdditionally, I\u0027ll write one stage play every three months, \u003c/strong\u003ein keeping with the content that started me on Patreon\u003cstrong\u003e.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eMost of those plays will be based on aspects of Caribbean identity - imaginings of local folklore, stories about West Indian family life, plays challenging Caribbean faith/politics/masculinity. Others might be outside of the Caribbean, and even outside of this world! Some of it, you\u0027ll even get to decide for me. All of it, though, I\u0027ll share with you, along with progress reports and tips that help me write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we reach my $750 goal, I\u0027ll have the means to share professional audio tracks and videos for some of my Spoken Word, as well as recordings of my stories. Some of my higher goals will let me feature other performers in my Spoken Word work, partner with other creators to create additional works of art, and even put on a show for you fine folks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe journey starts now. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you in?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
