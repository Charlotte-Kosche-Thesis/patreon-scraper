    "summary": "Hi. Thanks for visiting Bobby\u0027s Patreon 2.0 page. Please feel free to look around. A Big Thank You to my patrons for their continued support and encouragement. It means the world to me and I look forward to continuing our creative journey together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons who pledge $5 or more a month are enrolled in the subscription service and receive ebooks from my catalog each month  as well as new releases and the monthly Nash News email newsletter. They also get advance looks and sneak peeks of projects in development.  Subscribe today! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Bobby\u0027s Patreon 2.0?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started this page, it was to help raise a little extra money for convention travel. In 2017, I found myself underemployed on the day job front and caring for two sick parents, which equaled a full time job. At that point, Patreon became a means to help pay some bills. As I go into 2018, I am redoubling my efforts to write full time and make my freelance writing and my BEN Books creator-owned publishing imprint a going concern. Patreon money will help me keep eating and a roof over my head while I get things moving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also talked with my patrons and after hearing their ideas and feedback, I am making some changes to the page. The monthly sketch giveaway has been tabled for the time being. I still love doing them, but with a limited number of patrons they were winning often and after a while, the free art loses some appeal, I think.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFree giveaways will become more organic going forward. At times, I will do a drawing for either paperback copies of new releases or a sketch or whatever I have that is perfect for a giveaway. I\u0027m working up some cool ideas on that score. Stay tuned for details as I get everything ironed out.\u00a0These giveaways would be exclusive to patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother area of interest was in doing blog post style tutorials about writing. I recently released a post about creating the cover for my novel, Deadly Games! and I am planning a series of posts about the creation process I use when writing. Those are coming up soon and will be exclusive to patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also playing around with the idea of doing Patron exclusive interviews with other creators where we will discuss the creative process. Those would start as patron exclusives and then rolled out to the general public at a later date. I\u0027m still trying to work the bugs out on this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are early day ideas. As always, I am open to suggestions. If there are topics you would like me to blog about, I would be happy to take suggestions. If you\u0027ve got questions, send them along as well. I\u0027ll answer them here as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe monthly ebook giveaway will not change and I will make ebook copies of all of my new releases available to you as well, publisher permitting (although, so far this has not been a problem).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s go create something together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBobby\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#####\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBobby\u0027s Patreon 1.0:\u003cbr\u003eHi. Thanks for visiting my Patreon page. Please feel free to look around.A Big Thank You to my patrons for their continued support and encouragement. It means the world to me and I look forward to continuing our creative journey together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little about me and why I\u0027ve set up this Patreon page. I\u0027m Bobby Nash. I\u0027m a writer of novels, comic books, short stories, graphic novels, and even a screenplay or two. I have even won an award or a few for some of my work. You can learn more about me and my work at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.bobbynash.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.bobbynash.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI originally started this Patreon page as a way to help cover the costs associated with writing and traveling to conventions, of which I do about 15 a year, on average. I would love to travel greater distances for cons to spread the word about my work. In recent months, my day job went away and now I\u0027m trying to make a go of it as a full-time writer while taking care of my ailing father. I was also taking care of my mother, but she, sadly, lost her battle with cancer on September 1, 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, I\u0027m off to a good start, but still not quite enough to pay the bills so Patreon funds will also go toward\u00a0paying the occasional car payment or phone bill. The bills never seem to stop coming, do they?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m using Patreon like a subscription service for my books. Each month, I send out at least one ebook to my patrons at the $5 and above levels. If a book is released in that month, they will get that one as well. Some months, they get one, but usually it is more than one. $5 a month is actually cheaper than buying them outright, but this way the majority of the money flows to the author.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those interested in supporting me here, first off, Thank You. I offer some exclusive and first looks at novellas I\u0027m producing myself through my BEN Books imprint. Patreon supporters will see those before anyone else. I do a monthly giveaway and supporters names will go in the hat for those prizes. I\u0027ll also do the occasional artwork for supporters as well. I can also do either hangouts or Skype groups as well once I work out the logistics. There\u0027s also an idea I\u0027m floating for one on one or group tutorial sessions. I think that could be fun. I\u0027d love the opportunity to meet my Patrons face to face at conventions and offer a special deal or two at my table. I\u0027m sure other ideas will come to me as I go along, but if you have any ideas, I\u0027d love to hear them. Maybe we can make them happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve read this far down and are still here, thanks for checking out my Patreon page. I appreciate your support. Let\u0027s create some cool stuff together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBobby\u003cbr\u003e"
