    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHello! My name is Brendan Keogh. I\u0027m a videogame critic and academic from Melbourne, Australia. You might have seen my writing on \u003cem style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003eUnwinnable\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003eEdge\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003ePolygon\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003eOverland\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003eArs Technica\u003c/em\u003e, or somewhere else. Maybe you read this book-length piece of criticism I wrote on \u003cem style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003eSpec Ops: The Line\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://gumroad.com/l/fsdz\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKilling is Harmless\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recently used this Patreon page to create\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtu.be/zH-sDMLGR8c?list=PLoN-AaQc-uK76KW5lXuLyKqGR-OyxiGYH\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea \"Critical Let\u0027s Play\" video series of the Modern Warfare trilogy of games\u003c/a\u003e, and I really enjoyed doing that. I thought it would be good if there was a way for people to be able to support me while I do this, because videogame criticism is important and the people who make it deserve to be supported. Now that I have finished that series, I am going to use this Patreon page to continue making Critical Let\u0027s Play videos of other games!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s a Critical Let\u0027s Play video? \u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s somewhere between a video essay about a game, and a normal Let\u0027s Play video. In my first series, I played through \u003cstrong\u003ethe single-player campaigns\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0of\u00a0all three Modern Warfare games, while talking about them in a critical and analytical sense. I didn\u0027t just react to the games, but talked about particular, moment-to-moment design and storytelling decisions. So whereas a written essay (my usual line of work) would allow me to talk about the games in broad strokes, what these video series let me do is get into the fine-grain of what I find interesting about these games (while also connecting these grains to the broader themes). Things like how a particular corridor is shaped to direct the player\u0027s gaze at a certain scene, or the way the music shifts over the course of a single stage, or the way a stage in a later game references a stage in an earlier game.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003eWhat games are you going to play? \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve already played through the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare trilogy, and you can see those videos\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoN-AaQc-uK76KW5lXuLyKqGR-OyxiGYH\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. For my next game, I\u0027ve already started recording a playthrough of \u003cem style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003eMax Payne 3 \u003c/em\u003e(now being uploaded\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoN-AaQc-uK6gpzWcXln_IdT6LPhKUPZ0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e), which is a game I find incredibly interesting for its level of polish and the general rhythm of the game. After that, I am thinking of doing something a little bit more obscure and strange by playing through \u003cem style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003eBinary Domain\u003c/em\u003e, a Japanese cover shooter full of fascinating themes and characters. After that, we\u0027ll see where things take me. After those two games, I will probably put it up to a vote to my Patrons to decide what games I do next.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to playing through full games, I would also like to do other videos where I maybe just play one chapter of a game, or just move around an open-world game for a while so I can talk about that environment. For instance, I would really like to record a single video where I drive across the barren wasteland that is \u003cem\u003eFuel\u003c/em\u003e\u0027s open world. Or maybe play some indie games, like\u00a0\u003cem\u003eProteus\u003c/em\u003e, which would only require a single episode or two.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo How\u0027s This Going To Work? \u003c/strong\u003eWell. I will play through the games and create videos that are at least 20-30 minutes in length (sometimes they might be longer), that I will then add to a YouTube playlist. There will be a break between each game while I go off and record the next game, and I will provide plenty of warning in case you have no interest in whatever I am doing next and want to remove your patronage. When I am uploading new episodes, I am going to continue to upload a new video \u003cstrong\u003etwice weekly\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0(once on Sundays and once on Wednesdays). Other individual videos about other games might appear around these videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I am asking for patrons to pledge an amount per video, which I will be posting in bursts (quite frequently for a while, then none for a while). Patreon doesn\u0027t allow you to pledge less than $1 a video but you can, of course, also use the monthly cap option if you wanted to pledge less per video. For instance, a $5 monthly cap would mean you are giving me less than $1 per video, which would be totally fine!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen Will You Start? \u003c/strong\u003eI am currently recording some videos for \u003cem\u003eMax Payne 3\u003c/em\u003e, and I plan to start uploading those in December, probably. I am deliberately waiting a while before I upload these so that my existing Patrons have a chance to withdraw their pledges since this project was exclusively about \u003cem\u003eModern Warfare\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0when they came onboard.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s With That $100 Goal? \u003c/strong\u003eSo a few people asked me if I was going to put subtitles on my Modern Warfare videos. This is something I simply don\u0027t have time to do myself, sadly, but I\u0027m paying somebody some of the money I made from doing that series to slowly do that. But this is something I\u0027ld like to formalise with future videos. So once this Patreon gets to $100 per video, I will either start using a percentage of that money to pay someone to implement the subtitles on each video in a timely fasion, or find the time to do it myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that is that! If you have any questions or concerns, please don\u0027t hesitate to reach out to me either on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/brkeogh\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e or via\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:brendankeogh86@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eemail\u003c/a\u003e. I have also archived the old version of this Patreon page\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20141102225304/http://www.patreon.com/brkeogh\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, from when it was just for my Modern Warfare Critical Let\u0027s Play series."
