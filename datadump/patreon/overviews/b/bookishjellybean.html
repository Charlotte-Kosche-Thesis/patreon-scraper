    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"https://bookishjellybean.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Bookish Jelly Bean\u003c/a\u003e started, like most things, as an idea. What if, I thought to myself, I started reviewing every book in the \u003cem\u003e1001 Children\u0027s Books You Must Read Before You Grow Up\u003c/em\u003e list according to a bunch of left-leaning criteria? I\u0027m fairly socially conscious. I have a Masters degree in Children\u0027s Literature, so I\u0027m even kind of qualified to do this sort of analysis. And, when I polled my crowd, it seemed like there was a real audience for something like this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther left-leaning parents I knew said they\u0027d love a resource like this, somewhere they could go to see how the \"great classics\" of kiddielit measured up to liberal ideologies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love doing this. I love kids\u0027 books (obviously, since I spent a significant portion of my life studying them), and it\u0027s great fun to track down these books and hold them up to liberal yardsticks and see how they fare. The blog is, and shall remain, totally free. Every post will go up publicly and free for anyone to read. I really hope that over time it becomes a valuable resource.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what I\u0027m doing, and would like to support my doing it, supporting me here is an awesome way to do that. I will make my first post of the week a paid post, and also my last, but only if I have actually posted every day. So the first and the seventh of every week. If I don\u0027t get to seven, then it\u0027ll only be the one paid post. If you can\u0027t afford that level of activity, please make use of the monthly cap option. Every tiny bit helps, and I am grateful for any support I get.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money will go firstly to tracking down the books that I can\u0027t get through the library - some are pretty obscure and not easy or cheap to find. Anything extra will go to supporting your humble reviewer. :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will get the chance to request reviews of books that are not on the list, a bit later in the process. I want to get my rhythm going before I open up that option, but I think there is much benefit to also look at other books - books not in the \"Must Read\" canon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://bookishjellybean.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThanks for reading\u003c/a\u003e, and for supporting if you can and choose to. And even if you can\u0027t, please keep reading and engaging. Because this works a lot better as the start of a discussion. :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
