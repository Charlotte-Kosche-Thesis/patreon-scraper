    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eA Few Words: Why I Would Love\nto Have Your Support\u2026\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor the past 12 years as a full time studio artist, I have\nhad the incredible fortune to be able to support myself by creating and selling\nthe work in order to keep my studio doors open and the lights on.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nStudio\n740:  a place to bring like-minds\ntogether\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHowever, the last few years have\nseen a dramatic change in the rhythm of my working days.  Beginning a new group studio project, called\nStudio 740, here in Helena, MT with my partner, Alessandro Gallo, we are bringing\nin other artists to work with us, challenge us, and collaborate with projects, ideas,\npractice, and fuel for the excitement of creating.  A lot of our travels internationally and\nacross the US have put us in touch with so many amazing artists from every end\nof the spectrum, that we were really inspired to create a modest space where we\ncould reciprocate that energy and invite them to come to us. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn addition, I am mentoring 4-8\ninterns each year by inviting them into my studio to work with me on these\nprojects and be a permanent part of them as they emerge from the studio.  It\u2019s an incredibly intense experience!  But I cannot stress how important their\ndedication and donated hours has been to me. \nMonthly support from patrons on this site would help provide financial assistance\nwith travel and lodging for those assistants, as well as collaborators, and\noutside specialists. (see below!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nI\nwant to do those projects we were always told not to try at home\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have always nurtured a secret\npassion for crazy projects involving robotics, mad kid-science inspired pieces,\ninteractive works, and collaborative projects that push waaay beyond the normal\nscope of what I can do alone in my studio. A few of these projects include the\nmechanical breathing goat: \u201cA Second Kind of Loneliness,\u201d the tattooed hare:\u201cL\u2019Amante,\u201d\nthe 30 ft long hand-stitched bride: \u201cThe White Hind,\u201d and the insane sugar\nencrusted chandelier:\u201cThe Adoration\u201d \u2013 most works from my New York solo show\nwith the Claire Oliver Gallery in 2012, called \u201cCome Undone\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThese pieces have been relatively\nrare in my studio, due to the incredible amount of resources that they require,\nin addition to compensation for the other artists and assistants who are part\nof those herculean projects.  If I had\neven a modest source of additional funding that didn\u2019t take away from my time\nproducing the other works, it would have a huge impact on the type of\nexperimentation that you would see emerging.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCreating\na body of work specifically made for a public exhibition \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPerhaps most importantly, I would like\nto have your support, on even the smallest scale, because the audience I make\nmy work for cannot afford to purchase the pieces or even see them as they\ndisappear into private collections. Most people have only ever seen my work on\nthe internet.  While I am humbled by how\namazing that is that I can reach so many people this way, it is not at all the\nsame as experiencing the scale and presence of the work in person.  With that in mind, I\u2019d like to focus the next\n2-3 years on creating work for a public museum setting that would travel to\nhalf a dozen cities across the US. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have already begun planning and\ncreating with this goal in mind. \nHowever, in practical terms, this will take me well over 2-3 years to\ncreate, during which time I cannot sell the work I am saving for the\nexhibition.  If through a few small\ngrants and the support here, I was able to supplement that missing income, it\nwould allow me to use this time solely for the purpose of bringing together a\nbody of work for this exhibition.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt is an ambitious proposal for the\nnext 3 years, but I am practically glowing in the dark, I\u2019m so excited.  I have had a fantastic outpouring of support\nthrough my website, Instagram, and from every school, residency, and\norganization I have encountered.  These\nare all people who have been inspired and in return, continue to inspire\nme.  I hope you will join in supporting\nthat enthusiasm and any donation that you feel is doable and appropriate.  I promise I will transform it into the most\nmysterious and emotionally charged images that I can create\u2026\u003cbr\u003e"
