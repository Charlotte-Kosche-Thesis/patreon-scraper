You\u0027re the best! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMore about me: I\u0027m a lover of games, photography, fashion, anime, manga, and art! By supporting me you are giving me the means to create cosplays and bring amazing content to you. I love befriending new people, so eventually I want to go to conventions all over the place if possible! I\u0027ve always had an interest in art and crafts, as well as photography, so cosplay mixes it all together for me. It\u0027s been an amazing experience so far and I look forward to seeing what else I can do with my interests!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do both regular cosplay shoots and lingerie shoots for Patreon. I love lewd shoots, and so I offer it as a part of some of my patreon rewards. I do both cosplay lewds and casual lingerie lewds. I don\u0027t do nudes though,so if you are looking for that this is not the place to be!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause I am using my own money to purchase cosplays and material it takes about two-three months to finish one. I have only started cosplaying February/March 2017 and I have came a long way from then. My first cosplay was bought, and it was Rem from Re:Zero. My second was Raven from Teen Titans which I made. Flash forward to now and I am working on Yang from RWBY and Berry from Tokyo Mew Mew! I recently started experimenting with EVA foam and other materials for prop-making. I can\u0027t wait to see what the rest of the year brings!"
