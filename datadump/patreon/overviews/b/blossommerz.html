Now I\u0027m leaving the mountains that I love and the mountains that I know in favor of the arts communities and opportunities of New Mexico.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I Do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFolks have known me for years as \u003cem\u003eThe Weaving Monk\u003c/em\u003e, carefully handweaving hundreds of gorgeous garments and sending them home with happy people all up and down the West Coast. A long, slow shoulder injury sent me in search of a new craft. (Don\u0027t be too sad. The skill I acquired is not lost.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eBridgette Extraordinaire\u003c/strong\u003e studied and worked with me for two years to master every step of my complex weaving style and then make it her own. Be sure to check her weaving on her website:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://raanuhandwoven.com/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eraanuhandwoven.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. She is really going places!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I am producing letterpress printed work on original equipment from the 1890\u0027s. The art might look different, but it really uses the exact same skills I\u0027ve been employing for years. I create original designs and spend all day operating gorgeous antique machines with many complex moving parts to produce those designs. The complexity of the process and the mastery of arcane historical skills are integral to the beauty to me. The journey is the destination.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Happening Now\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I launched the letterpress business as a part-time venture a year ago, I took a big risk and focused on the only folks who had a real income in Southern Oregon - cannabis producers. I gained the skills and did some fantastic projects in that industry before, from the perspective of my customers, the industry collapsed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the same time, some longterm friends of mine invited me to come and live with them in Cerrillos, New Mexico. At 30 minutes from Santa Fe, which is famous for the culture of support for the arts, I will have vastly more opportunities available to me after I get the business moved, up and running.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Are Supporting\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe move halfway across the country is a big change. I need to land in a completely new environment, get the word out to find new customers, do awesome work for them, and wait for the referrals to come in. I\u0027ve built numerous businesses before and I know that the cycles of reputation and referrals will take time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me through Patreon, you\u0027re helping me to land on my feet and have a fighting chance of getting this new business up and running. Then I will support queer community as I have always done. I expect to be part of a brand new network of queer artists in this tiny desert town.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I get to the upper levels of support, I will have a dedicated studio again and offer education and resources to underserved queer communities in the area. If New Mexico is anything like the west coast, this will most likely be trans folks and people of color.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
