I also want to thank you if you watch my videos. I wouldn\u0027t be able to do this if it were not for people like you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love movies and I want to share that love with as many people as possible. I also want to make sure that I deliver the absolute best content that I can. While I love making videos about movies it does come at the sacrifice of my time, energy and money. For example I recently bought the latest in video editing software because the one I\u0027d previously been using was so out of date that it just couldn\u0027t keep up with my computer and kept crashing. A standard movie review can take anywhere from 3 to 5 hours to film and edit. My Letterboxd Sundays videos can take an awful lot longer due to how much goes into them. Supporting me through Patreon will definitely help to ease the pressure of time and financial constraints.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are going to reward me for my hard work then it\u0027s only fair that I reward you for your awesome support. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve tried to offer some really great rewards for my patrons. Please do check them out and thank you once again for your support. You really are awesome!\u003cbr\u003e"
