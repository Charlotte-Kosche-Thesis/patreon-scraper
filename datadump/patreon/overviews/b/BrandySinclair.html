When I\u0027m not at my workbench or doing Mom things with our little girl, I draw, paint, do calligraphy, and make coloring books. I sell my jewelry at art and craft shows, reenactment events, and online through my website. I self-publish my coloring books on Amazon, and I have a Redbubble page with my artwork on various things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eWhy is a jeweler on Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eI work with my husband, Brian. He\u0027s a writer, graduate gemologist and stonecutter. We\u0027re self-employed, so the majority of our income comes through selling at weekend events. While that\u0027s awesome, it makes it hard for us to really connect with our fans. It\u0027s difficult to have an actual conversation about jewelry or gemstones or even how our work is done when there are five other people in the booth who have questions or who want to try something on. We used to have an easy time of it with social media, but with the new algorithms in place even our family members don\u0027t see most of our posts.\u003cbr\u003ePatreon not only gives us the opportunity to have a reliable stream of communication with you, it also gives you the opportunity to influence what we make, so you can get what you want. Let\u0027s say Brian is getting stones ready for his slab saw to cut into slices. You can tell us what you want to see cut first. If I\u0027m making a ring with a gorgeous one-of-a-kind stone in it and you want it, you can claim it and I\u0027ll make it in your size.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eWhats in it for you?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eWell, even if you only spend $1 a month, you\u0027ll get a special discount code you can use on our website for existing work, and \u003cem\u003efirst dibs\u003c/em\u003e on all the jewelry I make at special Patron-only pricing. You\u0027ll also be able to view Patron-only content, like sneak-peeks from my workbench and art from my upcoming coloring books.

Why am I self employed? Well, dual carpal tunnel will take you out of video game jobs pretty quick. I essentially worked myself out of my chosen career before my mid-twenties, and had to fall back on skills I learned from my grandparents on the farm and in the workshop, respectively. In fact, metalworking saved my wrists because of the variety of movements and tools I use at my workbench.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been self-employed for fifteen years, and while it\u0027s not been the smoothest of rides, it\u0027s certainly never been dull!
