That\u0027s why I started the Five or So Questions series, and why I hope to continue occasionally interviewing indie developers and creators for my blog,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.briecs.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebriecs.com\u003c/a\u003e. More than that, though, I\u0027ll be writing games and about games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you join in supporting this campaign, not only will you get to see my thoughts about game design and my Designer \u0026amp; Devourer podcast, but also interviews with other creators. With your support, I can continue to provide content, and allow your input, including allowing patrons to influence the topics I write design posts about, and I\u0027ll take suggestions on who to interview about what projects. On average, I post 3-4 times a month with interviews and design or fiction posts. If you are worried about paying too much per month, please feel free to cap your pledges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy the content I\u0027ve already produced on my blog, and I hope that you\u0027ll join me in my efforts to create even more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Also, if you\u0027re interested in creating a Patreon of your own to support your creative work,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.com/invite/pgwbv\"\u003eclick here\u003c/a\u003e to go through my referral link and get started!)"
