    "summary": "Hi,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jon, I am a nutritionist and fitness trainer located in Vancouver, BC. I teach nutrition, kettlebell lifting, movement and mindfulness, as well as martial arts. My primary focus is on mental health, and helping people get moving and stay moving when things are tough.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am asking for support for two reasons:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first is that I want to coach people who \u003cstrong\u003eneed\u003c/strong\u003e coaching, not just people who can \u003cstrong\u003eafford\u003c/strong\u003e coaching. The current fitness industry greatly excludes those who cannot afford training, and I want to change that. For every 40 dollars donated per month I will be able to offer one hour long coaching session for free to someone who will benefit from it, or one space in my online coaching program. Equally, supporters can use these sessions for themselves, in person or online.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly I am currently developing an online, six week course for people with depression to get moving and start to take charge of their health. This course will bridge the gap that comes from the fact we are often told that exercise, meditation and healthy eating aid in depression, but we are not told how to get started with these things. By supporting me on Patreon you will allow me to develop this program and give it the time it deserves.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll subscribers, regardless of level will get access to a weekly video from me, a weekly email, and online private support group, an exclusive pre-pre sale on all courses, and a 10% discount on all classes and courses (except those run exclusively for charity, or when I am contracted as a private instructor)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
