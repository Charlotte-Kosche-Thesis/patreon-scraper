I am also the co-coordinator of the Blogs of the Round Table feature at \u003cem\u003eCritical Distance\u003c/em\u003e, where we select a topic to try and help both new and experienced writers find their critical voices in engaging with media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat makes your writing special?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy formal background  is a two-knifed spoon of literature and psychology. I\u0027ve also got some formal background in comparative literature, history and philosophy. I have a Master\u0027s degree in media studies and I\u0027m working on a PhD in communication studies. They\u0027re basically two terms for the same thing, but it\u0027s an interdisciplinary field and I embrace the variety of research needed to be a part of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese disciplines have all had \nimportant influences on the way I approach criticism. I believe and that all media impacts \nits audience, whether the audience appreciates or even invites these \ninfluences, and I approach every piece of writing with that in mind. So, as it can then be assumed. My goal in my writing is to understand how a particular \npiece of media, trend or aesthetic paradigm can impacts its \naudience. I want to approach all forms of media as serious cultural artefacts that have significant impact on their audience. But I also aim to be accessible. Because everybody lives in the media, everybody has a right to understand how it works, and it\u0027s important to me that I write clearly, coherently and accessibly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m interested in how the structure of texts communicate ideas. I\u0027m \ninterested by novelty and by how traditional and I write about whatever I can get my hands on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of writing do you do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy average being somewhere around 2,000 words. Although I am an academic, blogging and freelance work is not the place for that kind of work. Scholarly writing does have its place, but it\u0027s a specialized and occasionally pretty isolating kind of communication. I want to write interesting, insightful, occasionally entertaining things for people who would be interested in them regardless of their background.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write about games, movies, novels, comics, social movements, broader culture, broader politics. broader history and all the intersections between them. I want to write work that is smart but not smug, fresh but not obscure. I keep a record of everything I write and when/where it gets published on \u003ca href=\"http://big-tall-words.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e if you\u0027d like to get a feel for the things I\u0027ve written and how I\u0027ve changed as a writer over the years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOk. That\u0027s cool I guess, but why do you need a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d \nlike to keep up the pace of releasing one of these articles every week \nwhile also putting time into curation work. The basic arithmetic here is that the more money I\u0027m able to earn from my writing, the more writing I\u0027m able to do. The amount of writing I can do, the quality, form and experimentation of it will all improve if I can spend more time on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fact of the matter is that this is an odd time to do any kind of writing with the expectation of getting paid. Day jobs come and go but they don\u0027t come with any promise. I\u0027ve been through layoffs and I\u0027ve hit promotion ceilings before. I\u0027m in graduate school now but the prospect of stable work is nowhere near as solid as the prospect of student debt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that the work I do is important and that in questioning the world around us we have some measure of anticipating what the status quo will expect of us. Literature and criticism may not act as resistance but they can illustrate what and how we should be resisting. As much as I believe in my writing, I also believe in getting paid for the work I do. Right now Patreon is the best option for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I also have grand dreams of one day expanding the kinds of writing I can produce. Basically, the more I can earn from my existing writing, the more broadly I\u0027ll be able to write in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy being a patron, you\u0027d not only \nbe supporting me for all of the content that I\u0027ve already created but \nyou\u0027d be encouraging me to experiment with new outlets like podcasting and video content. \nFurthermore, the more support\n I get, the further I can expand my horizons into new projects. And while I won\u0027t charge you for any of the work I do through my Master\u0027s program or through other outlets like \u003cem\u003eCritical Distance\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0or \u003cem\u003eGood Games Writing\u003c/em\u003e, these are some of the other projects I\u0027ve been a part of to help other writers in the discipline. Like I \nmentioned, I\u0027ve been writing and publishing in some capacity for nine years now, and I\u0027m excited for every opportunity I can get to improve \nand expand on my work. What I\u0027m asking for is for help in accessing more\n opportunities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI demand samples!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\"\u003ca href=\"https://bigtallwords.com/2012/11/06/challenge-is-conflict-how-difficulty-makes-game-narratives-work/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eChallenge is Conflict: How Difficulty Makes Game Narratives Work\u003c/a\u003e.\" \u003cem\u003eMedium Difficulty\u003c/em\u003e.
