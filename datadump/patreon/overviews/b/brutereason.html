Most of my writing touches on issues like consent and autonomy, direct communication, community building, and rational thinking. Although my writing often persuades people, I\u0027m more interested in giving people tools to live more happily, think more clearly, and act more ethically. I aspire to be compassionate, charitable, reasonable, nuanced, and honest in my writing. Integrity and accountability are very important to me. My writing is often personal, because I want to remind others who struggle with the things I do that they\u0027re not alone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides my blog, which has been active for almost six years, my writing has appeared in the Daily Dot, xoJane, Everyday Feminism, Friendly Atheist, Salon, and other outlets. Thanks to my writing and activism, I speak at conferences several times a year, usually about mental or sexual health.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you know about all these things?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have a BA in psychology and a masters in social work. I have years of experience as a writer, sexuality educator, public speaker, counselor, and advocate for survivors of sexual violence and mental illness. I read constantly and learn a lot from the people around me. I hope to never stop learning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often do you post?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt really varies. I do my best to make sure good ideas happen. When they\u0027re not happening, I can\u0027t force them. I would rather take more time to write a carefully considered post than churn out something hasty and lacking in nuance.\u00a0Usually I write between 2 and 12 posts per month, with an average of 6.75 and a median of 6. Regardless, I will post a weekly update here so that you know what I\u0027m thinking about, learning about, and working on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNotice: blogging may be unexpectedly delayed due to cat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I can only pay [$amount] per month but you write five thousand posts?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, then I would be really awesome. But never fear, Patreon charges you once a month for all the posts I made that month, and you can set a cap on the amount you pay. So if you think my posts are worth $10 each but you can only afford to spend $40 per month, set that as your cap. Even if I write more than four posts that month, you will only pay $40.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you use the money for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLiving, mostly. I work as a therapist in a community mental health setting, which means we\u0027re publicly funded and I don\u0027t make a lot of money. But consider your patronage as payment for the product I create, not as a donation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support your writing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s really only one reason--because you think it\u0027s important and you want to help make sure I\u0027m able to kee\u00a0doing it. If you don\u0027t feel that way, then you should spend your money where you think it counts. \u003ca href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHere\u0027s a good place to start\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you do want to help out, know that every little bit helps--even if you can only give $1 per post. But the more you give, the more rewards you get! Each tier includes all the rewards below it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:miri@brutereason.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eemail\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/sondosia\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etweet\u003c/a\u003e me if you have any questions."
