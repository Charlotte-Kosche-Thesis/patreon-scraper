That\u0027s the first key to being a successful photographer anyways... \u003cstrong\u003eYou do you\u003c/strong\u003e, and the other pieces will work themselves into place.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore I get to far, here\u0027s the main reason for starting this page, straight up. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to share, I want to help others become better photographers and I don\u0027t want to see all this money being wasted on seminars and more with other photographers who really have no right teaching.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e So here I am, helping you, and teaching all that I can...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoing into my 11th year as a professional wedding photographer means a few things. One, I have learned the in\u0027s and out\u0027s all on my own. Two, I am still pushing strong capturing 40-50 weddings per year and three, I believe that I\u0027m ready to divulge everything I have learned and then some. And well, the best part is that you\u0027re here to reap the rewards of that and I believe that together we can get you to a successful place in the business as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-9CW4fHL/0/bf5454b7/S/i-9CW4fHL-S.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t plan on just going in one direction here, but instead, every direction I can think of and along the way, even directions you want me to go in. From e-mails, to client handling, to photography and more. Even including off camera lighting and tricks that I\u0027ve learned, stumbled upon or just downright didn\u0027t even know I knew till I figured it out. And with that, I want you to know it all too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo you have a couple options\u003c/strong\u003e, you can pay hundreds and even thousands to go to seminars or conferences where you might learn a thing or two and forget about 5 while at the same time you\u0027re partying or drinking. Or you can become a patreon here, with a small contribution, every week or so \u003cstrong\u003elearning pieces and parts of the industry that you can actually implement one by one to become better at what you do\u003c/strong\u003e or to just get your feet off the ground and running right from the start.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-5JvfG3p/0/5a9c05a1/S/i-5JvfG3p-S.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you\u0027re not all about wedding photography, that\u0027s okay too, lots of what I share can be used across the photography industry to better your business as a whole. So don\u0027t feel like we\u0027re not including you.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe question is, do you want to invest a few dollars a month to actually learn? Or do you want to spend hundreds and thousands to pretty much just hang out with the cool kids and maybe learn one or two things??? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDo you want to become a successful 6 figure wedding / portrait photographer? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you want to support a certain life style and or your family. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe choice is just yours, but either way.
