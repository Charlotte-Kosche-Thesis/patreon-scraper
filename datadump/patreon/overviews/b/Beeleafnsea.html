I was always the artist in my class, but the tale the grown-ups told me of my kind in the adult world were usually surrounded by the word \"\u003cem\u003estarving\u003c/em\u003e\". So, my entire life I tried to be someone I\u0027m not. I\u0027ve done hair, farm work, tattoos, you name it! None of it seemed right, that is until I approached swenyar on DeviantArt about collaborating on a story of hers called No Smoking. She had a request for an artist on the top of her page and I wanted to focus on the art side of comics. We agreed to share any profits and she gave me freedom to elaborate on the original story. Once I got started creating these pages, I couldn\u0027t stop. I mean, if it weren\u0027t for my dogs wanting to play and go outside, or my volunteer work, I\u0027d be a total hermit! I draw full-time now because I \u003cem\u003ewant \u003c/em\u003eto, I \u003cstrong\u003elove \u003c/strong\u003eto, I am drawn to draw. I have found something so few people in the world can claim to have.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI LOVE TO WORK!!!\u003c/strong\u003e *screams it from the mountain tops*\u003cbr\u003eBut doing what I love for the sake of me is only fun for so long.\u003cbr\u003eI need to know that my community loves it toooooooo!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are just getting started. Your support tells us to keep working!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThere is something else missing, and it feels like a special sense of pride. Until someone gets paid to do what they love, it\u0027s just a hobby. \u00a0By partnering with me and swenyar, you are giving us pride and ownership of our lives. When we tell people we are supported by our fans, we are spreading the word that dreams are possible if you believe in what you want and\u00a0reach out for it. We have to shake off all the bad comments, nay-sayers, and high-expectations. It\u0027s hard but we have to because \u003cstrong\u003eyou can succeed if you work hard enough!!!\u003c/strong\u003e That\u0027s what I\u0027ll tell people with every fiber of my being once I get enough tips from fans to split with swenyar.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re making an impact on artists and dreamers everywhere when you support what you love.\u003cbr\u003eThank you, \u003cem\u003ethank you\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eThank you!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e!!!!THANK YOU!!!!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eYou are the stars I\u0027ve been reaching for ^^\u003cbr\u003e"
