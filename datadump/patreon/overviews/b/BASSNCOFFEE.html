We would like to thank you all for making us as big as we are today because, without you, we would have no reason to pump bass to your ears at 11am.  We started this campaign, not so much for just us, for all our fans around the world. We\u0027re getting bigger and better with every show, and want to convoy our thanks to you by being able to provide you with even more content.  Bigger contests, more interaction, traveling shows and even greater merchandise. This campaign will help us fund our new website so we can give you more music on a bigger scale since Facebook does have its limitations. We will still provide the show where it started, but now be able to deliver to a much bigger audience.  There will be prizes along the way as we try to reach our goal, so you can be a part of this growth with us. Thanks so much for all the help, junglist fam, and we\u0027ll continue to see you every Sunday.  BOH BOH BOH!"
