    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi! And welcome. Thank you for taking the time to check out my Patreon.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Brooke Magnanti, though most of y\u0027all probably know me better as Belle de Jour. In 2003, when living in London, I started an anonymous blog that became \n\u003cem\u003eSecret Diary of a Call Girl\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goal is to write more books with genre-changing heroines and you can come along on that journey. Want first-look access to what I\u0027m working on now? Backlist goodies, promotional exclusives, Patrons-only events and more? Well then! You\u0027ve come to the right place. Check out the reward tiers for a taste of the good stuff you can expect, with treats at every level.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(235, 241, 221);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Patrons have allowed me to do already!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(235, 241, 221);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(235, 241, 221);\"\u003eIn less than two months, support from Patrons has helped me carve out the time to work on a new project. Even better, supporters are able to read along as a book is written in real time. That\u0027s right - eight chapters in (as of April 6th), and feedback has already changed character names, changed scene locations, and helped me shape the plot. So if you want to watch the process of me writing a book as it happens, now\u0027s a great time to get on board!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m Doing This\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2009 my identity was revealed (hello again). I was working as a child health researcher by then, trying to juggle a science career with writing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI left science to concentrate exclusively on writing and activism in 2011, and have had some incredible experiences. Getting to talk to people who loved my early work has been an enormous privilege. I\u0027ve written new books, moving from memoirs to crime novels. I\u0027m loving the change! I have a doctorate in forensic pathology so might as well put it to use, right?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut the path from scientist to writer has not been straightforward.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe last few years have been, let\u0027s just say, not what I was expecting. My publisher didn\u0027t know what to do with me once I wasn\u0027t Belle anymore. Plus there was a lot else going on. Being repeatedly dragged through the courts by an abusive ex was the opposite of a peak experience. I was having severe panic attacks and insomnia on a daily basis. I didn\u0027t ask for help then; I was too embarrassed, too afraid of what people would think if I did. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn all that time the things that kept me going - the things I had to hold on to - were \u003cstrong\u003emy work, my friends, and the kindness of fans\u003c/strong\u003e. Every time a stranger tells me \u003cem\u003eSecret Diary\u003c/em\u003e changed the way they think? Or that \u003cem\u003eThe Turning Tide\u003c/em\u003e made them see a whole genre differently? It makes a difference. It actually does. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2018 is something of a fresh start for me, personally and professionally. I\u0027m out of contract with my former publisher, working on exciting new projects, and have moved to the US. My goal is less of the grind, more of the creating new short-form writing and novels. Plus more contact with the fans who got me to this point so far. There are still a lot of stories to tell. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith Patreon it\u0027s about more than just one book. The support is ongoing and makes a difference at every level. A $1 per \nmonth donation means $12 gets spread over a year. If you can give more, that\u0027s awesome! Patrons will get sneak peeks and early access to my upcoming books, and there\u0027s fun stuff available to all supporters.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI will keep speaking out about the issues that matter to me. Workers\u0027 rights. Migrants\u0027 rights. Unlike non-profits and other orgs I don\u0027t get any funding to talk about that, but for better or worse, am one of media\u0027s go-to people on the topics, because of my past. This usually doesn\u0027t even pay costs to travel. We\u0027re out here fighting a battle against rich, deeply entrenched interests. If social justice floats your boat - think of this as my tip jar.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, to sum up. I\u0027m going to keep on keeping on with writing and activism. And I\u0027m going to share it with you. The process, the ups and downs, all of it. There\u0027s a few tiers over there on the right, check \u0027em out. If you like what I\u0027m doing and want me to keep doing it, then I\u0027d be honoured to have you on board. \n\u003cstrong\u003eAnd thank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
