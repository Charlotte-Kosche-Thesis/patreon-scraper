My name is Brad Glasgow and I take pride in being an old-school journalist. The world of online writing is filled with alternative voices, written by underpaid and often unpaid \"tech culture\" writers looking to make their big break. They write with an agenda, because the site that publishes them wants to build their brand in a certain style. They forego long held journalistic principles in an attempt to appeal to whatever market their editors are trying to sell to their advertisers at the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can I make it in this competitive world of a million writers all pushing out the same content? By being different. That means upholding basic journalistic principles. When I write about a topic I consider the alternative. When I write about people I attempt to get their side of the story. I look at data. I trust that the reader is intelligent enough to be able to interpret what I write without adding my opinion into everything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Original articles with unique content\" has been my mantra since day one.
