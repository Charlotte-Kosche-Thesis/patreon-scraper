    "summary": "Hi Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the darkest period of my life I asked for all negativity to be removed! Instantly, I stepped into the unknown territory of my heart and began a spiritually challenging and rigorous journey towards my subsequent personal transformation. Late one evening while trying to wrap my mind around releasing my own negative relationships, ideas, and desires I asked to receive mind-blowing mystical hearts to validate my spiritual direction. The Universe\u2019s response was so instantly overwhelming, that I felt emotional ecstasy while photographing the hearts. As each heart appeared they seem to shine light upon hidden truths within my own heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the day I knew I needed to be authentic and honor my heart, I was soaring to the top of my career! And in order to do so, it literally took - dropping my son off at 5am at my father\u2019s, a friends or his father\u2019s house and then driving to Chicago or flying to New York, and then catching planes, trains, and taxi\u2019s, racing through humanity to compete in my next audition. I was joining my sisters in an emotional, physical, and mental gauntlet to achieve my optimum goal. I\u2019d leave auditions inspired, yet aware. I\u2019d only know my fate if I succeeded or I happen to see the show, commercial, or print add come out with a fellow participant\u2019s smile instead of mine. Landing or driving back that same day I would prepare a late dinner, perhaps watch one of my son\u2019s favorite shows, put him to sleep and get ready to do it all again. A few years ago I was driving to Chicago, stopped in traffic rehearsing my lines for a role in one of the top tv shows, when I was struck by a gut wrenching feeling. \u201cWow this character is so negative, and so are the majority of shows and roles that I happen to read for!\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u2019m at the door of my dream role after 10 years of grit, sacrifice, and determination, only to realize that my desire to fulfill my life purpose couldn\u2019t be executed in the way I thought. The ability to make people laugh or cry is a gift that I have and I really did enjoy being on TV, because I love connecting humanity through human emotion. But my heart yearned for something more! I pulled into a small shopping center in Illinois and called my agents and clients and told them Im out of the biz! After building my career and enjoying many of the relationships in it, Although I was shocked, I realized it was the most courageous and heart-felt moves I\u2019d ever made. Then a torrent of thoughts raced through my mind. How will this impact my son? Who am I now? Where do I start? How do I fulfill my life purpose? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a series of intense meditations and a ton of self-reflection, I created my life philosophy Carrorism. I define carrorism as: the lawful use of kindness and love for oneself and others; in pursuit of optimum welfare for all living things. The five essential elements of carrorism are: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHeroic Consciousness \u003cbr\u003ePursuing Optimum\u003cbr\u003eGiving More \u003cbr\u003eUse of Healthy Words\u003cbr\u003eLight-heartedness \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy mid October of 2016, I experienced a complete spiritual transformation and began going by the name \u201cBuddhaslim\u201d. Since then, I\u2019ve photographed over 700\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.carrorism.com/buddhaslimsheartgallery\"\u003enatural hearts\u003c/a\u003e and I continue to find and photograph them almost everyday. This gofundme campaigns to create The Heroic Heart Center, a space where I can share them with all of you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Heroic Heart Center is a place for companies, religious and secular organizations, schools, families, friends and especially individuals to experience the heart of the Universe. The exhibition of natural hearts effortlessly transports you into a positive state of mind that activates our Heroic Hearts. From my past personal experience I know how challenging it can be to access positive thoughts or maintain a positive state of mind. The Heroic Heart center will also provide workshops, lectures, and resources to everyone seeking to live a carrorist life style. Visit \u003ca href=\"https://www.carrorism.com/buddhaslimsheartgallery\"\u003ecarrorism.com\u003c/a\u003e  to see a few hundred hearts and learn more about carrorism.photographed over\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe darkness that once consumed me is nothing but a momentary memory and negativity has no choice but to run. As the carrorist leader Buddhaslim,\u00a0I have an abundance of good fortune, magical mystical miracles and intense love that I wish to share with everyone. I created a non-profit Carrorize365 to accomplish my goal and spread my story of hero consciousness by sharing my heart exhibit globally. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003ePatron, please join me in carrorizing humanity, starting with you!\u003cbr\u003eLove Buddhaslim\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS - \u00a0One time gives are available through Paypal, paypal.me/Carrorize365\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
