    "summary": "I\u0027m a professional photographer living in Slovenia, a place that is a paradise for landscape photographers, but it can be also a nightmare if you want to make a living as a fine art photographer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough as a professional photographer I make a living foremost with digital photography, my heart is with handcrafted analogue photography. I\u0027ve specialised in wet plate collodion process and other 19th Century techniques. WHY? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause it\u0027s much better! Photography from 19th Century is a slow process and it\u0027s not appropriate for sport photography or ornithology or space photography, but if you are interested in landscape and portrait photography, then 19th Century photography is by far superior medium in comparison to digital photography! The best digital cameras have a resolution of 100M pixels. I do not know how many trillion molecules of silver are on my glass plates, but that\u0027s the resolution and tonality of every single glass negative I make.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd this is what I do. I\u0027m sharing my knowledge and raising an awareness that there is another way how to do photography. That you do not have to listen to all the advertisers, that you can build a camera for yourself and you do not need the latest model of digital camera.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m advocating that you can do photography with your hands, you can make unique pieces of art, you can write your own rules what a good photography is. Topshit rules of photography! I\u0027m organising a photo-safaris in my woods, where we make photography without electricity. We find a spring of water, filter that water, set up a mobile darkroom and make photographs there, in the middle of nowhere in the centre of everything! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo my wish is that with your support, I could devote more time for my videos and go deeper into exciting stories how the pioneers of photography created masterpieces that are benchmarks even today.\n"
