And though I have listed it as four separate roles, it would most likely be anywhere from 1 to 4 people helping me at any given time depending on demand and budget availability. The roles would definitely overlap heavily.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eI would pay these assistants at least $15/hr (no unpaid interns here) with the potential for higher pay or other perks once the sites start generating steady income. \u003c/em\u003eI could also lend my expertise and experience to help them develop as a sort of \"Apprentices\" - they would get to see how I have built the Becoming a Data Scientist websites and audiences so far, and they could contribute new ideas and help me grow them even more! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\nAt a minimum, I need 1 person that can help for 5 hours per week, which would come out to 5 hours x $15/hr x 4 wks/month = $300/month.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo get the most help I imagine needing at this point, and build a full team, I could use up to 4 people x 10 hrs/week each x $15/hr x 4 wks/month = $2,400/month.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\nThen, as the websites grow and start to generate income, I would need less support from Patreon and could eventually end this campaign, as I wouldn\u0027t need the continued outside support.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSee the Patreon \"goals\" for how I plan to use the money at each level!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIn Summary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe main goal of this Patreon Campaign is to make sure I get enough help that the sites I\u0027ve built don\u0027t stagnate, and that I can eventually grow the Becoming a Data Scientist sites to the point where they\u0027re self-sustaining financially, fun and active, and benefiting a wide variety of users long-term. \u00a0At the point when there is enough traffic that the ad and affiliate income can support the paid assistance, I would end the Patreon support for these activities. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nI need your help to get up and running, but I\u0027m not focused on getting rich from these websites, just on bringing them up to a point where they\u0027re being updated consistently, and are most helpful to you without costing me additional money out of pocket; freeing me up to do more valuable activities on the sites myself, like reviewing learning resources and\u00a0generating original content.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks in advance for participating and helping me help you (and others) learn data science!!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n(Even if you can\u0027t contribute financially, help spread the word!)\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
