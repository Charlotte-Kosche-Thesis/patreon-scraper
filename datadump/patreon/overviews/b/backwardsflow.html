    "summary": "Hi. If you\u0027re here, you\u0027re either familiar with me or my work. This page is where you can donate a couple bucks to making sure both continue to exist. Thanks for being here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Quinn Wolf. I\u0027m a 19-year-old trans woman who spends her time doing independent audio production. You might know my independent music, my podcast The Quinnsider on the Comfort Zone network, or my work running and producing for the Luminous Studios network. Between schoolwork and my attempts to find stable employment, my ability to work on these projects is limited. This is why I\u0027m turning to you for assistance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhat will my money do?\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/u\u003eFund my transition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis is an important one. Being trans is more expensive than most people might realize. I pay every month for prescriptions that keep me alive. I\u0027m trying to save money for more expensive parts of transition further down the line. Not to mention the items I need in order to present as unambiguously myself - clothes, makeup, and the like. This is a way to directly support my existence as an out and proud trans woman making things for people like us.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFree up time.\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis one is self-explanatory. The less stress I have over my finances, the more time I can dedicate to creating things. For music, it means putting that much extra polish in lyrics and production. For podcasts, it means more research and more interesting topics.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchase audio gizmos.\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027ve been working for a couple years with almost entirely free software and budget hardware. However, the more I learn about making audio, the more use I\u0027d be able to make of better tools. Some of your money will buy things like microphones, interfaces, studio monitors, and even instruments and samples.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhat do I get from this?\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/u\u003eIndependent music\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI make chiptune-adjacent instrumental songs on my Soundcloud and nostalgic synthpop songs on my Bandcamp.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePodcasts\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e#CONTENT:\u00a0Concepts from the world of media.
