    "summary": "I started shooting Live Action Role Play (LARP) as another\npart of my 3rd Year Final Major Project in Geek Visual Culture. I never\nimagined it would become such a huge interest for me in such a short time, or\nthat would I become someone relatively well known in the community as a result\nof my work. I love shooting LARP, it challenges me at every game and I\u2019ve met\nsome incredible people through doing it. I\u2019m discovering more genres, more ways\nof working, developing my postproduction skills, and meeting even more people\nthrough every game I attend. I\u2019ve been involved in this hobby now for\nnearly 3 years and I am still constantly learning.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nKnowing that my LARP photography brings so much\njoy to people within the hobby andoutside of it fuels me so much. There\u2019s both\nthe professional side of knowing I delivered results to the organisers, but\nalso the personal side of seeing people generate froth from an album, or even\njust one image. Through the post-event side of the image taking, it\u2019s a very\nrewarding hobby. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/4f181982cc3f41b21eddd281541e8d0d/tumblr_oqu1c2Q26c1tpq6pgo1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, that is what it is, a hobby. I am at a\ndifferent stage in my life from when I began shooting LARP and I was able to\ndevote more time to it. Time and money need to go into other areas, yet LARP\nphotography still takes up a lot of that. If travel expenses and food are\nunable to be provided, then it does all add up into a bit of a strain on my\nwallet. I am not currently in a financial place to be able to fund my hobby\nwithout help from patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNot only do I want to be able to make myself\ncontinue to be available for shooting LARP games, but also I want to be able to\nhave the opportunity to develop my skills through it, both for myself and for\nplayers. Being able to expand my kit, I can produce not only more successful\nshots but also more creative work through the hobby. I want to take my critical\napproach to my work further and be able to work on key areas of development in\nmy style. This is through looking at the strengths and flaws in my own work;\nand general inspiration, be it other LARP photographers, what\nplayers/organisers have suggested, or film production stills. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/ad6193b4f04a19d42b52881428b9bf1a/tumblr_oqu1c2Q26c1tpq6pgo3_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is where the LARP Community has been\nwonderful during the past couple of years of having a Patreon Account, and how\nyou can still continue to help.\u003cbr\u003e\nWith the support of\nthe community so far, I have been able to continue devoting time to LARP\nsystems and providing images for players and organisers. It means my mind wont be troubled with the thought of \u201cWill I be able to\nafford this one?\u201d when invited to a game, and be able to pay people who have\nkindly given me lifts to events in the past. It also means the time I\ndevote to doing post-production on images doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s eating into time\nI should be spending on freelance work. I can help\nout a game team who need crew to pay for catering without me glancing awkwardly\nat my bank balance. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/5bb4fa6cfece8ba8b6bbf9b334fb4d9f/tumblr_oqu1c2Q26c1tpq6pgo6_r1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been able to buy the small but essential replacement\nkit like batteries and memory cards. Financial support over the least year\nmeant I could buy more thermals, so I can comfortably keep shooting throughout all\nconditions. I was able to put a fair amount of money without stress into buying\nbetter boots for LARP, with ankle support and everything\u2026 only 2 years after\neveryone was telling me to do it. I listened eventually. It meant I could buy more\nvaried base kit; and next on my plans is to buy more ways of hiding the more\nmodern elements of my photography equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the systems that needed it, I have been able\nto hire out lighting to provide portrait shots of people in a dedicated OC area,\nand now thanks to an incredibly generous donation, own lighting kit to bring to\ngames. I plan to put money into a film camera and experiment with different\nstyles of shooting to create a more visually diverse and exciting result for\ndifferent games. I have been able to hire kit that can cope in more challenging\nconditions better the the kit I currently own, making me able to produce more\nwork and not be limited by what I currently own. It means a stronger body of\nphotography work from each game I attend, work we can all be proud of. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/e53803b2ba4e098f3ddca9cd42a46e7f/tumblr_oqu1c2Q26c1tpq6pgo2_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNot only has your support help my LARP\nphotography, but it also meant I can devote more time and personal money into\nmy other projects without LARP losing out. \u2018The Cosplayers at Home\u2019 and \u2018Geeks\non the Streets\u2019 are both dependent on my finances, and both have a strong link\nto Geek Visual Culture, which is how all my projects tie together.\nAdditionally, this will help me fund a version of \u2018The Cosplayers at Home\u2019 but\nshot with LARPers in mind, which I am hoping to start during the final\nprocesses of \u2018The Cosplayers at Home\u2019. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe current support has been wonderful and has\nkept me going through the hobby; your continuous support will help me grow even\nfurther in the hobby. I am still reliant on the finances I get through Patreon\nto keep me attending and photographing games, so I hope what I have provided\nover the years with photography has proven your belief in me. Thank you all for\nyour time and support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/bac7550635779e63abec5f312c3d8ecd/tumblr_oqu1c2Q26c1tpq6pgo5_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/5d45bccc3d76f1aac18d10714d701b18/tumblr_nw46xtvjRk1tpq6pgo2_500.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
