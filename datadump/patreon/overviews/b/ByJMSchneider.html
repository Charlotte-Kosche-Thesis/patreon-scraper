    "summary": "I have been creating songs, writing stories, and crafting poetry for almost a decade now. Writing is my greatest passion, and it is something I have sacrificed a lot for... from money to jobs to the treasured comforts of home as I have traveled around the world to improve myself as an artist and a human being. \u003cstrong\u003eThankfully, I haven\u0027t had to sacrifice any of my friends and family who are my greatest supporters.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbove all, Patreon gives me a chance to bring all of my content together for the people who matter most to me and have listened and read from the beginning. But it does not end there, because this is also a chance for me to share my work with a broader audience and expand my support base. \u003cstrong\u003eSo, this is not only for the ones who have always been there, but for all those who are yet to come.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is there to say? \u003cstrong\u003eMy name is Jonathan\u003c/strong\u003e. I have been writing songs since I was in junior high, sharing stories from way back when I used to post and collaborate with strangers on public forums, and exploring poetry after discovering a few artists who made me realize it was more than just rhyme and meter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMuch of my work touches on elements of the human condition, pulls from deeper thought life, and navigates the uglier, more realistic, side of existence\u003c/strong\u003e. I try to keep the philosophy layered underneath, and the surface of my work entertaining and engaging. If ever you find my work esoteric or overly saturated with meaning, please do not hesitate to speak up between the lines and remind me to tilt my nose a little lower!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://s640.photobucket.com/user/PhotoJ0n/media/About%203%20fini.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon and I had quite the serendipitous beginning, but from stumbling upon an link amid the wide web I decided to make it my next platform for sharing my work. So here I am!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePateron is a place where creatives of all sorts come together to share their work, while allowing support via \"Patronage\". Unlike Kickstarter, Patreon allows supporters to back their chosen content creator by subscribing to their Patreon site rather than making one-time donations. Some Patreon sites charge Patrons per creation or multiple times per month... \u003cstrong\u003eI have decided to charge my Patrons just once a month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more info on Patreon and how to become a Patron, I explain more in my video here: Art is supposed to bring people together, right? Well, yeah, but should it not also enrich the lives of those people and their communities in some way? And I mean beyond just getting your feet to slide and your shoulders to pop. I mean ENRICH! Make it better! Level the playing field for those less fortunate, or shed a light where darkness reigns!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA touch too dramatic maybe, but I am an artist after all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, guys, \u003cstrong\u003ethis site is about what I believe the true purpose of art should be: enlightening the world\u003c/strong\u003e. And I figure, while I strive to create content that achieves such a purpose, why not also devote some of the resources gained through such an endeavor to amount greater change in our communities?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is why\u003cstrong\u003e this website will begin donating a percentage of its earnings to a charity chosen by its Patrons once we reach 2,000 Patrons\u003c/strong\u003e. And for every 1,000 Patrons after, 10% more earnings donated monthly until at 10,000 Patrons the site becomes \u003cstrong\u003eentirely non-profit\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e"
