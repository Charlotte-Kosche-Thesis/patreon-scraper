We\u0027ve produced some pretty good books over the years, good enough to gain ten\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.prixaurorawards.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAurora\u00a0\u003c/a\u003enominations and two wins. While most of our novels are by Canadians (with one exception), our anthologies have included writers from a dozen countries around the world. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe three partners of Bundoran Press (writers all) have put their own money into the venture and will continue to do so. But the demands are great and, so far, the rewards (other than ephemeral ones) non-existent. Every month we\u0027re a few dollars short and if we want to keep going -- and we really do -- we need some support from folks who like Bundoran Press and love good science fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve averaged 4 books a year for the last little while. If we can get a little help we can keep doing that; if we get a lot, maybe we can up our production to 5. We don\u0027t publish our own work (though one of the writers was published by the company before the current group bought it 5 years ago) but seek out the best books we can find -- paying writers, artists and designers to produce the best books we can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out our\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkoDi5L3gIMJVdTVgJrny7g\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e Youtube channel\u003c/a\u003e to learn more about our books."
