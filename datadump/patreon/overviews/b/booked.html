Patreon page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBooked. has been dominating the booky corner of the podcasting world for over four years, reviewing books, interviewing authors, recording live events, publishing books, and acting as a conduit for talent in the indie book scene.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a long time, we had a sort of angel investor who provided hosting for our site, bringing our monthly costs to almost nothing. Well, that angel spread their wings and flew (with our deepest gratitude for the support he gave us). Now it\u0027s up to us to keep things working. We decided that Patreon could help us bridge the gap between us and our enthusiastic listeners who want to contribute to our ongoing success, in a way that guarantees we\u0027ll make good use of the money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur basic monthly costs fluctuate, but they average between $50 and $80. right now, our generous patrons cover those costs and beyond, which is amazing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoing forward, we will add some milestone goals where, when they\u0027re met, some excellent advances will be made in the podcast, and listeners will be rewarded with special content and better and more frequent episodes, videos on YouTube, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking the podcast has evolved from a hobby to an absolutely life-changing experience for both of us, and we are honored to have had the opportunities that we\u0027ve had. We\u0027re looking forward to growing in the coming years and sharing our experiences with everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks, eternally, for your support."
