    "summary": "I\u0027m Shawn, a Health and Finance Research-Freak \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ein love with Black people\u003c/em\u003e!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m also the founder of Black Health HQ where we produce content for your Physical, Mental \u0026amp; Financial Health.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created Black Health HQ for Black folks and those who love Black folks. I started building in October of 2016 after I realized that there weren\u0027t ANY health blogs that were more than a few paragraphs per post! No one cited sources, few created health content for Black people specifically, and no one provided in depth\u003cem\u003e How-To\u0027s\u003c/em\u003e to actually transform anyone\u0027s life. Had to change that. Health is our Wealth (also, wealth is wealth so we cover that too), it\u0027s far too important to leave only half-treated.\u00a0I believe this content can change people and communities. Join me in the mission to serve Black folks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow you can help: Pledging patrons help grow Black Health HQ by supporting social media advertisements and growing our subscriber family. Without these, we can\u0027t stay alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow I got into this: After I got my Master\u0027s a few years back, I noticed my life wasn\u0027t what I intended. With a pot-belly, broke and lil\u0027 depressed, I started asking myself: \"If I\u0027m so intelligent, why does my body look the way it does, why does my bank account look the way it does, how come I\u0027m not all that happy?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason...I simply wasn\u0027t making my body, mind, and finances a priority. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a scholar, I turned to the one thing I knew I could do. Research.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I committed myself to learning what I could do for myself, I embarked on the journey of self-transformation: My mind changed, my body followed, and my finances sharpened.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing about the tricks I learned along the way. It\u0027s a little crazy what can happen when you apply good information to your daily grind...You end up with no choice BUT to transform.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what I know: \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1)The need for strong bodies, minds, and bank accounts isn\u0027t going anywhere. Somebody needs to make sure that all relevant data is up to date and disseminated for our people. I want Black Health HQ to go on for long time. I\u0027m one of those weird bro\u0027s who likes to research and apply my findings to my life. I love seeing how information affects the lives of Black folks and those who love Black folks. I believe that each of us can be a powerful nucleus that, like a healthy cell, radiates energy to others, sustaining an enduring vitality.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m about Living. I\u0027m about Loving. I\u0027m about supporting powerful Black people that will heal the world through the sheer joy of Being.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2)I know it takes commitment and consistency to make our Health \u0026amp; Wealth goals come true. I can provide all the best research in the world, but without committing to making use of the information, my work remains just words on a screen. Research from acclaimed psychologist, Robert Cialdini  demonstrates that in order to accomplish our goals, we must first commit to very small steps. Even a small donation can help you to apply what you get here to your life.\u00a0I know that subscribing \u0026amp; pledging a donation is one way to stay connected, committed and consistent. Call it crazy, but you\u0027re more likely to apply the concepts you read here if you know you\u0027re paying $1 a month for it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You To Those Who Will Support Us. Your donations help me create more content, spread it to more people, and grow the Black Health Family. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eREFERENCES:\u003cbr\u003eCialdini, R. B.
