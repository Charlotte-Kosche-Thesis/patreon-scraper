I love what I do. I listen to and write every kind of music you can imagine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have so many half-baked ideas, demos and flashes of wacky inspiration that I can\u0027t keep track of them all. I\u0027d really love to finally turn some of them into real, polished recordings - but that kind of thing costs money and time. \u003cstrong\u003eSPOILER ALERT:\u003c/strong\u003e I don\u0027t have a ton of either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always wanted to record an album of \u003cstrong\u003eoriginal fiddle tunes\u003c/strong\u003e, with guest appearances by awesome trad instrumentalists and singers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always wanted to really stretch out and write \u003cstrong\u003emoody pseudo-soundtrack electronic music\u003c/strong\u003e, but gear and software aren\u0027t cheap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always wanted to write some \u003cstrong\u003ebizarre and over-wrought theatre-pop\u003c/strong\u003e that sounds like it should be in a horror musical and press it on vinyl for my lumbersexual friends and allies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have an ever-growing list of \u003cstrong\u003ecovers\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027d like to record, just because they\u0027re great songs and I\u0027m itching to put my own twist on them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEt freaking cetera.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e gives me a means of doing all of this - really chasing inspiration - while giving you, my lovely patrons, a window into my creative process (and access to the various fruits of my labors). I\u0027ll write blog posts about the things I\u0027m writing and the challenges I\u0027m facing throughout the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve chosen not to charge a monthly \"subscription fee\" - you\u0027ll only help me out when I finish something new and upload it for you to hear. I won\u0027t release anything to you until I\u0027m sure it\u0027s something you\u0027ll find interesting and valuable - and if you think I\u0027m phoning it in, call me on it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeriously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can access all my finished recordings for as little as a dollar per track, or help out with a little more and access other fun exclusives like personal letters, demos in progress, video rants/greetings/shout-outs, and other things I\u0027ll come up with as we go. You\u0027ll only ever pay your pledged amount when I finish a track and make it available for you to download - demos, video blogs etc. are free provided you\u0027re pledging the appropriate amount per finished song. If you\u0027re confused, shoot me an email at brianhaggis@gmail.com and I\u0027ll get you sorted out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever you decide, I humbly thank you for even reading this far -\u003cstrong\u003e today\u0027s artists depend more and more on the direct support of their friends and fans\u003c/strong\u003e, and I promise I\u0027ll do everything I can to make your contribution count.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s get writing!"
