    "summary": "So ... where do I begin with this? hmmmmm I could start from my bir... no way to far back, hmmmmm maybe I can start with saying who I am and what I do? yeah lets go with that!\u003cbr\u003eHello! My name is Michael Sheppard and my youtube alias is Sirbootling, and I started youtube on august 2015, so I am still a youngish account but I am still trying my very best to entertain as much as possible and loving every minute of it.\u003cbr\u003eI guess I\u0027ll start with how things got put into place that lead me onto the mystical world of youtube I guess, it all starts way back in first school (yes I could say it starts there, you\u0027ll understand why) I was a loner most of the time and most of the kids would of bullied me alittle but more than likely ignored me, and from secondary school, I started making a few friend who were nerdy, but I liked them, and as for the bullying ... well it got worse, I never understood why I was picked on so much.\u003cbr\u003eThis all changed when I went into high school, I started knowing I was abit different from everyone else, so one night I asked my mother what was wrong with me and that I knew that I was different from everyone else, and that\u0027s when she told me that I have Asperger syndrome, only borderline but still, knowing that I accepted that I was different and start isolating myself.\u003cbr\u003eOn the bright side though since I started playing video games since the first sonic so I never felt completely alone, and I started becoming more sociable as time passed.\u003cbr\u003eSoon after high school I went into college to study music tech since I played the guitar at the time, doing this helped me out alot, I leaned so many new things and became a music producer, I carried on music production for about 4 years doing mainly electronic music, preferably dubstep.\u003cbr\u003eAfter those years though I left the music industry cause I lost the spark that kept me going on in it, and almost starting to isolate myself again, that was until I saw what CherryCharley was doing over youtube, and I thought it looked fun so I got my webcam, started up with Action (Now using d3dgear) and getting Power Director and went off into the world of gaming.\u003cbr\u003eI bet you are also wondering how did SirBootling came about ehh? Well strap in cause this is now part 2 of my story ... well Bootling\u0027s but you get the idea\u003cbr\u003eOne of my very first mmorpgs was runescape, and Grand Fantasia, always had the character look like me cause well who doesn\u0027t sometimes, but one day I thought \"I want someone who looks weird, like he always that one poor sod who would always think he would die against anything\" so after messing about with some features that was in the character creation, the eyes came firstly which made me laugh, the small straight mouth came into it soon after giving him the signature face, the hair was still inspired from the hair I had back then, but after randomizing it, it went a nice baby blue which then he was finished, the name? Oh yes, he was named \"SirBootling\" due to how big the boots looked on him ... Pretty ironic isn\u0027t it? Well he was intentionally meant to be small.\u003cbr\u003eDidn\u0027t really think I could write so much, anyways I plan to do gaming for a long time and enjoy the most out of all the story based games I am playing and the odd one play I have done, thank you guys so much for reading this story, and I hope to see you all soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
