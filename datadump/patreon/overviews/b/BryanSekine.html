    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eMy name is Bryan Sekine and I want to make the best sushi tutorials on the internet.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for making your way to my Patreon page. I have some really big plans for the future and I want you to be a part of it all! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI run secretsofsushi.com and a YouTube channel (Secrets of Sushi) where I teach people how to roll sushi from home. For the past few years I have been funding all of this through my day job, but as the videos and website become more popular, the cost of maintaining the site and creating new content also raises. This is where I need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA brief explanation of Patreon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an amazing way to support artist who creates content for you. It\u0027s a relatively new system, but it\u0027s been proven to work for hundreds of other artists! Instead of purchasing a product or making a single donation, you sign up for a small subscription and the artist is paid $1 to $10 each month! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the subscription may seem small to you, it quickly adds up for the artist and can eventually allow them to create full-time. You can cancel your subscription at any time, but members get some amazing awards for being a patron!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is easily the best way to enjoy your content without having any greasy ads or constantly being subjected to sales tactics.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an artist, I want my videos to reach as many people as possible and I want to share every piece of information that I have for free. However, artists can\u0027t continue to make free content AND work a day job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere your money goes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money will cover the costs of...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIngredients -\u003c/strong\u003e sushi is expensive and so are the ingredients to make the videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideo editing -\u003c/strong\u003e while I\u0027ve been making it by on my own, the videos would be *much* better if I could pay someone who really knows what they\u0027re doing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeb hosting -\u003c/strong\u003e as the popularity of the website raises, so does the hosting cost.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOngoing website development -\u003c/strong\u003e the website is good, but I believe that it can be so much better.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmail provider -\u003c/strong\u003e this is a 3rd party system that is used to send emails to my subscriber list. As the list continues to grow, so do the fees!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e... and, once everything else is covered, it will cover my cost of living. It\u0027s my dream to be able to create content for you full-time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease don\u0027t become a patron if you\u0027re low on money - I know what that feels like - and please don\u0027t feel like you have to. I will carry on making sushi tutorials whether you donate or not, they just might be a bit better and more frequent if you do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStretch Goals:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$300 -\u003c/strong\u003e Intially, I want to raise awareness of what Patreon and give away a sushi knife for doing so! This will cover the cost of one month of web hosting and pay for the knife.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$1000 -\u003c/strong\u003e 4 videos per month!

This amount, plus the income from teaching my live classes, will allow me to work full-time on my sushi business and create the best sushi tutorials for all of you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$3000 -\u003c/strong\u003e I will create a weekly podcast.
