You can keep a roof over my head, food in my stomach and most importantly, you can keep me writing. In return you\u0027ll get a ton of really awesome benefits that give you an inside look at me and my process and every success I have from here on out, that\u0027s gonna be in part, thanks to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s really, insanely hard to be an artist - but I wasn\u0027t built to do anything else, so please, take a look down the list, see what you might want and think about what you can part with on a monthly basis\u00a0and let\u0027s get this thing done."
