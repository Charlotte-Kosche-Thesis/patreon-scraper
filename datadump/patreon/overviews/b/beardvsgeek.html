Most people have been bullied for who they are or what what they enjoy at least once. Well Beard vs. Geek is dedicated to helping men feel that they are not less of a man for being a geek and not less of a geek for being a man.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBeard vs. Geek is more than just one person making videos. It\u0027s every person who has been bullied for being a geek and want to have a more balanced life. It\u0027s every person, man or woman who comments, subscribes, and helps each other embrace the geeky and the masculine at the same time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eUnlike most YouTube channels who only focus on one limited topic, Beard vs. Geek recognized that humans are complicated and are passionate about more than just one topic. So if you believe like I do that it\u0027s OK to be a man and a geek at the same time, than become a Patron, and let us both work to spread a message that will change people\u0027s lives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY I NEED YOUR HELP.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou may not know this but making a good quality YouTube show is actually rather expensive. Between equipment, software, and time it all adds up. It\u0027s come to a point where I cannot grow this community alone, so I\u0027m asking for your help. I\u0027m not begging for money, I\u0027m asking you to be a co producer and join me in changing lives. Since I can\u0027t have you all on camera there is a way you can help and get some amazing stuff in return and that\u0027s by being a Patron. Each month you give a little that means a lot and goes directly to making the Beard vs. Geek content better and better. In return you recieve some awesome rewards listed to the right. Of course any little bit helps and is appreciated, but if you can\u0027t donate through money please continue to donate though watching the videos and commenting and helping out your fellow geeky man.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
