    "summary": "WHAT AM I DOING ON PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my life I\u0027ve been an artist deep in my core. While I am not without my skills, family obligations, myths surrounding an art career and paralyzing self-doubt prevented me from following my dream of becoming an artist, so I pursued music instead. Don\u0027t get me wrong! Being a musician has been a wonderful adventure and we raised our little family on the money we made playing for our fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomewhere, though, deep in my psyche, I yearned to be an artist. As I am slowly phasing out certain types of gigs and working toward collaborative projects with other musicians, I realize that my time is opening up and my yearning to create art is now front and center. I always knew I\u0027d be a late bloomer, and as I\u0027m approaching 60, I realize I\u0027d better start painting. It\u0027s time. I\u0027ve been honing my skills and educating myself with books and videos but I long for mentorship from other artists, and maybe a class or two when the time comes. At the moment, though, I\u0027m content just spending time every day in the studio, continuing my studies and practice, and occasionally commissions to help pay the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you know me at all, you know that I spend hours practicing in my studio. As a musician, I\u0027m down from nearly 25 hours a week to roughly 6 to 10 hours which frees up some time for my art studies. I spend at least 3 hours a day in the studio, but truthfully, most of the time, up to 6 hours a day. Some days it\u0027s figure or anatomy studies, other days I\u0027m studying the paintings of my favorite artists, and some days I do portraits. Spending this much time in the studio is fantastic. It keeps me inspired and in the creative process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWith the help of your pledges, I\u0027ll be able to expand a little. I\u0027d love to rent a little studio in town away from the hustle and bustle of home. Having a studio at home is convenient, but I need a place away from the family. As much as I love and adore them, it\u0027s hard to work with so many interruptions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will also help me replenish my art supplies! In the beginning, I used student brands but as I\u0027m learning, nothing compares to using better quality supplies. And there\u0027s a reason they cost a little bit more (sometimes a lot more). They work better and last longer. And the colors, oh, the colors...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please consider supporting me on Patreon. Every little bit helps and I\u0027ll have little surprises for you as you follow me on this journey and help me realize this new phase in my life. In future months, I\u0027ll have prints and gifts available to patrons, as well as solid breaks on commissions if you so choose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay with me and let\u0027s have some fun!\u003cbr\u003eMuch, MUCH love to you,\u003cbr\u003eBecky Reyes\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
