Comics take effort, but with patrons like you, we feel encouraged and engaged to make stuff. Your dollars help keep the lights on, but it\u0027s your engagement that encourages us. We want the comics process to be a collaboration and build a community. That\u0027s when the internet is at its best!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith each donation, we can cover our hosting costs and get content to you quicker. We are able to spread the load between the three of us. And as we hit each milestone, we can ramp up our production accordingly. Meaning, the more you give, the more we give. It\u0027s a fantastic cycle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here we are, willing creators willing to create. We have a lot of ideas to explore, so imagination is in good supply. If you can help us with the other stuff, we\u0027ll make sure there\u0027s plenty of enjoyment to go around. Thank you!"
