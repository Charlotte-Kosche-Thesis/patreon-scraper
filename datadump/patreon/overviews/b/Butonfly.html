    "summary": "In a little stick village on a little stick world lived a little stick boy and a little stick girl.\u003cbr\u003eThey sang little stick songs and played little stick games. They even ran around in a little stick maze\u003cbr\u003eThen one day in a little stick twist came a little stick villain with his little stick fist.\u003cbr\u003eHe said:\u003cbr\u003e\u201cIve watched you run your little stick maze; sing your little stick songs; play your little stick games!\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u201cWith your little stick world as happy as can be, I\u2019ve decided little stick girl is coming with me!\u201d\u003cbr\u003eWith a little stick flick of his little stick wrist came a little stick cloud as thick as sticky mist.\u003cbr\u003eThe little stick villain with a little stick laugh fled the scene in a dash down little stick path.\u003cbr\u003eHe raced on over his little stick moat. Then up-into his little-stick tower they did go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e~the opening scene to The Little Stick Story\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years I\u0027ve entertained writing as a hobby along with my wife. Together we\u0027ve written stories amongst like-minded people, developing characters, laying out plot lines, and generally working on skills related to storytelling in the written form. Over that time we\u0027d spend countless hours discussing what we discovered, disecting what was good, and embellishing on what worked best. At some point through the process the desire to take what I\u0027d learned and create content for an audience began to settle within me. But traditional methods, such as writing a novel, we\u0027rent quite what I had in mind. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this Patreon my wish is to provide a window into the fascinating world of writing I\u0027ve known and loved for years. With your support I want to create episodic fiction in written form for your reading pleasure, to transfer that fiction onto the audible podcast format, and top it all off with thoughtfull discussion into the thinking and development that goes on behind it. Finally: I hope to create a space in which other creators can engage with their own thoughts, and feature their creations via the platform we create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThankyou for your support, and I hope you like the show.\u003cbr\u003e~Ross (aka Butonfly)\u003cbr\u003e"
