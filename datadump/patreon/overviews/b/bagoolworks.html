    "summary": "This is the patreon page for the support of the game I\u0027m making called Spanquest II: Prepare to Cry edition. This is a game about spanking, yes the butt slapping kind. Spanking is an interesting thing to a lot of people, usually sexual but not always. This fascination and demand led to me making my own game on the topic, due to them being so few and far between. This game started off as a walking around simulator where you can talk to folks and spank or be spanked, but it\u0027s in the process of evolving into something much more. What my goal is, can be summarized as a new take on the Harvest Moon games but instead of crafting and farming resources, you\u0027re spanking or getting spanked and travelling. The game will feature choices and multiple solutions to quests and problems that will have their own resolution, and make it really feel like the player has influence in this world. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve never been in a great financial state, and making my game takes a lot of time. I set up this patreon because some people have shown they are willing to support me by the means of donating. I was initially against the idea of taking donations, because I felt I would be made to commit to a project I didn\u0027t know if I was continuing. Now, since I\u0027m determined to finish this game and I\u0027m confident that I can do so, I feel that I can set up this page with confidence.\u003cbr\u003eThis is primarily a spot to show your support for the game, but it is also a sort of blog about the game\u0027s development. Of course if any of the rewards interest you, then go nuts. One thing I can offer to all of my patrons is an early release of any updates I finish. Seeing as that\u0027s what I\u0027m charging my patrons for, it\u0027s only fair you get a little head start in that regard. But you will have my gratitude for putting your faith in my game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDownloads:\u003cbr\u003eThese downloads are for the old version made in RPGMaker.
