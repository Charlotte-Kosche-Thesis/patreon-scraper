    "summary": "I have been writing fiction and doing editing work for over\ntwenty years, and have self published some collections and novels in a limited\nvenue. I primarily work in fanfiction, but have written extensively in the\ngenre of gay original fiction. I have four novels available to purchase on Amazon. One which is gay (m/m) original fiction (\u003cem\u003eMen in the Moon\u003c/em\u003e), two are m/f/m erotica (\u003cem\u003eDeep Magik\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Catalyst\u003c/em\u003e) and \u003cem\u003eAll That Matters\u003c/em\u003e is m/f erotica:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Men-Moon-Patience-Dudley-ebook/dp/B016DX8TBO/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.amazon.com/Men-Moon-Patience-Dudley-eb...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-That-Matters-Ramsey-Courtland-ebook/dp/B00PKPTDI0/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.amazon.com/All-That-Matters-Patience-Dudley-ebook/dp/B00PKPTDI0/\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Magik-Patience-Dudley-ebook/dp/B00XBBD4QW/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.amazon.com/Catalyst-Patience-Dudley-ebook/dp/B01903EJO0/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttps://www.amazon.com/Deep-Magik-Patience-Dudley-...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy stories, written with my co-author\nSekhmet, generally feature character driven explorations of relationships in real life, fantasy, science fiction, and vampire/werewolf stories; some are sweet romances and others are deeper\nlooks at human psychology. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI was able to travel early on in my writing, and offer my\nbooks in person, as well as hold other, regular employment. Now, the chronic\nillness and the severe depression I\u0027ve battled for most of my adult life has\nbecome much more severe, and I am unable to hold a regular job because of the\ndebilitating effects of my illnesses. A simple cold that might last two weeks\nin an otherwise healthy person will make me bedridden for six weeks. So, what\nwas once a hobby that helped a bit is now the only way I have to make some money\non my own schedule to help support myself and my family. However, due to my illnesses, many times I am unable to write. Getting out of bed is an accomplishment sometimes.\u00a0I cannot get\ndisability; I was turned down because I no longer have my medical records\ndetailing my illness and cannot get new medical records without expensive tests\nand doctor visits I cannot afford. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am the sole carer for my elderly mother who suffers from\nCOPD and needs assistance with cooking and other daily tasks. While she\ncollects Social Security, it does not nearly cover even the most basic monthly\nbills of mortgage, utilities, her extensive medical needs, and food. The\nconstant stress of how to cover mortgage, food, electricity, and transportation\nincreases the frequency and severity of the painful crippling flare-ups of my\nillness. It\u0027s a cycle only increased income will alleviate.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe live in a rural area without public transportation and do\nnot have a reliable car, so my adult daughter is not able to get a job. Despite\nher own life challenges, she has instead begun building her own transcription\nbusiness to work from home, which makes me very proud. She is helping us a lot,\nbut is not bringing in enough to give us financial peace of mind. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy becoming my patron, you will not only contribute to my\nfinancial peace of mind so that I can keep writing and editing, but you will\nhelp ensure that the three of us are fed every month, that we can keep a roof\nover our heads, that we can gain reliable transport to doctors and food stores,\nand, in time, that I can get the medical care I need. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI believe the arts \u2013 writing and creating, helping others to\nwrite and share their stories, is a vital part of our culture and society. I\nthank you for taking the time to read this and please know that anything you\nfeel moved to do is greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e"
