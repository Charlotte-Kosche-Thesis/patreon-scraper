We\u2019ve been running for over 15 years and publish two issues a year. We\u2019re a very tiny team - just two people  - a poet, (that\u2019s me, Jacqueline Gabbitas) and a designer, Martin Parker - and we run it around our day jobs. Any money Brittle Star makes from subscriptions and sales goes back into the magazine\u2019s print costs. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe have three brilliant feature writers who write regular columns on poetry, short fiction and reviews of first collections, and they get paid a tiny amount for the work they do (which probably only keeps them in tea and biscuits while they\u2019re writing our articles). Did we mention Martin and I don\u2019t get paid for our time or skills? Up to now, this has been okay, but we want the magazine to be as self-sufficient as possible and your help as patrons can make this happen. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.brittlestar.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Patreon-why.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve been doing this for a while and we\u2019ve learned through lots and lots of trial and error that when we give the magazine some proper time and attention beyond the editing and production, the rewards are bountiful! Just one to two dedicated days a week on admin, promotion and outreach boosts sales of the magazine, subscribers and submissions. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eA few people suggested looking at Patreon to help us raise funds, so here we are. Patreon is a new way for us to thank our supporters, keep in touch with writers and readers, and be paid for the creative work we do. It\u2019s patronage in the way artists and writers used to be supported but much more collectively. \u003cstrong\u003eWe also want it to be another way of donating and subscribing to the magazine at the same time (with a few perky perks thrown in just for our patrons).\u003c/strong\u003e If you\u2019re already a subscriber, you might think about becoming a patron to take advantage of the exclusive rewards!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd here\u0027s something slightly bonkers -\u003c/strong\u003e if only 5% of people who follow us on social media donated $2 (about  \u00a31.60) a month we\u0027d be half way to hitting our first goal!

You can stop and start your donations at any time - there\u2019s no pressure. We\u2019ll love you anyway, for supporting us!
