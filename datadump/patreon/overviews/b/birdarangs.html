I studied illustration for a year and a half before I had to drop out because of money and mental health problems. However that hasn\u0027t stopped me from learning on my own, and now I aim to improve as much as I can and make a living out of what I love doing most.\u003cbr\u003eI like drawing fanart as much as I like drawing original content, but I\u0027ve been trying to focus on original content more so you will most likely see more of that than anything else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way this site works, I might be able to get a reliable and steady source of income without drowning myself in commissions, so it\u0027d be way more manageable and easier for me to create even more things. And god knows I need somewhere I can post my art other than tumblr.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy pledge?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike I said, I live in Venezuela. You may or may not have heard about the crisis that\u0027s been going on over here for the past couple of years. Without getting into the uglier details, things have been getting from bad to worse. Food is more scarce than ever and we\u0027re going through a crazy hyperinflation so terrible, my mom\u0027s salary (the strongest source of income in my family) has been reduced to around $20 a month. There\u0027s not much anyone can do about this, and our country will take several years to recover, so everyone\u0027s abandoning ship and moving to safer countries. My ultimate goal is to move out of this country, preferably to the United States, and live a more...livable life so I can continue creating. If for some reason that doesn\u0027t work out, you\u0027d still be helping me help my family a LOT, as well as myself because I\u0027d be able to buy better tools and reduce my stress greatly. Your support would be immensely appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.redbubble.com/people/birdarangs\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eredbubble\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/birdarangs\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://impactrueno.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e.
