    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eBinary Gaming Network [BGN]\u003c/strong\u003e is more than just a gaming server or group, it is the embodiment and envisioned dream of an entire network to support not only its own gaming community but other gaming communities as well in Australia. We aim to provide the Volunteer Technical skills required to create a massive community that is expected to grow with our embodiment of social, fun and exciting gaming with great people who also share this goal and thus extend Australian gaming as a whole.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur Vision: For too long we felt that Australian gaming has been about how long you can suffer your horrendous ping to another country, or sometimes even interstate, because there is simply no other alternative, no solution, no choice that allows you to play on a Australian Based server that is reliably available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe intend to provide more Dedicated, Powerful and Reliable Enterprise grade servers to facilitate stronger Australian based casual gaming. We are also interested in working with other communities to provide the best experience for the gaming community and provide technical skills and hardware for those that cannot acquire it. It is our hope that by providing these services Australian gaming will expand and thus ensure new creativity and ideas combined with fun will foster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur Goals: We aim to provide the best experience in accordance with our users wishes. We aim to be open about our projects and financing so that fair discussion can take place thus fostering communication between all. We will also provide public access to our solutions to our server hosting as we embody the belief that a community is one open and free group that shares with one another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegarding Rewards: Just like the rest of our community we are looking for feedback! If you think of a patron reward you\u0027d like to see let us know! We love creative and funny ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support! :)\u003cbr\u003e"
