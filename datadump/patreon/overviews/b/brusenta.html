    "summary": "Hello generous soul,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Alex. I compose music, make visual art, and work with some incredible people to in order to create\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.brusenta.com/experiences\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eexperiences\u003c/a\u003e (broadly defined) for you. Since you\u0027re reading this here (on Patreon), I would like to start off by thanking you for considering supporting me and my work. That simple act already means the world to me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re here to just sign on as a patron (and know how this works and need no further convincing), I\u0027ll save you the hassle of reading further and simply say \u0027thank you\u0027 right here. In a very tangible way, you make everything I do possible and for that, I can never be grateful enough.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re unsure and would like to know a little bit more about me, what I do, and why I would benefit from your support (and how that, in turn, would benefit you), please read on.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY \u003c/strong\u003eI do what I do:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI am driven by the belief that space [physical, mental, temporal] is \n\t\u003cem\u003evitally \u003c/em\u003eimportant. It is an opportunity and a catalyst. It is an invitation for the things that matter most: empathy, connection, and peace.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tArt - especially adventurous art - is uniquely capable of creating the spaces we most need. By breaking away from static patterns and entrenched expectations, it can bypass our walls and give us a place where we can just be [ourselves, alone, together...] and [heal, connect, love...].\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWHAT I actually do:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI create art - of all sorts. My canvas is any moment you\u0027re willing to share with me. My medium is any sound, sight, smell, taste, or touch that allows me to create a space where you can play, explore, and question freely. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough I work across media, the core of my world is music. I completed my Master\u0027s in composition at Royal Academy of Music in London and have been lucky enough to have my music performed internationally by renowned artists such as the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the CHROMA Ensemble, and Alexandra Wood and Huw Watkins. Having had these incredible experiences, my goal is to continue to push the musical medium further in order to find the most relevant and engaging way to tell the story of us now. (For a bit more on my musical background you check out my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://issuu.com/brusenta/docs/official_bio_-_short/1?ff=true\u0026amp;e=11501286/43576830\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eshort\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://issuu.com/brusenta/docs/official_bio_-_long/1?ff=true\u0026amp;e=11501286/43576821\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elong\u003c/a\u003e composer bios.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eTo compliment the compositions, I make graphic artwork and videos. These works are paired with the music as a way to offer listeners a more tangible in to an abstract world. With time and resources, I will further expand my work to include immersive experiences that combine all the aforementioned into evening-length shows that indulge all the senses (think socially-conscious opera meets immersive theater with a twist,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.beyonce.com/album/lemonade-visual-album/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLemonade\u003c/a\u003e-style).\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIf you want to see some of my work, absolutely everything can be found on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://brusenta.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHOW you can help:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI LOVE creating. I work every single day for most of the day. If I\u0027m not working, then I\u0027m thinking about working. That said, two things I do not love are timelines and deadlines. I believe that more often than not, they kill creativity and result in adequacy. I \n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003enever\u003c/u\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ewant to be adequate: extraordinary or bust!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIn order to work in the way that best suits my strengths, I need [space]. In practical terms, that means some financial stability and a clear head. Though the current system of working for commissions and applying for grants and awards has its place, I feel that it is ultimately a disservice to the art because it either forces me to rush or to work on getting work - neither of which is, in the grand scheme of things, worthwhile. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003eYou can help me break from that system by pledging your support here. Simply put, by becoming a patron, you agree to donate a set amount every month in order to support my work at whatever level works for you. It may not seem like much, but even a little steady income can do wonders by allowing me to be more independent\u00a0and consequently more selective about the work I do take on ensuring that I can keep the focus on quality and quality alone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWHAT is in it for you?:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tUltimately, that depends on how this goes.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMy initial goal is to make what I currently do sustainable. Everything from web hosting, to renting rehearsal spaces, to adequately compensating my collaborators for their time and talent requires money. Thus far, everything has been self-funded with practically all earnings from awards and commissions going back into making more art for you. Though endlessly rewarding, this model is ultimately unsustainable. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWith your support, I can ensure that I am able to continue to create what I do now, at the pace that I do now, and offer it all online for free. This includes full perusal scores on\u00a0\n\t\u003ca href=\"http://issuu.com/brusenta\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eISSUU\u003c/a\u003e, videos on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/brusenta\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e, recordings on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://soundcloud.com/brusenta\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSoundCloud\u003c/a\u003e, and writings and artwork on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://brusenta.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e. That is the bare \u003cem\u003eminimum \u003c/em\u003ethat I promise.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAnything beyond this initial goal will go to into creating more ambitious content faster. Faster? Yes, faster! Currently, everything that I can possibly manage to do, I do myself - even if I\u0027m not the best person to do it. I do this because I do not charge myself and, at the moment, money is the limiting factor in absolutely everything I do. With adequate funds, I can expand my network of collaborators and ensure that the best person is working on each element of each project. In addition to improving quality, it also frees me up to do what I do best, consequently allowing me to create more high-quality art for you, faster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for rewards, aside from the patron-only feed (which is offered at any patronage level), they are of the warm/fuzzy feeling variety. Simply put, I want to focus on my actual work, and if you\u0027re here, I assume you want the same. If you do have suggestions of things you\u0027d like to see, please let me know - this is definitely an open conversation. In the meantime, to help give you a sense of what your support means to me in practical terms, I have included descriptions of what a donation at each of the suggested tiers could provide me each month. You make this happen.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAbout the per month thing:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI gave this a lot of thought. Why should you pay me for just working, instead of for delivering? First, getting paid per thing gets me back to the situation I am trying to get away from; I do not want to have to crank something out just to get some money. Second, not all things are equal. A short piano ditty is a thing, but so is a 25-minute orchestral piece. Under the per-thing system, thing 1 = thing 2. In real life, thing 1 does not even resemble thing 2. Sometimes I\u0027ll release smaller things quickly, other times, a big pause will precede a big release. At the end of the day, I think it works out better if you know what you\u0027re giving and I know what I\u0027m getting so that I can work without pause to make the best art for you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, it comes down to trust: you trust me with your time (and maybe some money) and I work for you by writing music, making art, telling stories, and creating spaces that help us break away from the ordinary and enjoy life, and one another, a bit more.\n\u003cbr\u003e\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t That said, I completely understand if it is not for everyone.\n\u003cbr\u003e\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t If you happen to be someone who wants to support my work but not regularly and per thing, please consider purchasing something from my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://brusenta.com/shop\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eonline shop\u003c/a\u003e. Each item will bring in a modest bit of income for me and allow you to have a physical copy of some of my work. Everyone wins.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003eAlternately, you can commission a work. If you\u0027re interested, get in touch: brusenta.com/connect\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eConclusion:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003eWow, this turned out to be a bit more text than expected - if you\u0027re still reading, kudos to you! \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tBut, seriously, thank you so much for considering to support my work. I said it above, but I\u0027ll say it again, it really means the world to me.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWith love and gratitude,\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAlex\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e"
