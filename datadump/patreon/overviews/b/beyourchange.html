    "summary": "Hey Everyone--\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am social creative entrepreneur passionate about empowering people and organizations to share their voice. I don\u0027t know about you but I am tired of mainstream media talking about negative news where there are so many people doing incredible things, small or big to create the world I want to live in. I am also driven by aligning my values with my work, doing something that makes me feel good and where I feel I am helping the world to be a better place.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I decided to create Be Your Change. It has been a long journey, getting my voice out of there was not easy but my interests in the environment, diversity and Inclusion, women empowerment, education, politics, social justice and social impact was the driven force behind the idea of launching a podcast network. I have met and discovered so many incredible people and telling their stories was calling me. I grew up listening to the radio\u00a0and I am more a listener than a visual person. As a child, my favorite things was to listen\u00a0to the stories from my grandparents and other elderly. That\u0027s why last January, I launched my first podcast\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.soundcloud.com/techinclusion\"\u003eTech Inclusion\u003c/a\u003e and in August I launched\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.beyourchange.co\"\u003eBe Your Change\u003c/a\u003e to enable me to cover a larger set of issues. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe Your Change (BYCN) podcast network is to create the world you want to live in. It\u0027s about the changes we can make every day at every level, in our lives, with our time to participate in creating positive change. We have the power to create a conscious world where everyone thrives and where we take care of our planet and ourselves. BYCN wants to empower people to create a sustainable, healthy, eco-friendly supportive world, where success means we live an abundant life in harmony with our family, friends, communities, and values. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou joining my journey will support me in developing this vision and have the ability to produce high-quality audio content. Producing a podcast takes time and great skills from many different people. You can also help by just liking our Facebook page and sharing the podcast with your friends. If you feel you want to get more involved, then I am looking for people to help in digital marketing and, graphic design. You might decide you want to write for the website or let me know about a story you think we should cover. We often forget how much power we hold in transforming the world. Every actions matter and your support matters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI won\u0027t create a video sorry... not my best skill for now. Every feedback welcome, feel free to email me! Thank you for sharing my vision and expressing your support! Best, Juliette\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
