While my first book could be written with or without Patreon, with Patreon, it changes years to possibly months. as an amateur writer, I am opening myself and my world to you, my patrons and friends, to share ideas with, expand the world with, and have some fun in a land not our own. whether you stop and watch from the shallows, or dive headfirst into this new land, thank you for you time and support, because every little bit helps."
