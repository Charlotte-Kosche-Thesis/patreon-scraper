     "about": "As a child growing up I was always surrounded by comics, my\nmother loved Archie and strips like for better or for worse. There would always\nbe little piles of books in the bathroom for reading. Then when I was 8 my\nbabysitter Cy exposed me to the wonders of super hero comics, and I was hooked.\n I developed an intense passion for the\nstory telling medium, and it had astrong influence on my\ndevelopment as an artist. I drew some of my first strips about my cats at the\nage of 8. This interest continued to fuel my creativity throughout my life, I\nwas always drawing new characters and creating new stories. It was always my dream\nto draw comics for a living, but I never thought I would. After high school I\nentered the workforce to save some money to return to college. After working in\ninstallation renovation for a bit I ended up settling into a collections\nposition at a local company. Though the work was sometimes soul sucking I\nenjoyed that it allowed me to doodle and draw for most of the time I was\nworking. Finally after many of coworkers and managers questioned me after\nseeing my illustrations, \u201cwhy are you here?\u201d I asked myself the same. Why\nshould I give up on a dream I never even tried to reach. So now with some money\nsaved, I decided to pursue a formal education in illustration. I was aware that\nMax the Mutt College of Animation, Art \u0026amp; Design had recently started their\nillustration for sequential arts program. Finally having the option of\neducating myself in the specific field I was interested in, I applied.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe formal training I went through at Max the Mutt\nCollege of Animation, Art \u0026amp; Design prepared me for a career as an\nillustrator. Their classes provided a strong base of fine art fundamentals in\nLife Drawing, Anatomy, Perspective, Animal drawing, Painting and Colour Theory.\nAs well as training us specifically in the creation of comics, children\u2019s books\nand other illustrated media. From scripting writing to layout, though\npenciling, inking and colouring, to lettering and preparing files for final\nprint, all aspects of the process were covered. I excelled in my understanding\nof layout and design, perspective, figure drawing and any work involved in a\ndigital medium. The school also put a strong emphasis on professionalism, and\nprovided solid information on how to find work in our chosen careers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy professional career began while I was still\nin school. In-between my second and third year I illustrated a thirteen page\nstory for an anthology entitled Shards Tales from the Ruin Nation written by\nAlex Steacy. Upon graduating I began work doing lettering and inking for a\ncouple of kickstartered comics, Shards and Demonox, that both were unfortunately\nunsuccessful. The next project I was solicited for was to finish the\nIllustration for the 6th final issue of Freelance Blues This was a great honor\nas I had been a fan of the independently published series for a few years.  I contributed four full colour pages for the\nprofessor elemental anthology issue 3. Another wonder full achievement for me\nas I have enjoyed the professor\u2019s work for years!  More Recently I illustrated comic pages for the\nOntario Truckers Association Truck Hero Awards video, I did character and\nlayout designs for Sticky Brain Studio and completed several illustrations for\nthe Sci-Fi parody book How to Conquer the Earth written by Michael Lee.  Throughout this time I have been working\nconventions, producing illustrating on commission and creating art prints to\nsell. Currently, I am doing all the illustration and graphic design for a\nstrategy board game called Kaiju Conquest. As well I continue to work on my own\nindependent projects, the Sci-Fi graphic novels Bolts, my Steampunk horror\ncomic The Twisted Tale of a Tortured Raven and my semi-autobiographical meta\nhorror comic series Proxy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThroughout it all there has been ups and downs,\nbut I can no longer deny I am chasing the dream and finding it. There is work\nout there for even us little fish and you can build a career, and I am so grateful\nfor it. All this is so I can start to focus a bit more on my own stories, many\nof which are horror to help me express and release a lot of the dark that\nhaunts my past. Every step forward has only made my life brighter so I\u2019ll\ncontinue towards my goals to tell my own stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
