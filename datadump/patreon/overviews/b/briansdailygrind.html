Thank you for considering becoming one of my PATRONS.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you don\u0027t know, let me tell you a bit about me.\u003cbr\u003eLife has produced a very interesting journey for me so far. It has taken me from kid with an incredibly rough upbringing, to a man that has more skills than he can count on his fingers and toes combined. After years of being drug through mud and broken glass, I have come out on the other side with so much to give.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI produce content of all kinds. Motivational videos, vlogs, blogs, gaming footage, short stories, novels, audiobooks and audio dramas, toys, shirts, posters, art, photography, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting today, my patrons get first access to all of that content days, and sometimes weeks before anyone else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo Why Patreon? I love to produce all this content. I would do it non stop all day, everyday.\u00a0However, I got bills to pay and a family to feed. That means that every second is precious and each of those seconds has to produce income. Thats where you come in.\u003cbr\u003eFor as little as $1 a month, you can become a patron that contributes to the ongoing production of all the awesome stuff I do. Obviously, if you want to contribute more you certainly can. I have some different levels of rewards for different levels of contribution.\u003cbr\u003eYou Rock. Remember, you are making a difference.\u003cbr\u003eBrian"
