You won\u0027t pay me for any gaps between seasons -- you\u0027ll only pay for what you receive. For 6ish months of the year, episodes will be every other week, so you\u0027ll pay twice your pledge amount each month. And then there will be a dry spell, where you won\u0027t pay me anything. With your support, I hope to produce more episodes and release them for more months out of the year!\u003cbr\u003e"

This season includes sound I collected on trips to New York City. I would LOVE to do more of this for Babes of Science. The going rate for a tape synch (where you hire someone to go record your interview because that person lives in Los Angeles/Canada/Japan and you don\u0027t) is $125 for an hourlong interview. I\u0027m a pretty cheap traveler, but bus tickets \u0026amp; tape synchs don\u0027t grow on trees!\u003cbr\u003e",
