As i work to keep up with such a print heavy environment filament became a concern, getting into huge usages up to 5-6kg a week and not daring to run more printers because i couldn\u0027t keep up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo i began looking into filament, working with proto-pasta to get some of their materials to apply to some of my college projects and eventually interning at their factory making filament. after finishing the internship i began my adventure to get into home filament production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003enow with my Wellzoom extruder and my filastruder in rebuild i\u0027m ready to begin filament production. join my Patreon to venture with me in testing new filaments and get some of the first rolls of BradyHoover Designs filament.\u003cbr\u003e",
