    "summary": "I am a geek from Norway whose calling in life is to play the harp, and sometimes I also sing. My works include covers of music from my favourite games, movies, animes and TV shows, and the artists that I love and admire. I\u0027ve been playing the harp since 2007, and have been fortunate enough to have been taught by one of Norway\u0027s finest harpists, Sunniva R\u00f8dland Wettre. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m crazy about the Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, K-pop and folk music, and although this may seem like a very random mix, I am determined to express all of my burning passion for these fandoms through my harp music, to delight all my fellow nerds out there! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to be able to one day be able to support myself, at least partly, by playing my music. Or if I can\u0027t do that, then at least to be able to inspire others to learn to play this most wonderful of instruments that I love so much. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour generous patronage will help finance things like equipment upgrades, repairs/replacement harp strings, costumes, props and other things that will enhance the overall experience of my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I can promise you is varied content, all of which are my personal arrangements of my own favourite songs and melodies. So if your interests coincide with mine, please lend me your support and help me make my dream come true!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
