I am a fun loving, compassionate, and hard working guy that enjoys long drives with the windows rolled down and great music blasting from the speakers. I also think that anything below 75 degrees is too cold! lol.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI found my passion at a very young age and it all started when I got on stage with my ukulele when I was 9 years old. The butterflies before the performance, an empty stage, the heat from the stage lights, not knowing if anyone will like what I do, and all of those doubts fading away once I start strumming. Then it\u0027s freedom and bliss. Over the years, as the crowds changed and got more drunk, the feelings remained. Letting go of everything else going on in life, the smiles I see in the audience, the rumble from the loud amplifiers, people dancing and getting sweaty, watching that one persistent guy try to pick up every single girl he walks by (lol), seeing friends having the best night ever! I love the rush of stepping away from the mic to listen as the crowd sings, sharing my stories and taking people on a journey from song to song, creating a safe and loving community brought together by music. It\u0027s about leaving your all on the stage and I have been doing that for over a decade.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am passionate about music and I love creating. I\u0027m one of those guys that buys a dresser from IKEA or Costco that puts the instructions on the side and just starts building. I like to try new things and learn along the way. In music, it works great, not so much in building furniture lol. There is something freeing about a blank piece of paper and a music idea. I can usually hear in my head where the music wants to go and the songs usually write themselves. Creating something from nothing, building the parts, creating tension and release, adding the low end and the bass, creating the musical canvas and then adding the lyrics to tie it all together. I love it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made the decision a long time ago that I wasn\u0027t going to follow what\u0027s normal and that I was going to create my career in music no matter how hard it would be. I want to truly say that I don\u0027t work a day in my life because I am doing what I love. I got my bachelor\u0027s degree from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in Music Business and my band Local Uprising (cali reggae, conscious, rock band) is doing great! We have played some amazing shows opening up for bands I looked up to like Tribal Seeds, Ekolu, Fiji, New Kingston, Mike Love and many more but its just the beginning. I work hard daily, write down my goals and have a bucket list of places I want to perform at like the Red Rocks Amphitheater in CO, Carnegie Hall in NY, the One Love Festival in New Zealand, the Cali Roots Festival in Monterey CA, play an official showcase at SXSW in Austin TX and one day playing the famous Waikiki Shell in my hometown of Hawaii while watching the whole crowd sing the chorus to my song Heartbreak Girl.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make a difference. If life is a buffet, I want to bring more than I take. I want to bring that soul food to make people slow and smile, to make people think, to push people to be better to one another. I want to be an outlet and an alternative to all of the stuff going on in the world today. \u00a0I want a hub, a music and entertainment network that people can escape to\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll say it again, a place people can \u003cstrong\u003eescape\u003c/strong\u003e to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started live streaming almost three years ago on an app called Periscope and this is where I started my music \u0026amp; entertainment network. I would go live all the time while I was rehearsing, in the studio, roaming around town, or when I was catching waves in the ocean at Sandys (yup, I was the crazy person taking selfies in the shore break! haha). It was always about good vibes, spreading positivity and the jams! I met so many cool people and would get messages all the time about how my music turned around someone\u0027s day or how a song helped them through troubled times. Like all growing apps and the demands that come with it, the vibe of Periscope changed.\u00a0So I have been on a mission to create my own music and entertainment network. A community and space where I can share inspiring music/arrangements, a place where people can go to when they\u0027ve had a long day or they are sick of whats going on in the news and need a positive outlet. A place all about good vibes, positivity and the jams!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me create and build that community here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew to Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\tHeres how it works...\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a monthly donation platform for creators and artists to do what they love.

Here, I share five things going on with things like behind the scenes videos, rough drafts of new music I am working on, other projects I\u0027m a part of and Q\u0026amp;A sessions. These broadcasts are a lot of fun!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAnd starting this year, the replays of these exclusive broadcasts will be available so you can watch the ones that you miss. Or rewatch the ones you love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- FLASH SALE DISCOUNTS and EXCLUSIVE PATREON ONLY MERCH\u003cbr\u003eReceive random flash sale coupons to use at my online shop.

Lots of cool stuff exclusively for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will get everything above, doesn\u0027t matter what you donate!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand there will be\u003cbr\u003e- MONTHLY FUN AND RANDOM REWARDS\u003cbr\u003eCheck in before the end of each month for a few fun and random tier rewards.
