I\u0027ve been making good-intentioned attempts at making comics for a few years with varying levels of efficiency, and the past year have finally managed to make something I\u0027m proud to call my own. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUseless\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, my darling baby and well-nurtured hobby project, is now live, and making headway towards being the thing I\u0027ve been dreaming of for over five years.

I\u0027m determined to see this monster through, and that includes a heck of a lot more to give you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhat you could come to expect from me, if this works out:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePDFs of the script, broken down from arc-act-scene, plus all the notes involved and the occasional trashed versions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSemi-(ir)regular full illustrations of characters, ranging from character refs, pin-ups, ridiculous memes, and more. You want a full breakdown of a character\u0027s costume? A loving sketch of Harper holding a grapefruit? Quinn memes? These can be yours.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\"Deleted scenes\" and extras from each arc of the comic, including the occasional foray into the lives of the villains the Useless encounter, and slices of the team\u0027s shenanigans on their own.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn progress shots of pages and illustrations, as well as occasional streaming experiences!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMystery mini comics and illustrations of projects that aren\u0027t Useless (far less frequent)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAnd possibly more, who knows?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBUT WAIT!
