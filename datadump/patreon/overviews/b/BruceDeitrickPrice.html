The average citizen doesn\u0027t have a chance against the Education Establishment, which is supremely talented at creating fog and fatigue. People can\u0027t understand the jargon and weird logic; and finally they get tired and give up. We need a lot more education about education.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext, the biggest disappointment is how passive the movers and shakers are, how useless the rich and famous are, how little our many institutions contribute to a solution. Ivy League universities? They\u0027re not doing anything. The media? They\u0027re not doing anything. There seems to be a great silence wherein all the \u00a0rich and powerful agree not to do anything. So we have tens of millions of functional illiterates; and even students in college know very little.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e So my campaign is aimed at informing the public about what goes on in the schools, and motivating the public to do something about it.",

We eliminate the  flawed theories and methods promoted by John Dewey and his followers throughout the past hundred years. We return to a world where learning, not Ideology, is primary. \u003cstrong\u003eWe embrace the proven ideas typically used in the best private schools, classical academies, Montessori schools, and homeschooling. \u003c/strong\u003eStudents, parents, and teachers will be better off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor many years, I\u2019ve conducted a reform campaign on a shoestring.   With a larger budget I can reach far more people. Your support (\u003cstrong\u003e$1 or more\u003c/strong\u003e) will go to ads in popular sites and magazines, Facebook boosts,\u00a0press releases, and other marketing options. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e  Together, we can make the American public more knowledgeable. That\u2019s the essential first step\u003c/strong\u003e. Otherwise, the Education Establishment will continue to exploit the public\u2019s ignorance, peddling such counterproductive methods as Sight-words, Constructivism, Reform Math, Cooperative Learning, Self-esteem, Multiculturalism, Common Core, and many others.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e  The Education Establishment hides behind jargon, marketing slogans, and disinformation. My forte is deconstructing this stuff so the school system once again becomes transparent.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e If you feel that the public schools have gone off-course and you want them to return to traditional, common-sense approaches, please support my campaign.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e",
