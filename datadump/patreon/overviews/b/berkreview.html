    "summary": "Berkreviews.com is approaching the start of its third year. It\u2019s because of our readers and listeners that we\u2019ve been able to grow. We currently have a few writers, but we are really hoping to add some more. We currently have four podcasts in our family and also hope to add some more in the future. However, we want to provide the best content imaginable and maintaining the quality isn\u2019t easy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are grateful for those who chose to support us. The money donated to us is used to pay for server costs for both podcasts and the site, marketing, and purchasing access to films (whether tickets, Moviepass.com, Vudu digital, DVD/Bluray, Netflix, etc). I also hope to be able to offer writers compensation for their work, which is something I can\u2019t do without the donations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future, we hope to continue to grow and get you reviews that lend insight to the film and also introduce to movies you may not have heard of. I love film. It\u2019s my passion and my longest love. I\u2019ve spent much of the last five years of my life to independent research and study of film. Neither of my degrees is on the subject, but the next one will be, one day, in the future. I teach high school film and I hope to continue to expand my knowledge while running this website, podcasts, and meeting more film enthusiasts."
