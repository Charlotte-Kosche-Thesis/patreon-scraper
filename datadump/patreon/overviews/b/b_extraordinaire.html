Yes, weaving. Like on a loom. The kind I use is about 5 feet wide and purely human powered. I make cloth and then turn it into luscious pieces of wearable art. Through my apprenticeship I have acquired equipment, materials, and a product line. Now I\u0027m ready to turn this remarkable skill into a thriving business.

The people have been asking and I am here for it. Over the past years I have performed at house parties, ecstatic dance, and small bars. I\u0027m starting to book bigger gigs and I\u0027m very excited to see where it leads. The vibe is what I\u0027m calling Deep Femme Disco House and it\u0027s got a radical framework.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly...\u003cbr\u003eTurns out I lead an interesting life, and I\u0027ve got some strong opinions.

I dream of giging femme powered events in major West Coast cities. I wish to pursue this rabbit as far down the hole as it wants to take me (I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s headed toward production). And I want you to bring the ritual home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am eager to be publicly vulnerable. But it\u0027s just too scary out there in the internet wasteland. I want to know that the content I\u0027m sharing is held in circles of care.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost importantly I seek to give back.

It will also assist me in purchasing the kind of equipment necessary to take my video and DJ skills next level.\u003cbr\u003e",

Some travel is necessary in order to discover new markets for my work. I have already laid some groundwork in the Bay Area through the boutique \u003ca href=\"http://www.phyllisboutique.com/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePhyllis\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e in Palo Alto. I will continue to broaden my representation in northern California. I also see my work in other major cities with the top 3 destinations being L.A., Portland, and Santa Fe. In order to make that kind of travel with safety and ease a vehicle upgrade is paramount. I love my vintage Mercedes wagon but she\u0027s ready to retire from the long haul road trips.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also envision having more time on the decks and in the crates so that I can keep bringing YOU fresh sounds. And I\u0027ll bring those fresh sounds with me when I travel. Book me for your gig.\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e",

With this level of support RAANU can confidently hire a collaborator.
