I\u0027m Bobduh, the creator of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://wrongeverytime.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWrong Every Time\u003c/a\u003e, a site for criticism on anime specifically and storytelling in general. I tend to focus on media as a vehicle for specific themes, as well as the craft of narrative and character. Sometimes I talk about the ways we consume and identify with media, sometimes I just make silly jokes about cartoons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently update several days a week with new thoughts on shows or specific media breakdowns, but have to balance my output with my frustrating need for food, shelter, and high speed internet. With your help, I\u0027ll be able to devote more time to the criticism I love, resulting in more close analysis of individual episodes, more essays on old classics, and maybe even some streaming content, videos, or other entirely new features. The sky is the limit when you give me money to do things!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you appreciate the work I\u0027m currently doing and would like to see me continuing doing it while remaining an alive person, please consider lending a hand. I\u0027m holding off on setting concrete goals for now, but some projects I have in mind would include episodic writeups of older shows like Evangelion, streaming either games or visual novels, and possibly posting some short fiction on the site. It really depends on what you all want and would be interested in supporting, so please, let me know! Either way, I deeply appreciate your patronage of my site up until now, and am very grateful for however you choose to continue supporting my work. Thank you all for giving me a platform to share the work I love."
