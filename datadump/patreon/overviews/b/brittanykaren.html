    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eBrittany Karen and the Americans\u003c/em\u003e: born in the wake of our nation\u0027s total bummer political climate. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen your family and friends turn out to be racist, sexist, homophobic, shitheads. You\u0027re not getting anywhere fighting online, you\u0027ve shared article after article only to realize no one is reading. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour voice is muffled by men speaking over you and down to you when you speak up. \u003cbr\u003eYou question the purpose of caring and feel yourself slipping into complacency because the issues at hand are so huge and you don\u0027t know where to start. Knowing you need to release frustration and crack yourself up, you put on a few wigs to mock your family members and online trolls. Why not make some videos and text them to your friends? They love it! So you make an Instagram account and stop sleeping because the ideas of hilarity, characters, and situations flood your recently numb uninspired brain and the thought of your disparaged friends cry-laughing is enough to smash your insecurities about the ugliness of the wig people. Helplessness is no longer blindfolding your mind and you\u0027re making a difference to the people around you through laughter! Your phone starts blowing up with texts begging for more. Everywhere you go, acquaintances  encourage you to keep doing the weirdest, ugliest, most uncomfortable art you ever didn\u0027t know you were capable of making. In fact, before this, you were so terrified of public speaking that you actually vomited before class presentations or introducing yourself in a crowd. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the WIGS...the WIGS give you power that you\u0027ve never felt before! Your voice becomes clear and you find yourself loving YOU at all strange and unflattering camera angles. Suddenly, your best friends start rallying to support this strange new art and you\u0027re hooked up with a videographer and fucking shit, it\u0027s a YouTube show! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s \u003cem\u003eBrittany Karen and the Americans\u003c/em\u003e!!! Brittany Karen finds herself interviewing the very bad ass women in her community and topics are being heard by hundreds of people in a fun and weird way. A heckin\u0027 woman is being funny, crude, and opinionated! She gains support and isn\u0027t required to be sexy or cute while doing any of it which stands out because: when are women allowed to be funny AND ugly? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe answer is NOW because \u003cem\u003eBrittany Karen and the Americans\u003c/em\u003e are doing it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show is produced by the good will of Erin Zimmerman. She has donated her time to film and edit the show, but only for as long as she can afford to do so with her free time. The costumes, props, and sets are procured by creative mastermind, Andiy Ransom. There is no profit or budget for the show since Andiy is a part time laborer, raising two kids, and struggling to make ends meet. The magic that is happening is being done with almost no budget, and what is used comes from utility and grocery funds. Realistically, Erin and Andiy can\u0027t keep up the starving art forever. Andiy is facing the reality of giving up her creativity for a full time job if \u003cem\u003eThe Brittany Karen Show\u003c/em\u003e can\u0027t generate enough revenue to sustain itself. Imagine what could be done for the production of the show if there was funding or additional resources! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re looking for support in ways to build a set crew, expand production, grow our wardrobe, write and produce scenes, and of course pay ourselves for the time we put into production. So, if you enjoy weird, wild women making art and using their voices, or want to contribute to the production of the show, please consider supporting our project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor our friends who have supported us by sharing our content online, being extras, taking photos, making videos, and sending encouraging texts, THANK YOU.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
