    "summary": "My name is Ben Petry. I\u0027m the author of the \"Three Kinsmen\" fantasy series and the co-creator of Milton Roe Creative\u0027s SHOOT COWS brand. I recently took a leap of faith in my creative life. I resigned from an unfulfilling day job to raise my two children, and to work from home on my creative projects. My wife -- the one with the college degree and the professional career -- gave me leave to do this, with one condition:\u00a0 that I earn a couple hundred bucks a week to offset the losses incurred by quitting my job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve worked hard all my life (and I don\u0027t mind doing so), but my passions lie in storytelling, in bringing people together over the shared experience of wonder and enjoyment. I have at least a lifetime\u0027s worth of books to write and games to create, but as a homemaker and part-time breadwinner, it\u0027s difficult carving out the time it takes to work on them. Or, as my friend and reader Stephen is fond of saying, to \"get ON my duff, and get to work.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t like asking people for favors, but I realize that everyone has to start somewhere. I\u0027m looking for a few (hundred, maybe) of my friends, family members and fans, who are willing to be patrons of my art. With enough of you, pledging just pennies a day, I could spend my time working on what I love -- my life\u0027s calling, my career -- rather than looking for, bidding on and performing side jobs just to make ends meet. If you like me, like what I do, or just like the idea of bringing stories to life in the world, then please consider pledging. Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://benpetry.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSee what I\u0027m up to\u003c/a\u003e"
