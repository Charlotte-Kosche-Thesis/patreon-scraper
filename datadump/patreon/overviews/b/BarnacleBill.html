    "summary": "Barnacle Bill Magazine started as a blog idea but rapidly outgrew its original parameters. Aimed at the amateur boat builder and small boat sailor the content is primarily aimed at those who have an interest in building boats, usually wooden, or those who enjoy the recreation (as opposed to racing) sailing, motor and oar as well as paddle boats (canoes). With a firm emphasis on the creative, the adventurer and the history and craft of boat building around the world. Our readership is global, we will initially publish in English but will be publishing in French, German and Spanish as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBarnacle Bill is about boats yes, but it is also about waterbound adventure whether it be an expedition in an open boat around Cape Horn or a jaunt up the Thames with the grandkids. We are about sailing as a recreation not a race. We are about the idea of \u0027relative\u0027 adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have some exciting plans lined up in the future, we\u0027ll be collaborating with Duckworks Magazine and Small Craft Advisor Magazine on some international projects and will be sponsoring clubs and raids as well as looking at launching new ones in the UK. We\u0027ll be carrying out boat reviews and will also publish a comprehensive buyer\u0027s guide to small boats and canoes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe format will be monthly and of around 24-36 pages depending on content. We will carry some paid advertising to keep subscription costs as low as possible. With content from some of the leading contemporary boat designers such as John Welsford, Mik Storer, Francois Vivier and Keith Callaghan the magazine will include monthly features on design and building techniques as well as accounts of voyages, planned trips and club and society updates, links to suppliers, designers and organisations designed to help you get afloat or stay afloat. Boat builds.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe already have commitments from five leading designers and three other writers in the sector and are now working on planning the February issue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA key ongoing feature of the first six months will be the OpenGoose project \u003ca href=\"http://www.opengoose.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.opengoose.com\u003c/a\u003e . Mik Storer the designer has already shown how the OpenGoose can be used to equip a community club with a whole fleet of boats, quickly and at minimum cost. The class is rapidly developing with dedicated sail numbers and a growing global following. We\u0027ve been working with Mik to adapt the Goose for the UK/European market and we will be building a Mik Storer OpenGoose for as little money as possible to prove that an effective and engaging family sailing boat can be built for not a lot of money. The main motivation is because the costs involved in getting afloat are very high. The irony is that boating only became a mass sport, especially sailing, post WW2 when there was a surplus of marine ply and with the development of epoxies. However, the technological arms race, as well as increased costs in labour, materials and spare time have made the cost of even a modest new boat beyond many. With a range of designs like the OpenGoose, the Goat Island Skiff (another Storer Design) and the Saturday Night Special by John Welsford, there is a growing market for easy-to-build, lightweight but sturdy, family boats which perform well under sail, oar and motor but all costing considerably less than an \u0027off the shelf\u0027 dinghy. One of the core missions of Barnacle Bill is to get armchair sailors on the water by lowering the bar to entry and making sailing, in particular, more accessible to more people around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to produce high quality content we need to incur costs. We\u0027re keeping these as low as possible by using open source software where possible and existing hardware, vehicles etc. However, there are costs we cannot avoid including photo rights, content, travel and accommodation for articles and I also need to eat (I\u0027m a cheap date, don\u0027t worry).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you\u0027re worrying that this sounds like a lot to get off the ground, yes it is. However, I am not a stranger to the world of publishing and started my career in Magazines in the early to mid nineties before moving to online and then recruitment in the noughties. In addition, my wife, Nichola is a professional editor and has worked in journal publishing her whole career. I am also a highly experience sales person and am technically competent with web and graphic design which is just a swell for the first few issues I will be editor, publisher, ad manager, production manager, designer and tea boy. Technology wise, the first few issues will be released through the tried and tested Joomag digital magazine system but as soon as we can afford it we will be moving over to a UK based system called YUDU. It is used by several international titles including Men\u0027s Health.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve got the people, we\u0027ve got the content and the readership identified and all we need now are the patrons to back us with the project and launch this exciting new magazine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron, you will have the ability to request subjects and articles and we\u0027ll also take your suggestions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
