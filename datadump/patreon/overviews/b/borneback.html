Typically, each post is\nthree or four items, readable in five or six minutes, as in these samples\n[link]. All the BB material is date-specific, tied to a noteworthy (or just\namusing) book-related event \u2014 the day that James Joyce had his first date with\nNora Barnacle, that Wilde went to prison, that Dante was expelled from Florence,\nthat \u003cem\u003eA Christmas Carol \u003c/em\u003ewas published,\nthat Groucho Marx dined at the home of T. S. Eliot (\u201c\u2026So, apropos of\npractically nothing, and not with a bang but a whimper, I tossed in a quotation\nfrom \u003cem\u003eThe Waste Land\u003c/em\u003e \u2014 that, I\nthought, will show him I\u0027ve read a thing or two besides my press notices from\nVaudeville.\u2026\u201d)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n My\naim is to open a window of fresh air to the world of books \u2014 provide context\nfor a famous quotation or overlooked author, connect a work to its time and to\nours, relate a telling anecdote. All my work is researched and reliable, based\non years of teaching and reading rather than online, cut-and-paste sources.

If\nyou \u003cem\u003ewish\u003c/em\u003e you read more, or were\nbetter acquainted with the literary tradition, BB will offer inspiration and\nopportunity.

This became\n\u201cToday in Literature,\u201d a syndication service for libraries and book-related\nwebsites; Borne Back has evolved from that. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThroughout, I have had one main goal: to encourage\ndeeper reading by making the literary past more accessible.

     "description": "In the short term, my goal is to secure\nenough patronage to decrease the pen-for-hire (i.e. pay-the-bills) writing I\ndo, freeing up time to develop more BB content. I currently have several years\u2019\nworth of on-this-day material, but there is so much more out there, especially\nwith regards to writers beyond the confines of the Western canon. So much of\nthe material available online is inaccurate, unclear or tailored for specialists;\ncareful research and accessible writing takes time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy ultimate goal is a more or less\ncomprehensive, searchable archive of date-based material, useful to readers,\nstudents, libraries, book advocacy groups \u2014 anyone interested in enjoying or\npreserving our common literary heritage. Such a resource, in a range of\nformats, would be a useful tool to keep not only reading but cultural literacy\nalive. Imagine a daily 5-minute literary item leading readers to related music,\nart, dance, movies\u2026. For example, a BB story on Constantine Cavafy\u2019s poem \u201cThe\nGod Abandons Anthony\u201d might lead to Leonard Cohen\u2019s song \u201cAlexandra Leaving\u201d; a\nstory on the murder of Federico Garcia Lorca to Picasso\u2019s \u201cGuernica\u201d; a story\non \u003cem\u003eFor Whom the Bell Tolls \u003c/em\u003eto Orson\nWelles reading the John Donne Meditation which gave Hemingway his title, or to\na Martin Luther King Jr. speech (delivered just a few weeks before his\nassassination) which also incorporates the Donne Meditation. Such an\naudiovisual project would take manpower and technical expertise, and alliances\nwith other content providers, but it is achievable. And essential: literature\nis being marginalized, its place in the wider cultural record unappreciated,\nits power to enrich and humanize lost.\u003cbr\u003e",
