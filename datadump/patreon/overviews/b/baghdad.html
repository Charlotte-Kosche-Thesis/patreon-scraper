Better lighting would be nice too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSan Francisco is also a very difficult city to get ahead in. No one knows this better than me when during the last recession I was out of work for over 2 years. I rang up a lot of debt and almost lost everything I own. I\u0027m still trying to pay that off and I believe with the new equipment it will help make my blog and soon to be upgraded video channel more profitable.
