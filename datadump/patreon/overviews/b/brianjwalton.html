    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eFirst, um... who are you?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m Brian J. Walton, author, screenwriting, editor of the Future Visions Anthology series as well as a husband, and father to two adorable and rambunctious\u00a0boys (well, one is rambunctious while the other sits there working busily on becoming the platonic ideal of cuteness). My first series, the \"Recursion Event Saga\" has already sold thousands of copies, and my next endeavor, the Future Visions Anthology is about to launch with quarterly volumes. In short, I\u0027m going to putting out a lot of fiction in the coming months for you to read.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut why Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003eGood question. I\u0027m starting this page as a way of connecting directly with you, my readers. But also, let\u0027s be honest, as a way of making money. Artists need to buy coffee (and sometimes food as well) and artist\u0027s kids need even more than coffee to subsist (or so I\u0027m told). Moreover, Amazon takes a long time to pay their authors, and that\u0027s a bit of a problem for us right now. You see, In the winter of 2017, my second son surprised us by coming early. Two and half months early. And so he spent nearly three months in the NICU. Now the hospital bills are coming in, and that long wait for Amazon checks to arrive is looking even longer. But this isn\u0027t just about paying bills, it\u0027s about, as I said, connecting more directly with you and finding the best possible way to deliver my writing to you as soon as it is ready.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, what do I get?\u003c/strong\u003e First and foremost, you get my fiction. But you\u0027ll get it early and before anyone else can get it. You\u0027ll also get it automatically, which is the genius of Patreon. Whenever it\u0027s ready, you\u0027ll receive an email with links that you simply have to click. Done, done, and done. Isn\u0027t that great? Most of it will be digital, but higher backers will have the option of select physical copies as well. Also, higher backers will get all sorts of other personal goodies. I\u0027ll be posting regular writing diaries (raw, unfiltered reflections on the process) as well as videos of live\u00a0readings of my works in progress.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll right, sounds good!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/b\u003eWait, wait, wait! Not so fast. You can\u0027t get away without my heartfelt thanks. Honestly, none of this would be possible with you, the readers. I am forever grateful that anyone would read my\u00a0works, let alone you. So... THANK YOU!\u003cbr\u003e"
