We rescue farmed animals and offer them care, love and peace at our sanctuary, while treating them with dignity and respect for the individual characters that they are. We nurse them back to health as many of them are former victims of abuse and neglect. In some cases we are able to place them in loving forever homes and in other cases they spend the rest of their lives in our care. We also offer sanctuary to companion animals enabling them to recover from mistreatment and then find loving foster homes where they can safely spend their remaining years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur aim  is to provide for each individual a safe and loving environment in which they can live out a long and fulfilling life, whilst experiencing care and compassion towards their needs, to treat them as we would wish to be treated and to be pain-free and calm when the time comes naturally for them to exit this world. We strive to offer an environment which allows people to connect with the animals and recognise them as sentient individuals who deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. We invite  people to spend time with us, help us and work alongside us in order to understand and appreciate the commitment of becoming an animal guardian. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe advocate animal rights within all aspects of our lives and extend invitations to eat with us at the sanctuary. Our goal here is to advance veganism and encourage others to appreciate that all life is precious. We are active animal advocates who fight for animal rights in conjunction  with other social justice movements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron of Big V Sanctuary you will be supporting the ongoing care of our rescued animals, you will help towards the rescue of more abused and mistreated individuals and you will assist us in our work of promoting veganism and animal rights. With your kind donations we will also be able to increase our reach via various social media platforms, YouTube and on-the-ground activism. All of this results in saving more precious lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRescue. Rehabilitate.
