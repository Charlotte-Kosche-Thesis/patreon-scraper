We won\u0027t tolerate anything that\u0027s \nactually toxic, but we\u0027re not here to babysit your feelings either.

Even after breaking 15,000 fans the average post reaches \u0026gt;1,000. I\u0027d like more options and one of the long-term goals is a free BasedAF app that delivers the news to your device. I\u0027m not clued in on app development costs but I sure as fuck know I can\u0027t afford it now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuilding a Team:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs mentioned before, trying to run everything alone is a bitch (I also acknowledge it\u0027s my fault for biting off more than I could chew), so ideally I\u0027d get some other cunts helping me and I could afford to compensate them for their time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso I\u0027d like to quit my job and go full-time with this, though I figured that would be an obvious one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore news:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I post between 10-30 times a week, the mainstream outlets post around 150-250 (other outlets also repost content if they can get more clicks). I\u0027m nowhere near that and I\u0027ll always pick quality over quantity, but every now and then I have to skip some stories for the sake of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonthly Discord Giveaway:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll subscribing members are entered into a monthly competition, with the winner drawn at random. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now the the winner will win a prize worth \u00a330 - \u00a335, and as the income increases, so will the prize (see goals).*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*All prizes must be claimed with an acceptance speech in the Discord chat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdvertising:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe hypocrisy is real. I Advertise to fight against a system driven by advertising. If you\u0027re reading this then there\u0027s a good chance an advert lead you to Based, it was a necessary evil to get things going, and still is. I don\u0027t always plan on paying to advertise, but for now it\u0027s really helping to get the name out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMerch:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re basically paying to be a walking advert, but a surprising amount of people are happy representing the BasedAF merch, so any funding will also contribute to new shit in that area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome final things worth knowing:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- BasedAF is located in the UK, and playing with others outside the EU a little more difficult, but not impossible. There\u0027s a handful of games we play that don\u0027t require low-latency.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- PC/Steam is where pretty much everything happens. Plenty of the community play consoles too, but it\u0027s difficult to organise at this point in time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/BasedAF.Media\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/BasedAF.Media\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/xJFrDZP\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/xJFrDZP\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#ClickbaitIsForCunts\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/BasedAF.Media\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
