I love creating content and interacting with you, but being able to do it consistently has been a challenge. \u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s an opportunity where you can get more content you love, while being directly involved with spreading more positivity through music around this earth (and galaxies beyond).\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCreating quality content requires a budget, and over the years I have paid everything out of my own pocket and I love having this independence (instead of being bound by a label).

I grew up suffering from depression as a teenager, battled many demons while becoming a young woman, and now I have fully stepped into myself as a proud, confident, multi-racial, queer artist. It really has been a meaningful journey to get to where I am today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have a similar story to mine, \u003cstrong\u003eI want to inspire YOU\u003c/strong\u003e through my videos and songs to tell you that all is possible.
