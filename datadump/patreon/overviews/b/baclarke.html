    "summary": "Hello everyone! My name is Bishop Clarke, and I\u0027m an aspiring blerd (black nerd) photographer. I\u0027m crafting this Patreon because I believe that we can enter into a mutually beneficial relationship. I recently acquired an outdated DSLR and discovered a creative side of me that I didn\u0027t even know existed. I\u0027ve gotten a lot of positive feedback about my work, and people have suggested that I kick it up a notch. However, I am also a lot of other things in addition to a photographer, each of which costs me in some way (financially, emotionally, mentally, etc).\u00a0I\u0027m a college student, a poor black dude in America, neurodivergent, and a massive nerd.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I love it dearly, photography is an incredibly expensive art. Not only that, but a significant portion of the photographers I\u0027ve encountered have very little interest in matters of blackness, nerdiness, or representation. With your help, I will grow into the photographer I want to see in the world and you will be able to reap the fruits of that labor. With each new photo I take, technique that I master, and piece of gear that I acquire, you will witness the struggle of a young blerd to become an artist and contribute to his local community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m no fool: I\u0027m not expecting to be the very best that ever was. What I\u0027m asking is that you help me survive so that I can provide you with a view into a world that is uniquely mine. I will go out and capture as much of the world as I can, and you will glimpse it from behind my camera. I will tell my own story, but I will also make sure to capture stories that you don\u0027t often see. And with every dollar, every kind word, every token of support, you can watch the quality and scope of my work grow exponentially. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I hope you\u0027ll join me on my journey!"
