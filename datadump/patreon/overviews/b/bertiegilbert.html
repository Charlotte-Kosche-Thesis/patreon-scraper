It\u0027s me, your nice mum!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHIS IS GETTING ANNOYING, PACK IT IN\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0027t know why you\u0027re getting so worked up darling. If referring to me by my first name would make you feel more comfortable, then fine. Hello, I\u0027m Bertie! I make short films and other things. Mostly short films. Would like to make music one day but that\u0027s just a pipe dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT AM I DOING HERE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is Patreon. Here you can support creative people you like by sending them money. Money can be used to buy things, like coat hangers for example.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY DO YOU DESERVE MY \u0027MONEY\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGlad you asked! I adore making films, it\u0027s literally my favourite thing. But it can be expensive. When me and my team can secure funding from elsewhere, that\u0027s GREAT. But sometimes I have to self-finance which, as a young person living in London, ISN\u0027T IDEAL. Boy\u0027s gotta eat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGO ON\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo be able to partially self-fund various projects thanks to the people kind enough to support my work would be incredible. I\u0027m absurdly blessed to have so many lovely folks tuning into my stuff and to get more of you involved would be quite nice I think.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBUT YOU BARELY UPLOAD\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is true. The stuff I make often takes a few months to complete, so new videos won\u0027t be appear super often. Even when nothing\u0027s being uploaded, I\u0027m always working on something. So even in an off month, every little helps. Give as much as you want, when you want.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOKAY FINE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLovely! I\u0027ll make sure the perks aren\u0027t completely rubbish and I seriously appreciate any contribution. Also, come down for dinner!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
