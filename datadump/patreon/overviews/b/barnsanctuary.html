This includes any animals that have been abused, abandoned, sentenced to death or are victims of natural disasters. We educate the public about the horrific treatment of animals raised and slaughtered by modern day farm factories, and the positive impact that a plant-based diet can have on the environment and our health.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.barnsanctuary.org/donate\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMy name is Dan McKernan and I started Barn Sanctuary May 2016. I\u0027ve had a farm in my family for the last 140 years and when my father asked what we should to with the property last year I jumped on the opportunity to create a farm animal sanctuary. I believe we can make the world a better place with the work we\u0027re doing at Barn Sanctuary and help bring the direct community together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday we are utilizing 15 acres of the 70 acre property and developing sections of the land at a time. There are plans to have a cow barn, pig barn, goat/sheep, duck barn, etc. We are in the process of planning all of this out on a mass site map and this group here on Patreon will be the first to take a look and provide feed back! Thank you!"
