Do I try to be brief, to explain who I am and\nwhy I\u0027m asking strangers on the internet for their money? Do I introduce the\nconcept of \u0027patronage\u0027 with a verbose and unnecessary speech?  I still haven\u0027t decided how I might best\nconvince you to contribute to this so-called campaign. I\u0027m not entirely sure\nthat I do want to \u0027convince\u0027 anyone, either, beyond what the cynic may call a\nblatant and repugnant attempt to feign humility by writing in this format (but\nhonestly, who could do such a thing?). If I haven\u0027t convinced you to donate funds to this channel through my\nwork, I don\u0027t think I will in this simple note. Nor should I embarrass us both\nby trying! That said, if you have\ndecided to become a Patron for this channel and myself, I should, by your leave,\nprovide some details on how I intend to manage this campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be sure that you, the Patron, are wholly confident in your backing.  I want you to know where your money is going\nand where money has gone in the past, so you can determine for yourself if you\nare comfortable with the arrangement.  To\nthis end, I will publish a full account, every month, for the previous month\u0027s\nspending.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  I\nalso understand that many YouTube-Patreon campaigns will offer their Patrons\nexclusive video content and similar benefits, but I will not do this.  The way I see it, such practices would only\nsplit the audience and harm the educational aim of the Channel.  I do not want you to give your money solely\nto view some \u0027premium\u0027 level of content, but instead because you delight in\nthis channel and would like to support it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  My\nactivities on YouTube have proven enormously fulfilling.  I am amazed by the support which I have received.  I have met many new friends and learned many\nnew things, and hope to continue doing so for years to come.  Whether or not you decide to support the\nChannel and myself in this particular way, I am still honoured that you might\ntake time to share in my inane ramblings. \nThat is the greatest form of support that you, or anyone, may provide,\nand for that I thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  I\nam, my dear viewer, and by your leave I shall remain, your most humble and obedient\nof servants,\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBrandon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
