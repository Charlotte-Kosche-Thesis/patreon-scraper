    "summary": "Hey you beautiful people! We are Henry Firth and Ian Theasby, the guys behind BOSH! The creation of BOSH! has been a labour of love for us, borne out of our love for plant-based food and our desire to show the world just how easy it can be to eat vegan. We\u0027ve had many people express a desire to support us on our journey, so we thought it would be right to allow them to do that. Voila.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this Patreon campaign is simple, to enable both of us to create more, better videos. To help us reach more people with our gorgeously simple vegan meals. And to reduce our dependence on ad revenue.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating the high-quality simple videos we do is expensive and time-consuming. Each video takes us about over a day to make, plus about another half day of researching and testing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe currently put 4 to 5 videos out every single week. We see it as our mission to get loads of delicious vegan food in front of people\u0027s eyeballs, to help tip the scales away from meat and cheese laden video sites like Tasty, Tastemade or any other such site.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve grown to be the biggest plant-based food video channel on the web. But we want to keep growing, and keep putting out even better, higher quality content. With your help, we can do that!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo thank our patreons, we will be creating custom content for this channel. We\u0027ll be offering exclusive content, rewards, and even chat for people who are generous enough to become patrons of BOSH!.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out our rewards, we\u0027ve gone all out to offer some really cool ways to get involved. And every single patron will get access to our exclusive content, such as cookalongs and behind-the-scenes access.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to our table. It\u0027s all plants. And everyone\u0027s invited!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ex Henry and Ian\u003cbr\u003e"
