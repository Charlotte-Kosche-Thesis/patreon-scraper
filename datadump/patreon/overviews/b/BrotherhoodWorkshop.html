But doing so isn\u0027t cheap. Every video I produce represents hours, days, and sometimes weeks of work! I recently quit my day job in order to produce Brickfilms full time, but in order to do so, I need for my work to pay the bills (mine, as well as those who help me in production).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy our content, and would like to take part in taking Brotherhood Workshop to the next level, please consider supporting us on Patreon! Even $1 per video will be a huge help. You will also get some sweet rewards for doing so. And if you can\u0027t afford it, don\u0027t sweat it. Our videos will always be free on youtube for everyone to enjoy!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s my viewers who make all of this possible, and I\u0027m excited to see where we will go from here! If we gather enough support, I am hoping to expand into longer and more story-based videos. Perhaps even a web-series! And it all starts with $1. \u003cbr\u003e"
