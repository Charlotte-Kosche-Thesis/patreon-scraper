MotH is my oldest and most beloved series at current, i\u2019ve devoted so much to it and something i work very hard on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love comics, and always will, but due to my current work as working as a freelancer full time, the time i used to produce the comics has been consumed by work pretty much as it takes priority because i need the income, safe for the occasional small blocks of time i can set aside to relax and/or work on personal projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings me to my reasons for this campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we can band together and support this patreon page and reach the goals, I can start moving towards doing this as a full time job and shave back my freelance hours to make room for comic work hours. Which ultimately means-- more content for you guys-- and more you can view on the web.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMelodies of the Heart i have so much of-- the draft page folder is crazy thick and without spoiling how long this baby is-- theres a lot more books coming i can assure you, and will confirm to you now there are at least 20 books for this first arc of the story. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf i can work on it full time-- books will be coming out much faster and we\u0027ll be able to progress through the story at a much faster pace then we are now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to check out Melodies of the Heart and read it online, it has its own site over at \u003ca href=\"http://www.melodiesoftheheart.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.melodiesoftheheart.net\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdded bonuses\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we go over the listed mile stones-- i\u0027ll try and think of some ways to reward you guys further with either some exclusive livestreams for those who have donated, as well as exclusive content and giveaways :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBig thank you!\u00a0\u003c/h2\u003eI also want to say a big thank you to everyone whos supported the series so far!
