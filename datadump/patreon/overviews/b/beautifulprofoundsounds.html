It is kind of heartbreaking.\u00a0 I want to be a force to inspire.\u00a0 I have been told that my music has a very unique intensity and that my lyrics stir up passion, emotion, and love.\u00a0 I want to seek out other musicians and artists that have a similar mission.\u00a0 I am very grateful for all the help I receive and I will come up with ways to give back for any and all contributions.\u00a0 I am open for suggestions in accomplishing this.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Namaste\u00a0",
