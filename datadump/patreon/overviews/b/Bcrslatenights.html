Without listeners, we\u0027re just talking into a mic with no purpose and that\u0027s a single step away from talking to ourselves late at night with no direction. You give the podcast purpose and drive! I hope you\u0027ll be so inclined as to donate some of your hard earned money to the cause of sharing more and more about this project with you, the listener! We\u0027ve got a lot of content that can\u0027t necessarily make it into the final episodes but we\u0027d love to still be able to share it with you! The whole point of making the podcast was to make something that we\u0027d love to listen to and we hope that with a bit of extra funding we can have guest stars, better equipment, domain hosting for a website, and hopefully make the podcast a self-sustaining project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything contributed to the podcast goes back into it, whether by freeing up time from the day job or getting us some nice studio mics, the point is that it\u0027ll come back to you, dear listener."
