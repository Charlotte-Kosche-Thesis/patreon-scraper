As Han says, it doesn\u0027t look like much - but you can help by applying to be a writer. In fact, if you write for SJW.Land, I\u0027d be happy to provide certain Patron perks like emails or personal web hosting without pledging.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Twisted Tale of Bootleg Girl: Moonshine, Illegal Concerts, and Infiltrating Anime Cons\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn way of a long-winded introduction, because I\u0027ve got one of them humanities Ph.D.s and that\u0027s how we do things, I\u0027m going to ask you to hop in my cheap knockoff American model T.A.R.D.I.S. with me and take a brief hop back in time: specifically, to the passage of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution. Rightfully hailed as a major milestone for women\u0027s rights in America, it\u0027s not quite right to describe it - as many people, including feminist scholars, often do - as the triumph of \"woman suffrage,\" often misspelled \"women\u0027s suffrage.\" Many, many women of color were still disenfranchised because of their gender because of the horrific and messy intersections of race and gender in American culture. Despite this unfortunate fact, a massive new population of voters surged to the polls all at once, and there was no way that the American political status quo could hold. As a result of this, alcohol was made illegal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou probably heard most of what I said above, perhaps with the icky truths about racism persisting despite the actions of white feminists deemphasized or even left out, in middle or high school. If you\u0027re anything like me, you probably wondered why the hell that happened.\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eGet women the right to vote\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e???\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eProfit?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBan all booze\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eBut, of course, there \u003cem\u003ewas\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0a causal reason: many of the newly enfranchised women voters were brutalized and harmed by their husbands while said husbands were intoxicated. In the desperate and sadly futile hope that cutting off the substance at its source would solve this problem, voters ushered in the \u003cem\u003eGreat Gatsby\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0era by taking the unprecedented - and not since repeated - step of mandating that a law applying to U.S. citizens rather than to the U.S. government be written into the nation\u0027s Constitution. We all know it didn\u0027t last, and it probably wasn\u0027t comparatively fun while it did last, either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that leads me to my Internet name, Bootleg Girl. You could be forgiven for believing that it references a love for moonshine. Perhaps I distill my own vodka in my bathtub. (Nah, I\u0027m begging for money for health insurance, I can\u0027t afford a bathtub!) I don\u0027t actually drink, personally, but even if I did like moonshine (I tried one of those \"moonshine\" branded drinks that\u0027s not real moonshine since it\u0027s legal to sell once, it was ok as distilled wheat in a jar goes) that\u0027s not where the name originates. Your second guess might be that I make illegal recordings of concerts. I have done this, on occasion (although the band knew it was happening, so I\u0027m not sure how badass that makes me). But I was already known by the moniker at the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, you see, I am known as the dreaded Bootleg Girl, Scourge of the Internets for one reason and one reason alone: about 5 years ago, shortly after coming out as a transgender woman, I described myself as a \"gamer girl\" to a man who was insisting there was no such thing. (This was 2013, before #GamerGate had technically begun, although in my research - which I discuss subsequently - I found it was already going on for most intents and purposes, and this harasser\u0027s actions were likely part of the burgeoning hate movement.) The man, who went by a screen name derived from transgender screenwriter/director sisters Lana and Lilly Wachowski, claimed that no women played video games for any reason other than to impress their boyfriends. I informed him, accurately at the time, that I was single and liked video games. Undoubtedly, Mr. RedPill** had read my profile and noted I was trans - I have never made a secret of this - and so he replied that I was \"not a real girl, just bootleg.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d received anti-transgender harassment on social media before, so this wasn\u0027t really all that concerning. I had half expected he\u0027d go that route as a dodge, and I had been prepared to follow up with examples of cis women who also game, because I like arguing. But his use of the term \"bootleg\" became almost fractally absurd and infuriating, and so here I am today, using the name \"Bootleg Girl,\" a transphobic insult that I had the privilege to be only slightly bothered by, as a personal brand for self promotion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe name fascinated me partly \u003cem\u003ebecause \u003c/em\u003eit\u0027s super bad ass. I mean, most people who hate trans people just go out and say we\u0027re ugly and no one wants us, that we\u0027re mentally ill and need therapy, etc.. I do get, in a twisted way, why RedPill** would want to change that up, because he knows that the more aggressive among us often have defenses against that sort of thing. But, much like his use of a transgender filmmaking team\u0027s metaphor \u003cem\u003efor gender transition\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0as his own screen name, RedPill**\u0027s use of \"Bootleg Girl\" \"attacked\" trans women by making us seem cool - bootleggers, maybe with tommy guns, or people smuggling hidden cassette tapes into Rolling Stone concerts. It was cool, he stole a trans metaphor, so I stole a transphobe metaphor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Bootleg is more than just an ironic appropriation of transphobia. It aligns with my personal philosophy in a number of ways. For instance:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI enjoy modded content and changes to expectations in discourse and narrative\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI consider copyright to be a necessary evil at best, and release most (but not all) of my creative work under a Creative Commons CC0 license\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI don\u0027t oppose authority, just as a bootlegger in the Roaring 20s might have willingly worked with a mafia boss - but I do despise legitimate, unable-to-be-challenged authority\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI carry these values forward into all the content I create.
