    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe mission:\u003c/strong\u003e Formal higher education in North America has a pretty high barrier to entry in the form of tuition and fees. I believe knowledge shouldn\u0027t sit locked behind a paywall, that historical knowledge is necessary and allows people to make informed choices in daily life, to confront the world and news, and see threads of connection between their own life and time and those of others. I also believe historical knowledge is not the sole province of academia, though I have gained much of my knowledge, training, and understanding through formal higher education.\u003cbr\u003eTo that end, I produce regular historical educational content written for the general public. My #fascismfact threads give facts, connections, and insight into many aspects of the extreme right in history, always ending with sources so you can learn more. I always take suggestions and questions; if I don\u0027t have the answer, I will point you in the direction of where to find it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe professional: \u003c/strong\u003eI write about history, religion, politics, and how these things intersect. (I am a joy at dinner parties, yes.) I have some fancy credentials that include a degree from UC Berkeley, one from York University, and certificates in Portuguese and German. I have been studying the far-right and the use of religion (specifically Catholicism) by dictatorships for almost a decade, have tutored and taught university students, and although I\u0027m an independent researcher now, my passion is to learn more and facilitate learning by others. To that end, I tweet regular #fascismfact threads, write on Medium, and regularly butt into conversations to say \"well actually, Bush/Harper/Cameron wasn\u0027t a fascist because...\" I also dabble in more formal scholarly writing and education.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe personal:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I am a first generation student, the immigrant daughter of an immigrant woman, a Portuguese-Canadian woman raised in a Nicaraguan-American family. And I really like cats. I come from a family of five children (plus a stepsister in another state),was raised Anglican with summer vacations, as it were, into Mormonism, Southern Baptist and nondenom churches, and JW Kingdom Halls. I identify as culturally Catholic which informs my work looking at the history of Catholicism in the living memory of my parents and grandparents. I seek to be a kind, generous, and loving person which means I seek to be anti-oppressive and acknowledge my complicity in discrimination and other forms of injustice and inequity. I currently live on\u00a0the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit River.\u00a0I consider the Bay Area, Puget Sound, Toronto, and Lisbon home which is both an incredible blessing and terrible curse. My cat is extremely old and extremely obnoxious, and I wouldn\u0027t trade him for the world.\u003cbr\u003e"
