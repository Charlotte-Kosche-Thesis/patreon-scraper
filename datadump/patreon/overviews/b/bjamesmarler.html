    "summary": "Hello! Thanks for stopping by my Patreon and checking it out. \u003cstrong\u003eMy name is B. James Marler and I\u0027m a writer and podcaster.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve wanted to be a full-time writer for as long as I can remember, and in April 2018 I began my journey to follow that dream. With the support of my family, I\u0027m striving to accomplish \u003cstrong\u003ea lot\u003c/strong\u003e this year, including bringing in some dough to put food on the table and fund my journey. Here\u0027s all that I want to do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Write \u0026amp; Produce Podcasts. \u003c/strong\u003eRight now I am writing/producing/acting in an audio drama podcast called \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHeretic\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. It\u0027s a mysterious, cult-driven thriller following one man\u0027s descent into madness following a tragedy involving the cult that raised him. I make this show on my own, and I\u0027ll be bringing Patrons behind the scenes while I continue to do so. I\u0027m also in the process of writing a second audio drama, a dramedy called \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe\u0027re All Lonely People\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. This project explores humanity through a group of people engaging in group therapy together. \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ll also be bringing Patrons behind-the-scenes of the writing, casting, and production of that show. Patreon will help fund the podcast hosting and website costs.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Blog About Writing \u0026amp; Podcasting. \u003c/strong\u003eThis one is pretty simple. Over at my website, you can read my blog. I\u0027m going to be blogging about anything and everything concerning my writing and podcasting.\u003cstrong\u003e I\u0027ll be posting those blogs early on Patreon so Patrons can read them before they go public. Patreon will help fund the hosting and domain name costs for the website, as well as help pay for coffee I consume while writing said blogs.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e 3. Write Short Fiction/Novellas/Novel. \u003c/strong\u003eHere\u0027s where the fun begins! This year, I\u0027ll begin building the world I\u0027ve been creating in my mind for years. Similar to the way C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, George R.R. Martin, and H.P. Lovecraft (look at all those initials) have done, I\u0027m creating a literary world in which all my creations live. Podcasts, short stories, novellas, and novels will all take place in one literary universe. The fiction writing that I\u0027ll be putting together will be shown to Patrons way before anyone else gets to see or read them.\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003ePatrons will be behind-the-scenes from my notebook to the publisher. Patreon will help fund things like editing, promotion, and further website costs.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see, I have quite a few goals, but I believe that everything is within reach. I truly appreciate the time you have taken to read this and let me express my gratitude in advance to anyone who becomes a Patron. I do hope that you enjoy my work.\u003cbr\u003e"
