They always tell me how much they enjoy it and how happy it makes them. That makes me happy, too! \u00a0But most of the time they leave without making a purchase. \u00a0That\u0027s just fine - not everyone can afford art and not everyone has room for art in their homes. Still, it costs me a good deal to provide them with that experience. And it is what I live for, so I don\u0027t resent it. If each of those people pledged just a dollar a month in support of what I am trying to do there, my worries would be over and I could fully pursue my calling. \u00a0It is a small contribution that will make a very big difference, not just to me but also to the whole community!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI typically produce 2-4 paintings per month, depending on the size. \u00a0Patrons can set a maximum per month contribution of as little as $1 a month so that they can control the amount donated.\u003cbr\u003e",
