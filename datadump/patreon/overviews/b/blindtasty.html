Making it, eating it and showcasing all the great Food I come in contact with! On top\u00a0 of that, I am trying to bring a little light on my experiences as a person suffering from Vision Loss. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was diagnosed with Stargardt\u0027s Disease in my early 20\u0027s and it took me down a real dark road. I stopped having passion for everything around me. It affected everything around me until I got to a point where I found a passion. That passion was Food! So I started showcasing what I could do and what I was getting creative with and out came Blind Tasty! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut while doing this, I also discovered that some people were interested in what it was like experiencing Vision Loss at such an important time in my life, so I have tried to open up my world with Blog Posts called Legally Blind Living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have many things planned on top of my Blog Posts and Visual entries, so come help a guy with Vision Loss out and maybe learn a thing or two! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers!\u003cbr\u003eTyler Baird aka Blind Tasty\u003cbr\u003e",
