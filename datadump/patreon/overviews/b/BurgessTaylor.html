I believe that within every person is a spark of creativity, sometimes people just need a bit of inspiration and/or motivation to light the fire. My passion is helping people take that spark of creativity and turn into a brilliant flame. My goal is to help light as many creative flames as possible and to continue to inspire and motivate people to keep their creative fires burning brightly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.journeywithburgess.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/P1010133-2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://flic.kr/p/PdHkFq\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flic.kr/p/PdHkFq\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThroughout the bulk of my journey I\u0027ve been sharing via YouTube and my blog: http:journeywithburgess.com.\u00a0 I\u0027ve learned that through journaling, writing, and art, \u00a0which are my creative passions, \u00a0I am able to  encourage people to see the beauty of combining art and words in their own way. Using art and words you can create a door to the imagination, and that in turn fuels your creative muse--lights your creative fire. I love helping people find that spark, turning that spark into a flame, and being able to share that journey with them. Each of us has that spark of creativity. We all have a story to tell, and a different way to tell our individual stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://www.journeywithburgess.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/P1010920-e1516170600992.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough creativity, I have lessened my anxiety and depression. Learned how to journal in a way that works for me and has helped me learn how to focus better, which is saying something since I have ADHD. There has been such a transformation in my journaling over the past couple of years--chronicling life events, my feelings, goals, and plans, along with just having fun with art and words, has been not only healing, but has also inspired and motivated others to pick up pen and paper themselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://www.journeywithburgess.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/P1010260.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0And it hasn\u0027t stopped there. As a creative person I have my hand in quite a few creative cookie jars. Since there\u00a0aren\u0027t any rules to creativity... You make them up as you go along, as you learn and grow... I\u0027ve learned that it\u0027s perfectly okay to color outside the lines, to think outside the box, to be a creative person and to live a creative life. And I\u0027m so glad I get to share my creative life with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I started my YT channel to help inspire and motivate people (especially people who were closer to my age bracket) in regard to writing, NaNoWriMo, and then as things progressed, and I became more involved with art, journaling, and the creative life in general, my YT channel changed and grew.\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/BurgessTaylor\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYT Channel\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But creating videos takes time. Editing videos takes even more time. And creating quality content requires supplies like cameras, editing software and learning how to use that software, journals, pens, art supplies, books, and more. I am faced with a choice: either get a part time job to help support my family, which means creating less videos per week, less time to write, journal, create art, etc.; or do something that will help create a way for me to help support my passion and my family at the same time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://www.journeywithburgess.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/23658502_2410314002526278_6355490148623377197_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of your pledges, my goal is to continue creating 3 videos per week on YT: Coffee Chat Monday, Writer Wednesday (on the third Wednesday of the month), and Journal Jam Friday, as well as to create a Patreon exclusive videos every week , content on my Patreon Page that will include an exclusive behind the scenes look at how I create my pages, the supplies I use, and what I think about certain supplies, methods and techniques.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 As I learn and grow as a writer, artist, blogger, YouTuber, and person I\u0027ll be sharing that journey with you. One other thing I\u0027d like to do is choose a topic each month to build upon. I\u0027m not a color-inside-the-lines kind of person, so we\u0027ll definitely be thinking outside the proverbial box while we\u0027re building on each topic. If you\u0027d like to share in my creative journey and pledge I would greatly appreciate it. If you cannot afford to do so, I completely understand--I will still be making my normal videos on YT on Monday\u0027s, (every third Wednesday), Friday\u0027s, and occasionally on Sunday\u0027s.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For those of you who do pledge, as a \"Thank You\" for being one of my supporters and patrons, you will receive exclusive content here on my Patreon page in addition to rewards depending on how much you would like to support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.journeywithburgess.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/P1000432.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have enjoyed my videos and are one of the folks that would like to see more, I would be so grateful if you would consider becoming a patron so I can provide exclusive content for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your time visiting my page and consideration in funding my videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"75\" src=\"https://c8.staticflickr.com/6/5499/31022345591_75b9b6cbb3_t.jpg\" width=\"100\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "My original goal with Patreon was to pay for my own supplies and to be able to pay for the things that I need for creativity: internet, camera, watercolor, new brushes and pens and things, a better lighting system, a class here and there to improve my technique, but now that I\u0027ve been on Patreon for one year I\u0027ve realized how much fun it is, as well as how much work it is. Not that I\u0027m complaining--I love creating, sharing,\u00a0 inspiring and motivating others to be creative. It feels like one of my main purposes in life is to share, motivate, and inspire. :D And it\u0027s wonderful to be able to do something you love. But in order for me to continue to create on a full time basis I need to earn at least enough to pay for expenses like the internet, classes to improve my skills, supplies, and to replace income I\u0027d earn if I were working outside of Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to be able to make a full-time income from Patreon and to devote the bulk of my time to this. And my hope is to reach that goal within six months.\u00a0",
