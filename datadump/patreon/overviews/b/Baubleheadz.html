I could have sworn \nthat my heart had even stopped, maybe time had   even stopped...\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor\nyour enjoyment, I offer character driven adult fetish stories and\nvignettes. I try to write from the perspective of the character, with\na variety of perspectives and characters throughout my stories. I\nhope you enjoy them as much as I like writing them! You can expect\nstories about fetishes such as Dollification, Submission, Mind\nControl, Machine, Transformation, Self Bondage, Inter-species sex\n(Tentacle, Plant, etc.), and Body Swapping.\u00a0Get inside the heads of characters in the situations you\u0027ve fantasized about.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlmost\nall of my work is about characters in fully consensual or dubiously consensual\nsituations. Even if the character didn\u0027t start off consciously\nwanting it, I try to write them in such a way that it is something\nthey desired. But be warned, \"consensual\" in one person\u0027s\nmind is not \"consensual\" to another.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDue\nto the adult rating of this Patreon page, I am required to post every\nadult content story as \"Patrons only\". If\nyou want the newest stuff NOW, please consider becoming a Patron. Having a\nway to see the results of my fans\u0027 interests will drive me to write\nmore.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRecommended\nstories to try out my writing style:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.selfbound.net/storieslr/leakyhotwaterheater.html\"\u003eLeaky Water Heater\u003c/a\u003e (Self\nBondage, Dubious Consent)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.devouredstories.net/storieslr/planted.html\"\u003ePlant(ed) Series\u003c/a\u003e (Tentacle, Mind Control)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.mcstories.com/Copy/Copy.html\"\u003eCopy\u003c/a\u003e (Dollification, Mind Control, Consensual)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso I want to make it very clear that fantasy is fantasy.\u00a0Once I hit each of my goals I will donate 5% or more of my yearly Patreon earnings to a local Women\u0027s Shelter.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank\nyou so much for your support and \"may the pleasures be ever in your\nfavor\"...\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Baubleheadz -\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
