    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWe are Bad Catholic Dads\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Bad Catholic Dads Podcast is first and foremost, a podcast where two lay (not ordained by the church) Catholic men, husbands, and dads hangout \u201con air\u201d and talk with you: the listener about faith \u0026amp; family. We\u0027re a sort of \"podcast ministry/community\" where we hope to pray together, talk with each other, laugh together, even maybe cry together, but we\u2019re not even professionals or experts, just two best dad-friends on a podcast who talk about life. Our mission: to spread the Gospel and to show authentic Catholic fatherhood through our podcast and witness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we doing this and how might this apply to you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know, I know: Catholic Fatherhood? Who might want to listen to that? Go to mass and daily prayer? Change diapers, play with kids, sit on the couch, watch sports, read, etc? Yes, but there\u0027s so much more to being a dad in addition to that! It\u2019s about sharing our stories of the everyday miracle of parenthood, but also to show that hey, being a father and being catholic isn\u2019t uncool; it\u0027s way we live our lives that is quite the opposite. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s real, challenging, and authentic, showing our love for our faith and family. It also goes beyond that. Our job isn\u0027t to convert, but to converse. It\u0027s about having real conversations with each other. We may talk about entertainment or other things, all through the lens of fatherhood and faith. It\u2019s imitating Christ\u2019s love for the church. We want to give you something different, we hope this podcast can give you that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cWe strive to help Catholic men, in particular husbands and fathers, so that they can have a place digitally to hangout with others who may have the same struggles with the purpose of building a community of Catholic fathers who can 1) relate to each other, 2) help each other grow, 3) empower like-minded fathers to keep going forward.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is the platform we\u0027re using to fund this podcast. It works like Netflix or Hulu in that you can support on a monthly basis. Podcasting isn\u0027t cheap, and we don\u0027t pretend it is. Not only does it take a vast amount of resources to get a good quality sounding show, but it also takes a lot of our time as well. Your support not only helps this podcast and community, almost every dollar goes back into the show hopefully making our content better.\u00a0Each month, you can support us on this platform in any way possible. A little goes a long way to supporting this podcast and this community we\u0027re building. With that said, our podcast content at this moment on BCD is free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen can you expect our content?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou can expect our content, our podcast to be released EVERY SINGLE FRIDAY at 9AM ET. Our podcast episodes are topical, so you can expect each podcast to have some sort of topic that relates to our faith and fatherhood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBad. Catholic. Dads.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of name is that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBad\u003c/strong\u003e? Okay. Let\u2019s start with the bad. We don\u2019t mean bad in the sense that we\u2019re doing bad things or that we\u2019re bad people, it\u2019s more that we have accepted that we\u2019re not perfect fathers, husbands, and men in general. We\u2019re flawed. We sin. But we strive to do our best. That through this podcast, and through sharing our stories we can help those who are seeking answers, seeking a direction -- if not those two, we just want to be here for support because we are not alone in this. Oh, and of course we like to think we\u2019re pretty baaad, you know, like hip/cool, just like all dads think they are. (Dad jokes will definitely be on this podcast!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCatholic\u003c/strong\u003e? We\u2019re Catholic. We won\u2019t shy away from that in this podcast. Our podcast isn\u2019t intended to try and convert you. We promise. It is simply to share with you the everyday joys and struggles of being a parent and a spouse as a man of God, man of faith. We will have different topics such as looking ahead to the readings for upcoming Sunday Mass, gentleman tips, discerning your vocation, sharing about our vocations, parenting adventures, church teachings, and much more. In all of those things we pray that Our podcast will always point to Christ, His Church.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDads\u003c/strong\u003e? We\u0027re men. We\u2019re fathers. We\u2019re husbands. More than ever our world is need of real men. Our world gives off the message that being holy isn\u2019t manly. The world can often give men the impression that we\u2019re selfish because we are husbands and/or that having kids is a burden. Prayer, faith, and vocation are commonly left in the dust and we get left with mixed messages of what it means to be a husband, father, and a man of God. Be though as it may, we are here to affirm you - we believe striving for sainthood, striving to lead in our vocation (or whichever vocation you are called to) - dying on the cross\u201d daily is the most manly thing there is.We believe Catholic fatherhood entails \u201cdying to self\u201d daily for our family, and even for our fellow brothers and sisters in Christ (even those we disagree with!). So we hope, wherever you are in your state of life, you can find something out of this podcast -- whether it\u0027s inspiration, laughs, fraternity, community, or just coming for the hilarious (or really bad...) dad jokes. So for whichever reason it is, we thank you for your time, support, and prayers  from the bottom of our hearts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThree Ways You Can Support Us:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePray for us!\u003c/strong\u003e Your prayers help us immensely.
