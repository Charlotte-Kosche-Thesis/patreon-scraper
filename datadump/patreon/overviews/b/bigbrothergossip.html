    "summary": "Hello to all of the wonderful listeners of The Big Brother Gossip Show. We\u0027re now in our eighth season, and we believe we\u0027re at the top of our game!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we need to talk. Here\u0027s the deal. Outside of some extremely generous donations last season (thanks!) we\u0027ve never made a penny off our show. In fact, it\u0027s actually cost us quite a few bucks over the years to produce this lovely program. Sure, Mike and Colette make a little bit selling feeds, but that has dwindled to almost nothing since CBS took over the live feed process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need your help. Unlike other Big Brother podcasts, we\u0027re a strictly indie D.I.Y. production. We\u0027re not part of a podcast network that underwrites, promotes, and supplies advertising sponsors. We hate asking for cash, but all three of us have some bills to pay. Patreon is great for people like us. You can pledge a buck per episode. Or you can give us two bucks, five bucks, twenty bucks, or however much you want. You will only be charged whenever a show is produced, so you don\u0027t have to worry if for some reason we have to skip a week. When the season is over, so will the funding.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re going to make it worth your while, though! We\u0027re offering some perks, from ringtones to exclusive extra shows. That\u0027s right, EXTRA SHOWS!!! You guys have always wanted us to podcast more than once a week, and now we will!!! Shows that only patrons will have access to hear!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t worry. This will never turn into a premium podcast. We will always have a live stream of the recording, and they\u0027ll still be on iTunes and Stitcher. We\u0027re just appealing to our longtime fans (and any noobs) to help us out a little bit so we can still make you giggle at the three of us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for all the support over the years!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScott, Colette, and Mike"
