My college education in charcoal and oil allows me to make works with texture and atmosphere not seen frequently in the online art world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve taken on multiple clients even though my business has only just begun. My specialty for the time being lies in charcoal drawings. Customers have been highly satisfied in my ability to replicate photographs and other stills, and other potentials are blown away by my fan works and post-modern style. My studies in 20th century art truly shine as I experiment with figurative, cubist, and contemporary work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor my friends and patrons as nerdy as myself, you will get to see my use fantastic Prismacolor markers to make fan art and play mats come to life. I look forward to getting my name out into the card playing world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I ask of my patrons is to stick with me while I bring forth these unique styles and apply them to personal interests and the request of my clients. I intend to display something unique and eye-catching."
