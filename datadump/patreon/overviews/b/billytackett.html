Between purchasing supplies, booth space at shows, hotels, van costs, studio space, house payments, etc, the art business can be rough. Luckily I\u0027ve been able to weather the down-turns in the market in the past. I\u0027m confident that Patreon will help myself and others weather any that come up in the future.

Over 200 of\nmy works have been published as book and album covers, illustrations, etc.  During this time I created a series of oil\npaintings, including my signature \u201cZombie Sam\u201d, which led to multiple exhibits,\nawards, and invitations to national events as a fan favorite.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMeanwhile,\nI also explored other styles and mediums which is how I developed my \u201csplatter\nart\u201d technique.  By dipping my fingers\ninto the paint and flicking it onto the canvas, I\u2019m able to capture my desired\nimage without the use of brushes, giving my highly textured art a more fluid\nand organic quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe\nsuccessful reception of my splatter art has encouraged me to open my own art\ngallery and working studio in the historic Florence Hotel, which my wife and I\nrecently bought and renovated. My goal is to continue advancing my technique\nwhile pushing the boundaries of my creative work. \u003cbr\u003e",
