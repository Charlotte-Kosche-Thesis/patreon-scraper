Only thing more important than the name is the game, though, so let me cut to the chase.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBREADSWORD\u003c/i\u003e is a channel that I write, record, and edit content for mostly centered around the analysis and review of films. This channel is, to put it plainly while still sounding as pretentious as possible, a vehicle to better my understanding - and hopefully other people\u0027s understandings - of specific works or creators within a given visual medium. My channel is an indefinite assignment I\u0027ve given myself to pick a film, or a director, or a writer, or a show, or a video game that interests me - and to force myself to learn everything there is to know about it. And then to write what I\u0027ve learned into a script and present it to others with as pleasing a blend between audio and visuals as I\u0027m capable of producing without going insane.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\"Sounds great but how do I squeeze in?\" \u003c/i\u003eAnother sharp question you devil, you. Now - I don\u0027t normally like to do this - but I\u0027m gonna be honest here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://hustonsite.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/cm_fatherson1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s exceedingly hard to create content, especially content requiring an abundance of research on top of the sheer amount of time required to record and edit it, with sub-par tools to do the job and a tight schedule. Patreon can be viewed as the beggar\u0027s choice but the alternatives of pay-walling content or just not being able to recuperate the hours put into my videos are much worse. I spend most of my time working in a warehouse (glamorous, I know) with a long commute so having to battle my own editing rig because it can\u0027t handle Premiere or needing to scrap half-hour long vocal takes due to an inadequate recording environment in what little time I \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e have is very counter-intuitive to the growth of my channel. My greatest ambition, the absolute tip top tippity top of my hopes, is to be able to support myself enough off of my Patreon and what revenue I gain from my videos to transition away from garbage job world and put all of my focus into developing content for this channel. And that is precisely what my Patreon goals will be predicated on. Milestones that I need to pass in my climb to the top of Mt. Video Essay Olympus so I can hang with the big dogs like Channel Criswell and Nerdwriter and Super Eye Patch. Nothing crazy fancy. A new editing rig. Better headphones to mix with. Better monitor to edit on. Camera. Lighting. A loosely thrown together yet tastefully self-indulgent set. Rent money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll it comes down to really is that with your help, I can keep growing and reaching for the only dream I\u0027ve ever had. To talk about cool shit with internet strangers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnyhow, thanks for reading this far if you did!
