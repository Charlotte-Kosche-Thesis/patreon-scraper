In September 2017 I began to pursue my goals of creating content for YouTube. I combined my love for video creation and Star Wars to begin making guides and news videos for Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes. The community around this game has been so welcoming and exciting to be a part of. By making a Patreon I am establishing myself goals and ambitions for the future of my channel to connect with my fans and friends.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me on this site you are helping my goals and getting a personal level of support in return. Providing advice and information to people who need it is what has inspired me to continue making videos each week. By starting a Patreon I am motivating myself to push forward and by having somewhere like Patreon my fans are donating because they like the content I am creating which pushes me forward to stay on course.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does my donation pay for?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be putting every single penny given to me back into the content and channel.

While I am using a gaming headset for my sound I one day wish to get a professional set up. I was aiming towards a Blue Yeti Microphone to ensure supporters are getting the best looking and sounding content on YouTube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should I Support You?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always believed that as a creator I have a responsibility to support the fans the same way they support me. Through my discord, roster reviews and videos I aim to provide the best possible advice and information to make everyone\u0027s playing experience better. The game is designed to want your money so my advice tries to keep everyone\u0027s mind at ease so they don\u0027t have to spend money to farm a character because they\u0027re needed in a week\u0027s time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You For Stopping By!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
