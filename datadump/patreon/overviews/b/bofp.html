It\u0027s a very interesting look on how certain systems handle\n certain games.  Games covered range from classics such as Out Run, \nFinal Fight, Golden Axe and so on all the way up to Sega Model 2 games \nsuch as Virtua Fighter 2 or Sega Rally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp support the show to \nkeep them coming.  All my videos are of the highest audio and video \nquality unlike other videos of this nature.  HD video at 30fps or 60fps \nand quality HD audio are found in all of my releases.  I even offer \ndirect downloads from my site to the original video files that are uploaded \nto YouTube who then re-encode them for their service.  The original files are higher in quality than what YouTube can offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
