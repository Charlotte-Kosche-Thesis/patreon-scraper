It has beautiful coral reefs, white sand beaches and friendly, fun-loving people. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince the 70\u0027s, this site and surrounding areas have become popular with tourists for scuba, freediving, snorkeling and canyoneering activities. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis all sounds great - except for the garbage everywhere!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo understand the problem, we need to understand the culture. Less than 100 years ago, it was OK for people of the community to dump some waste in the street. When it\u0027s banana leaf food packaging and coconut husks, these naturally go back into the soil. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur wonderful industrialized nations then introduced plastics to this town, without also giving them a means to deal with this non-biodegradable waste.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery day here, one can smell the burning of plastics and see them floating past you in the otherwise beautiful oceans. The risks to humans and wildlife from all of this garbage is severe.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLeon and Grace first spent a month on an ecobrick cleanup project in Moalboal in October 2016. We paid local kids to join us in collecting the plastic food wrappers and other litter, stuff it into PET bottles also found on the street and talk to passers-by about what we were doing. We then went back to New Zealand to finish packing up our life there and prepare to move back to Moalboal permanently.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith some time to reflect on what worked and needed improvement, they are now full-time, committed to containing the plastic pollution affecting Moalboal.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have been self-funding this project, but have very limited income.
