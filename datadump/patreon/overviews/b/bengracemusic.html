    "summary": "I\u0027m Ben Grace, an Australian singer/songwriter working in Brooklyn NY and I\u0027m passionate about local craft beer, good stories, and messy community. \u00a0Over the last 20 years I\u0027ve had more than 50 songs released \u0026amp; have written in a range of styles from power pop to country. In 2017 I wrote 40 songs, including 15 songs for\u00a0a commercial children\u0027s TV show airing in Australia in June 2018. \u00a0I did 3 house show tours, visited 10 new states, and covered over 5k tour miles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve always created music in community and often helped other musicians with their dreams. \u00a0And now I need your help with my dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been busy writing and recording music that I\u0027m so thrilled about, pulling in some incredible musicians from New York to Nashville.  I\u0027ll be releasing one song at a time as they\u0027re finished \u003cem\u003e(aiming for one a month) \u003c/em\u003eand then compiling them into EPs or a full length album.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd I\u0027d love you to come\u00a0along with me on the journey and be my drinking buddies!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor less than a cost of buying me a beer a month you can help me build a sustainable music career. \u00a0Or for the cost of a case of beer you could partner with me to set up house show touring opportunities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo w\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the words of my buddy and fellow musician\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/danieldeitrich\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDaniel Deitrich\u003c/a\u003e:\u00a0there has never been a more exciting or challenging time to be a musician and songwriter. The tools to create, record, and reach an audience have been democratized, but it is increasingly difficult to make money as an artist. I didn\u0027t get into music to strike it rich, but it takes money to put quality work out into the world (gear, producers, studio time, mixing, mastering, video shoots - it adds up QUICKLY).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is a membership platform that makes it easy to join your favorite creator\u0027s community and pay them for making the stuff you love. \u003c/strong\u003eIt lets you say, hey, what you\u0027re putting out into the world is valuable to me. You choose a monthly tier that\u0027s right for your budget ($1 to $50 or more) and receive rewards in return. Though it\u0027s a slick new online platform, the idea of patronage isn\u0027t new at all. For centuries people have been directly supporting artists so they can continue to paint/compose/create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/rwvUjAv6pxg\"\u003eHere\u0027s a quick vid from Patreon that explains it well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are we going to create together?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs of March\u00a0I have 4 songs that have been skillfully crafted and recorded in the best studios of New York and Nashville that I\u0027m aiming to release monthly. \u00a0As patrons you will receive early access to these songs before the world gets to hear them on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zy5oN2FLsEto2iifrhKea?si=F2LnKE3vRX2Pt_D0BegfMw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSpotify\u003c/a\u003e or wherever you stream music. \u00a0In addition to my songs I\u0027m excited to share with you lots of other exciting rewards from live tracks from shows such as Rockwood Music Hall, to behind the scenes access to my process and, my personal favorite: A HOUSE SHOW AND CRAFT BEER TASTING! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere isn\u0027t much more than I love than sharing a local craft beer with new and old friends alike while sharing stories and melodies. \u00a0I hope that together we can build some intimate musical experiences and bring us all a little closer together through the power of melody.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks in advance for becoming my drinking buddy and I look forward to sharing a beer and a song with you soon! \u00a0Oh, and follow me on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://untappd.com/user/bengracemusic\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUntappd\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003eBen\u003cbr\u003e"
