    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eBroadcasting from Resistance Headquarters and relentlessly fighting back against the Clown Dictator and his Regime of Deplorables...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are so many ordinary liberal political shows on the internet -- podcasts that are either the audio-only versions of corporate cable news shows, or amateur-hour \"blogtalk\" shows, or really wonky and soporific shows that make you want to jump out a window after five minutes because everything seems so bleak and humorless. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the Bob Cesca Show is about being \u003cem\u003eentertaining\u003c/em\u003e first. In addition to your intrepid host, Bob, the show also features the talents of a rotating troupe of co-hosts including author and blogger Kimberley A. Johnson (Huff Post, Liberals Unite), radio news guy Buzz Burbank (Buzz Burbank News \u0026amp; Comment, Don \u0026amp; Mike Show, Mike O\u0027Meara Show), Jacki Schechner (InvestigateRussia.org), Jody Hamilton (From The Bunker podcast, daughter of Carol Burnett), and David \"T-Rex\" Ferguson (Rawstory).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe show features fun, fast-paced political talk (mostly center-left) but always with plenty of jokes in there, too, including pre-recorded sketches, improvised bits and absolutely no sacred cows. Our primary targets include President Trump, along with conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones and the giggling couch tumors at Fox \u0026amp; Friends, as well as tea party Republicans and the vast, soul-crushing hellscape of cable news. We also occasionally dip into our personal lives and pop culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe only way we can continue to have minimal commercials while adding more shows every week is for you to become one of our sponsors. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can sign up for the standard monthly amounts, or if you\u0027re feeling saucy, you can sign up for more. It\u0027s totally up to you, but there\u0027ll be special love from us to our highest donors -- love that we can\u0027t legally describe on a family website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re not charging for our show, and it\u0027ll always be free to download. Instead, we\u0027re asking you to become our sponsor. And in return we\u0027ll give you the absolute finest shows possible as we fight our way through the Trump era and beyond. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbove all else, we want to help guide you through the mayhem of American politics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, then, let\u0027s do this!\u003cbr\u003e"

The more listener patrons we get, the more shows we can produce for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe routinely talk about presidential politics, the news media, and even weirdos and freakdogs like Alex Jones and Dan Bidondi from InfoWars. We also produce prerecorded radio sketches, such as commercial parodies and our popular \"House of Clintons\" series. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show was nominated for Best Political Podcast in this year\u0027s 10th Annual Podcast Awards, and is usually ranked in the Top 50 on iTunes News \u0026amp; Politics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s political podcasting without that boring, super-serious crap that makes you want to claw your eyes out. We\u0027ll make you laugh while arming you with bits that\u0027ll help you win the water-cooler wars at work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbove all else, we want you to be a part of the show, so help us out here on Patreon and we\u0027ll guide you safely through the political insanity with a laugh or two.\u003cbr\u003e",
