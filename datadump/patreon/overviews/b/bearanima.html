I\u0027m Bearanima and I do stuff on the internet, stuff that people seem to like for some reason. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eMy Youtube story!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI\u0027ve been on Youtube for around 6 years, but I never bothered to make videos. \u003cbr\u003eThat changed back in November of 2014: I decided to make a random video based on a character of the now popular Five Nights at Freddy\u0027s franchise on my channel \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e(BearAnima)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e. That video got a small bit of attention, so I convinced myself to make another one, and another one, and another one. You get the point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started to grow a bit and within 4 months I\u0027ve managed to reach 1,000 subscribers. That moment became a turning point for me. I started to take Youtube a bit more serious and thanks to that, as well as to the people who have supported me,\u00a0I\u0027ve managed to reach over 75,000 subscribers on Youtube on the May of 2016. I\u0027ve met some amazing people that have helped me these last few months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhat do you make?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI make animations using a program called Source Filmmaker: an animation software used by Valve in order to make trailers for their games that run on the Source Engine. It allows you to animate with a lot of different characters, props and maps from a variaty of games such as Team Fortress 2, Half Life 2 and of course, Five Nights at Freddy\u0027s. This program allows me to be as creative as I want to be and I thank Lord Gaben for it\u0027s existence, because without this program I wouldn\u0027t be where I am today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my animations are based on the Five Nights at Freddy\u0027s franchise, a popular horror game series that I\u0027ve enjoyed since the beginning. The style of the animations vary from funny to a bit sexual, but people seem to like them both.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI decided to make this Patreon page in order to evolve. Even though the software itself is free, the equipment needed to use this software properly, is not. Source Filmmaker demands a lot from your PC and if I want to create more content for my viewers I\u0027ll need to upgrade, but the money I make on Youtube isn\u0027t enough and if you know Youtube, you should know that it can be very untrustworthy.\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I\u0027ve decided to make this page. I was hoping that you, the viewer, could help me out and make me feel more secure. Maybe I can make a career out of Youtube, wouldn\u0027t that be amazing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eHow will you evolve?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eWith the money I\u0027ll be able to upgrade my pc, buy equipment that\u0027ll help me to improve my animations and maybe even fund some meetings with you guys!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eUnfortunatly, not much when it comes to rewards. I was hoping to get a t-shirt line up and running soon, maybe I\u0027ll give away some free t-shirts as a reward. But for now, this page will allow me to create more content for you guys, because that\u0027s what you all seem to want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eDone with the chitchat?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI think that covers most of it, but if anything else pops up, I\u0027ll cheerfully discuss it.\u00a0For well over more than a year, the love and support of an amazing audience has kept me interested in making these videos. Now, it is my express hope that the same love and support can allow me to ply it directly to the audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you fund me or not, thank you. Honestly, thank you. The fact I even feel like I could\u003cem\u003e\u00a0attempt\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ethis is thanks to you all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
