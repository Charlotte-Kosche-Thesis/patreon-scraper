We have an unbridled passion for the subject, and want to share it with as many people as we possibly can. Our website aims to celebrate beer culture, independent brewing and travel through engaging storytelling and high-quality photography.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeeson On Beer is the brainchild of James Beeson, a journalist and photographer who specialises in the field of food and drink. He is currently working as a reporter for The Morning Advertiser, and has a Masters degree in Newspaper Journalism from City, University of London. He is a member of the British Guild of Beer Writers, and writes about beer for The Independent, Good Beer Hunting, Ferment Magazine, Belgian Beer \u0026amp; Food Magazine and The Brewers Journal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy fund Beeson On Beer?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeeson On Beer is currently a one man army; a lone crusade led by me (James) to produce entertaining, informative and engaging content, free for anyone to access and read. I write all of the content, take all of the photos, produce all of the posts and manage the website and its social media by myself, alongside a full time job at The Morning Advertiser. It is a labour of love, and a personal project of which I am extremely proud.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not interested in securing advertising revenue to disrupt the experience of reading the content on Beeson On Beer, and I certainly don\u0027t want to take on any shady \u0027sponsorship\u0027 deals that might interfere with the objective and honest editorial that makes Beeson On Beer what it is today. However, if I want to continue to grow and expand the site (which currently makes no money whatsoever and costs a considerable amount of funds and time to run), I need your encouragement and support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me financially is entirely optional; Beeson On Beer will remain free to read as it has always been. You can pledge as much or as little as you like, and there is no obligation to keep paying - you can cancel at any time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA pledge to support Beeson On Beer is a pledge to support independent storytelling and creative photography-led journalism. I want to bring better, more ambitious and research intensive stories to a wider audience, but I need your help to do it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will we do with your support?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have three main goals, all of which your support will go some way to helping to achieve:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) Build the brand\u003c/strong\u003e - I have ambitions to grow Beeson On Beer into a household name; synonymous with the idea of good beer writing. I want to reach more people by expanding the reach of the brand and bringing in new audiences. I have recently rebranded and redesigned the entire website from the bottom up, and this has resulted in a huge surge in the number of visitors to the site. The next steps are to start producing\u00a0merchandise to further spread the Beeson On Beer name, and to start hosting events that enable me to introduce new people to the site.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) Produce more content\u003c/strong\u003e - I am currently hugely time poor; working a full time job and producing content for Beeson On Beer during my evenings, weekends and holidays. I aim to produce at least three pieces of content every month, but this is not always possible due to time constraints (and an overwhelming lack of sleep). Your support would enable me to investigate the possibility of commissioning new writers to ease my workload and enable me to focus on improving the overall quality of the site.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) Produce better content\u003c/strong\u003e - The best stories take time to research, edit and produce. They also sometimes cost money - I may have to travel some distance to visit a brewery, or (as I did recently) spend vast sums of money on equipment such as a new camera. Supporting Beeson On Beer will lead to higher quality, more relevant content for you to enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get in return?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAside from the warm and fuzzy feeling you get\nfrom knowing you are supporting a passionate young journalist to do what he\nloves, there are a number of benefits to becoming a supporter of Beeson On\nBeer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, you\u0027ll get a say\nin the kinds of stories we seek to produce going forward - Want me to write\nabout a particular brewery, pub, or city? I\u0027ll do my best to try and write\nabout it (assuming I think it is something our readers would be interested in).\nYou\u0027ll also be the first to know about any new and exciting projects we are\nworking on, and I\u0027ll also be setting up a\nsupporters\u0027 only newsletter where I\u0027ll give you a sneak peak of what to expect\non Beeson On Beer over the coming months. When our online shop launches\n(sometime in 2018), you\u0027ll get first dibs on the threads, and a discount if you\npledge over a certain amount. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFinally, you\u0027ll get your name listed as a\nsupporter of Beeson On Beer on our \u0027About\u0027 page, and a message of\nthanks from me. \u003cbr\u003e"
