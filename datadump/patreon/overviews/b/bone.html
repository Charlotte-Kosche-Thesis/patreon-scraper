Me too. So a long time ago I decided to start doing things a little differently in the hopes that maybe I\u0027d make something that wasn\u0027t dogshit. No Balto faces, no comics about characters giving each other bedroom eyes, no locker room rape, boobs that looked like they could feasibly exist, no bullshit. The majority of my work is illustrated pieces but I\u0027d like to change that, since people seem to like my comics a lot more. The problem is that people pay me for my illustrations (which you\u0027re still totally allowed to do if you don\u0027t care for Patreon, starting prices here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/16222827/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/view/16222827/\u003c/a\u003e ) and my comic is completely free. It\u0027s going to remain free but man would it be cool to make money off of it! If you haven\u0027t read it here\u0027s the first page:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/7966557\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/view/7966557\u003c/a\u003e It updates every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://56.media.tumblr.com/7bc24f6a1f7495b9473ca73ea1a7fd14/tumblr_o11zzjZ0xy1rc2yyso1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel it\u0027s also important to mention that I have chronic Lyme disease and it\u0027s made me unemployable, possibly for life. Being able to work from home and make my own schedule (I have to adapt a LOT) has allowed me to actually pursue a career. A successful Patreon would mean I\u0027d HAVE that career. I see a lot of \"hobby artists\" using Patreon, and they have every right to, but in my case it\u0027s become an absolute necessity to my well being and future. I\u0027ve been working as a professional artist for eight years and under the conditions of my illness for nearly three. I\u0027m tough as nails and not going anywhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support the insane idea of a sick man making alternate comics for a living I\u0027ll be able to update said comics more often, work on additional stories, and even hire people to do spin-offs and novellas. As a Patron you\u0027ll get all the usual Patreon stuff such as layouts, linework, storyboards, and other behind the scenes extras. Since I\u0027m largely a traditional artist there will be a LOT of stuff to see that really no other artist on FA has, does, or will even consider doing. I also stream every Thursday and backers will get a bit of my time every week for sketches in pen and/or ink:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://picarto.tv/Bone\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://picarto.tv/Bone\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy general gallery is here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/boneitis/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/boneitis/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tumble-bumble some too:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://boneitisuno.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://boneitisuno.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tweet, I\u0027m not nice:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Boneitis\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/Boneitis\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s what\u0027s up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://56.media.tumblr.com/fbd73ba9ca6ee9d679412054336154ff/tumblr_ntwziurMWr1rc2yyso1_1280.jpg\"\u003e"

Currently I can manage to do four pages a month (two for each comic) but at this tier I would add one additional page of ONE of the comics (I\u0027ll let you guys vote on it on Twitter).
