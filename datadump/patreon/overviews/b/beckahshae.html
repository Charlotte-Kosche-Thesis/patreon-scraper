Now I want to give you the opportunity to connect with me at even a deeper level. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what is Patreon? Patreon is your own, personal monthly subscription to me and my music. You will be supporting me, to not only keep creating music by funding my production, marketing and videos, but you\u0027ll enable me\u00a0to fly out to sing for those who are less fortunate that really could use the encouragement! My heart wants to champion these people whether young or old, rich or poor, and this will enable me to do that. For your support, we\u0027re offering some pretty neat rewards on the right side of this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith music streaming now taking away a substantial percentage of our digital music income and touring becoming harder with three kids, Patreon is how I can keep releasing more songs, albums and music videos to each and every one of you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the upcoming months, I have tons of new music to share with you! Apart from that, there will be tons more videos coming as well. A lot of you have been asking when the next Scripture Snacks album will be releasing and I\u0027m excited to tell you we are half way there! Those who become a partner today at the $10 reward or above, will instantly get those 5 finished songs! I\u0027m also adding the past YouTube covers I\u0027ve done as mp3s in the $20 reward or above!\u00a0You\u0027ll also find a download link for a remake I did of Ed Sheeran\u0027s song \"Shape of You\" in the thank you message for becoming a Patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your Patreonage!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eFAQ:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to pay in US dollars?\u003c/strong\u003e No. You can use any currency and it will be automatically converted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many songs and videos will you release a month?\u003c/strong\u003e I expect to release 2 songs per month, and 1 video every other month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t have much money, can I still become a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e Yes, please only sign up to donate what you can easily afford.
