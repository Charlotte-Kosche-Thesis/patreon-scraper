We are \u003cstrong\u003eBat\u00fa Games LLC\u003c/strong\u003e, a video game development studio based in Puerto Rico, creators of games like \u003cstrong\u003eTripleteo \u003c/strong\u003e(for Android and iPhone)\u003cstrong\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eAtriage \u003c/strong\u003e(on Steam) and \u003cstrong\u003eSave the Shapes\u003c/strong\u003e (for Android). Our passion for video game development pushes us forward to create many of the ideas we have in our minds, and just the fact that we are able to make them a reality fills us with joy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jj04yTV6hxQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also love to celebrate the idea of videogames and its culture by making podcasts dedicated to them. Currently, we have three podcasts planned for release: \"\u003cstrong\u003eThe Usual Spot\u003c/strong\u003e\" where we talk about topics relating to videogames or media entertainment content in general; \"\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Love\u003c/strong\u003e\" that serves as an excuse to allow fans of a game to celebrate it\u0027s successes and comment on the impact it had on their lives; and finally \"\u003cstrong\u003eCast That\u003c/strong\u003e!\" where we attempt to cast the ultimate fantasy roster of a game and let listeners weigh in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQw25LRe01o\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe would love to upgrade the quality of both our games and podcasts\u003c/strong\u003e, which is why we are asking for help. \u003cstrong\u003eWith your help\u003c/strong\u003e, we would be able to buy \u003cstrong\u003ethe necessary equipment and programs to upgrade our working conditions\u003c/strong\u003e, which in turn would allow us to make better content. We would also be able to pay our members and collaborators for their work, helping the videogame industry on the island grow in the process.
