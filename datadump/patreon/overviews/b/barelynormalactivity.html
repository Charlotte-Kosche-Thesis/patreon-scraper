    "summary": "Hello, and, first of all; WELCOME!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for coming here, to my little corner of Patreon. Whatever it was that brought you here, please do stay for awhile!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChances are, you might be coming from somewhere related to art content, and so are aware that I am, indeed, an ARTEEST. I have been \"arting\" since as far back as I can remember. My earliest clear recollection is drawings of jets shooting Sooper-Lazers in my wire-bound notebook on the school bus on my way to school, probably some time around 1st grade. But my mother says it was from the age of 3 or so. Either way, it\u0027s been awhile, and I\u0027ve never once stopped; kudos to anyone who guesses the number of years correctly (and maybe a little bonus as well)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, these days I am an Art Director at a video game art production house in San Francisco, where I work on anything from concept art to 3D production, to \"Unity game engine integration\", which means I put stuff into Unity and make sure they work correctly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"But why am I here at Patreon then, if I have a schnazzy game-industry job, and all that?\" you might ask.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s because I have a goal. A goal that I set for myself some time ago. A goal that basically amounts to wanting to structure my life around my own creations, and tackling the projects I want to tackle. Ultimately, I want to make my own games and art, and the surest way to do that is by developing the independence and freedom to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t get me wrong! I work with awesome people at an awesome place, and it\u0027s super fun every day. But it\u0027s not time spent working on stuff that I (and hopefully, YOU) love every second of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so, here I am, at Patreon, asking you, most humbly, to help me. Help me gain the independence I need to make the art and media I want to, and bring those creations to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon is set up very simply, which may change in the future, but for now, I want it to be straight forward:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $2/ month you get one, exclusive, high res drawing! This drawing may consist of whatever I wish, it may be gray scale, it may be color. It may be a character, a scene, or anything. The only thing is that, if you are a patron, you get it, and no one else will.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s it. We\u0027ll start there and see where this goes.Thanks again for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
