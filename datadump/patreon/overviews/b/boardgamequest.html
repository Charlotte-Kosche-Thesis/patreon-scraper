We publish new articles every day including board game reviews, news, top 10 lists, interviews, and regular columns. We have grown to include 7 different writers and cover a wide range of games from family games to heavy 4 hour+ games. Board Game Quest is one of the biggest written review sites on the internet that focuses solely on tabletop gaming. Since our early days, we have published around 1,000+ articles.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe content published at Board Game Quest is, and always has been free. And that\u0027s not going to change. We aren\u0027t going to ever put up a pay wall or annoying full screen ads. We like covering board games and will continue to do so. And as our traffic has steadily grown since the early days, it seems that you like reading our content, which is pretty exciting.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon Now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your support we can make Board Game Quest even better. We have always prided ourselves on the high-quality nature of our articles. However as we grow, so do the costs of running the website. This includes more web server resources, costs associated with expanded convention coverage, better quality photographic equipment, and purchasing games to review. For the past five years, we\u0027ve covered all of these expenses ourselves. As we want to continue to put out amazing content, enhance our coverage, and remain editorially independent, we are hoping you can support us in that endeavor. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\tIf you love what we do at Board Game Quest, we are hoping you will consider throwing us your support. We have a lot of exciting things planned in the future (expanded convention coverage, podcasts, new article series, and more!) and with your backing, we know we can make that happen. The funds will be used solely to keep producing content, such as purchasing equipment, acquiring games for review, and ensuring attendance at notable gaming events. If you like our coverage and just want to see more, your backing will help us deliver as much of that coverage as we can.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\tOn the right side, you will see a few different levels of support you can offer, and the rewards for each tier. Thank you for supporting Board Game Quest and we hope to make the site one of the premiere websites for tabletop content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e*********\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGiveaways, for right now, are limited to those with a USA shipping address.
