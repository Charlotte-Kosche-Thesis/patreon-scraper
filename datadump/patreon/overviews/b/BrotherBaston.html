    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Brother Baston, welcome to my Patreon page! I\u0027ve been making digital art videos on Youtube for years now (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/BrotherBaston\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eyoutube.com/brotherbaston\u003c/a\u003e), sharing my passion through time lapse videos, tutorials, collaborations and all kinds of other things. I do a lot of stuff like character design, concept art and world building. I try my best to design characters and places that tell a story, that spark your imagination and make you want to know more about the world they come from. I love mixing sci-fi and fantasy, technology and magic, mechs and wizards, creating something that hopefully you\u0027ve never seen before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an independant artist who likes to share all their work online with no restrictions, it\u0027s pretty difficult to find ways to make a living doing this stuff and to invest more and more time into it. My hope is that this Patreon would help me free up time that I could spend working on always bigger and better art projects, like comics for example, in addition to the usual Youtube videos. So if you think my content is worth your support, check out the rewards on the right or explained in the intro video above. I really tried to pack as much value as i could into all of them and keep the prices very reasonable. And believe me, even the smallest support has a huge impact.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo check out some of the videos below to see what I\u0027m all about, and thanks very much for your consideration! =D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
