I want you to avoid the mistakes I\u0027ve made, and I want to test new methods and show you the results both good and bad. I want you all to be confident in your abilities to make killer terrain, and know that you too can have highly detailed and realistic pieces for your game at very little cost. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis hobby has greatly improved my life. Crafting terrain has helped me learn to cope with severe anxiety and depression. Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons has helped keep me close with long time friends, and having awesome terrain has made the game experiences even more memorable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to help people just starting out by showing them simple projects, and I want to help long time, experienced terrain builders by showing them new and unique techniques. I love building terrain, and I love sharing it with our community. I love making tutorial videos but they take a considerable amount of time and effort to do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve learned from my videos, or appreciate the help I give by diligently answering your questions, than this is a great way for you to give back to the channel, and I would be ever greatful. \u00a0Cheers!"
