    "summary": "I\u0027ve been active in the fetish game community creating quality content since 2008 including \u003cem\u003eRough Landing 2\u003c/em\u003e which has received a fairly ridiculous number of accolades from players and frequently is named as one of the top five games period to be developed using the RAGS platform. This is a platform that despite the inherent flaws I\u0027ve often pushed well past the point of what it was meant for. To quote one recent player of my game \u003cem\u003eNo Haven\u003c/em\u003e;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"\"\u003e\"but I wanted to let you know this has to be my favorite slave management game out of all of them; and my favorite overuse/abuse of a game engine, previous engine had been Warcraft 3.\"\u003c/blockquote\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in supporting me in continuing to develop games as I transition into working in Twine I would be most grateful. I would also be able to then put some of the funds towards more commissioned artwork to better visualise the worlds being created.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you just want to tip me the once for the enjoyment you\u0027ve had and then cancel after a month, or are happy to support me on an ongoing basis, either way I will do my best to bring you the content that you deserve.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI post Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s there so please visit\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bedlamgames.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy tumblr\u003c/a\u003e (frequently NSFW) along with more frequent quick updates on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Bedlam_Games\"\u003emy twitter\u003c/a\u003e. I also stream development 3-4 times a week along with curated playlists of HMVs, MMDs, and AMVs on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://picarto.tv/bedlamgames\"\u003epicarto\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a quick note on my pledge tiers I try to be as reasonable as possible so for example if you\u0027ve been on the Unique Slaver tier for awhile and want a second one made, or if you want to up your pledge for just the one month to get an Assignment made and then lower it again afterwards both of these are more than fine. Due to the proposed fee changes of December 2017 I added the additional crit tiers so people could continue to support me and receive the same rewards from those tiers, but without losing out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
