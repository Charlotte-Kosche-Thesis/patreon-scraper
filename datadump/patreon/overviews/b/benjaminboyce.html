    "summary": "On June 11th, 2017 I opened up the camera app on my phone and began speaking (in vertical video, no less) about what was happening on the college campus I was soon to be graduating from: The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington. I had experienced four years of workshops, lectures, and classes that had become increasingly ideological, and less and less open to different points of view\u2014and I wanted to document the inner workings of the college which at that point in time was overrun with weird-ass antisocial justice aggitators.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIronically, Evergreen college taught me to go all-in on the subject at hand, and so I began with an expos\u00e9 on the college which is currently 50 episodes deep and still ongoing. The subject matter I was dealing with (what people like to call cultural marxism, or social justice, or postmodernism) \u00a0eventually lead me to speaking about similar phenomena in other institutions\u2014of education, media, and governance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy focus has always been on wrestling with the big questions\u2014such as: why do people act this way (speaking of protestors)? Why do people think this way (speaking of the social justice crowd)? And, most pressing for me\u2014what does any of this have to do with being a human being, living briefly on a planet rife with other human beings?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore this all began, I was an unpublished novelist and verbose preschool teacher with dreams of making something \"the cultured\" would cherish and adore. Now, I\u0027m gunning to sway contemporary discourse toward reasonable ways of relating, person to person\u2014and have some fun while doing so.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for swinging bye\u2014and thanks to all my supporters :)"
