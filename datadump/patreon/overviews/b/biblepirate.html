    "summary": "Ahoy there me hearties and welcome to the Bible Pirate Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Matt Valler, I live in Cornwall in the UK, and I\u0027ve been making the Bible Pirate podcast since October 2017. I\u0027m really interested in stories, how they shape us and how we shape them. I also have an academic background in the Bible, so I decided to combine those interests in a podcast that would take listeners into new, often unorthodox territory.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest, when I set out I didn\u0027t really know who the podcast was for, or how it would shape up. That\u0027s pretty novel for me - I\u0027ve spent years working with Bible-focussed organisations on strategy and audience. But a couple of years ago I decided to quit most of that work, and set out to create something more authentic. To cut a long story short, I ended up sat in front of a microphone to talk about the Bible for 30 minutes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe response has been totally overwhelming. Listeners from all over the world have got in touch to say how much they appreciate the podcast. And I\u0027ve been amazed at the range of people who are willing to listen, even if they don\u0027t agree with everything I\u0027m saying. In February 2018 we completed the Maiden Voyage, a full first series exploring the Prologue to Genesis (the first 11 chapters of the Bible) and I went to find a sunny cove and some rum.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTurns out, however, that making 30 minutes of quality podcast takes longer than 30 minutes! I don\u0027t use a script, because it feels too forced; instead I talk and edit until I\u0027ve got an episode I\u0027m happy with. The most straightforward episodes take about 8hrs to produce. The most complex took me 5 whole days, just for that elusive 30 minutes! And of course none of that includes the research time involved in drawing together multiple subjects in a coherent way. In addition, I\u0027m also re-translating the Bible into English - called \u003cem\u003eThe Unauthorized Version \u003c/em\u003e- which I then use in each podcast episode. This takes me about 4hrs per chapter on average. So here I am on Patreon, hoping to make this something at least a bit sustainable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast will continue to be free, and by becoming a patron you make it possible for me to make more episodes. There\u0027s also a bunch of other rewards for patrons. You can join the Bible Pirate Crew at different levels, depending on what you can afford and what treasure you\u0027re after.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for being part of this adventure! Reports of the Bible\u0027s demise are greatly exaggerated, which is both a good and a bad thing. But we\u0027re unashamed Bible-fans and with the Pirate spirit in the air we\u0027re setting sail for stories beyond the horizon.\u003cbr\u003e"
