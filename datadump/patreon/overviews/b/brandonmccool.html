    "summary": "Hi everyone! If you don\u0027t know who I am, my name is Brandon McCool, and I make board games...not professionally, not at all. I started doing this about 5 years ago, I\u0027ve made 4 games so far and have several more in the works. Last year I released one of my games, based on the Castlevania series, for free as a print and play game, and also on Tabletop Simulator. It has steadily developed a regular player base in that time, and I just released the third expansion for it on 11/25/2016. You can download it at www.castlevaniaboardgame.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m here because after the amazing response to that game, in addition to continuing to expand on it, I also want to be able to release more of my games for free in the same way. I actually intended to do so already at this point, but it requires a lot of time and materials for creation, playtesting, etc. as well as the cost to keep the website(s) active, and to be honest, it\u0027s getting to be kind of a stretch for me on my income. I\u0027ve had to make decisions recently about if it was more important for me to finish a game I\u0027m working on, or, you know...eat. Sadly, I chose the latter. I previously had a GoFundMe page set up, and received a few contributions, enough to cover the domain for 6 months and \u00a0a little left over to pay for some ink as I worked on the next expansion, which was awesome. I really hate begging for money, but I just need a bit of help if I\u0027m going to continue doing this. I promise to be reasonable about any of the pledge rewards, I\u0027ll do my best to do what you want with it, if for any reason I don\u0027t feel like I can deliver and make it worth your contribution, you will be refunded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust to be clear, you are in no way expected to contribute just for playing the game. I couldn\u0027t legally charge for that even if I wanted to, it\u0027s free, download it, play it on Tabletop Simulator, have fun, it means a lot to me just that people enjoy playing it. I don\u0027t want money for that, but if you would be interested in playing some other things I\u0027m working on, anything at all that you can afford to contribute would be incredibly helpful, and it would all go directly back into more games. This is what I do with every free hour of my life now, and I love being able to share my work with everyone for free, but unfortunately it\u0027s beginning to cost more than I can manage. Thank you so much for the support."
