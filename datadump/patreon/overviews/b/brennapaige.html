Its something I love to do and as time goes on I\u0027ve been improving my videos as much as possible. So I\u0027ve decided to go all in and do it full time! My channel focuses on alternative subcultures and fashion, with personal vlogs, make-up tutorials, fashion related videos and product reviews thrown in there. I hope to add to this list as time goes on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat dose\u00a0Patreon do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon lets users donate to creators regularly, contributing to their development. Its not the same as kickstarter or gofundme, rather then donating towards one large goal its more of a way of \"tipping\" your\u00a0favorite\u00a0online creators. Your support will allow me to continue making videos, as well as\u00a0providing me with opportunities to get better equipment, host awesome giveaways for you, and provide new, exciting content!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eYou have COMPLETE control over how much you pay. You can select the amount you wish to donate per video, as well as a monthly limit. This means if you donate $2 per video but put a monthly limit of $10, even if I were to upload 20 videos that month, you\u0027d still only pay the $10 you set as your limit. You can also change, adjust, or cancel at ANY time. On top of this, Patreon allows you to use PayPal, for total security. No sneaky costs, no getting caught out, just a straight forward way to help out the creators you love!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatron perks?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off , inexpressible gratitude \u00a0from myself \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003eI cant put into words how thankful I am to patrons ,you make this happen .\u003cbr\u003eAside from that\u00a0you will be granted access to my Patreon feed where you can chat with me privately, put in video suggestions and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eBecause Patreon is a little more exclusive, your messages will be more likely to be seen than on other places on the internet were often times\u00a0there\u0027s\u00a0just too many messages to get to everyone promptly.\u00a0In the coming months I will also be working on further rewards for Patrons, so stay tuned!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eOn a personal note\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love all of my subscribers and followers !\u003cbr\u003eI love reading your\u00a0comments,hearing your thoughts and opinions ,and bringing you more content.\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate the crap out of when any of you help out here!
