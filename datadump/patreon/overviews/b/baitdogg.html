    "summary": "Hi there! \u00a0Welcome to Bait Dogg!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Si and I am the writer of the forthcoming graphic novel series, \u0027Bait Dogg\u0027 - thank you very much for visiting my page. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those visitors pressed for time, who would just like to see the work, here is a quick and easy link to view our 12 introductory pages straight away: \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flic.kr/s/aHskUsEXDq\"\u003ehttps://flic.kr/s/aHskUsEXDq\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who would like some history on the project, here it comes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBait Dogg is a story that I originally wrote back in 2013. \u00a0I had always been a fan of Marvel/DC styled comics as kid and then, during my teenage years, I was introduced to manga and anime for the first time. They completely blew me away and altered my perception of what was possible when it came to comics and animation. \u00a0Unfortunately, real life in the form of rent/bills/tax eventually intervened and I kind of lost touch with the world of graphic art for a while. \u00a0Finally, a friend introduced me to the incredible work of Garth Ennis, whose stories impressed and inspired me so much that they got me hooked on reading comic books again and made me want to create something of my own. \u00a0I didn\u0027t know then what that was going to be exactly, but, spurned on by my taste in film and my interest in various real world news stories and events that were occurring at the time, the plot of Bait Dogg began to form in my mind. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI knew that it was wasn\u0027t going to be an easy read from the outset, however I have always much preferred to watch films and read stories that affect my emotions and question my moral boundaries, rather than just switching my brain off whilst watching/reading the latest summer blockbusters, and I wanted Bait Dogg to be a reflection of this. I\u0027m a big fan of the director, David Fincher, who was once quoted as stating that \u0027people are perverts\u0027 and that he had basically built his career on giving them what they wanted, meaning that he acknowledges that we are all intrigued by dark subject matter in one form or another and that sometimes it can be interesting, if not exactly fun, to explore those themes.\u00a0 It was in this darkness that I knew I wanted Bait Dogg to live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I guess that I had better give you some insight into what you will be getting yourself into if you do very kindly choose to become a Patron of Bait Dogg.\u00a0 The following synopsis briefly explains where the story will be heading:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Ten years ago, the son of philandering, alcoholic \npatrolman, Abe Anderson, was kidnapped and murdered in front of his very\n eyes. Abe claimed brutal revenge on his son\u0027s kidnappers, however his \nactions were judged unlawful and he was sent to prison to pay for his \ncrimes. Now, ten years on, Abe is released from incarceration into a \nworld where he has been stripped of everything. With nothing to live \nfor, Abe soon falls back into his old ways. When a child goes missing, a\n chance encounter with a face from his past gives him an opportunity for\n redemption, however, unbeknownst to Abe, it is a quest that will lead \nhim into the dark heart of a sadistic underground society where \nkidnapped children are forced to fight to the death, like dogs.\u0027 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePretty grim, huh?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has taken me a long long (long long) time to get the project to this point in its evolution and there have been more than a few false starts along the way, which I have had to learn from. \u00a0I have never created anything before and I had no idea how to write a script or how it should be formatted or how to then translate it into something that an artist could use in order to turn my descriptions into imagery. Then of course, there was the real life financial aspect of actually believing in and committing to the project enough to pay for an artist to bring the story to life, as good art costs money and money is in short supply! \u00a0However I now totally understand the amount of blood, sweat and tears that go into creating page after page of incredibly beautiful art and believe it to be worth every penny. \u00a0I consider myself extremely fortunate to be working with the incredibly talented Tom Walker of Big Foot Studios (http://www.bigfootstudios.co.uk/) in Liverpool, England, on the art front. \u00a0Tom is an absolute genius, and thankfully a very patient and understanding genius to boot! \u00a0I hope that you will appreciate his art just as much as I do and enjoy the story as well (as much as you can enjoy something of this nature!).\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing working on this book has definitely taught me is to appreciate the work of others.\u00a0 You can love a project that someone has created, hate a project that someone has created, be ambivalent towards a project that someone has created; be as critical as you like, but you have to respect the massive amount of work that has actually gone into creating that project.\u00a0 So, my congrats to all the other creators out there who have actually gone and made something out of nothing - you totally have my respect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be posting the first section of the story, along with Tom\u0027s work in progress pages to show you how the art was made and will also include my original script to show you just how much of an amateur script writer I really am, ha! Hopefully though, you can look past my shortcomings and appreciate the project as a whole.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for reading and contributing to our ongoing project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest regards,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSi\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS - Scroll right down to the very bottom of the page to view the posts and story in chronological order.\u003cbr\u003e"
