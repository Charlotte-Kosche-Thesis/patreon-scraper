    "summary": "\u00a0 \u00a0I\u0027m Blair MacGregor.\u00a0 Reviewers describe my fantasy novels as brutal, gritty,\ncharacter-driven, and realistic military fantasy.\u00a0 Even my most well-meaning characters must choose between what is\ngood and what is necessary... then live with the consequences.\u00a0 You can find more information about the\nnovels \u003ca href=\"http://blairmacgregorbooks.com/sand-of-bone/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 This little Patreon began with a singular\nfocus on martial arts, self-defense, and fight-writing, and it\u0027s been a\nfantastic experience.  Now it\u0027s time to\nchange it up.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 We\u0027ll be keeping the\nfighting and the fight-writing! \u00a0(Here\u0027s an \u003ca href=\"http://blairmacgregorbooks.com/2015/09/11/five-things-to-avoid-when-you-want-to-learn-self-defense/\"\u003eexample\u003c/a\u003e of the articles I write.  Here\u0027s an example of \u003ca href=\"http://blairmacgregorbooks.com/2013/08/09/seeing-is-understanding/\"\u003ewhy I write them\u003c/a\u003e.) \u00a0But\u00a0we\u0027re going to have fun with a couple other\ntopics, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0There will be the whiskey!  We\u0027ll go into the drinking, the making, the\nstories and myths, and even the laws.  We\u0027ll chat about other spirits, too\u2014vodka and\ngin, brandy and rum, maybe even a little applejack on the side.  Sure, I\u0027m mostly a whiskey gal, but there\u0027s a\nbunch of overlap on the production and tasting side, and the entire history of\nspirits\u2014and their present iterations\u2014is fascinating.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0There will be puppers!  My puppers, your puppers, all the puppers!  There might be anything from simple pupper\npics and photos, to the occasional in-depth article.  There will be seriousness and silliness,\nscience and storytelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0There will be more regular updates on\nnovels-in-progress!  I will not promise\nsnippets and such\u2014I\u0027ve learned the worst thing for my creative process is a\npublic schedule rather than a private one\u2014but there will always be something. It\nmight be a curiosity research uncovered, or the challenge of a character\u0027s\ntransformation, or a stylistic experiment pushing the boundaries of my\nexperience.  And maybe, now and then, a\nsurprise snippet.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0This should\nbe \u003cem\u003efun\u003c/em\u003e, my darlings.  I want to ensure it is, every month, month\nafter month.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0In the past, y\u0027all have made it clear you want the\nself-defense and fight-writing articles to eventually become public rather than\nbe kept behind Patreon\u0027s walls.  I will gladly continue that tradition you so generously\nchose to support.  The other pieces we\u0027re\nadding, though, will be just for Patrons. \nOh, some of the writing updates will bleed over to the public blog in a\ngeneral way, but the specifics and the depth will remain yours.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 By becoming a patron, you support the fiction and the non-fiction.\u00a0 The characters who must decide if their cause\nis worth the consequences.\u00a0 The real-life\npeople who deserve to know how best to protect themselves from the bad\nguys.\u00a0 The storytelling that benefits\nfrom understanding when, why, and how violence is effective, and when, why, and\nhow fighters make their decisions.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Above all, my darlings,\u00a0thank you so much for your interest and\ninvestment.\u00a0 Your feedback is always\nwelcome.\u00a0 If you\u0027d like to stay in touch,\nyou can find me on Twitter \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/blairmacg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e(@blairmacg\u003c/a\u003e), on \u003ca href=\"http://blairmacg.livejournal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLiveJournal\u003c/a\u003e, and at \u003ca href=\"http://blairmacgregorbooks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlair MacGregorBooks.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
