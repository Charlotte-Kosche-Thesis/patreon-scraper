I\u0027m a crazy 23-year-old\u00a0on a mission to change the world with a passion for music and videos that entertain, educate and inspire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since I can remember I\u0027ve wanted\u00a0to\u00a0light people\u00a0up. Since I was a child running around playing games, telling stories or making jokes to today as I create music, videos and perform shows. Nothing lights me up like seeing someone smile, laugh or feel empowered. That\u0027s why I\u0027m dedicated to making a meaningful difference is as many lives as I can touch. I believe even the smallest of actions like a smile can ripple on and change the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my music and videos are available free online. I make it this way so that my content and message can reach anybody anywhere. I know this is not the greatest business strategy, but I love\u00a0what I do and believe in the difference I can make in people\u0027s lives. I believe those who have the means to support me and this movement will contribute what they can and if that\u0027s you, then thank you, from the deepest part of my\u00a0heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m super excited about this because if you chose to donate even 1 dollar per month it means you are a part of my team, my gang, my squad, the crew, the community! my board of directors, my producer, my coach, I get to share my creations, concerns, questions and you will be the team that point me in the right direction when it comes to song arrangements, ideas, or anything at all! So again, thank you! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8b02K3HRmsY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Does Your Money Go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell...rent lol. Not just that, but there is\u00a0a lot of expenses like gear, repairs, productions and more. It also allows me to increase the quality and quantity of content and set a higher budget for new projects! Money is freedom and the more money I can accumulate means we will have the freedom to create not just more content, but better content at new locations, better equipment, build our influence and our movement!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you can not donate, I\u0027d just like to say thank you! You clicked here and read all the way down here. Thank you, peace, love \u0026amp; positivity!"
