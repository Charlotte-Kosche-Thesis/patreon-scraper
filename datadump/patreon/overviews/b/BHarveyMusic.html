    "summary": "Wow. So here I am, finally at a place in my life where the Universe is no longer willing to wait around for me to make up my mind.\u00a0She has taken it upon herself to turn my world upside down and usher me out metaphorical door and off on this journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e for stopping by to check out my Patreon page. This is an exercise in faith and community. I am a singer/songwriter and writer, amongst other things. Patreon is a place where artists and creatives like me can find an audience, collaborators, and support that gives us the freedom to \"do\" our art. So, if you\u0027re a fan/friend of mine and love what I do, Patreon is the place to be. This is where my tribe can join me on this journey. By becoming a patron or following me, you become a collaborator, a patron, part of the tribe, and a fellow sojourner. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs part of the fun of it all, the patron levels are each based on one of the things I love. Along my journey, I have discovered that I\u0027m a total geek about some things, and I am not ashamed. Whether it\u0027s Doctor Who, Lord of the Rings, or all things Irish, you\u0027ll find little nods to those things and more woven through the levels. So, by just reading through the levels, you\u0027ve learned a bit about me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m trusting that my path has led me here at exactly this time because there is a community out there who believes in my art - a community of other desperate souls who will walk with me along the way\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStick around and meet other members of the tribe, find our more about me, and, if you like what you hear, and you, too, are another desperate soul, join the journey."
