    "summary": "I am a musician from Southern California who has a vision for music and videos! My first mixtape, Carpe Diem, is just the first step in the trilogy of mixtapes that will propel to me to my first album, Dreamer. Once Dreamer hits the scene, my music and videos only tell stories from there. Each album will be a visual album that when pieced together, will appear as one giant musical movie! I want to be a pioneer of visual albums because I feel they are the next big thing in the music / video world. Additionally, I just recently won First Place, Division Winner, and Best of Show in the 2014 OC Fair Student Film Festival for my music video, The Departure. In a week, I will be headed to Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee to begin my studies in Music Business and Music Production \u0026amp; Recording Arts.\u003cbr\u003e"

I was born in Framingham, Massachusetts, but moved to California with my family shortly after my birth, where I would spend the rest of my young life. I am currently an independent artist, recording under my own record label, Varce City Music. Additionally, I am the co-owner of the clothing company, Lucrative. My\u00a0first\u00a0mixtape, Carpe Diem, will be released on August 31st, 2014 via free web download.
