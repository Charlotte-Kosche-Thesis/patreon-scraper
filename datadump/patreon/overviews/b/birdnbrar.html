    "summary": "Hi. We\u0027re a pair of comics creators trying to complete our fantasy comics epic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether, we created \u003cem\u003eAl\u0027Rashad: City of Myths\u003c/em\u003e from 2010 to 2014. Working at a page-a-week schedule, we managed to grind out a 236-page fantasy epic with a majority-minority cast, big thrills, horrible villains, and as few \u003cem\u003eDungeons and Dragons \u003c/em\u003ereferences as humanly possible (because D\u0026amp;D; is great, but every other fantasy comic out there riffs off D\u0026amp;D;, and we wanted to make something different). You can read the entire story for free online; it starts \u003ca href=\"http://mightygodking.com/al-rashad/comic/book-1-page-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut \u003cem\u003eAl\u0027Rashad\u003c/em\u003e was only the first story in a trilogy. We\u0027re ready to begin creating the second book of the trilogy, \u003cem\u003eRa-Boka: Kingdom of the Bound.\u003c/em\u003e And we\u0027re nearly good to go. But there\u0027s a problem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem is simple: we both have full-time jobs (Davinder is a teacher and Chris is a lawyer). Creating the comic is a serious endeavour - particularly for Davinder, since the art is always the more labour-intensive side of the gig - and it takes time away from Davinder\u0027s opportunity to work freelance as an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo: this Patreon, which exists almost entirely to be able to fund Davinder\u0027s time expense in drawing Chris\u0027s often-annoyingly-complex ideas and let us continue to make our comic. It\u0027s simple: we work on a per-page basis. The more money that comes in, the more pages we turn out.\u003cbr\u003e"
