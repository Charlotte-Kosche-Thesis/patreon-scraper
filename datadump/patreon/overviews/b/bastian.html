    "summary": "Hi, my name is Bastian, i\u0027m living in germany with my beautiful wife and son in a little city near cologne. I love making music and playing guitar and eventually i\u0027m going out there to fulfill my dream of taking my music to other people, reach hearts and make them smile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m working as a graphic designer and software developer. My goal is to make some extra money for my family by sharing my music. The big hit would be to quit my job and to be able to live only from the music, writing songs and spend as lot of time as possible\u00a0with my son.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusic\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve been playing the guitar since 18 years now, both electric and acoustic. I played in several bands from aggressive metal to alternative rock. At some time i thought it would be a good idea to start singing too. But this project is all about finger style acoustic guitar playing. Maybe i will add some singing to the songs in the future, but for now it will be all instrumental.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what do i use the money from your support for?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAt first, I would reinvest the money in new equipment to give my supporters and everyone else the best sound and video quality possible. And then there is time. I\u0027m doing a lot of extra time at work, and in my free time the priority no. 1 is my family. So there is hardly any time for my music. If i get enough support, maybe i can lower the extra time at work to intensify the writing and recording sessions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how does it work?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you just want to listen to my music and don\u0027t want or don\u0027t can support me by pledging, i\u0027m ok with that. The greatest gift is to reach people with my music. And so my music will always be free to everyone who wants to listen. But if you\u0027re thinking about supporting me to reach my goals and get more and higher quality recordings, here is how it works:\u003cbr\u003eHere on Patreon you can make a funding subscription and define the amount of money you want to pledge for every song i\u0027m gonna publish (as a video). You can even set a monthly pledging maximum. And you can unsubscribe at any time you want.\u003cbr\u003e"
