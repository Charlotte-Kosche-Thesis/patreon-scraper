And, well, it has been quite difficult for us to explain. Because what might look like just another fitness blog on the outside is planned to be so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\tBut we think that we\u2019ve finally found our words.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch4\u003eWhere are we at?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\t\t\tThe internet is one of the greatest achievements in human history. Everything you want is just one click away. It\u2019s a blessing. But it can also be misused, making it a curse at the same time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\tWe\u2019re living in an era where reach on the internet, especially on \u003cstrong\u003esocial media can impact millions of lives\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\tAt this precise moment, social media creates a living for thousands of people. You can earn your money with affiliate links, brand cooperation, and so much more. But why do we only see people marketing supplements, the newest equipment, and yoga wear? Well, that\u2019s where the quickest and easiest money is.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\tBut does any of this stuff actually matter? Do the modern Influencers really help the individual? Do they make the world a better place?\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\tAnd, do you really have to sell your soul, values, integrity, and common sense to make a living online?\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch4\u003eWhat if influencing is used right way?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\t\t\tJust imagine what could happen when a wide reach and a big influence is used to pinpoint real problems, discuss sustainability, create awareness, and help an individual reach peak performance? What if we could create a \u003cstrong\u003eglobal self-awareness movement\u003c/strong\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eA movement that \u003cem\u003eis \u003c/em\u003ethe change it wants to see in the world\u003c/strong\u003e. A collective that starts with the man or women in the mirror but also sees the bigger picture? A community that is aware of their food choices, aware of their physical and psychological well-being, and, most importantly, aware of the global well-being. A group of people where \u003cstrong\u003ecreating value stands above money.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\tSounds like a fairy tale?\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\tIt\u2019s not.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\tInfluence on social media is \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e powerful.

This the reason why nutrition and strength training play such a huge role in our lives. Not only because of getting strong and ripped \u2013of course, these are good reasons. It\u2019s more about creating well-being, awareness, and fostering a state of mental and physical peak performance from which we can operate.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\tThe proper functioning of your mind and body and the creation of awareness for yourself and the world around you \u003cstrong\u003epaves the way for action\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eAnd awareness is the prerequisite for action\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\tWe create content about \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ehealth\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eperformance\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003esustainability\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ephilosophical questions\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, and much more.
