From terrestrial radio to streaming digital, Brian Fritz and his ilk have strived to bring you informative, educated, and (most importantly) entertaining professional wrestling coverage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we need your help! Server fees, bandwidth expenses, audio/video equipment, graphic designs, and more, all cost real money. (Trust us\u2026 we tried to pay in hugs. It did not end well.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we\u0027re asking for a few bucks a month to help support what we do, and help grow what we do. We\u0027re asking you to be our buddy! In exchange, we\u0027re offering up some cool freebies and interactive content to help you be even more involved in our process. Not only that, you can sleep better knowing you\u0027ve donated one more hard cider to Brian Fritz, and one more PBR to Michael A. Wiseman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can donate at any amount you feel comfortable (did you know that if EVERY Between the Ropes subscriber gave only one dollar, we could both make creating more BTR  content our full-time jobs?), but the \"Buddy System\" rewards start at $5.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANKS! You guys are the best buddies. For reals."
