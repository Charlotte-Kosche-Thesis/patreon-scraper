    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Ebbie, also known as BizarreJelly5 around a few places and I create content based around anime, or those Japanese Cartoons that you\u0027ve probably seen at some point in your life. I don\u0027t really have much of a structure when it comes to making videos, I just like to talk about what excites me, such as shows that I\u0027ve been watching, first impressions for new shows that have just started airing, and reviews for other shows and films that may or may not be perpetually late.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn terms of what I need help with, though, if people were kind enough to support me. I have a lot of ideas for content that I\u0027d like to create in the future, both short term, and in the long run. While these will get made eventually, regardless of how much support I get, they are going to cost a little bit of money to make. Any support I get will go into making these future projects the best they possibly can be. I\u0027d also like to upgrade some of my equipment in the future, such as getting a camera with a microphone that doesn\u0027t sound all garbled and awful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t like the idea of having exclusive content for Patreons, as if people can\u0027t pledge for whatever reason, I don\u0027t want to withhold my content from them. All of my content has always been free, and always will be.\u00a0So if you\u0027ve looked on this page, and read what I have to say, and actually want to support me, that\u0027s awesome, and I\u0027m so thankful, and you\u0027re wonderful. If you can\u0027t, or don\u0027t want to pledge any money to me, that\u0027s also cool, and thank you for reading regardless. Oh, and you\u0027re also still wonderful.\u003cbr\u003e"
