I\u0027m an avid writer, I\u0027ve got a couple of novels under my belt - one of which was written with a friend and we are seeking publishing for (we\u0027re working on a second, as well), and I also do short stories. I do my best to write daily.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy writing more than pretty much anything on the planet, and I would love to be able to do more of it. While I do have a normal-person job, and it grants me the ability to do more than I could previously, it doesn\u0027t lift me up the way that writing does, and still doesn\u0027t give me the absolute freedom that I would love to have. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate every single patron I have now, and those I have had in the past.
