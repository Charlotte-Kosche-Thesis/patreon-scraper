    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout us\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBioTech Games is an independent game development company based in Sweden. The company was unoffically founded during summer 2013 by two brothers,\u00a0but it was no sooner than during 2015 when we decided to take a name \"BioTech Games\".\u00a0At that time we grew from two members to eight, and we\u0027re still growing.\u003cbr\u003eWe believe that all aspects of games play important roles in them. Nevertheless for now, we are focusing mainly on gameplay and story of our games. However, we plan to introduce huge improvements of used music and graphics in close future.\u003cbr\u003eHere in BioTech Games, we do what we love: we play and make games!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are you currently working on?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSolar Space is a 2D sci-fi sandbox, conquer and starship management game.\u003cbr\u003eIt is going to\u00a0include elements such as exploration of various planets, surviving on them and even managing your starship fleet(s). Explore the vastness of galaxy, land on different planets and find all kind of races, civilizations and resources. Gather these resources, build bases to survive, forge alliances, expand your territory and influence and set up trade routes. Should you decide others are not worth your time and efforts, you are free to exterminate them all - or die in the process.\u003cbr\u003eLive your life as a ruthless and pompous emperor of a great galactic empire, or become a loved captain commanding a professional crew.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe choice is yours.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSolar Space is supported on all PC platforms including windows, mac and linux. It is translated into over 15 different languages and\u00a0features both single- and multiplayer, where you can choose from two game modes - a creative mode for builders, and a battle mode for those of you who want to wreck chaos and (mass) destruction. Both these modes can be then played together in the galactic mode where you can conquer whole galaxy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs already mentioned, we are focusing on the story in our games and this one is, of course, no exception. However, the story of this game will not be included in our official beta version release(s). We plan to release it later due to time reasons since we work on a decision-dependent frame. We want to present a story where your decisions will matter for sure - one way or another. For now, our priority is to release a fully functioning multiplayer as soon as possible to receive invaluable feedback from players allowing us to further improve gameplay experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you need my help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGame development is not cheap even if it might not seem to be true in case of a low budget project such as this one. Your help (or funding in general) will boost us on top of the hill, providing us with access to equipment allowing us to make better games and possibly even 3D games in future. Better the tools, higher the quality of content we will release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of now, we are working on Solar Space for free and without any income at all. Most of our staff is still students attending school which makes time we are free to dedicate to a game development really limited. And this is exactly where you and your help come in.\u003cbr\u003eLet us enjoy this fun together.\u003cbr\u003e"
