There seemed to be this great and growing gap between the film criticism I was reading and this very real and tangible thing that films themselves actually do to each one of us, how they make us feel. Most critics\u2014professional and amateur and everywhere in between\u2014were quite proficient at writing a very specific kind of review, one that described the film\u2019s basic plot, some of its performances, and whether they \u2018liked\u2019 it or not. But I kept thinking there had to be something other than this quick, streamlined, and often lifeless response to a medium that is\u2014initially and essentially\u2014an emotional medium, an art form that can immerse us more wholly in its world than any other form of entertainment available to us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so we created BW/DR, with the idea of gathering more personal and creative responses to films; a different lens on the medium, if you will. We didn\u2019t want standard movie reviews on the site, so instead of seeking out proper film critics, we contacted novelists, poets, essayists, filmmakers, painters, and musicians, as well as a handful of trusted friends\u2014people who could approach and engage with movies in new and interesting ways. And from that small kernel of an idea (and a whole lot of late nights spent at my computer), BW/DR has grown into the sprawling and fantastic community of writers and readers that it is today. In mid-2014, Matt Zoller Seitz, the editor-in-chief of \u003cstrong\u003eRogerEbert.com\u003c/strong\u003e,\u00a0reached out to us and asked us to partner with them for a monthly feature. For the past two and half years, they\u0027ve run\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026amp;q=Bright+Wall\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ean essay each month\u003c/a\u003e from \u003cem\u003eBright Wall/Dark Room\u003c/em\u003e on the front page of their site, one of the most well-respected film sites on the planet. We\u0027re also looking to partner with FilmStruck in the near future, and are constantly looking for new ways to grow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s all been an absolute thrill for us, to say the very least\u2014but we \u003cem\u003estill \u003c/em\u003eneed to find a way to pay the bills.
