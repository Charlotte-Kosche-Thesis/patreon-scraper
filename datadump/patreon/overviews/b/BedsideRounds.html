    "summary": "Years ago, when I was a lowly medical intern, I obsessively listened to podcasts to remind me that the human experience kept chugging along while I spent 80 hours a week at the hospital. My favorite was Radiolab, which was a constant reminder of the humanity and wonder behind science. I obsessively searcher for a similar podcast in my field -- a podcast that valued storytelling, but also highlighted the excitement, wonder, and humanity of medicine. I couldn\u0027t find it, and in a fit of irrationality I decided to launch my own podcast while I was a second year resident (and continuing to work 80 hours a week). I named it Bedside Rounds, after the medical tradition of discussing the case and teaching at the patients\u0027 bedside. I viewed Bedside Rounds as just another way to teach as a medical educator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut the podcast has grown into so much more than that. \u003c/strong\u003eInitially my stories were about medical ephemera, fun facts that would be appropriate at a cocktail party (though clearly the type of cocktail party I like, full of nerds who love science). But as I developed my craft, my stories became more researched and ambitious. I started to dig into historical documents, visit museums, talk to experts in the field. Bedside Rounds slowly became a podcast about using our past to understand the present and future of medicine. I\u0027ve had episodes about the birth of the X-ray, and how the first practitioners died horribly of radiation; how the medicalization of death fueled a panic about being buried alive in the nineteenth century; how doctors failed to learn the lessons of the first opiate epidemic, leading to the current scourge; and how decisions about who would get dialysis in Seattle in the 1960s led to the birth of modern medical ethics. With increased ambition, I\u0027ve also involved more people in the podcast, most notably Cam Steele, who is a producer and has helped make many of our most popular episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith increased ambition comes increased cost. \u003c/strong\u003eBedside Rounds is a labor of love. I\u0027m a full-time global health hospitalist (many of the episodes were recorder in Botswana), and Cam is a full-time medical student. We work on these episodes in our spare time -- and it takes a lot of it. The average episode of Bedside Rounds takes 10-20 hours to make, mostly in research, but also in recording and audio editing. On top of that, equipment and hosting expenses are about $300 a year. Don\u0027t get me wrong -- doing this is worth every penny spent, and every hour leafing through old medical journals. I\u0027ve always viewed the podcast as an educational pursuit, and I want to take the NPR approach to funding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo if you love Bedside Rounds as much as we do\u003c/strong\u003e, any amount you can give is greatly appreciated. We will put it towards our hosting expenses, and towards continuing to make great episodes about medical storytelling!"
