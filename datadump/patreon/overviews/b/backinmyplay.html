Growing up video games were a major part of my life. From gaining friends through a common interest in games to using them as a way to escape a difficult time in school with bullies. As far back as I can remember we had video games in our house and ever since then they have been a major part of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in my Play is a podcast for nostalgic gamers that want to revisit the memories of their favorite games growing up, as well as discover hidden gems they may have missed. My #1 rule of the podcast is that is has to be fun and positive. If the hosts aren\u2019t having fun, how will the audience? And let\u2019s be real, video games are fun, if you aren\u2019t having fun, do something else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt is hard to believe that Back in my Play will be celebrating it\u0027s 4th birthday June 2017. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created Back in my Play to celebrate retro video games by remembering our personal histories with the games from back in the day, as well as revisit them to see how they hold up in the modern era. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince starting the show back in June 2013 I have produced over 125 episodes covering specific games, expanded series like 2016\u0027s \"Summer of Dreamcast,\" as well as interviews with developers and others associated with retro games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has been nothing short of an absolute blast to produce over the years thanks to the incredible guests and dedicated and enthusiastic audience. As the show has grown in size it has become more demanding to support in terms of cost and especially time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoing forward I want to \u003cstrong\u003eEXPAND \u003c/strong\u003eBack in my Play. Create even more of the content that you have come to love from the podcast and produce in depth video features and series associated with retro games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is where you and Patreon comes in.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
