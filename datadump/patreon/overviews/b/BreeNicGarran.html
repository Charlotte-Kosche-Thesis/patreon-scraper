    "summary": "Times have changed, and so has the craft. The old texts are all well and good, but with the modern proliferation and incredible variety of practitioners in the community, there needs to be new material to support the new generation. Witches are looking for new angles and fresh ideas to supplement their practices, and that\u0027s what I\u0027ve chosen to write about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first solo project, \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://a.co/6ddt2bJ\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGrovedaughter Witchery\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, was a brand-new take on the Witchcraft 101 book, with a focus on accessibility, secular inclusion, responsible crafting, and solid practical advice. It debuted to rave reviews and a weeklong stay at the top of the Amazon\u0027s top sellers list for the overall Witchcraft category. Readers and reviewers alike have remarked on the practicality of the text, and the oft-repeated phrase that turns up is \"Where was THIS when I was starting out!\" A review in \u003ca href=\"http://www.bbimedia.com/store/index.php?main_page=index\u0026amp;cPath=42\u0026amp;zenid=d68be784e45c350e810ab7059d9cea88\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWitches \u0026amp; Pagans magazine\u003c/a\u003e (Issue #35 - Natural Paganism) praised the book as a friendly and conversational read, calling it innovative, accessible, and useful for practitioners of all experience levels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of patrons like you, I hope to make writing my fulltime job, so that I can keep creating amazing books like this one. I\u0027ve got several projects in the works right now, and all of them promise to be great additions to the library of the working witch. All I need is time to focus on research and creation, and your contributions help support me and keep the lights on while I work toward my next publication. Feel free to check out my \u003ca href=\"https://breenicgarran.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWordpress\u003c/a\u003e for information on my other published works and current projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for all your support thus far and for your continued encouragement as I move forward with my writing. Please feel free to email me with questions, tag me in social media, and spread the words to your witchy friends and family. Every little bit of recognition, visibility, and positivity and every cent of your donations is appreciated more than I can possibly say!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove and Best Wishes,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBree NicGarran\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
