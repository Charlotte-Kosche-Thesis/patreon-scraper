    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a professional wordsmith working for companies for 30 years as a creative writer, technical writer, editor, and proofreader. After years of working for others, it\u0027s time to write for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a lot of ideas, and I\u0027m excited to forge ahead. I\u0027ll be learning this side of my craft as I learn the ins and outs of freelance creative writing in genre fiction (fantasy, mystery, romance, science fiction, thriller, horror).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll share my research and writing path along with posting reviews of books and movies and links to thought-provoking stories and websites. (Link lists will be public and free. All other materials are for patrons only.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m working with Patreon because my full-time job doesn\u0027t quite pay the bills, let alone give me funds for things like a new computer and attending conventions to share my writing and make contacts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I find an additional part-time job to fill the wage gap, I won\u0027t have time or energy to write. I\u0027ve been at this gate before, and it\u0027s time to break through. It\u0027s time to write, with the help of patrons who will contribute to my journey in exchange for a window into my process and sneak peeks into my books as they are written. To be clear, you would donate money to help support me while I create, and I will respond as often as possible with thank-you gifts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can follow my adventure for as little as $1.00 a month. I\u0027m grateful for all donations and all will help me to reach my goals and realize my dream of sharing my fiction. In appreciation for your donations, I have several tiers of rewards, which I hope are as exciting to you as the possibilities are to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m at the top of the hill on the roller coaster of life. Won\u0027t you join me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNOTE: \u00a0Many, many thanks to Denis Loubet for my top banner art. Check out his artwork here at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/denisloubet\"\u003ewww.patreon.com/denisloubet\u003c/a\u003e!"
