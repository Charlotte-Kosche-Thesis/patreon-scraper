    "summary": "Hey guys, Buildzoid here. Let me tell you a story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was 14 I built my first PC to play games. In the process of learning about PC building I discovered overclocking and quickly fell in love with tweaking and modifying computer hardware to go faster. At the time I noticed that there weren\u0027t any sites covering overclocking as in depth or as much as I would like to see and so I decided to start my own computer hardware blog...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...and it was \u003cstrong\u003eBAD.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo bad in fact that I completely scrapped all of it after a while. Some time later armed with new knowledge and maybe a little more maturity I created Actually Hardcore Overclocking. It didn\u0027t suck but it tended to be content starved and never really got as much readership as I wanted, however it did at least have content in the form of reviews and various overclocking related guides on a level that I found acceptable. Recently I expanded into Livestreaming overclocking sessions and into creating Youtube videos about various overclocking related topics. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoing forward I would really just like to make more and better overclocking content be that in text or video. Right now I don\u0027t have access to all the computer hardware and various other devices I would like to cover or experiment with. I made AHOC to help people with overclocking. However I can hardly help someone trying to overclock a Pascal based graphics card if the newest Nvidia card I have is a GT710 which doesn\u0027t even have boost. I can\u0027t show and explain to people how to overclock non-K skylake CPUs when I don\u0027t have any skylake CPUs. I can\u0027t do much more than speculate if I don\u0027t have hardware to test withe and to show people what works and what doesn\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where Patreon comes in. With Patreon you can support me in buying the hardware and supplies I need to make videos and in return you get more, better videos, streams and articles. And who knows, maybe it could even become my full-time job \u2013 which would be super cool.\u003cbr\u003e"
