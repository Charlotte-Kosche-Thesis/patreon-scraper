I used to sell buttons with him on it as well. But he never quite got a solid purpose, or a name for that matter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I figured, why not combine the two somehow. \u003cbr\u003eBut since the conception of that idea I have procrastinated on it in search for a perfect story that I did not know how to write, stll don\u2019t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it is time to do something. \u003cbr\u003eTime to start somewhere. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wish to use this patreon campaign to motivate me and help breathe life into these characters. \u003cbr\u003eI want to do so by at least posting two solid images or one comic strip\u00a0per week that will hopefully inspire\u00a0or start to construct a story. \u003cbr\u003eFor starters, I\u2019m not asking much. Your minimum contribution of $1/month will give you full access to all exclusive content not shown anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf all goes well I will increase the tiers with more rewards. \u003cbr\u003eI will even post FREE bonuses for those who simply subscribe as patrons without any contributions, in hopes that you will help share and spread the word.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Thank You-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eSincerely, Alice, The Bear and Me.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
