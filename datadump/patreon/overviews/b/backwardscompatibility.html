He was instrumental in the beginning of the RO Project, but was unable to see it through to the completion of Subject 13-C. As the first successful biomech, his technology is relatively old; he has visible ball joints and his left leg creaks and sticks at the hip and knee. His CPU is also significantly slower and his nerve responses are less refined.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMatthew Maddox\u003c/strong\u003e, a former firefighter who was offered an underground rebuild. Currently is unable to work, as he has been declared legally dead. Has been largely rebuilt on the left side, with extensive burn scarring to the remaining natural skin, and wears a patch to cover his right eye socket after his body rejected the optical implant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLinus Peterson\u003c/strong\u003e,\u00a0fully human. He doesn\u2019t get depressed and he absolutely does not have an anxiety disorder. Keeps a popular blog about his experiences with his robot boyfriend and roommates, which is generally regarded as fiction and has a small but loyal fan following; his income comes from ad clicks and donations. Only trusts prepackaged foods.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKipper\u003c/strong\u003e, the first 100% synthetic consciousness in a lab-created biomechanical shell. Initially designated RO13-C in the facility where he was created. Mostly \u201csmooth\u201d with less noticable joints than Nicholas or Matt aside from the port access panel at the base of his neck. Is currently in hiding, having liberated himself from the lab in which he was built, and is therefore technically stolen property.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eThe story is constantly growing and offered entirely free to read;\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://backwardscompatibility.tumblr.com/prologue\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estart here\u003c/a\u003e for a taste of the universe.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to continue having the freedom to write the stories that move me, rather than those that might sell, and if you like the work I\u0027m doing, hey, maybe buy me a cup of coffee?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e"
