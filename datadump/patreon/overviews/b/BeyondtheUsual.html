Now we are in production for season 2, and we want to take our production to the next level!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDid you know that for most of season, Dayvee produced, shot and edited the project on her own? It was truly a labor of love. But, now it is time to make it even better, which will improve your viewing experience as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is why we created this Patreon account. If you feel compelled to give us a tip or help support this project monetarily, please select one of the options on the left side panel. There is no commitment. You can give monthly or just one time.
