    "summary": "Hi there its the Battle Corgi.\u00a0 This Patreon is for helping support my comic After Hours.\u00a0 It is an Adult erotic comic, for \u003cstrong\u003e18+\u003c/strong\u003e adults who enjoy furry artwork.\u00a0 The current story is set in a dark future era, with cybernetics that intermixes with my mates comic \u003cem\u003e(Complex Life)\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0 After Hours surrounds a few key characters and follows them through their daily lives. Both in their work and \u0027after hours\u0027.\u00a0 All of the\u00a0 story, art, and content in each page is created by me, for you, my readers and Patrons.\u00a0 This means a few things; First, that it takes me over 30+ hours to get one comic page cranked out; Second, working on this in my spare time causes for \u003cstrong\u003eMONTHS\u003c/strong\u003e in between pages. I want to be able to bring you as many as 4 comics per month but to do so I need help from the supporters of my comic and art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, who am I?\u00a0 I am a full time digital artist, raising my two sons and paying the other bills.\u00a0 This means it\u0027s hard to work on this comic and bring you all the content you want to see and the content I want to show you, and still make ends meet.\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eSO\u003c/strong\u003e, if you can consider supporting \"After Hours\" I will be able to post more pages and in the process, do my best to bring you the best content I can.\u00a0 In addition, as one of my patrons, you will get other little rewards, depending on the level you pledge to assist.\u00a0 That said, I have a lot of levels that you can select from, but some of the larger ones are limited as they involve things like your character getting a spot in the comic, as a background character, or even in a feature spot, where the page is their spotlight.\u00a0 As such, I can obviously only add a couple of those each month, so, yeah, limits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0However, all Patrons gain early access to after hours artworks, and as the levels increase you can get things like Q\u0026amp;A; with the cast/artist, access to polls and even custom artwork by popular demand, provided we meet our goals.\u00a0 There will also be early access to portfolios posted here that you can pick up before anyone else, options for access to the high resolution originals of the comic instead of the reduced size that is posted on the site and more!\u00a0 Just check it out below and remember, I really do appreciate all of the support I have already gotten on this comic and all the support that you are bringing me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Battle Corgi\u003cbr\u003e"
