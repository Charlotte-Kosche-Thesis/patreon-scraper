(all concept work currently!)\u003cbr\u003eIt centers around Kocho Nehein starting at a new high school with his twin sister Kaicha to finish out their senior year. Ko is having a much harder time adjusting than Kai. Having left their old city for mysterious circumstances involving Ko, he is trying his hardest to blend in. Being half an alien causes a lot of problems though, but with a new adult body, and a high tech government watch cloaking his skin, he is ready to, tentatively, try and fit in here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eRobert Wallis is a short punk biding his time until he can leave his shitty home town. Apathy turns to quick infatuation as the twins sweep the school, and Ko is seated right in front of him. Rob isn\u0027t stupid though, and immediately notices something is off about this new pretty boy. He\u0027s so tall and shredded, but a complete wall flower and jumpy to boot. A bent desk and a few electric sparks here and there have him convinced things aren\u0027t so dull around Chixon High.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe comic will be covering their few months together in highschool while each deals with different trials of growing up in an unfair world. Abuse, LGBT, and race issues will be prominent. Depending on how this goes they will get much darker.
