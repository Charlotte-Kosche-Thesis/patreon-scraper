    "summary": "\u201cIn the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer. And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there\u0027s something stronger \u2014 something better, pushing right back.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Albert Camus\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI found this quote years ago. I always liked the idea of an \u201cinvincible summer\u201d from the moment I read it and it became an aspiration of mine to achieve, if not an \u201cinvincible summer\u201d than at least a \u201cfairly hearty spring\u201d within myself. Having been a cynical, sarcastic, and mostly miserable gen-x bastard for most of my life, this seemed like a tall order...and it was.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I found my summer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day I woke up and realized that if I didn\u0027t turn my focus inward and begin to consciously move my life in a direction of joy and enthusiasm, that I may never make it. So, I quit my job, got rid of most of my belongings, and set off on a spiritual quest that has brought me to where I am today...a much happier, relaxed, and purposeful place. It has been a long and sometimes circuitous journey and, of course, the process is ongoing, but I can tell you this: I have never been happier and more content in my entire life...and now I am chronicling the journey that brought me here in the hopes that others might find some benefit in the path I\u0027ve been walking. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the next year, I\u0027ll be writing a book about my experiences in transformation and techniques I used to encourage, nurture, trick, and cajole my mind to change itself into a machine that can produce joy, regardless of the circumstances it finds itself in. I\u0027ll also be writing my usual \"slice of life\" essays and producing videos on my experiences in creating a better life, wherever you are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron, you will have access to chapters of the book as I finish them, essays, videos, chats with me, and behind the scenes peeks at my process. When all is said and done, book-wise, you\u0027ll receive a digital copy of the finished work...all for just $1.00 per month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, you don\u0027t have to join in order to see content! There is no paywall. Pay as much or as little as you want. Pay nothing if you don\u0027t believe you should. And if you ever do become a patron, but decide to stop, no hard feelings. But if you\u0027re digging what I produce and you\u0027d like to support a writer in his dream to go full time...by all means...throw me a dollar. I promise I won\u0027t spend it at the saloon or the card table. Any help is wildly, gratefully, and sincerely appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e"
