If not, then, please allow us to introduce ourselves...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is \u003cstrong\u003eJuliana\u003c/strong\u003e and with my husband \u003cstrong\u003eMark\u003c/strong\u003e we wander the planet to shoot \u0026amp; release weekly yoga videos and all kinds of other positive content through our channel on Youtube. We have created a video library full of \u003cem\u003epilates, fitness, yoga, travel, introspective diaries, vegan food, meditation, vlogs, and inspirational videos\u003c/em\u003e. We even released a mini-doc about our journey to an elephant sanctuary which helped raise over $10,000 for Elephant Haven in Thailand. \u00a0We believe and base our entire brand around one overarching idea- \u003cstrong\u003eThat our decisions today, will define our tomorrow\u003c/strong\u003e. And when we started Boho Beautiful, we had no idea how powerfully that idea was going to reshape our lives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur dream is to stay independent, able to create the content our hearts command us to, and always in control of our own destiny as long as we possibly can. And\u00a0it\u0027s with hope, that your Patreon pledges can help us keep this dream on track. We also want to be able to give back value to all of our Patrons in exchange for their pledges, so this platform seems to make a lot of sense for things like exclusive content and live streams. A place that can bring us all closer together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are so lucky to do what we do. Not a day goes by where we don\u0027t feel that. We work hard. Harder on this than anything we have ever put our hearts into in our lives. It\u0027s because we feel people are receiving more than just a free youtube video... our creative energy and all the love we invest. We feel this because when our videos connect to someone, we receive exactly this back in return and it\u0027s wonderful.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe appreciate you being here and considering joining our community... if you do not have the money to spare but still want to help that\u0027s perfectly ok too- you can share one of our videos, or subscribe to our Youtube page and come along for the journey. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is you guys who lift us up to spread our wings... and for that we will always be grateful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eLove and Light,\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eJuliana and Mark *\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBoho Beautiful\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
