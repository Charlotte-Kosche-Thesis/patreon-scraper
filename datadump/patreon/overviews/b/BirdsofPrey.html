    "summary": "The three of us (Tony, Phil, and Ken) each have a life-long fascination with all-things aviation. \u00a0Our bookcases are chock full of material, as is our hard drives, cell phones, and tablets. \u00a0We devour this information ravenously, and it\u0027s all homework for what we do with our spare time: work on \u003cem\u003eBirds of Prey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThat said, there is so much material that we get our hands on, and so many ideas that pop into our heads, a lot of these things will never fit into one of our themed products. \u00a0 Sometimes these \"sketches\" are refined into something useful. \u00a0Others get tossed in the file, perhaps never to be seen again. \u00a0And some of them are labors of love, specific to machines, events, and people that captivate us- our \"flavors of the month\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d like to change that. \u00a0And so every one to two months, we\u0027ll have an assortment of toys for you- one, two, or three. \u00a0Sometimes, there will only be one toy, but it\u0027ll be *big*, and worth the three-item release target. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey could be a new aircraft data card (ADC) and a box miniature. \u00a0A new scenario. \u00a0One of our ACM lessons (\u003cem\u003eFollies\u003c/em\u003e, we call them). \u00a0Maybe a new automated opponent (SOAR), or an expansion/playtest of an upcoming rules change or addition. \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdmittedly, some of these materials may not be up to \"production\" quality- you\u0027ll see how the alloy gets pounded into sheet aluminum. \u00a0Others won\u0027t work if they aren\u0027t- but again, they may never become available in a product in the future. \u00a0And in some instances these things need to be seen and abused in this state to become production- those \"future rules\", and such. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever it is, it\u0027ll be fun, and worth the small price we ask for the donation (between $5 and 10). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause we\u0027re not going to be in the crowdsourcing habit of \"overpromised and under-delivering\",\u00a0\u00a0we\u0027re going to make sure you know what\u0027s coming at least one full week before it drops, and you get charged. \u00a0This way, you can step out for a cycle if you choose, or, if you really want that third item, you can bump up your donation for that month, too (but again, please- keep it reasonable). We want you to be comfortable and have fun with these oddities. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow if you\u0027re here, you\u0027ve likely heard of our title \u003cem\u003eBirds of Prey: Air Combat in the Jet Age. \u00a0\u003c/em\u003eIf not, \u003cem\u003eBirds\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is wargame that uses real world physics, captured elegantly in a pair of tools called nomographs\u00a0to do all the scary aerodynamic math, and let you fly a modern day fighter jet against other players. \u00a0And nomographs aren\u0027t the only cool toy- perhaps the most stunning is the PHAD: a two-dimensional representation of the three dimensional world, which lets you maneuver your aircraft exactly as it would in real life. \u00a0This trio allows you to employ the specific performance capabilities of the type you\u0027re at the controls of against whatever opposition you choose to take. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver wished that you could take a flight simulator, throw out the keystrokes and the lack of inertia, and distill the art of ACM down to it\u0027s purest form? \u00a0That\u0027s what \u003cem\u003eBirds of Prey\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0does. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if the thought of that gives you geasels (if you know, you know), take a look at our website \u00a0(www.airbattle.com)- we think you\u0027ll like what you see. That, and keep watch on these spaces here."
