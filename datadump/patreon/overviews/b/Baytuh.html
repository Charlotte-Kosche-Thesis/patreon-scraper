Also to be on a more Intimate level with you all, Because Real Talk i don\u0027t have friends, like at all. Most people at my school that i talked were into stuff like partying and drinking ETC..... That stuff is boring (IMO) That\u0027s why It was hard finding those who had a deep passion of Video games like i do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt doesn\u0027t matter what tier you support me at just know it allows me to Create better content for you all, Pay for video games , Pay for rent and Eat. Like i said i don\u0027t have friends but family and i want you to be a part of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still remember the early days of being a YouTuber i had 200 Subs and got like 40 views per video\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m 44k Subscribers strong and still Growing, I started to stream over at Twitch and now Patreon,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOn behalf of ME, MYSELF AND I, THANK YOU!! for all of the Love and Support.\u003cbr\u003eWELCOME TO THE FAMILY\u00a0 :-D\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
