    "summary": "We\u0027re Bumfuzzle. Also knows as \"The Bums.\" I\u0027ve been blogging about our travels and lifestyle since 2003 when we first took off to sail around the world. There isn\u0027t a travel blog (\u003ca href=\"http://www.bumfuzzle.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebumfuzzle\u003c/a\u003e) out there that has been as consistent as us, for as long as us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve circled the globe by boat. Raced a vintage Porsche across the United States\u2014and won. Driven the Pan-American in a \u002758 VW bus. Had two babies in Mexico. Lived aboard and sailed all over Mexico. Traveled small around the U.S. and Mexico in an old 1966 Dodge Travco motorhome. Currently we are a family of four living in a 22 foot Airstream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur site produces hundreds of thousands of page views each month, yet we don\u0027t make a penny on this. We never capitalized on bumfuzzle.com because to do so on a blog requires selling yourself\u2014your site, your content\u2014to marketers. You become a shill, and you do so for chump change. We could never bring ourselves to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon gives us a better way. It lets us continue to produce content\u2014stories and photographs of the world we travel through\u2014and share it in a free, uncommercial way. Meanwhile, those who feel strongly about us, our travels, our lifestyle, our written word, and our photography, can donate in a way that lets both sides feel good about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA couple of things. Everyone will continue to get our unfiltered musings on the world, travel, children, boats, motorhomes and Airstreams. And everyone will get all of our best photography, watermark-free, in big beautiful format. Our goal is to take you with us on our travels through our pictures and our stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonate a little more and you\u0027ll get signed copies of our books, and postcards from the roads less traveled.\u003cbr\u003e"
