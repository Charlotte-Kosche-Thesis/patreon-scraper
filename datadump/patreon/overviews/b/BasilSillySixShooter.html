Yes, hire, by you the fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always been a fan of Patreon and supporting the creators you like, as I too give my dollar contributions to some handful of great people. However the real reason for this page is to give more power to the creative process to you guys, and more freedoms to explore topics for me. Content Creation is nothing if not a time sink and the issue with where entertainment sites are going, my content, moreover my topics are not always the most popular, yet many of you have shown interest in the ideas I put forth and even ask me to explore your own. That and while I try to deconstruct other\u0027s narratives I\u0027m\u00a0working on presenting my own. A creator and a critic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to keep adding to the medium, to keep exploring and finding new things to love, but to do that fully, I\u0027d wanna go full time with this line of work, and to do that with grace and consistency, I\u0027d rather leave that support in the hands of my fans."
