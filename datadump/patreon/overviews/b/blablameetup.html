We are Katya and Zhargal, the founders of Blabla Meetup. We love hanging out with all kinds of awesome people from all over the world whatever the language. We\u0027re also into learning foreign languages. That is why we came up with Blabla.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Blabla?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is a multilanguage speeking club in Novosibirsk, Russia. It takes place several times a week in different locations around the town. At a meetup, the tables are labeled with the names of languages and the guests speak those languages with the natives. Anyone can take part in Blabla whatever the age, nationality and job, AND it\u0027s totally free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe try our best to find new foreign guests in town, to find new locations for our meetups, new partners to work with. We also create new events for our members to have a good time. However, despite all these efforts, we can\u0027t dedicate enough time to this project as we\u0027re busy at our main work (plus two kids!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat brought us here\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only way for us to be able to give the most of our time to Blabla is to get financial support from our members. That\u0027s why we\u0027re here:) We truly appreciate all that help you\u0027re giving us and we\u0027ll be happy to return this favour in every possible way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee you at our meetups!\u003cbr\u003e"
