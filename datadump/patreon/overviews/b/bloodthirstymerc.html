I\u0027m a bit messy when it comes to this sort of thing at first, but have no fear; I\u0027ll get my bearings eventually.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eMerc, Merc, (Me)rc\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(36, 64, 97);\"\u003eFor those of you who are wondering \u0027what the hell is a BloodthirstyMerc?\u0027 well, it\u0027s a Deadpool inspired username that I came up with when I created my Tumblr. (That\u0027s the short answer anyway)\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a fanboy who writes all kinds of fanfiction for mainly comic book characters but dabbles in multiple fandoms across all kinds of media. I\u0027ve been writing fanfics since 2012 when I started out on Wattpad. When I really started focusing on my writing I discovered that it was exactly what I wanted to see myself doing with my life! \u003cbr\u003eI have written original works alongside my fics and plan to one day publish at the very least one book (but I won\u0027t complain if I can make it big like Stephen King). My dream is to become an author and it\u0027s something I try to work toward every day, even if I only write a couple hundred words.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy position\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(36, 64, 97);\"\u003eI\u0027m still relatively young and at the moment I am still living at home with my parents, despite my want to be free. It can be pretty harrowing especially since they\u0027re transphobic and my dad is pretty homophobic too. Not the best position for a pansexual transgender male to be in but I have nowhere else to go for the time being so I get by to the best of my ability. Which is the exact reason I turned to Patreon. What\u0027s better than earning money by writing fanfiction that will help in escaping a toxic home environment? Not much that I can think of at this current moment for it\u0027s all I want to be doing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGoals and plans!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(36, 64, 97);\"\u003eMy goals on Patreon are possibly a little intimidating at a first glance, but ultimately simple. I know that for a long while I most likely will not be moving out of home and living independently, however, I do have some awesome friends. They\u0027re going through uni because they have a better grip on life than me and can afford that sort of thing with the payment of unicorn tears I can only assume and so they can\u0027t pay for me, but they are living away from home and have offered for me to stay with them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoal number one is to be able to move in with them so that I can be away from my parents which will also mean I\u0027ll be able to be in a safer place which my mental health will benefit from and I\u0027ll have more time to write my heart out.\u003cbr\u003eGoal number two is saving up to eventually get out of their hair and stand on my own two feet in this world.\u003cbr\u003eGoal number three is to save up for hormone treatment and eventually my transition. It\u0027s a long and rough road but with your amazing support, I can get there :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this time I plan on posting one-shots fortnightly and major fic chapters weekly. But once I\u0027ve reached a comfortable spot financially I hope to be able to not only post ongoing fic chapters weekly but also give you guys weekly one-shots and work toward other fortnightly and monthly projects. I want to give so much for the support I get! \u003cbr\u003eSo please consider pledging; even a single dollar a month will push me toward being able to provide you guys more content rewards! With your help, my dream of being an author will slowly become a reality and I will never forget that. I will forever be grateful for every single Patron.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you guys so much, I hope that you enjoy the work I have for you and will continue to enjoy everything I have in store for you! I love every inch of your bodies for supporting me and my work :)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

No sugar-coating here. I\u0027ve decided to try out my luck on Patreon because I love writing and I\u0027ve been writing for free for nearly six years and I think it\u0027s time to try getting paid for what I love doing. Simple really. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny money I earn will go toward me moving out of my family home and in with my supportive friends who\u0027re going through uni and can\u0027t afford my ass or their own. And once that\u0027s out of the way all funds will be saved to go toward my transition. So yeah that\u0027s about it. Enjoy my page and thank you :)\u003cbr\u003e",
