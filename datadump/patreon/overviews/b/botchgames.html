First, host Craig is joined by his family to discuss the games they have been playing, and the the main segment of the show features Craig and two industry people (media types, designers, publishers, etc.) to have a mini-topic round up. All in all it\u0027s a great time with great people and we would love your support to make the show bigger and better! Thanks so much for taking the time to check out our project!"
