    "summary": "Welcome to the club --\u003ca href=\"http://www.brushstreetbaseball.club\"\u003e Brush Street Baseball Club\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwelve years ago, I couldn\u0027t find what I was looking for in Detroit Tigers coverage. Sure, you had the newspapers, and the beat writers provided you with plenty of quotes and a little analysis. You had a handful of blogs. More than you have today, even. But while each filled its own role, none of them covered the team quite like I was looking to read. So in April 2006, I made my own site, Mack Avenue Tigers, and I covered the team my own way. There were challenges, but fun times, too, and I always knew that it was mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn December of 2009, I gave that up to join SB Nation\u0027s group of blogs. It made good sense. Through its size, SB Nation had a lot of advantages. People often think of its sites first. Their bloggers received opportunities they wouldn\u0027t otherwise have. They had a deal so they could add photos to posts easy. The selling point is that you just have to concentrate on the writing, and they\u0027ll do the rest. The hardest part for me was giving up Mack Avenue Tigers, but I did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it turned out great. It was a good time in my life and led to opportunities I never expected. I edited a glossy magazine for the Maple Street Press in 2011 and brought in many of my friends and colleagues. A year later I joined SBNation.com, and a year after that took a full-time job there. Soon after I mentored young writers and editors and was one of several people who helped build the site it is today. In February of this year, that period ended for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, I would like to introduce a new Tigers site, Brush Street Baseball Club. The name is a nod back to Mack Avenue Tigers, while also being a glance toward what I want to build: a truly independent baseball site -- for us, by us. We\u0027re not going to be driven by some big bureaucracy making demands. We\u0027re not going to worry about making money off pageviews or advertisements. We don\u0027t even care what the team thinks. This is just for us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s going to look a little like some places I\u0027ve been in the past, and how could it not? The model that so many sites today grew out of my attempts to build the site I wanted to read. Now I want to build the site \u003cem\u003ewe\u003c/em\u003e want to hang out at.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it\u0027s not just limited to the stories and comments here. While stories and comments sections are important, over the past years I learned having a fun chat room to hang out in with friends was one of the best parts of the entire fan experience. So we\u0027re going to do that here too -- and anyone can join in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write \"we\" because you are a part of this. Your voice, your photos, your love of the team will be what makes this a success. Please help me build the community we always wanted but have never had.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to the club -- Brush Street Baseball Club. Please settle in and make yourself at home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003eKurt\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
