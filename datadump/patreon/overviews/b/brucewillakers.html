I have been creating funny content online for my entire adult life as my full time job. This patreon for the last few years has been the driving force that allows me to create fun and interactive content from streams, to URealms Live shows, and to fun animations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t believe in taking in any paid promotion of any kind. I think any time I spend telling you about this new website and bullshit promo codes just distracts and wastes your time. I think playing and trying to perform with games I know are bad because I\u0027m being paid to play them is lame for everyone involved. While I understand many creators are trying just to make ends meet in the end, my hope is that I can build up an audience willing to throw a couple dollars at me a month to keep making goofy videos and games that I never need to go back to relying on ad revenue or sponsorship.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for checking out my Patreon and potentially supporting me. Projects like URealms Live would not exist if it wasn\u0027t for support I have had over the years from fans. Thank you for allowing me to be a weird/cool digital bard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
