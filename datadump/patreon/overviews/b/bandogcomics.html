    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Scott! As of January 2018, I can officially say that I write comics because my very first mini comic, Saint Bernard, is finished and available for you to read right here for free (with artwork by the amazing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dayo3.art/\"\u003edayo3\u003c/a\u003e!) ! As the year goes on, I want to continue creating mini comics in various forms for you fine folks to enjoy for free digitally, but I\u0027m broke and art isn\u0027t free. I\u0027ve got a handful of other projects underway with some incredibly talented artists, but in order to continue making comics past this year I\u0027m hoping to gain some support from you fine folks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust here for the free comics? That\u0027s perfectly fine. I hope that you enjoy what we create, and if you like what you see consider sharing it with your friends, your enemies, or even complete strangers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThinking about becoming a patron? I\u0027d like to say THANK YOU in advance! Whenever a new project that\u0027s free to read is uploaded to the web, you\u0027ll be the first to know. I\u0027m also hoping to post some of the behind the scenes process art from my various co-creators when they have something to share. Right now there is only one Pledge Tier, the $1 pledge, but you can donate as much as you\u0027d like. In the future, I hope to add addition tiers when I have more things to give you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you want to help out, but don\u0027t want to become a patron, feel free to buy me a coffee:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ko-fi.com/bandogcomics\"\u003eko-fi.com/bandogcomics\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by my Patreon page, and for considering supporting my work!\u003cbr\u003e-You can follow my on IG here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bandogcomics/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebandogcomics\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Banner art by Kimi:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sun.vitamin/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/sun.vitamin/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
