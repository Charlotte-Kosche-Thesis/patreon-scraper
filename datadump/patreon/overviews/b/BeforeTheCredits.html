Since I was a kid I have enjoyed watching Movies and TV Shows. One of my earliest memories is being at my grandma\u0027s house looking through her VHS collection; she had all of the Disney Classics and probably the most distinctive VHS I remember is E.T. For those that don\u0027t know the original E.T. VHS had a green guard panel on it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMovies have always been an escape for me and as I have grown up I have fallen more in love with them. One day I would love to become a \u003cstrong\u003eWriter/Director\u003c/strong\u003e, I wrote my first screenplay with my brother. Him and I went for a long walk and created this outlandish story of two stoners stealing a vacuum cleaner. It was terrible but I had a blast doing it with him. Now years later I just helped finish up my first \u003cstrong\u003eShort Film\u003c/strong\u003e. It is currently in the editing phases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy favorite directors are Kubrick, Hitchcock and\u00a0Fincher.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI decided to make this channel because I was having these discussions with my friends anyways and thought \u003cstrong\u003e\"Why not let other people in as well?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JFAG2TC.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003eIt really depends on what kind of video I\u0027m putting out. Right now I do a few different kinds:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nVideo Essays:\u003c/strong\u003e This take the longest, I have created a huge list of ideas for episodes and every once in awhile I pick one and start writing a script for it. The script generally takes longer than I initially plan because once I start looking up content and reading I get lost in the rabbit hole. That turned my 5 minute Spider-Man Video Essay into a 15 minute Video Dissertation. My current editing style isn\u0027t the greatest but I am working out it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nCancelled Series:\u003c/strong\u003e This one is a lot like the \"Video Essay\" category, they are generally a lot easier to write right now because I have only written about well known shows that have a lot of information pertaining to their cancellations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe following are \u003cstrong\u003eNOT\u003c/strong\u003e paid for Patrons:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nReviews:\u003c/strong\u003e These are probably the most fun, I get to sit down, watch a movie, and let everyone know what I thought and how I felt about it. They don\u0027t take any script but in the future I plan to take notes and create talking points. Some of these episodes may be more along the lines of a podcast style with a few of my friends in them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nRants:\u003c/strong\u003e These will always be the easiest because they are pretty much just me complaining about something I didn\u0027t like. Which happens a lot when it comes to cinema.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/r1fM4f5.jpg\"\u003e"
