With a viable revenue stream, a lot of the more mundane jobs could outsourced, giving me more time to write, record and create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what will I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCommercial success has never been a driving force in my life but I have always tried to create work which is considered and genuine.\u00a0 By \nbecoming my patron, not only will you give me the freedom \nto focus on my work, you\u0027ll also be encouraging me to refine and explore my craft - trying, as always, to do something unique and unusual.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith support, you will receive my thanks and acknowledgement, get opportunities to talk with me and suggest/discuss my work - as well as receive exclusive updates, previews, demos and unreleased material.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEither way, thank you for taking the time to stop by and even if you can\u0027t pledge, I hope you enjoy some of the things I create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease spread the word.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBen x\u003cbr\u003e"
