My first R/C was purchased at a local pawn shop. The salesman took one look at the smile and excitement on my face and in my eyes, quoted me a good price, and I was off and running. The first year was alot of trial and error, then I discovered \"RC SPARKS.COM\". Those video inspired me tremendously. A few years later I decided to start my own channel, \u0027BlackSmithRC\", and the rest is history.\u003cbr\u003eGrowing in subscribers, getting to know other R/C enthustiasts, and learning from them has made me want to continue to reach others around the globe.\u003cbr\u003eIf you feel that I\u0027ve inspired and enlightened you, your support would be much appreciated.\u003cbr\u003egoogle-site-verification: google2c5cfeec8857e16b.html",
