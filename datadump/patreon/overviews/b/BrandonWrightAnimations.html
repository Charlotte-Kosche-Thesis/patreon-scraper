At lteast not yet. I may have rewards specific to the amount of money donated in the future. I kept thinking about different rewards for the different amounts of money but the more I thought about it, the more I realized working on the different rewards would actually take away from the actual Episodes and films that I\u0027m trying to release faster in the first place. So in time I will continue to think about how to offer rewards that don\u0027t slow down the process that I am comfortable with.\u00a0But for now I just want to make it clear that all money you donate will be used to get better equipment and to make sure I can release the best animation possible more quickly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you\u0027re able to give what money you can, I promise I will work my hardest to make sure I give you an even better film than I could before.
