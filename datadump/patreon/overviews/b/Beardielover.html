    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIMPORTANT NOTE: Because of multiple people exploiting the fact that Patreon does not have upfront payments for most creators, patreons will not recieve any rewards until their first payment has gone through.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHello, I am Beardielover! As you can probably tell I love Bearded Dragons. But that\u0027s not all! I program modifications for the popular game Minecraft! My primary mod is a WWII-Themed modification called \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eCall to Battle\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. Check it out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2725045-call-to-battle-the-wwii-mod\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/phNWnDk.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow did it all start?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eAbout 4 years ago, I was playing some minecraft mods, and thought \"Boy, I wish I could make these!\" When I wish I can do something, I usually attempt to do it! Now sadly to say my first attempt failed. I couldn\u0027t get a custom mob to render, so for the most part\u00a0\u003cem\u003eI gave up\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut not forever! I still messed around with very simple things from time to time, such as items.A couple months later, I decided I was a little older, maybe a bit wiser, so I took a crack at rendering mobs again. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI realized the problem. I didn\u0027t know how to program! I was just copy-pasting code from random tutorials on the internet! I then decided to start learning, one of the best decisions I ever made! I am now fluent in \u003cem\u003eJava, HTML, CSS, Javascript Ruby, \u003c/em\u003eand\u003cem\u003e C#. \u003c/em\u003eBack to the modding story, though.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI went back and tried to render a mob. Success! I just rendered my first mob, which would later turn out to be the namesake of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/defender-mod-version-10/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Defender Mod\u003c/a\u003e. It was my first mod I ever released, my previous ones being lost in time. They weren\u0027t very noteworthy, though. After that, I tried to make a few more mods that were completely random and weird. It\u0027s actually rather humorous, so I plan to make a video of it since I still have existing files of it. That\u0027s how my modding experience began! Scroll down a bit for the story of Call to Battle!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did you start this Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI started this patreon on recommendation of a member of my community. Once I looked into it, I was excited and realized it would be a great way to involve the members of my community further in the development of my mod Call to Battle, as well as my other mods. I can\u0027t wait to see what we accomplish together! My first goal is to set up an official server!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow do Patrons help you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI make my mods for fun, particularly Call to Battle! Even if nobody donated, I would continue to work on them for the enjoyment I get out of it! As Patrons, you not only provide motivation to work harder, but provide funds needed to improve my workflow! This means more content to you at a faster rate!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Road to Call to Battle\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI feel my main mod Call to Battle deserves a section dedicated to it\u0027s unique story.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nOne day during Summer, I said to my Best Friend, \"Hey Nano, let\u0027s make a gun mod\". \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt the time I had no knowledge of guns whatsoever so I asked him what the first gun should be. He said, \"Uhhhh M9?\" So I spend the next few days making a M9 Model, making it shoot, reload, etc. Needless to say, it was a very blocky model, had a horrible texture, and it\u0027s gameplay was terrible. Summer ended, and Nano was back to school(I\u0027m homeschooled), so I kinda stopped working on it since it was \"our\" mod and he was rarely available(Really I was the only one who knew how to program, but he was my source of.... gun..... information? Or rather, source of guns in COD xD).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n I then started reading the Ranger\u0027s Apprentice series and enjoyed it, so it became my main mod for about a year until I grew out of the book series. My family took a trip to see our Great Grandparents that year. My Great Grandpa started talking about his experiences in WWII, including a story about how he attempted to trade one of his men his heavy \u003cem\u003eThompson M1A1\u003c/em\u003e for a \u003cem\u003eM1 Garand\u003c/em\u003e. His commanding officer wouldn\u0027t allow it, though. I went home fascinated with WWII.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/hhY4KgN.jpg\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nUpon arriving home, I remembered he had written a book and gave a copy to each family member. I started reading it, with much more interest than when I first received it at 10 years old. If you want a copy you are out of luck unfortunately, it\u0027s not published, just a family book.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started playing the Flan\u0027s WW2 content pack with my friend. Years ago I had found it rather fun, now I had heavy disatisfaction. Model quality of my first gun mod, ADS but no real ironsights.(Those two specific issues have been changed since then) No hands, no headshot detection, and many other complaints led me to say, \"Hey, I\u0027m a modder. I know my own abilities, I do have the power to make a mod that fills my WWII needs!\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow I\u0027m not dissing Flan\u0027s(\u003cem\u003eWell I kinda was in real life at the time to my friends..... which was wrong of me....\u003c/em\u003e), Prototype Theta has made vehicle physics for Flan\u0027s Mod in recent times that I could never hope to compete with. But Flans Mod\u0027s main goal was always meant to be a vehicle mod, just as my goal is to fulfill Infantry as much as possible in my mod. Most people would have ignored all the things I complained to my friends about. But my passion for World War II was drawn from real life, rather than COD.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI got to work. I made a Thompson as the first weapon, since it was my Great Grandfather\u0027s primary weapon during World War II. It was rather blocky, but a major improvement over the models I was making a couple years before that. And \u003cem\u003eit actually had ironsights and hands in first person\u003c/em\u003e. So it was good enough for me. Bullet physics were horrid, but they had headshot detection, and a couple weeks later, hit detection for each section of the body. I then added a Colt M1911A1, my Grandfather\u0027s Primary during World War II. Also blocky, yet like the Thompson had ironsights and hands in first person. Oh and a animation for the slide going back. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA couple models later and I start thinking. What is limiting my modeling ability? It\u0027s the lack of float values! So I made my own version of Minecrafts rendering system to accommodate float values.\u00a0For a while, I was making models in Techne and adding float values to the model pieces for detail post creation. I realized Techne wasn\u0027t gonna be good enough for me anymore and made my own modeling program, that I still use to this day.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZGGRGYC.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor my 16th Birthday I asked for my first Airsoft gun, an MP40, because it was cheaper than a Thompson. It is now gray with brown on the lower reciever, and sanded a bit to imitate wear. Of course, I used it as a reference for the MP40 model in the mod, and in my opinion, it is the best pre-vertex positioning update model. I haven\u0027t updated it\u0027s model to the quality of the current models, but it\u0027s already pretty close without vertex positioning. I feel having a real life model helped. Since then I have added a Thompson M1A1 and Colt 1911 to my small airsoft collection, which models are reflected in game.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNeedless to say, real life experiences influenced the mod greatly, and still influences it to this day. I surpassed the level of ability I thought I was capable of when I first started the mod, surprising me and my friends. I believe as time goes on, hopefully my skill win increase further. I feel there\u0027s always room for improvement. Thank you for reading!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3srRdoA.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOh and my profile picture? That\u0027s me dressed as my Great Grandfather. Most of it is re-pro, but the M1943 Field Jacket is the real deal. It was given to me by Corporal Ritchie of the 16th Armored Division, my Grandfather.(Was in a Cavalry Squadron so his squad had a Jeep). I am honored to wear his jacket, and thankful that I still have the chance to talk to him to this day! God bless America!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
