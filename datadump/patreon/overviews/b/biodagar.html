But there\u0027s more than one.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey both deal in some way with capital punishment in Australia. \u003cem\u003eUltimatum\u003c/em\u003e is about the battle over who controls society: The government, or the media? It tells a little-told story involved in the very famous Ronald Ryan case. And \u003cem\u003eThe last man sentenced to death\u003c/em\u003e is a portrait of one of the last men sentenced to death in the state of Victoria after committing a horrific crime (he was released and eventually suicided). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth films are based on real events, and both tell stories that have fallen out of common knowledge. As a storyteller, one with a social conscience, and one with a penchant for a curly story, I feel called to tell both of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe story I\u0027m writing right now \u003c/strong\u003eis provisionally titled \u003cem\u003eUltimatum\u003c/em\u003e. The second one requires deep research, and much more time (and funding).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I\u0027ll be able to complete both of them much more quickly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThroughout 2018 I\u0027m going to be posting here at least once per week\u003c/strong\u003e. This is because I\u0027m giving more of myself to my creative output. I don\u0027t know what it will yield, but right now I\u0027m excited for the possibilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFollow me everywhere else too :)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find me in a bunch of other places too.

But creatively I\u0027m pushing myself to shift into fiction. That push has resulted in a rediscovery of poetic form, because it\u0027s in that shape that feelings can surface more easily. Brevity is more important, and so leaving out fluff is critical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGiven I work as a writer professionally, creativity is - for me - professional development. Seeing it in this context means that I take it more seriously and devote more time to it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eJoin me on my journey... and you can read my regular blog at http://biodagar.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
