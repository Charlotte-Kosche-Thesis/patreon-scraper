    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eWAR: The Afterparty \u003c/em\u003eis a round-the-world tour through countries that have received American military forces in the pursuit of freedom, democracy, justice, and the free flow of commerce. In Southeast Asia, the Greater Middle East, the Balkans and Central America, I recorded oral histories from political and religious leaders, writers, teachers, mothers and combatants who witnessed history from the other end of the gun barrel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo we accomplish in war what we say we will? After the party is over, what are war\u2019s real effects? \u003cbr\u003eThis is the story of the Afterparty, in the words of those uniquely able to make an assessment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe $10,000 travel budget was funded by 62 Kickstarter backers; at the time, it was the most popular print journalism project on that platform.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe book was uploaded April 22, 2016, the day before I pesented it on a panel discussion on war, Orwell and colonialism during the TriBeCa Fim Festival in New York City. A week later, I launched the Kindle version.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the months following the book\u0027s publication, I will post photos of the people and places I encountered, along with chapter excerpts, interviews and unpublished bonus content. As the U.S. presidential election approaches, I will take the candidates\u0027 pronouncements and review them in light of the learnings of the Afterparty journey. My travels ended in Southeast Asia, where I chose to stay, first in Cambodia and now in a small beach house on Koh Phangan, Thailand. In the fall, I will return to the states and travel corss country with an election edition of the book, with photos and bonus content, and promote the book to newspapers, bloggers, radio and Tv stations, world affairs organizations, classrooms and bookstores.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support is needed. I will post a lot of free content here and one weekly paid post. By pledging $1 or $2 per week, you can have access to a rich growing library of content and fund the promotion of the book and its findings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring my travels, I stopped by the Abu Dhabi Media Summit and met NY Times prez Mark Thompson, who told me two things. One, that the traditional ecosystem for journalism and journalism jobs is collapsing but, two, that there has never been more opportunity for new, independent forms of content creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon, you decide the scale and limits of your patronage. Want to limit your pledge to a buck a week? A buck a month? Want to pull out before the money is due at the end of the month? You are in complete control.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to know more? Follow me at facebook.com/brian.k.gruber or on Twitter @thegrube. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for listening. Now, enjoy the expanded Afterparty experience....make a pledge!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
