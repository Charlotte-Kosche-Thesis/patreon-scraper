I literally do this everyday, more often anything else, and I would love to continue to do so. \u00a0Patreon seems like a good place to start to gather some support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what does Patreon do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell it allows you to support an artists and other media creators through donations, helping them to keep doing what they love to do. \u00a0In return, you get to see what you love to see them do! \u00a0No losing side here. \u00a0You get to choose how ever much you want to donate, which is billed monthly, and I can use it to pay bills, food and other essentials so I can instead focus full time on artwork. \u00a0It doesn\u0027t matter how much you donate, $1 is just as important as $10.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support you then?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTaking the worry of life\u0027s problems off my shoulders will allow me to draw more and more. \u00a0I\u0027ll be able to take on larger projects, livestream more often and interact with my fans. \u00a0As of now I can\u0027t offer too much in way of perks and rewards, so its up to how you feel about donating to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t feel like donating monthly but still feel like supporting? Well that\u0027s alright too, because I regularly take on commissions. Note me on dA and I\u0027ll see what I can do for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoes this mean there will be exclusive content on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo give something back to the patrons, yes, there will be exclusive content posted here. \u00a0Depending on the image, altered content may be posted on dA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat seems to cover the basics, if you have any other questions, feel free to note me on dA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://blazbaros.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://blazbaros.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
