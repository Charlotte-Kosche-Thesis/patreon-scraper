Their work is a\nfusion of the same techniques perfected by the imprisoned Renaissance masters of Murano, Italy,\nwith nods to comic books, cartoons, candy and pop culture.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUnder the studio name Bling Squared, their artisan\npieces, usually between 1 and 12 centimetres (.33 to 3 inches) in height, reside somewhere\nbetween toys and fine sculpture. Each stroke of brilliant colour is actually melted\nglass, not paint, resulting in an artifact of whimsy that will last for\ncenturies.  The alchemy of stained glass\nrods liquifying in the heat of an oxy-propane torch lends\neach piece a vitality and timelessness. Influenced by the Japanese phenomenon\nof collectible vinyl desk toys, the couple\u0027s response is the permanence and\nvibrancy of glass as both material and statement.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe genre of their work requires an exotic vocabulary:\nanime, manga, kawaii (\"adorable\"), chibi (\"short\nperson\")  \u2013  a world of giant robots, talking animals and\ncat-eared schoolgirls. Their brightly- coloured, impactful figurines of\nplayful, chubby characters have become increasingly varied as their skills as\nsculptors evolve.  Here are owls, baby dragons,\nfoxes, and Yeti alongside sloths, narwhals and red pandas. Their work has\nappeared in Ayden Gallery in Vancouver and the Waterfront Gallery on Salt\nSpring Island, as well as many comic and entertainment expositions across North America such as the New York Comicon and Anime Expo in LA.  Supporting themselves by their art alone,\nthey work from their home studio \u2013 torch, kiln, glass and all \u2013 while raising\ntwo small and active daughters.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCollectors and supporters of the work respond with\ninstant happiness evoked by these charming pieces. In the context of \"Low\nBrow\" pop art, the figurines are timely, joyous, accessible, and\nirresistibly tactile.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading, guys!
