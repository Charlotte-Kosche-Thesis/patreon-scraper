    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"https://yuzu-emu.org/\"\u003eyuzu\u003c/a\u003e is a work-in-progress Nintendo Switch emulator. yuzu is an open-source project, licensed under the GPLv2 (or any later version). yuzu has been designed with portability in mind, with builds available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. The project was started in spring of 2017 by \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/bunnei\"\u003ebunnei\u003c/a\u003e, one of the original authors of the popular \u003ca href=\"https://citra-emu.org/\"\u003eCitra 3DS emulator\u003c/a\u003e, to experiment with and research the Nintendo Switch. Due to the similarities between Switch and 3DS, yuzu was developed as a fork of Citra. This means that it uses the same project architecture, and both emulators benefit from shared improvements. During the early months of development, work was done in private, and progress was slow. However, as Switch reverse-engineering and homebrew development became popular, work on yuzu began to take off as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn January of 2018, the yuzu team was formed out of several Citra developers, and the decision was made to release the project publicly. As an emulator, yuzu is in its infancy, and is only currently useful for Switch reverse-engineering and homebrew development.\u003cbr\u003e"
