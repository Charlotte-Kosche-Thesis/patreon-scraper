    "summary": "Yo!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU for checking out my Patreon page! I know we all have plenty of important things to do with our free time, including watching cat videos and ACTUAL netflix and chilling. \u00a0So I truly appreciate that you are spending a few minutes checking out my story and what I\u0027m up to. You rock!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Adrielle Bow Belle. Bow Belle or just \u0027Belle,\u0027 for short. I also go by bowbellamochedda in smaller circles, usually amongst my 5 year old crew. I like to sing, cook/eat fattening foods, and create magic through performance...whether that be live shows or in youtube videos and blogs. I also love pretty unicorn colored things, and changing my hair to outrageous styles on whims. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI released my debut EP, MiSFiT, in June of 2017. I\u0027m trying to make music and teaching music and dance and acting to kids, my main gig. A bunch of people supported my Kickstarter (THANK YOU!!) that helped me to get that first album off the ground...and I\u0027m really excited to finally be writing and recording my own songs. I\u0027m literally can\u0027ting because it\u0027s a truly a dream come true, and I owe all of you guys for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I ended up having to quit my soul sucking boss (I actually liked the \u0027job\u0027 part, but the boss was unbearable) right after I got all my stuff off the ground. I have a new survival gig and all that...but I don\u0027t want to lose momentum and get unfocused because all the billz billz billz don\u0027t always leave room for art, as I\u0027m sure you can all relate to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have so much I want to share with you guys and I\u0027m so excited to be able to share my story with all of you, too. I made it through a lot of junk in this crazy life, and I\u0027m hoping that my sharing that journey will help some youngn\u0027s and oldn\u0027s and everyone in between, get through their own journeys a little easier. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love making people laugh and making people cry (healing tears, of course). I do it best through music and putting on shows...but I need something consistent to be able to produce these things consistently. And that is going to take a regular budget of dollars and cents, that is specifically for \u0027creating cool junk.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I know it\u0027s a BIG commitment. For serious. A kickstarter is a one-time thing, and a patreon is like a... I believe-in-you-enough-to-add-you-to-my-list-of-already-piled-high-monthly-bills, thing. Which Is why my rewards tier starts at 1 dollar, cuz like. ANY support is supportive and that support helps me to keep pushing for a dream that I can\u0027t live without :-) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have a major label, and I don\u0027t really want one. I feel like I have important junk to say, and I want to say it without bias or gimmicks that I don\u0027t actually dig, ya know? So I hope you can help me find my audience without all that, and we can make magic happen and create some beautiful art, together. If you wanna join the #bowbellemovement, and be a patron-I have all kinds of little goodies and pre-released stuff I will share with you, as it\u0027s released and I move on up the ladder from part-time recording artist to FULL TIME, which I hope can happen this year. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere may be some months where the content is more sporadic-because I\u0027m working on a huge project like a music video or a show-but I\u0027ll keep you informed as those things happen :-) Thank you for taking the time to read my ramblings, and thank you for being a part of this crazy adventure. I love you guys like I love bows...and if you know anything about me at all, that\u0027s a pretty damn big statement.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eXOXO\u003cbr\u003eBowBelle\u003cbr\u003e"

I trained at a conservatory, but threw most of that out the window when I decided to abandon musical theater and go for my true dream: POP. STARDOM. And changing the world with song and dance. Music really did help me to find my Voice. I used to be mad shy and intimidated by everything. My mom was crazy abusive and my childhood pretty much sucked because of it. I ended up in Foster care, and bad things happened to me there, too. I became a teenage runaway at 17. I lived in shelters and crashed on friend\u0027s couches, until I got a bomb social worker who helped me get into a school in New York, and move across the country with nothing but a bag full of leotards and a dream. It\u0027s been working out pretty well, ever since. Become a patron to help me at more bowtiful goodness to the world :-)",
