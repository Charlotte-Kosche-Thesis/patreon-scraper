If you don\u0027t already know, my name\u0027s Michael and I love creating this podcast for those people who enjoy the lewd, crude, licentious, and humorous facts throughout history that were too risqu\u00e9 to learn about during traditional school. One of the great things about the podcast is the fact that there are no advertisements. That sort of thing is only possible if people (Like you!) become a patron and allow me to continue to produce episodes without having to interrupt the episode to talk about the newest mattress, job recruiting, or shipping service. For those of you who are already supporting the podcast, thank you so much! And if you\u0027re not yet a patron, please consider becoming one if you like the content I\u0027m creating and, like me, can\u0027t stand the constant advertising that you usually hear on most other podcasts."
