I\u2019m a photographer and a Chinese martial and internal arts practitioner. I share my art by teaching qigong, taiji quan, and gongfu. I offer in-person classes and workshops, in addition to the Kwan Yin Lesson Films.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of you have found me through the Everyday Tai Chi Films, a collection of practice pieces filmed in serene and beautiful landscapes\u2014 one movie per day, one-minute or less in length\u2014 in documentation of my daily personal practice. These can be found on Instagram or Facebook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also write a bi-weekly online publication called \u003cem\u003eThe Listening Seed\u003c/em\u003e, which centers around ways you can use the wisdom of the earth and the oracle that is the body to establish a deeper connection with You. About once a month I offer a free Lesson Film, complete with narration and on-screen notes, which you can follow along in qigong, taiji, or gongfu form at home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I\u2019m working on creating a monthly Lesson Film Subscription Series, which will be initially offered as Pay-What-You-Like. In these longer, more in-depth Lesson Films, we\u2019ll go over different forms of qigong, taiji, and possibly a little gongfu, to help you build a home practice, or to simply follow along as they are published.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo share my art with you takes dedication and discipline, as well as time, energy, and money. I\u2019m hoping to continue making this work, and I am thrilled to use this platform as a way for you to gain access to more of what I have to offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a deep bow,\u003cbr\u003e\nBrea\u003cbr\u003e"
