    "summary": "Hi! Thanks for coming to my Patreon page :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create videos on engineering - not the kind that you find on TV (\u003cem\u003eWorld\u0027s most impressive engineering feats!\u003c/em\u003e) - but the kind that provides useful knowledge for people looking to enter the engineering field or are just looking to brush up on their skills. Most of my videos cover topics in control system theory (hence the channel name), but I also like to talk about robotics and space systems too. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from videos, I\u0027m writing a book called \"The Fundamentals of Control Theory\". \u00a0You can get the work-in-progress version of the book here by supporting my channel. \u00a0Here is the latest version: \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/fundamentals-of-13367470\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/posts/fundamentals-of-133...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hate expensive text books, therefore, I\u0027m releasing the book under a Creative Commons license so that even if you don\u0027t want to support me (or don\u0027t have the money to), you can always get the book for free from a friend who is a supporter (go in on it together!) or some other source. The important thing is that the content I create can help as many people as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor my supporters (per creation), a creation is a \u003cem\u003eControl System Lecture\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0video or a section update to my book \u003cem\u003eThe Fundamentals of Control Theory\u003c/em\u003e. \u00a0At the moment I would love to produce one creation per month, but realistically, it\u0027s more like every 2 or 3 months. \u00a0Of course, that would all change if I meet my 2nd goal! I don\u0027t charge for announcements, blog type videos, or book releases that are just typo fixes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease review and understand your contributions. \u00a0I have a little write up here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/please-review-13752559\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/posts/please-review-13752...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like creating content that everyone can access for free. \u00a0Your support means so much to me because it allows me to be able to get the equipment I need and one day have the financial freedom to make this my full-time job. \u00a0Cheers!"
