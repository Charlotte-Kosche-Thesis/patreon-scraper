Contrary to popular belief I am not related to Nev the Bear from Smile.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnyway, I make content on youtube from a Socialist perspective. I\u0027m largely non-sectarian and have large interest in Communism and Communalism.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOn the side I am also building up my Graphic Design skills.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eWHAT DO I DO?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nIn the past I used to make standard Vlog style videos responding to Pro-Capitalist youtubers, but over the past year I\u0027ve changed my style to more informative/humorous content.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003eThis involves videos that are much more editing intensive, and also spread to a wider audience as opposed to speaking the same points over and over again, I also put more research time into my projects.\u003cbr\u003eThis ranges from: Humorous, hyperbolic response videos, historical videos, or informational content surrounding Social Issues.\u003cbr\u003e\nI try to make videos at least twice a month, though sometimes I can come down with a case of Capitalism and am not in a great mood to make them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nI have been very cautious towards getting a Patreon, mainly because have always felt my content was not good enough, however more recently I\u0027ve become unemployed, and I feel my content is now at a point where I feel comfortable with the production quality I am pushing out.\u003cbr\u003eMy larger videos take approximately 4-7 hours to edit every minute of the project, which is very time consuming and doesn\u0027t allow me to get out much :(\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eWHAT WILL SUPPORT GO TOWARDS?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support will help me finance myself whilst I am out of work, and if possible buy extra equipment to improve my video projects further. But it will also help me to apply more Socialistic-esc values to those who help me, by paying them when I can. This includes... Thumbnails, Animations, Music etc.\n\u003cbr\u003eI will only be monetising videos that I deem to be of high quality, this will not include short projects, updates, or very basic response videos.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
