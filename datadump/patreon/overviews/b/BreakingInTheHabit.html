We live in an ever-growing secular culture in which many children are being raised without a knowledge of Jesus Christ and even more are leaving the Church by their teenage years. What has been passed down for two thousand years\u2014a community of faith bound together by a common experience of the divine to pray, work, and live as a source of strength and a symbol of the heavenly kingdom yet to come\u2014is fading away without serious consideration. \u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe internet is the new missionary frontier for evangelists. The mission of \n\t\u003cem\u003eBreaking In The Habit\u003c/em\u003e is to evangelize and catechize in the Franciscan spirit in order to promote faith, energize communities, inspire active involvement, and encourage vocations to consecrated life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(94, 50, 26);\"\u003eWhat does this ministry need money for?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eUpdating equipment: Up until now, everything has been produced with entry-level consumer equipment. While this has satisfied the needs of the mission in the past, the rapidly changing landscape of technology will soon render past equipment obsolete. With aspirations of improved image quality and a look to the future, I need to invest in professional equipment, namely, a cinema camera.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eHiring staff: For two years, \u003cem\u003eBreaking In The Habit\u003c/em\u003e has been entirely run by one person. Conception, writing, directing, performing, filming, editing, and promotion all fell on one person. For the mission to grow, professionals need to be brought in to improve both the quality and quantity of production. With someone to serve as video editor and social media consultant, I will have more time to spend working on developing content, and will be able to produce more than 50 videos in one year.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAdvertising: Ultimately, the goal of Breaking In The Habit is to spread the Gospel, and so there needs to be a stronger effort to spread its works. For the first time, a significant budget will be allocated to pay for ad time on social media platforms like YouTube and Facebook, as well as Catholic news outlets.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(94, 50, 26);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLooking to make a one-time gift?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile Patreon offers a convenient and integrated solution to monthly online giving, some would prefer to make a one-time donation.
