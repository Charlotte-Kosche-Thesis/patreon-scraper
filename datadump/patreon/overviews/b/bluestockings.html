I mean, I say I\u0027m Blue of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bluestockings.ca\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBluestockings\u003c/a\u003e, but who the hell is that, right? I\u0027m Kate Bullock, a Toronto local and big fan of the gaming world. I\u0027ve playing table-top RPGs since I was 14 (a long time ago now) and been GMing them for just as long. I started when my mom got me the Orange Box for 3.0 when I was in 9th Grade and reverted to 2nd Edition D\u0026amp;D from there. A few years later I sunk my teeth into Deliria and CyberGeneration and have never really looked back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy gaming career has moved from GM to player to convention GM to convention volunteer to freelance writer to editing to convention organizer and finally it\u0027s finding its way to game designer. I mean, I\u0027ve always wanted to design, but I haven\u0027t really done it. So I\u0027m working on a game, and no, it\u0027s not on the blog, but maybe one day. I\u0027ve helped other folks with their games, and I\u0027ve taken great pride in that, even if it was just play-testing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m here to find support for the non-game design stuff I do. That means, the blog I write, Bluestockings. Or Blue\u0027s Blog. On the blog I talk about issues in the gaming community, the strife of running conventions, the fear of writing your own game, reviews of other people\u0027s games, and often times a round up of some of the stuff I\u0027m playing. Mostly it\u0027s used to discuss things I think should be discussed in gaming, like love, family, sex, consent, and making space for minorities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this Patreon, I\u0027m asking for a little help with all the time I spend facilitating and working a payless job by asking for support with the blog. I post about two to four times a month, depending on what\u0027s going on, and every little bit helps!\u003cbr\u003e"
