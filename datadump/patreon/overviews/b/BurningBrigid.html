Diverse stories.\u003c/h4\u003eBurning Brigid Media is a Chicago-based production company dedicated to creating narratives that normalize stories about the traditionally marginalized: \nwomen, minority, and LGBT characters presented as people rather than \ngenres.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSynesthesia Theatre\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOur current project is an audio drama anthology podcast called Synesthesia Theatre. Each season presents a new science fiction, fantasy, or horror story performed by a full cast of talented local Chicago actors. Our first season, \u003cem\u003eIron Horses Can\u0027t Be Broken\u003c/em\u003e was a steampunk thriller. Our second, \u003cem\u003eCold Reboot\u003c/em\u003e, was a cyberpunk thriller. We are in pre-production for a third season.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support us?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSynesthesia Theatre is provided free,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/what-am-i-paying-8655999\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebut it certainly isn\u0027t free to produce\u003c/a\u003e. Everyone involved has day jobs, and everyone has to continually make choices between having time to create and having money for rent, bills, and food. And while we love producing this podcast, we do end up having to make hard choices about how much we can afford to invest in its production, in both money and time. We also believe that our professional, hard-working talent deserve to get paid for their labor, just like any other kind of job. A key aspect of our mission is finding a way to make this happen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince you\u0027re here, we suspect you feel the same way. In order to continue creating Synesthesia Theatre, we need your help in the form of pledges to help pay for its production. For as little as one dollar per month, you can help us afford to keep creating high-quality audio entertainment, and earn some fun just-for-Patrons perks along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please, if you like us and what we\u0027re doing, support us by clicking the \"become a patron\" button over on the top left.
