And it adds up very quickly. In the last month, I\u0027ve run up over $100 in charges. I know there are a lot more lawsuits in there I want to read and cover, but I have to take a break for fear of not being able to pay my bill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour donation will cover my PACER bill and help me continue to break these important stories taking place behind bars.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
