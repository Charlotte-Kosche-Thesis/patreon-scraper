The\u00a0team is currently filming the episodes for the\u00a0Promo Season.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur team believes that talented and\u00a0passionate people are all around us and that\u00a0every single person on this planet is talented\u00a0in one way or another. But because of the way\u00a0some of us were raised and taught, not all of us\u00a0know that they can use their talents and passions\u00a0to make the world a better place by helping and\u00a0inspiring others. How many greatly talented\u00a0people live their lives right now unhappy and\u00a0unrealized just going with the flow and not even\u00a0knowing how much of a difference they could\u00a0make by actually using their talents?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are, however, quite a few people who\u00a0are brave enough to go after their passions.\u00a0These people believe in themselves, their\u00a0talents, and abilities and go out there and act,\u00a0changing the world by their passion. These are\u00a0the people who know how to be happy and can\u00a0teach and inspire the rest of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show \u201cBrave \u0026amp; Passionate\u201d gives us all a\u00a0chance to meet these amazing people and learn\u003cbr\u003e\nabout their journey to success and how all of us\u00a0can do it too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe have collected applications with many\u00a0incredible stories and chose 22 most inspiring\u00a0people. These brave individuals truly believe in\u00a0themselves and can\u2019t wait to share their passion\u00a0with the world. Each episode will present one\u00a0person\u2019s path to success. \u201cBrave \u0026amp; Passionate\u201d\u00a0is ultimately a show that delivers inspiration and\u00a0promotes outstanding successful stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOUR GOAL\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe want to change the world in small steps, one episode at a time by helping people find their inspiration and believe stronger in their talents and abilities. There are just too many amazing\u00a0individuals in this world that nobody even knows about. We\u2019re absolutely  honored to share and tell\u00a0their stories, while encouraging others to fully embrace their passions. We want to see more people\u00a0believe in themselves, be inspired and go pursue their passions because we believe that this is a way\u00a0to find one\u2019s happiness and bring happiness to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW CAN YOU HELP?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can\u0027t do this without you! We now know that the best way to share these incredible stories is with the support of our fans. We are tremendously grateful to everyone who helped us produce our first few episodes to share these inspiring stories with the world. Now we\u2019re giving everyone the chance to actually help produce this show an inspire millions of people. Together we can do this! I\u2019m honored that so many of you have been part of this so far and you\u2019ve allowed me and my incredible team to create something that we all can be proud of. And this is just the beginning. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a Patron means making a monthly contribution towards the show. Think of it like your Netflix subscription, only the content is free and you get rewarded for your level of contribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to be a part of this show and contribute to inspiring more people around the globe (and maybe even help change someone\u0027s life...), sign up on Patreon right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing a show is a complicated process, and we want to be able to dedicate as much time and resources as needed to making it. On the technical side, we want to be able to deliver a better quality imagery to our audience with higher end cameras and equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe meet amazingly talented and inspiring people who live all over the world, but now we\u0027re only able to work locally because we don\u0027t a travel budget. We\u0027re just at the beginning of our journey, and can be a part of it by supporting us. We want to be able to show the geographical diversity and prove that no matter where you live, you can find a way to live your passion and inspire others. We plan on starting with the U.S. first, and then travel to other counties as we grow. It\u0027s going to be incredibly fun and exciting to be able to show amazing people with their stories all around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe know that some of you will be able to give a lot, some of you just a little, and some of you right in the middle. For us, every dollar counts to keep Brave \u0026amp; Passionate going and keep sharing great stories with our audience. We appreciate all of you no matter how much you\u0027re able to contribute because you make this all possible!\u003cbr\u003e"
