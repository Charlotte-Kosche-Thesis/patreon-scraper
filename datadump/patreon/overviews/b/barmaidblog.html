    "summary": "My name is Debra!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting in 2006, for several years on and off I wrote \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.barmaidblog.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Barmaid Blog\u003c/a\u003e,\u003c/em\u003e an online account of my experiences as a female bartender in New York City (with increasingly frequent digression into my personal life as well). For a variety of reasons, I gradually let go of the blog. Although I did post one pretty significant update in July, 2015, it was after a hiatus of nearly five years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing other things occasionally, but mostly for myself, and I miss writing for an audience. I miss knowing that there are people out there who are actually waiting to see what I have to say, and what\u0027s been happening in my life - as mind-blowing as it has always been to me that anybody would even care what I say.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know that I\u0027m now married to the man I called \"Warren\" in my blog, but I haven\u0027t talked about how we got there - how we got back together, what else has transpired in our lives, where I work, what\u0027s happened with my friends and former coworkers, all of those things. And I want to write about it, but I haven\u0027t been able to find the motivation. Then I stumbled upon Patreon, where\u00a0I ponied up a few bucks to sponsor a cartoonist I love, because he\u0027s managed to make me smile so many times over the years that I couldn\u0027t help but be grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI realized, \u003cstrong\u003ethis\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e is what will get me to write - the people who have appreciated my writing from the beginning, showing their appreciation again. I\u0027m asking you to sponsor me for a little bit every month - whatever your comfort level is. The more readers who become patrons, the more those readers pledge, the more often I\u0027ll post to the blog. You don\u0027t \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to sponsor me to read the blog at its original location; the entries will simply show up earlier on Patreon for my patrons than they will on BarmaidBlog.com.\u00a0But if you do choose to sponsor me, and I get back to writing on a regular schedule, that way \u003cem\u003eeverybody\u003c/em\u003e wins.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be fun rewards for people who sponsor me at a certain level, but you can pitch in for as little as $1 per month. And these won\u0027t be skimpy little bits and pieces I\u0027m posting; we\u0027re talking about significant work stories and personal stories with lots of familiar faces, surprises, and even \u003cem\u003eadverbs!!\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Excerpts from works of fiction that I\u0027m in the middle of writing! I promise, you won\u0027t be disappointed... and if you are, just cancel your sponsorship. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love you guys, and I hope this will be the start of something fun and enduring!\u003cbr\u003e"
