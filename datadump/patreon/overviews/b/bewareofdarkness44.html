I\u0027m a pro-liberty individualist, husband, father, free speech advocate, and social commentator. I like to make YouTube and Vidme videos and sometimes I share the noise I make that I call \"music\" to torment those in earshot. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I\u0027m hoping to build a community of similarly minded individuals who are respectful and meet those with differing opponents halfway as much as possible without compromising our principles. When that fails, we\u0027ll make fun of the rude and absurd folks who make the world as not as much nice of a nice place be as you all do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Due to YouTube\u00a0constantly demonetizing creators, I\u0027ve now demonetized my channel and will look to crowdsource for support here and via Streamlabs. I also removed the multiple reward tiers I previously offered as many creators have a hard time fulfilling those promises. Instead, I replaced it with a simple $1 or more single pledge option.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 In lieu of specific rewards, if you\u0027d like to chat or have a suggestion, feel free to send me a private message. I want to give you the best value for your hard-earned money, so I\u0027d like to interact with you in whatever way is beneficial to us both and the broader BoD audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I appreciate any contribution, large or small, to supporting my work. Those of you who support me in this way motivate me to continue investing time and hard work into improving my channel and addressing many subjects that are worthy of discussion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Thank you again, and remember the immortal words of Bill and Ted: Be excellent to each other!\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Beware\u003c/div\u003e"
