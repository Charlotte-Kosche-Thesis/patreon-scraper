I\u0027ve put over 4,000 hours of work into BallisticXLR and hundreds more into its sister works BallisticPRS and BallisticDLR. These are released freely to the public and I provide free support. Apart from the ballistics resource that I provide I also produce videos centered in the shooting sports focused on precision rifle shooting and evaluations and recommendations on equipment, mindset, tactics and skills to make your rifle shooting that much more fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to continue giving of my time and resources but that just can\u0027t happen forever. The annual cost to keep this up is over $5,000 in hard expenses and easily 5x that in time and soft costs. I\u0027ve absorbed that for a number of years but now I need your help. With your help I can turn out a lot more free stuff for you and everyone else to use.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "Since it won\u0027t ever happen that I might get any BHOTBS level patrons, I can say audacious things here and not worry about them needing to come true.\u00a0\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, if this level gets 2 Patrons I\u0027ll wash the ass of both of the Booger Hook off the Bang Switch Patrons and then I\u0027ll drink the water. Then I\u0027ll post a video of the event. If neither of these top dog patrons want their ass washed then once a year I\u0027ll build a custom rifle with Axial Precision or Georgia Precision or White\u0027s Gun Works, I\u0027ll equip that rifle with a Huskemaw, Leupold or Vortex Optics scope and draw 1 name from my bucket-o-names that I\u0027ll then give that rifle to (state and federal gun laws apply).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this level gets 3 patrons I\u0027ll take one person per year (drawn from all names of Patrons) to South Africa for an all expenses paid safari and you\u0027ll get a free slot in an RX17 or RX18 live fire event and seminar.\u003c/p\u003e",

I\u0027ll acquire and test a new and popular scope every week. If the scope is junk and deserves to be put out of its misery I\u0027ll destroy it in an appropriate manner: With a bullet to the objective lens and a goofy video wrapped around it. Think I\u0027m kidding: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLlEnSC4Gvc. If the scope doesn\u0027t deserve to be destroyed I\u0027ll select a Patron\u0027s name at random from my bucket-o-names and the winner gets the scope (winners are ineligible to win again for 1 year). These are popular scopes, not just garbage. Could be a Vortex PST or a Leupold VX2 or a UTG Bug Buster. You never can tell. If the scope does get destroyed the drawing winner still gets to claim it if they want.\u003cbr\u003e",

This is nearly all inclusive. You get a harvest for 1 of any antelope species we encounter, airfare, lodging, food, rifle, ammo all taken care of. All you have to do is get to Atlanta in August when we\u0027re planning to leave. The trip is going to be 10 days with 5 days in the field. If the first person drawn can\u0027t attend, I\u0027ll continue drawing names until I find someone that can. \u003cbr\u003e",
