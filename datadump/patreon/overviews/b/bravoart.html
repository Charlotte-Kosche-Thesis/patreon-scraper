I have kept a promise to myself since I joined the furry fandom that I would always post my personal projects and un-commissioned art for everybody to see for free. If I ever wanted to make something for profit, it would be exactly that, and not take the brunt of my regular content and lock it behind a paywall.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not a patron, you still get to see all the content everyone else does, just in a month when I post it to my FA or Tumblr or Twitter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been in the furry fandom for a long time, and I\u0027ve seen a lot of artists completely privatize their work or join a pay site to display their art. As a fan, I\u0027ve been in the situation of just being cut off one day and told that if I ever wanted to see their art again, I had to pay. While I respect their choices and understand their need for compensation for their work, I never want to do that to any of my fans since I started drawing for myself and for fun and, of course, to be a part of the furry fandom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, I like to use my Patreon as a humble tip jar. If you have the means and enjoy my work enough, I thoroughly appreciate you being my patron. If you can\u0027t afford it, don\u0027t worry. I will never lock you out, you can always see my art on free sites such as FurAffinity or Tumblr. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UnFIvmy99vAIGeT4pBqnf2eqDKBMxfyFO4HoI5rKeVo/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStream and Sketch Terms of Service\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
