    "summary": "Get information and news on Telegram: http://t.me/bbftv\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBBF Television is a thing that started as a nameless, fun thing for myself, and myself only. Having done a few conventions, I found that the photos I took weren\u2019t enough to keep my memories alive the way I wanted them to. I bought a video camera in 2003, and from that time, I decided to film at conventions, rather than take stills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a professional in the television industry with education in several fields, it didn\u2019t remain just that, and two years later that tiny little silver camcorder I had, was replaced by the \u201cBig Blue Camera\u201d you may have seen me use until 2015. It was not a cheap camera but it offered professional-grade quality and control. And it was not much of a problem as I was living with my parents and my expenses were low, so I essentially had the money I made to indulge in my hobby of filming at conventions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat began as a fun little hobby started grew big suddenly and started to take on a life of its own! Like everyone, I\u2019d share what I did on the internet. Now my media was video, not photography anymore. I had no goal or idea where it would go, and was overwhelmed when with any video that was released would create a sensation and feedback, up until the first convention considered me to be their guest of honor. I began working harder at cons and at home, putting more effort into the videos, educated myself more and more in my spare time to make the videos better every time, applying my professional skills to make them the best I could for my fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, life goes on, and one has to stand on his own feet at some point. So I decided to become a more responsible adult and moved out of my parents place seven years ago. I was lucky enough to pull a little stunt that got me a nice place at an affordable rate, but money has been more tight ever since. But - it was all going well since I essentially had what I needed to do what I loved to do for myself and for others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLife was going good until 2015 when a streak of bad luck hit. Essentially I was facing the loss of my car due to someone hitting it, a dead laptop (The one I\u2019d edit on, was in the car at the time) and a camera on its last legs at the same time (You can only repair so much). You even see the effects of a worn out CCD sensor in the Anthrocon 2015 video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI received a lot of help from the fandom back then to get me back on my feet, and there was a lot of luck involved that helped fix or replace everything. In some cases the replacement was better, in other cases the replacement wasn\u2019t ideal but had to do. To those who want to know more, I\u2019ll be happy to sit down with you for a drink and tell you the whole story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings have not gotten easier since then. With payments and prices rising left and right while I haven\u2019t had a significant raise in a while to balance that out, plus more money I needed to put into everything to keep working and improving (like the subscription of Adobe CC 2017 which is responsible for the big improvement in encoding quality and effects), I\u2019m now facing a situation in which I\u2019ve started to neglect a few things in order to keep the memories of all of you in motion. I really want to keep making those memories possible, I love doing it and I love that people enjoy it. I\u2019m afraid that while it was my point from the first day to do it all on my own without asking for anything in return, this is no longer possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting BBF Television is supporting the ongoing drive to continue to make videos at cons and events that show the fans, friends and events in spirit of the community.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s been 15 years already. I could do with another 15, what do you think?\u003cbr\u003e"
