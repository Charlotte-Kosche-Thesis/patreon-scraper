It\u0027s set in the distant future focusing on the character named Steve, a bit of a slacker with exceptional piloting skills who has the not-so-exciting job of hauling industrial freight. One day, Steve does a good deed that inadvertently makes him the most wanted man in the galaxy and sets him on an epic adventure of discovering other planets, new cultures, and ultimately, himself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 As a sculptor/doll artist by profession, I originally intended to bring my vision of the story to life using articulated sculpted figures and handmade sets. In 2008, I began to experiment with digital sculpting using ZBrush and 3D printing to create figures with interchangeable expressions based on characters from the \u003cem\u003eBreak Step\u003c/em\u003e Universe.\u00a0This brought me much closer to my goal of telling my story with handmade characters and sets; but the amount of models I would have single handedly needed to create to tell the whole story was out of my reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c3.patreon.com/2/patreon-posts/13565741805417538530.png?t=2145916800\u0026amp;w=620\u0026amp;v=deBkp5_jbhXj5Sdu5-Nu_jqWYwyIcN1su4ygdvYjPSQ%3D\" style=\"width: 445px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 I continued to digitally sculpt my characters (as collectors loved them), but the idea of a comic was shelved.  A few years back, I began to share some of my scripts and designs with other artists. That\u0027s when a longtime friend and professional illustrator/comic artist, Denys Kovalenko, fell in love with the offbeat characters and their story. We began to discuss the possibility of bringing the story to life as an illustrated comic, as well as creating extra mini comics using my sculpted figures.

This is a project we both would be working on, even without the Patreon; but the extra funds will make it go much faster and relieve a bit of stress on our parts. Denys and I are both full time artists who support ourselves entirely through our art sales (not an easy thing in today\u0027s world) and any contribution (large or small) will be a big help to us.

Unlike sites such as Facebook, that use an algorithm to filter posts down so they are seen by only a third of our watchers, you will be notified of EVERY post we make (which will be in glorious high resolution and uncompressed quality).
