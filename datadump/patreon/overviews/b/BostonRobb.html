    "summary": "Hi,\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Boston Robb or Rob or The Reverend, where ever you know me from is whatever you call me.. Welcome to The Boston Robb Show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally my own show. After 20 years working in radio, I found myself laid off. And since the boss of my old radio station still has not given me back my letter of recommendation (which btw - funny story - all this guy had to do was sign the letter and give it back to me because he had me write the letter and said that he has everyone write their own letters of recommendation - Asshat-ery. My wife says to take this part out... but its the truth. I know a lot of people who relate to shotty bosses. Truth be told, This boss stands out so much because I\u0027ve been wicked fortunate in having some real awesome bosses. And like someone would talk about the jarring things that happened on a bad date, I need to explore these oddities. Its cathartic. And please tell me how that ain\u0027t hilarious (remove me from the situation) that the ex-boss got me to do more work for him after I was laid off, then ghosted me! Brilliant, in a villain-esque way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Well turns out, I don\u0027t need any letter of recommendation to start my own show. So, this is a Revolution. On this show, we be rebellin\u0027 like it was 1776! America has lost her Got Dangt mind. And we have to talk about it. Lets find some common ground, like everyone taking life so seriously. I once saw a movie where Ryan Reynolds played the same character he always does in every movie he\u0027s ever been in, and he said \"Don\u0027t take life too seriously, you\u0027ll never make it out alive\". Pretty good advice from a looker not a thinker. Ryan was on to something. This whole America\u0027s the best motto needs an revised edition... ya know, America the land of the free but just gave black people the right to vote only half a century ago. I think the new motto should be \"America, The Richest Nation on Earth, just don\u0027t drink from the tap\"... and our logo should be a bald eagle with Kim Kardashian\u0027s face on it. Or \"America, Always Winning Hi$tory\". I don\u0027t know, just mind-storming some ideas. Maybe Logan Paul can write a new national anthem. I think what I\u0027m getting at is 2020 is going to be off the hook and this show is going to reflect how awesome everything is (if you\u0027re wealthy) here in America.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo lets get to making some entertainment. Do not forget to subscribe to my Youtube Channel \u0026amp; follow the show here on Patreon for exclusive content.... Mysterious...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
