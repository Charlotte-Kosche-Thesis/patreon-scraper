    "summary": "For several years I\u0027ve been producing videos on YouTube examining the claims of Christian apologists and Bible inerrantists. These videos are purely a passion of mine and I\u0027ve enjoyed writing them, producing them and sharing them with the community of skeptics and atheists and have never asked for a dime in their productions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI\u0027m still not asking for a dime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhat I\u0027m doing here on Patreon is providing a way for those who have asked me in the past for a means to \"tip\" me for the work I do. I will not stop producing videos if no one signs up. I won\u0027t be \"hurt\" or feel slighted. Think of Patreon as a hat sitting out in front of my YouTube channel. If you want to drop some change into it, please feel free to do so and accept my utmost gratitude. If you don\u0027t feel like dropping in any change, that\u0027s fine, too. You can still enjoy (or hate!) my videos for free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, the fact is, I do spend a lot of time on making these films. A lot of time reading and researching and writing the scripts. A lot of time finding just the right music, video clips, photos and pictures to use. A lot of time working with the production software, figuring out interesting ways to narrate and make a visually appealing presentation. Maybe all that work is really worth something?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e If you do decide to contribute, understand that I will use whatever funds I gather to purchase material in the production of future vids. That may be better movie making software. A better mic. A subscription to a service providing royalty-free images, etc. Note I will ONLY be taking donations for my major video productions. If you contribute, you will NOT be making a donation for my \"Channel Update\" videos or \"Shout-outs\" or anything like that. I\u0027m also not suddenly going to get crazy and start making videos once a week about whatever topic is in the news or on my mind just to get cash flow! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlternatively, you may not want to make an on-going contribution to my work. That\u0027s ok! While Patreon does not currently have a \"tip-per-video\" option,\u00a0you can still give a \"one time donation\" by pledging and then canceling your pledge at any time. But in order for the one time payment to go through, you will have to wait for your payment to be processed at the end of the month (either by credit card or PayPal). Once you have been successfully charged, you can edit your pledge lower or remove your pledge completely by visiting my page here on Patreon and hitting \u0027edit your patronage!\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this and considering supporting my work on YouTube. I love you guys and will \"see\" you next video!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e---Brett\u003c/div\u003e"
