Partly self-taught, and partly schooled... Always learning. Always trying to grow and try new things. I am currently not a full-time artist, though I am working toward expanding my portfolio and my brands, \u003cstrong\u003eBurly Press \u003c/strong\u003e\u0026amp;\u003cstrong\u003e Midcard Pins\u003c/strong\u003e. Any funds collected via this Patreon will go straight into these businesses and not into my pocket, unless I happen to start making enough from this page and those businesses to be able to quit my full time job as a customer service monkey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little about my motivation as an artist: I started creating comics a few years ago, not only because I love comics, or that I needed to make a few extra bucks, but also because I saw a lack of representation in the media that I most enjoy. As not only a gay man, but a large man, and someone who appreciates the larger types, I wanted to create comics and art that represent LGBTQ characters and people of larger stature in a positive way without the usual tropes that go along with them. I wanted to make a comic starring a gay bear type as the main hero, reflecting my own experience as a late bloomer, and hopefully sharing some of that experience with the audience. Some people have asked me why I didn\u0027t make it a porn comic... I didn\u0027t want to go the route of explicit content at first because I wanted the comic to be more accessible to more than just the gay male audience as well, in hopes of sharing that experience and part of gay culture with other folks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot that I don\u0027t love a bit of sexy art.\u00a0As side projects I draw burly, erotic pinup art work to express body positivity and the fact that fat folk can be sexy too. I love burly eye candy art, and love to draw it, and will be including some NSFW posts for backers as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you will see, however, my work is not limited to fat hairy gay guys... I\u0027m also a big geek and love to draw fan art, as well as from time to time I will make myself available for commissions. And who knows what kind of projects lay in my future! And if there\u0027s anything you want to see, let me know. I\u0027m always open to new ideas and ways to improve my work. Patreon is a great way to keep in touch and interact with me, or use any of the other social platforms if you wish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out my blog here. I\u0027ll be posting all of my art that I can on here, and will have exclusive patron-only content of the more explicit or larger pieces as well as behind the scenes/process posts creating new issues of Bludgeon with my co-writer/editor\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/gregfreeland\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGreg Freeland II\u003c/a\u003e (who is also an awesome artist in his own right and has his own Patreon page should you wish to look him up!).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks, and I hope you choose to contribute. All are welcome! Gay, straight, men, women, and anything that lies in between or outside of those bullshit binaries.\u003cbr\u003e"
