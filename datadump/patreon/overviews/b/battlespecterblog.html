    "summary": "When I started this Patreon account, I did so to monetize my writing. My audience is growing, and I figured if people wanted to support my work, they could easily come here and pledge to do so. I had an initial burst of support that tapered off when I hit a point of slow production. Audiences are fickle. That\u0027s ok. Spend your money where you want. I\u0027m not gonna get offended. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen I had an idea, and I realized that this could help make it a reality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, I\u0027m pro-2A. That means I support the second amendment (along with the other BoR) and after every shooting there seems to be a call for politicians to \"do something\" with the undertone being that the \"something\" be \"ban the guns.\" For ideological reasons, I stand opposed to further restrictions on our right to bare arms, and I started thinking. Perhaps there is a way to protect our children while at school by empowering the staff. Allowing teachers to be armed is one method (one I think has merit) that grabs a lot of attention both positive and negative. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what about giving them the ability to help the first responders respond? What if the teachers could quickly and efficiently report information to the responding forces (EMS and police) to better aid them in stopping the bad guy? If the teachers can\u0027t be armed and defend themselves, why can\u0027t they act as beacons and signposts for the good guys with guns? This idea now has a hold of me in a way that few ideas have. Sure, I still want to write for profit. Sure, my Patreon\u0027s primary mission is to fund my website. Sure, I still intend to publish novels and other works. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I can use what\u0027s left over to develop an app that will allow teachers to be active participants in a bad situation. I can empower teachers in their time of need, and maybe save lives in the process. So, until my idea is developed and in the hands of school districts across the country, or the $$$ for that idea is coming from other sources, all funds collected via this Patreon account beyond my websites operating expenses will go directly toward developing the app in question. The children of this nation deserve to be protected, and the teachers and staff at schools deserve to be empowered to change the course of terrible events. I aim to give them a tool they can use to do just that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I need YOUR help. A small donation is all I need. I can run a Wix website for $7.50 a month. Two patrons at $5/month will cover that after fees. Everything else can go into paying for the development of an app that will save lives later on. I can\u0027t think of any better way to give up two cups of gas station coffee each month. Seriously- this literally is for the children. \u003cbr\u003e"
