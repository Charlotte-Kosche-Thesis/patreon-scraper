It takes a lot of work to host the service code, maintain the service, maintain the code and maintain compatibility with D\u0026amp;D beyond and this is what this patreon is for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe dice rolls are then presented in a nice popup dialog which show the individual dice rolls and modifiers beside the type of damage as well as the exact expression used to get the values so there is no guess work.\n\nThe goal is to get this extension working everywhere that having dice results would allow for a richer, smoother D\u0026amp;D gaming experience (character page, monster page, custom items, etc). As well I would love to integrate even more third party API\u0027s in like Roll20, Discord, etc as currently only Slack is supported (as this is what I personally use).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs there are literally almost a thousand monsters in D\u0026amp;D, a thousand spells in D\u0026amp;D, thousands of character options it would be impossible to say \"everything will work 100% of the time\", but I activly fix bugs where it is possible and if all else fails, the widget will be able to roll what ever you need quickly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal was to build something smart enough to work 99% of the time and with user feed back, custom build edge cases in the for 1% so that overtime it becomes perfect - at least for official content. User feed back is extremely important, as a community we can make this amazing.\n\nThe other pages will come with time (unless D\u0026amp;D beyond devs beat me to it).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love D\u0026amp;D and as a GM this extension has become priceless to me and my players love how quickly I can present damage as it means I can spend more time describing than I do rolling and doing math in my head. Hopefully your players will too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIcons made by Roundicons from \u003ca href=\"http://www.flaticon.com\"\u003ewww.flaticon.com\u003c/a\u003e is licensed by CC 3.0 BY\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.flaticon.com/authors/roundicons\"\u003ehttps://www.flaticon.com/authors/roundicons\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.flaticon.com\"\u003ehttps://www.flaticon.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0\"\u003ehttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.flaticon.com\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
