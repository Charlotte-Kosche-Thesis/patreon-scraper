I\u0027ve been a member of the cosplay community for several years now, though I\u0027ve always been a cosplayer at heart. I was the little girl that was always playing dress-up, whose favorite holiday was (and still is) Halloween! I\u0027m also the kid who spent hours on end reading books (regular \u0026amp; comics), playing video games, watching movies, and just generally geeking out while the rest of my friends and family were leading a \"normal life\". Pfffffttttt!!!!!! Totally overrated, am I right? So anyways! This is my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease don\u0027t feel obligated to donate. But a friend suggested I start a Patreon to possibly help with the cost of my cosplay and modeling. Hope you like what I do. And if you do feel like donating, you\u0027ll most certainly be rewarded!",
