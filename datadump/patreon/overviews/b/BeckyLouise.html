    "summary": "Hello my lovely people! My name is Bex and I am 21 years old, I study screen acting in London! It means so much that you\u0027ve stopped by my Patreon page. I appreciate it so much! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ME AND MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo lets start with about me? As I said before my name is Bex, I am 21 years old \u0026amp; I study screen acting in London, which can I just say is amazing, especially as that is what I want to do as my career, I have a little half sister who pops up on my channel every so often, she is the most adorable and the reason I am alive today, the main reason anyway! I am a massive evilregal \u0026amp; swanqueen fan!! yes I am a fan girl! I loves books and writting and of course acting!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow lets talk about my youtube channel shall we...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I when I first created my channel It was to use as a sort of diary, but then I changed it and started talking about mental health and realized this is something I should do! so I started doing more videos and I realized I enjoyed it and thats also when my own recovery began! So on my channel I talk about ALL mental health topics, I talk about LGBT topics, I talk about sexual assault \u0026amp; rape, I talk about emotional abuse and I also talk about acting and every so often I do daily vlogs!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I always talk about strong topics that have a meaning to me and alot of the time I talk about things which I have been through and I have been through everything I have mentioned above!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT WILL YOU GET IN RETURN!?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of my lovely Patrons will be able to see my videos before they go live on YouTube. HOW LUCKY ARE YOU! You will also get a nice little message from me when you become a patreon to my channel...\u003cbr\u003eMore perks and rewards are listed below!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHERE WILL THE MONEY BE GOING!?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money will be going into the channel at first! however I will be putting aside a precentage of the money each moth (only only once it gets to $10 though and depending on how much you pledge) and will be giving it to a different mental health charity each month! My channel is all about raising awarness and that\u0027s what I want to do, I want to do a tour around the U.K going to different schools \u0026amp; groups talking to them about all the things I have mentioned!!\u00a0Doing YouTube full time is my dream, not only because I\u0027m will be attempting to change the attitudes of people surrounding mental health but it\u0027s something I can actually hold down. My own mental health makes it hard working in a \u0027normal\u0027 job setting so yes if I was able to educate people about mental health and earn along the way that would be amazing!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBUT I CAN\u0027T AFFORD TO PLEDGE OR I CAN\u0027T PLEDGE\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewell my dears, you will be fireballed my the evil queen (once upon a time reference!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003enope... you are absolutely under no obligation to Pledge at all! THANKYOU for being a viewer and THANKYOU so much if you become a Patron, I appreciate and respect you all the same. I\u0027ll continue to make videos... Here\u0027s hoping for the best though! \u003cbr\u003eBex\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eXX\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
