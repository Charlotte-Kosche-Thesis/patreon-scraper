    "summary": "John And Heidi Small are so excited to offer their radio program to non-commercial radio stations. This will help off-set the expenses that are incurred in delivering the program. The internet (cloud) is used to get the show to the radio stations. When John and Heidi started their show in 2010, it was on the station they own in Sioux Falls, SD... a few years later (2014) they bought another station in Sioux City, IA. Shortly after that, they began offering the show to other commercial stations around the country in exchange for barter ads, but sadly the small stations that need the help the MOST are not able to run ads, so this is an opportunity to help support the small station you listen to (or even a station that you don\u0027t necissarily listen to, but want to support)"

They added another station in Sioux City, IA in 2014. At that time they also decided to offer their show to other stations all over the US. These station are often in smaller towns and struggle to find good local talent. The John And Heidi Show is available on barter (meaning the station doesn\u0027t write a check, instead they run some ads for the show)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome stations are not allowed to run ads. Instead of making these small station PAY for the show, John and Heidi are allowing them to run the show in exchange for them to run an underwriting message telling people about this! An opportunity to make a small investment to keep the John And Heidi Show on their station for free.",
