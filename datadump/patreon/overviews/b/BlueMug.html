    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWelcome to Blue Mug Productions!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBack around 2007, a crazy group of deviants gathered together to launch a website devoted to their scandalous art and writings, called Blue Mug Productions. Our first project, an adult parody comic, was called The Last Tengu in Paris.\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately, real life and day jobs kept us from updating as often as we wanted, and our business plan/structure wasn\u0027t working for us or our audience, and in 2011 we went on hiatus.. which became quite extended.\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, our desire to continue Tengu and launch other crazy projects is still alive and well! We\u0027re getting re-organized, and want to give it another go!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"http://www.bluemugproductions.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.bluemugproductions.com/Patreon/BMP_HeaderText_450x50.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhyfor Patreon?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe monthly site subscription wasn\u0027t working well for anyone. Patreon will allow us to have more of a pay-what-you-want model. It allows more freedom and options for our viewers, as well as more direct interaction with the activity feed/comments/polls/etc. We\u0027ll be able to make more of the things that you want to see. It also gives us flexibility - This is not our full time job (yet), so sometimes real life happens to take priority. With Patreon, we\u0027re set up so that you only pay for content you actually get! We\u0027re using the \"pay per piece\" option instead of the regular monthly fee, so if we are running slow, you won\u0027t be charged. We only get paid if we make things for you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat lies in store for our Patrons:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFirst and foremost, we\u0027re going to start slow and work our way up, so that no one gets overwhelmed by the creative process. Mara and Kalia have been improving their skills over the years, and are super keen on remastering the first 4 issues of Tengu, so they look extra professional and gloriously sexy for your enjoyment. So as we get the ball rolling, Patrons can expect a lot of saucy sketches and pinup illustrations in addition to the new and improved pencils, inks, and colors of the existing Tengu pages.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIMPORTANT NOTE:\u003c/strong\u003e We\u0027re gonna throw all kinds of art at you guys! But we will only set fully finished Illustrations and Comic pages to be Paid Content. We plan for this to be between 1-4 pieces per month. As we grow, if that changes, we will let you know in advance so you can change your settings if you need to. So set your pledge and maximum amounts accordingly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFuture shenanigans: Once we get going, Mara and Kalia will continue to work on a few new pages of the Tengu Comic that were already scripted, and if we get enough support, we will throw the extra monies at our writer and letterer, so they can come back and we can continue our story!\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eThe more viewer support we get, the more time we can devote to creating new content. We\u0027ve got a lot of art ideas and fun merch we want to share with you all, including but not limited to, pins, posters, art books, additional comic series, animations, interactive games, etc. \u003cstrong\u003ePatrons will always see all content first, before it\u0027s released elsewhere! \u003c/strong\u003eAnd depending on tier, if you pledge, you will also see the high quality files, some exclusive and uncensored content that we won\u0027t post anywhere else, get to test out new features, be entered in contests, get some swag items, vote for what we work on next, and get as many more benefits as we are able to offer. It really all depends on what YOU want from us.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e"
