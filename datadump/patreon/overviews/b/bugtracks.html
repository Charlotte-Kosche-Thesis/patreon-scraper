    "summary": "Greetings! I am now seven years into my \u003cem\u003eLeafminers of North America \u003c/em\u003eproject, a guide that provides keys to the leaf mines that can be found on every plant in the continental US and Canada, along with information about the natural history and geographic distribution of each insect species involved. I\u0027m getting ready to start releasing it in monthly installments as PDFs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had originally envisioned this as a print book, which I still hope it will be someday, but there are several reasons why this hasn\u0027t happened yet, even though I have accomplished my original goal of compiling all of the published information about host plants and natural history of North American leafminers into identification keys:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAlthough my literature review is complete, I keep discovering and describing new species of leafminers, as well as making new discoveries about already described species. As a result I am constantly updating and revising my book manuscript, and if I published the book anytime soon it would already be out of date by the time it was published.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAt this point my entomology work is done entirely in my spare time, which means that I get almost no writing done during the growing season\u2014when I\u0027m not at work, I\u0027m too busy collecting, raising, and photographing leafminers!\u2014and then at the end of the season it takes me weeks to sort through all the photos I\u0027ve taken. On top of that, I have been prioritizing properly documenting my new discoveries in scientific journals over keeping the manuscript up-to-date and writing the several introductory chapters that will be needed before the book can be finished.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI have amassed so much information that I\u0027m worried that it won\u0027t fit in a book, once the hundreds (thousands?) of illustrations are included\u2014or if it does, then the book would likely be prohibitively expensive to publish, let alone for anyone to purchase.\u00a0 The text of the identification keys alone is about 1000 pages!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI\u0027m excited to start getting this information out to other naturalists, and I also want to keep updating this guide with new discoveries. Beyond this, I would like to start working on guides to other fascinating but poorly known insects\u2014in particular, I\u0027m thinking about a hostplant-based guide to sawfly larvae, and then maybe taking on the oak galls. We can make this happen together with Patreon. Thank you for your interest!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://charleyeiseman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IMG_6730.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
