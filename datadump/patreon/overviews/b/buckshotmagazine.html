You can check us out at\u00a0\u003ca\u003ebuckshotmagazine.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003eWe need to pay our writers and maintain our website, and those costs add up. We\u0027ve been fortunate to start off with a small arts grant, but Patreon will allow us to continue finding, buying, and publishing stories for you in the long-term.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo keep things going - to continue publishing once a week - we need your support. We pay our writers $10 for publishing rights to each story, a semi-professional rate which makes up 80% of our yearly costs. The rest goes towards web-hosting and graphic design on a per-issue basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn other words, the vast majority of every dollar goes straight to the front lines, to the writers out there creating original, convention-breaking pieces. The bulk of our time is spent in the submission process curating, editing, and publishing. Our small team of readers and editors work on a volunteer basis to bring these stories directly to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether it\u0027s $1 or $20, your patronage helps us find, house, and publish quality quick fiction for everyone to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhy should I be a Patron?\u003c/h4\u003eThe crowdfunding movement is so powerful - it gives every supporter a say in the ideas and processes that are there for them, and would never exist without their patronage. It\u0027s a vote of sorts; a vote of confidence, and it\u00a0keeps us crunching along seeking out quality fiction to put out there for everyone\u0027s benefit... So from each and every one of us here at Buckshot, \u003cstrong\u003ethank you \u003c/strong\u003efor your time. We hope you consider becoming a patron.\u003cbr\u003e"
