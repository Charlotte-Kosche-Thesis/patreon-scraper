    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eBawdy Storytelling is the original sex and storytelling series - the show that started it all! \u003c/strong\u003eFor years, sexual folklorist Dixie De La Tour has traveled the country to bring her unique spin\non pervy personal narrative to San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Boston, Portland, Baltimore, San Diego, and more cities to come. And this live storytelling series is also a podcast!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEach episode tells a bold and fearless personal story. Like the\nlive stage series, we\u0027ve been doing for 11 years now, the podcast\u2019s focus is to\nrelay a sexual adventure that is true, intensely personal and above all,\nrelatable. Dixie wants to know what about wild one-night stands, kink, spanking, open relationships, swinging, cuckoldry,\nsex work, carnal cosplay, being a furry, public sex - you name it - gets you going. Dive in with her and find out what real people (and the occasional rock star) truly want, and what they learn when they finally get it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoes that sound pretty daring and maybe a little outrageous? It often is. Sex is more than just performing a primitive act;\nit\u2019s about being true to your desires. Bawdy wants to inspire you to try\nsomething new. Dixie believes that storytelling can be your roadmap to self-discovery.\nIf you\u2019re a voyeur, Bawdy offers you a peek at a whole new world. And if you\u2019re aching to figure out how to create your own sexual adventures,\nthis podcast can show you how. There is no better way to learn what\u2019s out there\nthan through a masterfully told story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd Bawdy is not just shocking sexual\nexploits-- it\u0027s about affirmation. Dixie thoughtfully curates each tale and coaxes out the details; she also fires up the audience to support the tellers by bringing the house down at every show. (Hey, it\u0027s not easy getting on stage and sharing\nthose deep dark secrets, is it?) The result is\ngroundbreaking; each episode is a scene of love and trust. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant to support Bawdy\u0027s life-changing mission? Join our Patreon today. \u003c/strong\u003eAnd THANK YOU for wanting the world to be a more loving and accepting place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd if you\u0027re a supporter of this Patreon: THANK YOU. \u003c/strong\u003eWe love doing live storytelling shows, but podcasting is rather new to us. Contributing and following Bawdy Storytelling here is you telling us you want to keep hearing these stories - and you\u0027re actively helping us share them with the world via our podcast. Way to make it happen!\u003cbr\u003e"
