If you\u0027re willing to just pay a single dollar you get to see exclusive concept art, and play the alpha/beta versions of the games I create. Of course anything more is greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I pay for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThere are a few different reward levels to choose from but in essence you\u0027re paying for art, animations, and/or games. You can also pay for special recognition in the credits of my games and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen do I get charged?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eYou will be charged once a month, now don\u0027t you worry I\u0027m pretty fast at making games so there will be updates monthly and depending on the month I may have exclusive animations or artwork to add to your rewards.\u00a0 That means you will always get what you\u0027re paying for.\u003cbr\u003eAfter you are charged as soon as the payments go through (typically around the 5th of the month) I will send you a message with a link to your rewards for the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent Projects\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThese projects will change from time to time but the current project is:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMonster Trainer,\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/em\u003eThis is an RPG style of game full of combat with sexy monsters and you (the trainer) will blow their clothes off, quite literally.\u00a0 That\u0027s because this game has the wonderful clothing destruction system.\u00a0 As you fight the clothes and armor protecting the enemy wears away and be careful your own armor might disappear as well.\u003cbr\u003eAlong with that there is a detailed economy aspect to the game. You can capture, train and sell monsters, or maybe you\u0027d prefer to train them to cook and clean so you can start your own restaurant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReward Details\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eHopefully I can clear up any questions about rewards here.\u00a0 First of all I create three main things Games, Animations, and Drawings.\u00a0 I will spend most of my time working on games monthly, but to make good games I have to work on the art that will be included.\u00a0 This means I\u0027ll have animations and drawings that I put into the games, but sometimes I\u0027ll make drawings or animations that aren\u0027t related to the games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo first tier is just basic game related drawings and simple game access.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second tier is for more game content and input.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe third tier includes the animations and drawings I make that aren\u0027t related to the game.\u00a0 So pick this one if you enjoy my drawings and want to see short animations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fourth tier is about getting all the content I produce including super high-resolution game files, animations, special easter eggs in games and possibly even your own custom version of the game.\u00a0 Sometimes I\u0027ll make super secret versions of the games with special characters, scenes, or whatever just to reward these big game fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
