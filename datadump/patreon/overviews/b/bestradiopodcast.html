There are\nnearly 300 shows already \u201cin the can,\u201d with new ones debuting twice a month at minimum.\nThere are special episodes released on an ad-hoc basis when the situation\narises.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEach show features intriguingly mixed rock and rock-based music from a variety\nof artists that in other contexts might be considered incompatible. Genres,\nrhythms, moods and artists are seamlessly blended together to produce listening\nexperiences you can only dream about finding in traditional radio. BRYHNH\nincludes favorites and new discoveries from both familiar artists and those you\nwish you\u0027d heard before, downloaded twice monthly to your computer or iPod.\nBRYHNH has been recognized by the industry, including a rank of  #7 in The Digital Podcast Top 100\nPodcasts for 2005 and #3 Classic Rock Podcast for 2007, as well as #2 Rock\nPodcast in 2010 by Dave White from about.com.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOver the\nyears, BRYHNH has attracted an international audience.  There are listeners on every continent.\nMany of these listeners have become personal friends of the producers through\ninteraction, and several of them have taken on a more formal producer role,\nhelping the host source music and identify themes for upcoming shows.  Occasionally, one of these producers\nwill help host a show, like the eagerly awaited annual episode called \u201cRick\u2019s\nPicks,\u201d where Rick, a long time listener, cherrypicks songs from the prior\nyears\u2019 shows to revisit in what amounts to a \u201cbest of\u201d BRYHNH annual episode.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Best\nRadio You Have Never Heard is a labor of love from former radio and music\nindustry professionals. It is helmed by host Perry Bax. Perry has a remarkable\ninstinct for selecting songs, finding interesting and unusual version and\nultimately blending them into these unique shows from both an auditory and\nthematic perspective.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAbout Perry Bax \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPerry Bax\nhas spent his life surrounded by music. His passion started in his pre-teen\nyears when he would wait for the crews at the \"high school and up\"\nrock shows as a 7th grader. He would wait for the likes of the legendary WLS-AM\nChicago DJ Dex Card\u0027s \"Wild Goose\" touring shows of Chicago\u0027s star talents\nof the day, includingThe Buckinghams, Cryin\u0027 Shames, American Breed and New\nColony Six, amongst others, to pull into the local ice rink. At the venue, he\nwould convince the roadies to let him into the show in exchange for helping\nthem load in and load out. The crews were amazed he would be there for load\nout, holding up his end of the bargain, often throwing his trusty Schwinn\nbicycle into the back of the truck with the gear. They\u0027d give both him and his\nbike a lift home to ensure he got back safe and sound in the wee hours of the\nmorning.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEventually,\nyoung Perry convinced his parents that it was okay to attend big rock concerts\non his own. Not messing around, he camped out overnight at the local Ticketron\noutlet at Montgomery Wards department store to buy tickets, and was soon\nattending a 2:30 PM matinee show by The Rolling Stones as a mere 13 year old.\nAt age 14, being in the 10th row center for Led Zeppelin and The Who was the\nclincher.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOnce Perry\nturned 15, he decided that putting on the rock shows himself would be a great\nway to not only be sure he could gain admission, but he coud hand pick the\nbands he would like to see. After producing numerous shows for the local park\ndistrict, which gave him unprecedented support and access, he booked and\nproduced a show in the high school field house that sold out 2,000 tickets.\nThat concert featured Styx.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen\nchecking in on the band in the dressing room and asking if they needed\nanything, the ever intimidating Dennis DeYoung snapped at the then 15 year old\npromoter: \"Who are you, the Styx doctor?\" to which Perry replied,\n\"No, I am the guy who is going to pay you.\" This left the band with\ntheir jaws on the floor. That show opened a lot of doors for Bax.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn his\nsophomore year of college at Western Illinois University, Perry became the head\nof the University Concert Committee (which included the perk of having his\ntuition covered by the university) and the booking of the 7,000 seat basketball\narena. Acts included shows from David Crosby and Graham Nash, The Doobie\nBrothers, Foreigner, Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Ted Nugent, and a hilarious\nnight backstage with George Carlin amongst others.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPerry took\na few years off of school to tour with bands as a production manager and front\nof house sound mixer. In 1982 he found himself back at the same university,\nthis time bypassing the live music scene and quickly becoming the station\nmanager at the newly formed student FM radio station. This was a golden\nopportunity as the \"new music\" alternative college format was taking\nhold and Perry, along with Music Director John Vernon (who went on to become\nthe publisher of Illinois Entertainer Magazine) built the station into a\nrenowned powerhouse, recognized by bands and record companies around the world.\nTaking things one step further, they set up shop in a local club to \"make\nmoney to buy more records\" and established a \"new music/alternative\ndance night.\" The massively popular club night sold out its 500-person\ncapacity every night Bax spun for the next seven years, and frequently the\nentrance queue formed around the block an hour before the first disc was spun.\nPerry\u0027s role in the radio and club scene turned out to be so impressive that\nthe university insisted that Perry complete his undergraduate degree so they\ncould hire him as a full time administrator in the broadcast department and\nNational Public Radio affiliate, which Perry accepted.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHowever, a\nreturn to Chicago was ultimately calling. It did so in the form of a DJ slot at\nChicago\u0027s legendary Metro/Smart Bar, where Bax was spinning music compatible\nwith the diverse live acts upstairs at Metro and spinning alternative dance\ntracks in the basement Smart Bar. In his role as local sound engineer, Perry\nmixed many Chicago shows, as well as touring with artists including Stabbing\nWestward, Black Uhuru and Ned\u0027s Atomic Dustbin. When he had free days while\ngigging in Chicago, Perry took up residency in record retail working at Val\u0027s\nHalla Records, one of Chicago\u0027s legendary independent record stores.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs the\nyears went on, Perry worked his way up the ranks again, this time as Operations\nDirector at db Sound Chicago, coordinating sound gear and personnel, for tours\nby The Rolling Stones, The Allman Brothers, AC/DC, Metallica, Riverdance,\nTrans-Siberia Orchestra and more.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPerry was\nan early advocate of podcasting, launching his unique mix of rock-based music\nin 2004, at the onset of MP3 players. It seemed there was a void in the musical\nuniverse which wasn\u0027t catering to the needs of music fans who were serious\nabout music both new and classic. Seeking to fill this gap, Perry launched The\nBest Radio You Have Never Heard podcast in 2005 as a format without borders or\nlimitations, and a unique production style that is rivaled by none. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith\ntraditional radio becoming more and more regimented, The Best Radio You Have\nNever Heard has become a niche where listeners can relive the days of early\n70\u0027s freeform FM mixed with today\u0027s contemporary artists, and tracks by their\nfavorite artists that have never graced the terrestrial airwaves. With more\nmusic than time in his biweekly show, Perry estimates he hasn\u0027t repeated more\nthan 10-15 tracks since the show went live on the World Wide Web.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMusic\nwithout borders for a global audience...this is truly The Best Radio You Have\nNever Heard.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy Patreon\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBRYHNH\nvalues its audience and enjoys producing the show and providing it free of\ncost. However, the production and airing of BRYHNH does not come without expense.\nThe show is seeking support from its listeners in order to cover costs for\neverything from BMI, ASCAP and SESAC licensing to the more mundane expenses\nlike web hosting, IP and domain registrations, all manner of music procurement\netc.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon offers a mechanism where you can help keep Best Radio You Have Never\nHeard up and running for years to come. \nYou can be a proud contributor as you listen to new episodes and access\nany episode in the back catalog whenever you want, whether it be through the\niOS app, Google Play Music, simple file downloads or subscription via the\niTunes Music Store.
