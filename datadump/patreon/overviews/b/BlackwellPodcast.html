However, in order to keep the show going they are asking for help in covering the cost of their subscription services, which total to $40 USD a month.  Any money from patrons after the initial 40 will be donated to charity at the end of each month, as highlighted in the pledge section.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your consideration of supporting Blackwell Podcast, and for your continued support since 2015!\u003cbr\u003e"
