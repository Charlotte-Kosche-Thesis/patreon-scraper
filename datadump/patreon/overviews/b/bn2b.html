    "summary": "I know that this will not be a record breaking campaign, but I have three main reasons for starting a Patreon:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. \u003c/strong\u003eI want to commit myself to updating regularly. I\u0027ve been pretty good at keeping the blog updated since I restarted it in August, 2016, but I traveled a lot in the past couple of months, and then also got quite sick for a while. I wrote an update about the first trip I took, and there were no comments or replies, and I found it really easy to not update for a while. I feel like having people commit a dollar a month (or whatever) to this blog will be a good way of knowing it\u0027s worth updating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027d love if a ton of people all pledged $1/month (or whatever the minimum is) and eventually I could point to my Patreon as proof that people read my blog. This is how you become a thought leader, and once you\u0027re a \u003cstrong\u003ethought leader\u003c/strong\u003e, that\u0027s\u00a0when you get the real money. Do I like TED Talks? No. Do I want to become one of those guys who posts \"GET. SHIT. DONE. NO. EXCUSES.\" on Twitter a few times a week? No. If a book publisher gives me enough money, will I write a completely shitty book called \"The Blog Project: My Year of Dreaming, Living, Blogging, and How I Found Myself Through Blogging\"? Yes, I will do that. I would do that for $50,000 or more. That\u0027s the number.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know, I ran Diaryland fundraisers a few times when the site was exploding and there were sudden needs for server hardware or whatever. The first time, I wrote up a message, and I added \"Any donation is welcome, even if you can just give $1, that\u0027s fine with me!\" But then a couple of people actually only gave $1, and it turns out it wasn\u0027t fine with me. I thought those people were kind of annoying. Like, they owned a credit card, and they cared enough to go to the trouble to enter all their details online, but then they thought \"Should I give $5? Maybe just $2? Nah, too much\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut my point is that with this Patreon, I really don\u0027t care if people just give $1/month. I have realistic expectations, and it\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003efine\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0with me if people only give $1/month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI mean hopefully a million people will eventually do that - that\u0027d rule! Do the math: That\u0027s a million bucks per month. Great money. That works out to $12 million/year. I\u0027d love it! I\u0027m going to be honest, money has never been my strong suit, and I usually don\u0027t have much, or any. An extra twelve milly in my pocket every year? Sounds good to me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. \u003c/strong\u003eI know I said I only had 3 main reasons for starting a Patreon, but this line is to demonstrate that I am looking to smash everyone\u0027s expectations! In the good way. You expected three reasons, but you got four! This is not actually a fourth reason I guess, but I\u0027m out of reasons, and I wanted to put something here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5. \u003c/strong\u003eThe final reason I\u0027m starting this is in case I have more entries that get really popular. Since August, I\u0027ve had a couple that have gone pretty wild.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://benicetobears.com/2016/11/17/the-better-alternative-to-small-houses-that-nobody-is-talking-about/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThis entry on tiny houses\u003c/a\u003e got something like 25,000 pageviews after being linked in a few big places, and I bet if I had a Patreon back then, a couple of people would have said \"Hey I\u0027d like to support a traditional blog!\" and pitched in. I would say that of everything I\u0027ve written online, maybe 1% of things wind up getting really popular, and if it happens again, I want to have this all set up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6. \u003c/strong\u003eSince I restarted blogging in August, I\u0027ve had a few people say that they\u0027re going to start a blog as well, after seeing this as an example. I don\u0027t think anyone has actually done this, but once they notice that I\u0027m making an extra million dollars per month in American money, I know they\u0027ll be on it. I\u0027d love to see more people go back to traditional blogging - that would really be the most gratifying thing to me, other than all the money I\u0027m going to be getting (one million dollars a month), which I can only assume is going to dwarf anything else, gratification-wise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e7. \u003c/strong\u003eAlso I don\u0027t want to be a hypocrite, because I\u0027m always telling people that the best, most interesting way to fund things online these days is Patreon."
