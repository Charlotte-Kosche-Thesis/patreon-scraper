    "summary": "In Summer of 2015, John Pyka released his first Dieselpunk novel Tales From The Flip-Side: The Adventures of Big Daddy Cool \u0026amp; The Bombshell Kittens, published by Pro Se Press. In coordination with that release John created a scalable stage revue featuring music, magic, and stories inspired by the stories in the book. Tales From The Flip-Side On Stage was an instant hit and now John has expanding the brand to be a masthead imprint and to include not only live shows, but video and podcasts that tie into the book and live show. The live shows are marketed to theaters, entertainment venues, comic cons, and festivals around the country, bolstered by the marketplace exposure and prestige of weekly digital content and a second print volume coming in the Summer of 2017. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA MILESTONE CELEBRATION!\u003cbr\u003eCountdown to 30 Years of Professional Entertainment!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJoin us on John Pyka\u0027s Countdown to 30 Years of Professional\nEntertainment Celebration!
