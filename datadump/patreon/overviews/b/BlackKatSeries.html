    "summary": "Cheerio darlings, and welcome to the wonderful world of Black Kat!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Kimberly Gordon, author of the Black Kat series, a dark romantic comedy about superheroes. I\u0027m so honored that \"The Supers\" have entrusted me with their stories. The prequel to the series,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M4G83ZG\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUnlucky Charm\u003c/a\u003e, is already out, and has been well received.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M4G83ZG\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M4G83ZG\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.blackkatseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Unlucky17_400.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople can\u0027t wait to find out what happens next. Neither can I, and I\u0027m writing the doggone thing. The Supers never cease to surprise me with the twists and turns they toss in, even in the final editing stage! The next book, Kat \u0026amp; Mouse, should be out in this winter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem is finding time to write and wear the many hats of an indie author. Until recently, I worked full time as an IT professional and have small children (one with special needs.) But the Supers just won\u0027t let me be. They demand their time too and bother me in the shower, the car, while I\u0027m eating, sleeping, at work, anywhere, everywhere. I wuv them so and know that this is my calling and my passion: to tell their stories and share their world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027ve taken the next crazy, terrifying step in this process and come home to write full time. For that to work well, I need patrons. Poor Hugh would help if he could, but his money is tied up in a snarl of Swiss bank accounts and he\u0027s still stuck in a jail cell somewhere. Please help me bust him out soon before he perishes from the lousy food and Nightshade\u0027s poison!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.blackkatseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Hugh-supersuit_400.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ambitious plan is to come to publish FOUR Black Kat books within the next year:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTentative publication dates:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBook 1: Kat \u0026amp; Mouse (June)\u003cbr\u003eBook 2: Playing with Fire (August)\u003cbr\u003eBook 3: Katastrophic\u00a0(October)\u003cbr\u003eBook 4: Star Crossed (December)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut here\u0027s the thing: Black Kat is only one series set in this world. Yes, shocking, I know! There are at least five others, all with characters and conflicts (and plenty of jokes!) begging to be told. There are also budding digital artists among \"The Supers\" who wish to share their promo graphics, web design and book covers for the series. You\u0027ll get access to them here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.blackkatseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jacob_500.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo my goals are lofty: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake enough income from home to finish all 13 books in the series in the next few years\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreate print and audio books for the series\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eContinue to create digital art of the Supers and their world\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreate a Black Kat calendar, because- why not?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreate 3D animated book trailers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreate a graphic novel version of the books\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBegin work on the other series set in this world\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eDepending on what level you choose as a Patron, you\u0027ll get sneak peeks and first looks into new scenes, characters, beta copies, early releases, and digital mock-ups of the Supers.

At the highest levels, I\u0027ll be happy to coach you as you create your own world builds and amazing characters, and share limited edition artwork of the Supers with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome come join the fun and sign up today!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
