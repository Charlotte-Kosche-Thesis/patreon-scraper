    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Eldridge (stage name) Black Laid Back\u003cbr\u003eCEO of Black Laid Back Entertainment.\u003cbr\u003eI am a music entertainer, philanthropist and entrepreneur working in multiple industries (entertainment, business, and community development). I was born and raised in Philadelphia(south, north\u00a0\u0026amp; west). Before my\u00a0journey, my mom and I spent one winter in the homeless shelter on 13th and Pine before I was 4 years old. We were alone and far from rich, but my mom did what she could and\u00a0made it through. I grew up in South Philly; high rise project once located at 1234 Catherine St. then, later on, moved to 31st \u0026amp; Tasker housing projects still south Philly.\u00a0 I find it amazing how intellectual skill and talent can still come from rough environments.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the crack era and war on drugs when I was 5 years old; I was in my innocents while playing next to my high rise building and Martin Luther King Community center that served free lunches. I was maliciously attacked when someone unknown, threw a 40 oz beer bottle that hit me in the head. I was rushed to the hospital to receive\u00a0stitches and broke free from the straps on the bed that tried to hold me.\u00a0 Little before or after that\u00a0incident, I remember fighting some kid on the 5th-floor in the hallway over mom jokes. Later on, while my mom was at work; my sister; who was 10 years older than me at the time, ran away when she was supposed to babysit. She told me she\u0027d be right back and promised to bring me back a basketball. Even though\u00a0she never\u00a0returned, my love runs deep, my sister and I remained close even though we were far apart. I sat back, watched and learned a lot, I was a cool kid who later became a product of my environment. Unfortunately, my father was never there through the journey of making mistakes and improving. We all need guidance and support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI understand now that I needed more role models and i needed to be a better one. I needed more patience, opportunities and a creative outlet to focus my energy productively and express myself. My mom taught me to help others, be respectful, honorable, graduate school and said that I can do anything that I put my mind to. \u003cbr\u003eThrough the years I became interested in community development, performing arts and entrepreneurship. I love creating music, starting businesses and giving back. Like the rose that grew from concrete, where I come from; you would think that I would be an angry \u0026amp; bitter person but I have a mission; and my goal is to raise capital \u0026amp;\u00a0see it through. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
