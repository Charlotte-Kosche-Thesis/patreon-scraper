Support of the arts, be it writing or digital coloring, is an important aspect, and I hope that you view it the same way as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you became a patron, you would gain access to my coloring and writing livestreams, along with any writing resources I have available, such as editing/reviewing something you\u0027ve worked on, e.g. art or fiction works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you for taking the time to read this and hope you will consider supporting me in my endeavors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
