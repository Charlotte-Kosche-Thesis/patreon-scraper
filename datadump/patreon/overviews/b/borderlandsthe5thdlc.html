Wherever you might know me from I hope you\u0027ll get to know me just a tat better by reading this.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAt the beginning there was...\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nWell lets start at the beginning of my \u003cstrong\u003eBorderlands\u003c/strong\u003e career as that is the most relevant thing here. (seeing as what my/our (\u003cstrong\u003eSleepmaster\u003c/strong\u003e included) Patreon is about)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started playing Borderlands right about the time where most people started playing Borderlands, at the very first release date of the game back in 2009. Ever since I took my first steps in Borderlands I felt as if Borderlands was leading up to be something big, and something incredibly awesome. As time passed and 3rd party tools like \u003cstrong\u003eWillowTree\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eGearCalc\u003c/strong\u003e came out I became more and more infatuated with the game and wanted to know more and more about it. A result of this is that I became very knowledgeable of the game\u0027s\u0027 \u003cstrong\u003eRandom Weapon Generator\u003c/strong\u003e system and also about its various game mechanics in general. This knowledge only grew over time, but I always wanted something more out of the game...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnter onto the stage: Borderlands UDK!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0027t remember the specific date of the release of this \u003cstrong\u003eUDK\u003c/strong\u003e, but it was somewhere in 2011 I believe. (don\u0027t quote me on that, its been a while...) Right from that moment I knew what I wanted to do; create custom content for Borderlands!\u003cbr\u003e\nI started small, making minor weapons/items, nothing to fancy. And kept myself in the background of things. It wasn\u0027t until I saw what other content creators like \u003cstrong\u003eRatrace\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eYetiCavern\u003c/strong\u003e, etc. were doing that I decided to step out of the shadows and socialise. By sharing knowledge about the\u003cstrong\u003e BL UDK\u003c/strong\u003e with them my experience grew substantial. And ever since then I took it upon myself to create the most interesting/diverse/awesome/enjoyable custom made weapons/items collection for Borderlands. (I which I succeeded in flying colours if I do say so myself)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTime went by and I only got better and better with the BL UDK. Until, life caught up to me and I dropped out of the scene for about 1 - 1\u00bd years I believe. (that plus I wasn\u0027t able to run the BL UDK on my old laptop anymore) And with my dissapearance I took my custom made content as well. Pretty much for me the BL UDK community scene went silent, until, one day someone contacted me on the \u003cstrong\u003eBorderlands Wikia\u003c/strong\u003e. A person by the alias of \u003cstrong\u003eIceheartAnarchy\u003c/strong\u003e. Who asked me if all the weapons/items I made were still up for download. (as he\u0027d seen their pictures on either the Borderlands Wikia or the \u003cstrong\u003eOld GBX Forums\u003c/strong\u003e) Unfortunately I had to deliver bad news to him as they weren\u0027t and I wasn\u0027t able to upload them as was still \"working\" on a patch for them; eventhough I couldn\u0027t as my old laptop couldn\u0027t run Borderlands anymore because of a installation/removal cock-up. Lucky for him however I was in the market to switch from console to PC and was looking for a new and better PC.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe dawn of a new era.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEventually I did get my hands on a new PC, and what a PC indeed. Bristling with the latest tech. in the PC industry. (\u0027t was considered the best-of-the-best at the time) I felt it was time to get back into the swing of things a finish that \"patch\" I was working on for my \u003cstrong\u003eCustom Made Arsenal\u003c/strong\u003e. To be honest I actually got back into the swing of things because I promised this Iceheart that I would get my arsenal back up for download.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce I started working on my little brainchild again I felt complete and was reminded me again about my passion for Borderlands. With this my creativity went into \u003cstrong\u003eMode 9000+\u003c/strong\u003e and I started working hard on my custom made arsenal again. Before long I had my arsenal back up for download, much to the liking of many as the download page crashed within the 1st hour of uploading by the amount of users that were trying to get their hands on my stuff. Empowered by this I went back to the GBX forums to check out what was \"good in the hood\" with my fellow \u003cstrong\u003eUDK-ers\u003c/strong\u003e. Only to find that the \u003cstrong\u003eBL CCC\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e(Borderlands Custom Content Community), with exclusion of a handful, died out.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003eSpreading the word!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003eQuite shocked at finding out that the BL CCC,\u00a0apart from a few, pretty much died out I decided that I needed to work on grabbing attention towards us. And what better way then to make even more custom weapons/items to show everyone that we\u0027re still here. Unfortunately this didn\u0027t truly cut it and we were still pretty much in the dark. Then I decided to make my own YT channel and make video footage of my BL UDK work and other\u0027s\u0027 to gain attention. This also didn\u0027t start very well as YT-ers who were covering \u003cstrong\u003eBorderlands \u003c/strong\u003e2 were all the hype. At this point I kinda lost hope and removed every video I made about my custom weapons/items.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nContent with the idea of our little community vanishing I went on with my BL UDK work until I\u0027d have enough of it eventually. Time passed and I started playing a new game called\u003cstrong\u003e WarThunder \u003c/strong\u003eand I got pretty good at it. I decided to dust off my old YT channel and upload WarThunder video\u0027s to it. This went on for a little while until I stumbled upon \u003cstrong\u003eHandsomeJackBoy\u003c/strong\u003e\u0027s YT channel, \u003cstrong\u003eHJB\u003c/strong\u003e is a Borderlands YT-er who actually prefers uploading video content about the good ol\u0027 Borderlands 1 game as opposed to many who were doing \u003cstrong\u003eBL2\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eBL:TPS\u003c/strong\u003e content. Within his channel I found a video talking about a \"\u003cstrong\u003eScavenger Shield\u003c/strong\u003e.\" This video went on about someone who made a shield which\u0027ll cause killed enemies to drop various weapon/item collections made by various BL UDK-ers over the history, including my own. HJB went to explain that he really liked my creations and this sparked something within me. Considering HJB\u0027s channel size this single video is what got me back into trying to breath new/more life into the BL CCC! And my creational spirit had never been more ablaze.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003eBorderlands Custom Made Content FTW!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nFrom the moment I discovered HJB\u0027s channel I tried getting in contact with him. Which payed off as we eventually did get in touch. With my newfound inspiration and additions to my arsenal I went ahead and made various \"introductory\" video\u0027s on my weapon/item arsenal which proved to be quite popular (by my standards). HJB also spurred me to do a \u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s Play\u003c/strong\u003e series where I\u0027d go though the campaign of Borderlands using my custom made arsenal. Which also proved to be quite popular. In due time public awareness of the BL CCC scene had risen quite dramatically, granted there were still only 4 of us BL UDK-ers left active; count them \u003cstrong\u003eDopefiend\u003c/strong\u003e, Sleepmaster, \u003cstrong\u003eNolaFTW\u003c/strong\u003e and me. But at least I got the feeling that despite GBX\u0027s negligence towards us creators we were recognised for our hard work and dedication again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTime went by and my YT channel kept growing and I got in touch with other YT-ers like XSpider and Joltzdude who also were willing to help spread the word about the BL CCC in their own way. And all the way through this I kept making more additions to my arsenal and kept improving my old creations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003eGBX... You\u0027re crap mate go home...\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eHowever despite all the newfound friendships and attention I still felt it could be so much more. We were missing something... \u003cstrong\u003eGearbox Software\u003c/strong\u003e! I felt as if the BL CCC could\u0027ve been so much more if GBX would\u0027ve spend more time with us and supporting our hard work. Instead they only shed light on fan art, cosplayers and others who made various BL related props. This kinda got on my bad side and I started to resent GBX for not throwing us a slice of the cake. Instead they went on to cover the 1500th unoriginal f**king Maya cosplay artist. Because \u003cem\u003e\"OMG they worked a whole 2/3 weeks on that outfit. And oh? What\u0027s that? Here have some golden keys to keep you distracted until we showcase yet another halfbaked Krieg cosplayer who\u0027s wearing a 2nd hand Ebay muscle shirt and wears so much Black Marker that we\u0027re confused if its actually Black Marker or tattoo\u0027s! Because no matter how much they scrub it just doesn\u0027t come off!\" \u003c/em\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e(just a heads up, I have NOTHING against ANY Borderlands fan creation. Be it art, cosplay or other. I\u0027m just angry that GBX only puts them in the spotlights. I actually would like to express how awesome I find all the various BL cosplays and BL props. I just hope you can see that we\u0027re also putting a lot of effort into our creations as well.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003eI just figured that if GBX would\u0027ve spend a little more time on us, and putting our work in the spotlights that the BL CCC would\u0027ve been a lot bigger at this current moment in time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003eShowin\u0027 the world how its done!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eDespite various YT-ers and Borderlands Community Contributors\u0027 actions towards raising awareness for a possible UDK/SDK for Borderlands 3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e",
