    "summary": "Hey there, I\u0027m Booker Man, and I write Quests and Fiction. For anyone unaware, Quests are a form of interactive fiction which involve live writing sessions hosted on both the site\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fiction.live\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efiction.live\u003c/a\u003e as well as the /qst/ board of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://boards.4chan.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e4chan.org\u003c/a\u003e. The QuestMaster (myself) posts an update to the story a few paragraphs or pages at a time while any number of players can discuss the story and vote on the next actions of their protagonist. In a sense it\u0027s like a public collaborative version of a tabletop RPG, or a live Choose Your Own Adventure story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike most who produce written content for the internet, writing has always been my dream in life. Originally partaking in Quests as a way to practice and hone my writing skills, it quickly became a true passion of mine. I currently run two quests;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fiction.live/stories/KayfabeQuest/fQ3vDsPYMmXMxjmft/home\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKayfabeQuest\u003c/a\u003e on fiction.live, an action story revolving around the career of a professional wrestler. And my main quest which I have been writing since May 2016 on 4chan.org,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive.html?tags=Dark%20Gate%20Academy\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDark Gate Academy\u003c/a\u003e, an action-comedy which plays on the many tropes of shonen anime. The praise I\u0027ve received for this quests focuses largely on the sprawling casts of memorable and likeable characters, and it\u0027s this response which drives me to produce more and more content. In addition to these quest sessions I will also write stand-alone stories which act as bonus scenes or companion pieces to the quests\u0027 overall story.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, as much as I love writing these quests for my audience I find it difficult to commit my full time to producing this content with life, work and bills often having to take priority. It becomes a struggle to find the time to run, and the rate of my content has slowed as a result, a fact that is frustrating for both my regular players and of course myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make it clear to my players that nobody should feel obligated to donate. Questing is a labour of love, and I will always run my quests to the best of my ability regardless, and I would never hide content behind a paywall. All of my content will be visible to everyone, regardless of pledge. A little help can go a long way, though, and with your support I would be able to produce my content at a greater rate, and perhaps even find the time to run new quests on top of what I currently have. Your support means the world to me, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to supporting me monthly, I can also be commissioned to produce short stories, whether they are related to my quests are not. The rate for these commissions stands at \u00a31 per 100 words and I reserve to right to decline commission requests, whether it be due to the content of the commission or due to a lack of time to adequately produce it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, you shouldn\u0027t feel obliged to pledge, and whether you donate or simply partake in and enjoy my content, I thank you for allowing me to indulge in my passion.\u003cbr\u003e"
