On twitch, I hope to create as entertaining a stream as possible, and by supporting me on Patreon, you are helping me sustain livestreaming as a full-time career. Supporters can pledge any amount, and are free to do so just once, or on a monthly basis. Any and all support is truly appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for the supporters?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0027re choosing to support me on Patreon, you\u0027ve probably already decided that you enjoy my content and wish to show me a little bit of extra support. However, Patreon supporters also get access to certain rewards, in my case ranging from a thank-you on stream to choosing a game for me to play. Feel free to take a look at all of them below! There are also overarching goals which, when met, will serve as a positive change for the stream overall. As an example, my first goal is to commit to highlighting \u003cem\u003eevery\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0first playthrough on my stream. You can see all the goals just over to the left! The rewards and goals may (and probably will) change over time, and I will always be more than open to ideas for new ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will the money contribute to, exactly?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe common response is \"the money will contribute to increasing the quality of the stream\"\u2014and it most certainly will, but the honest answer is that streaming is not yet a financially stable career for me, and a little bit of additional income through Patreon will help me continue to get by. I will always strive to improve the quality of the stream via things like equipment upgrades, and support from my fans will help put me in a position where I can more freely consider that sort of investment. Again, I\u0027m truly thankful for any and all support.\u003cbr\u003e"
