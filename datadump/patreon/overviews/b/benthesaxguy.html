    "summary": "Greetings. Ben The Sax Guy here. Welcome to my Patreon page. If we haven\u0027t met yet, allow myself to introduce... myself. :) I\u0027m a wild, edgy multi-instrumentalist. You may have seen me onstage or in a video with with the critically acclaimed phenomenon that is Postmodern Jukebox. I\u0027m an original member of the group and have been touring regularly with them for the last years. You may have also seen me onstage with notable artists such Dave Matthews, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Neil Patrick Harris, 10,000 Maniacs, and many more acts ranging from rock n roll to Broadway to movie stars. For those of you who live in the tri-state area, you may have seen me taking a nap on a park bench or on the subway. Yup, I\u0027m a bohemian. I play lots of instruments by the way. Sax, clarinet, flute, trumpet, melodica, uke, keys, bass, guitar, vocals, beatbox, percussion, and more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with my reputable role as an instrumental side-person, I have recently found my own voice creatively. This is why both you and I are here. To share our mutual appreciation of all things music! The purpose of this patreon page (the NEW, updated version) is to focus exclusively on recording my favorite songs. Some will be originals, some will be unique arrangements. This is a no-frills experience for the purpose of focusing on the MUSIC. Most songs will be audio recordings. I will throw in some videos when I can. One other creative avenue is that there may also be a few blog entries here and there which are related to music education. I am passionate about music education and it\u0027s important to me to include that in everything I do. Anywho, the goal of this is to do more songs more often, and to bring in other band members and visual specialists as well. Sometimes my schedule is hectic, other times it\u2019s not. Therefore, the \"subscription\" will be per song and not per month. I am very much a part of the New York busking culture, so most of what I do is based on tips/donations. The same concept applies here. Pay what you want, it\u2019s up to you! Happy listening!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
