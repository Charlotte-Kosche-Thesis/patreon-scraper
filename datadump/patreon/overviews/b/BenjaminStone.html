     "about": "Benjamin began in 1997 like many struggling artists, selling few paintings for years and painted houses as a means of survival. However he stayed focused throughout on his visual arts, growing the portfolio for buyers and galleries locally and nationally. \u003cbr\u003eIn 2007, Benjamin began to refocus strongly on music production. He began to produce the works of other artists locally who wanted gig demo\u2019s or music arrangements for RAP, pop, rock, techno and alternative music. These endeavors led to the formation of Void Studio Limited and back to the basic love and passion of his life, composition. \u003cbr\u003eIn 2009 Benjamin moved to downtown Denver where and enlarged and updated his studio, He changed his focus from production of local artists in Denver to full time classical/jazz composition and production. This repositioning has resulted in the Licensing of many of his compositions for commercials, television series production and movie trailers, along with the formation of Granite Symphony Orchestra. \u003cbr\u003eNow, this project and production oriented group of musicians - in tandem with the most advanced sample technology - provides a robust and current sound to his compositions. With an Orchestra that is making things happen on a daily basis, the future is looking bright for Benjamin Stone.\u003cbr\u003e",
