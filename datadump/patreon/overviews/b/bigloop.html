    "summary": "From the co-creator and executive producer of The Black Tapes Podcast comes a new anthology series: THE BIG LOOP. Part horror, part sci-fi, and part dark comedy, some call it \"This American Life meets The Twilight Zone;\" others describe it as \"Love + Radio meets Black Mirror;\" and another group proclaims, \"Stop arguing about what it is and just listen!\" We agree with the last group. We know you\u0027re going to love it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut hiring professional sound engineers and the finest actors in podcast-land costs money. We are trying to round up some advertising dollars but it will barely cover the costs. Plus, we\u0027d like to continue The Big Loop as a full-time endeavor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in. With your support, we can continue writing and producing the finest in audio drama on a bigger and faster scale (that is, shorter breaks between seasons) without losing quality. Listen to the first episode--coming out Halloween 2017--and judge for yourself. The Big Loop aims to create a new space in fictional podcasting. It will feel like you\u0027re listening to an actual episode of some of the best in documentary podcasting--if those series took place in a world full of supernatural and macabre wonder, beauty, and terror.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery season of The Big Loop will feature six unique, self-contained episodes. Take a look at the bonus offerings for Patreon subscribers and see if The Big Loop is something you\u0027d like to support. A little goes a long way here, so anything is greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards will be launched shortly after each new episode\u0027s release. This will provide time for me to collect all the behind-the-scenes materials and tell the full stories of each episode\u0027s productions. (I can\u0027t wait to share the story with our patrons of our music choice for the season premiere!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u003cbr\u003ePaul Bae\u003cbr\u003eProducer/Creator\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
