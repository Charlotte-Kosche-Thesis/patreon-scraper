    "summary": "My name is \u003ca href=\"http://www.bendutter.com/sigil-stone-publishing/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBen Dutter\u003c/a\u003e, and I write and design \u003cstrong\u003etabletop roleplaying games\u003c/strong\u003e. In March 2015, I published \u003cem\u003eVow of Honor\u003c/em\u003e after a successful Kickstarter. During the polishing and publication process, I began working on my next game - \u003cem\u003eHunt the Wicked\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBy the time I got my print proofs for \n\u003cem\u003eVow of Honor\u003c/em\u003e - I had already completed writing and major playtesting for \u003cem\u003eHunt the Wicked\u003c/em\u003e. The game was scheduled to be \u003ca href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sigilstonepublishing/hunt-the-wicked-rpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKickstarted\u003c/a\u003e in September 2015 (which was successful, by the way), and so I set out to create my next game - \u003cem\u003eBelly of the Beast\u003c/em\u003e. Guess what? I finished writing that in April, a whole year ahead of my publication schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou see, I love to write. I love making RPGs. I can\u0027t help myself, and I want to channel that creative energy (more like obsessive anxiety) into improving and expanding the universes and settings that I place my games: the brutal and amoral world of Sasara, the exotic and alien planets of the Vassal Territories, the endless and caustic Evergut, and the many more settings to come from Sigil Stone Publishing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.bendutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/duel-crop-wide-e1430002151157.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eThe Patreon\u003c/h1\u003e\nSo why Patreon? Simply, your patronage will \n\u003cstrong\u003eallow me to write rpg supplements\u003c/strong\u003e that can be used for my games - \u003cem\u003eVow of Honor, Hunt the Wicked\u003c/em\u003e, etc. I want to expand upon these worlds, but it isn\u0027t economically feasible for me to pay my editor, layout designer, and artists to release some $5 or $10 supplement every few months. Quite frankly, I\u0027d be a bit bored with that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nInstead, I want to produce as much solid content as I can, presented in a way that\u0027s digestible and simple for you, and low-cost for me. The games you love and play will only get better, and you can use my ideas and words for inspiration on your own campaigns, gaming projects, hacks, or games using other systems. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u0027s the cool part - \n\u003cstrong\u003ethere\u0027s only one pledge, and it\u0027s for $1\u003c/strong\u003e. Yep, $1 per supplement, you get exclusive content, and I get to burn off that incessant creative \u003cdel\u003eanxiety\u003c/del\u003e passion without losing too much money in the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.bendutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/voh-cover-small-jpeg.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhat\u0027s a supplement?\u003c/h1\u003e\nEach supplement (what you pay $1 for) will consist of \n\u003cstrong\u003eat least one\u003c/strong\u003e of the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e2,000+ words about a particular setting\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTwo d66 random tables for hooks, seeds, disasters, etc (72+ options)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn adventure that\u0027s appropriate for a particular game or setting\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRules expansions, alternatives, or hacks for one of my games\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1,000+ words of fiction (generally in one of my settings)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve written up an \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.bendutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/VoH-Supplement-1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eexample supplement\u003c/a\u003e, a setting expansion for \u003cem\u003eVow of Honor\u003c/em\u003e\u0027s Sasara. It details a city called Tarborand, an economic powerhouse under blockade by roaming bands of Carhai Raiders. This particular supplement is about 3,500 words (17 5.5x8.5\" pages), and gives the GM plenty of flavor and context to run a session (or campaign) in the struggling, corrupt city.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI can\u0027t thank you enough for your support, and hope you enjoy reading my supplements as much as I enjoy writing them."
