In other words, I am trying to offer you the cognitive tools you need to change how you see the world when you need to. In the meantime, I\u0027m creating an endless array of artwork, performances and games to stir the collective consciousness into realizing something of our ultimate potential. These are big promises I know, but it\u0027s somehow working. Have you seen my show? Have you played my games? Have you seen my visions? Have you heard my stories? If you have and you know me and you have read this far than you understand that my kind of magic will need an alternative kind of funding. I need you to become my patron with whatever monthly contribution you can offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.dragonflower.ink/portfolio/wp-content/uploads/wppa/33.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eExactly how we\u0027re going to have an actual stone and mortar school is not yet in scope, but overall the theme in my work is about mind altering perspectives and actualized magic.

Not sure how I feel about tiers for patrons but I will do my best to make being my patron fulfilling on your end. I will hone the projects I am already creating, spawn new projects, and bring you older projects that were never fully produced due to lack of funding. Of these there are many. I\u0027m guessing that though you have seen some of my artwork you would probably be surprised to see all I\u0027ve done. Have you seen this this knot I chiseled out of plaster?

My professor, Barney Haynes said the task was impossible. Those who know me today know that accomplishing the impossible has become something of a hobby of mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis film was only viewed by less than a dozen classmates and my professors and from there went into storage while I began put animation aside for parenting.
