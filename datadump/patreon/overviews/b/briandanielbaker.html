I thought I was going to use my college degree in Mathematics to work 8-5 every day in the corporate office world (which I did do, for years) and get married and have the usual 2.5 kids. But from a young age, I discovered people just felt comfortable opening their lives to me, and that people could look fine on the surface, but underneath be burdened with deep struggles, feeling alone and scared, needing someone to talk to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe artistic side of me developed gradually over the years, in poetry and music mainly. But suddenly I went through a very dark period, and photography emerged and got me through it. I soon discovered how powerful photography could be in helping others too. Before this, I never thought I could be an effective catalyst for changing lives. Now I just want to be faithful to the path set before me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so grateful for the people who have been supportive, helping me to help others. There are many ways we can all find courage amidst life\u0027s hardships. I\u0027ve helped people do this through poetry and music and being active in humanitarian efforts, but\u00a0making nude art is a keen and effective means because it brings the heart, soul, body and mind together in ways we might otherwise miss, and there\u0027s something intrinsically fa\u00e7ade-shattering about it. I created my Patreon account as a practical conduit for those wishing to support my photography as my primary focus right now, as an expression of our shared values.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
