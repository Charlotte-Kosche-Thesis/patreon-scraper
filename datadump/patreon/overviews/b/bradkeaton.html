     "about": "Hello Everyone! \u00a0My name is Brad Keaton and I am a singer/songwriter from Spartanburg, SC. \u00a0I have been singing since I was old enough to talk and even singing harmony from the age of 3. \u00a0I come from a singing family with a background of singing in church. \u00a0I started writing love songs about one girl, at the age of 18. \u00a0I ended up marrying that girl and I am still writing songs about her today. \u00a0I currently lead worship at Brookwood Church in Simpsonville, SC and at Church180 in Rock Hill, SC. \u00a0I am also releasing my first EP, \"That To This\", in April. \u00a0On the EP will be 6 original songs that I know you will love! \u00a0I would describe my music like this: If you were to take Frank Sinatra, Bob Marley, James Brown, Brian McKnight, John Mayer, Rascal Flatts, and Switchfoot, lock them all in a room, and tell them that they can\u0027t come out till they write 6 songs, this is what they would probably come up with. \u00a0I pull from a lifelong musical journey with a broad range of experiences and genres. \u00a0My music is unique, my voice is unique, and I am ready to jump headfirst into the business of writing and singing my music. \u00a0My ultimate goal is to bring glory to God in everything that I do, since he is the one that gave me my gift to sing, and therefore will give me my platform to speak truth to the world through my music, if I continue to be faithful! \u00a0I hope you will join me on my musical journey and will be blessed by my music! \u00a0God Bless!",
