Not only that, but writing for a group of people that have very different ideas of what they want to read can be even more challenging.\u00a0I write furry stories as a hobby, most of them with a macro/micro theme.\u00a0This\nPatreon will be a way for me to be more focused in my writing, and a way to get more free time to actually sit down and pop out something that a lot of my\nfollowers would enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe content is still free in the end, as it gets posted on other websites, but people that support would be helping someone out with their interests. Finished short stories will be posted about a week earlier here for Patrons to read before it is moved to websites like Furaffinity, Weasyl, etc. Backers will also be able to vote on content that you may enjoy more of. Also as a bonus you\nget sneak previews of a novel I\u2019m working on. You can also leave feedback, tell\nme what you like or don\u0027t like, and help make me into a better writer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks for your consideration, and I really can\u2019t wait to get some content up from Patreon! \u003cbr\u003e"
