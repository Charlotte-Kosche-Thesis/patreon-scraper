The answer is \u201cpretty much now\u201d.  After 30+ years of pastoring, counseling,\nmentoring and college teaching.  I am\nexcited to have an opportunity to put some thoughts and reflections into what I\nhope will be a wider conversation.  The\nBar Herlev Scrolls will be a series of articles ranging from biblical studies\nto lived theology and will also include some reflections on counseling and\npersonal growth.  They will also include\nreflections on my own sacred journey in the style of a Frederick Buechner or\nAnnie Dillard \u2013 though I do not presume to be anywhere near their level. What I will be writing emerges from the nexus of biblical study, pop culture, and (occasionally) politics - along with those places in my life and the lives of others where everything get\u0027s broken and life spills all over the floor. I look forward to interacting with a\ncommunity of fellow travelers who are, like myself, fumbling towards wholeness.  This Patreon project, and your interactions\nwith it, will be, I am hoping, the first steps towards compiling a book on\nspiritual theology.  I am so honoured that you are visiting my new\nPatreon page.  I hope you like the free \u201csample\u201d\narticle \u003cem\u003eEmily\u003c/em\u003e and I welcome your\nfeedback.  If you choose to become a \u201cpatron\u201d\nyou will graciously be allowing me to continue with this project and with my\nvocation of soul-crafting.  Thank you so very much! \u00a0Please see the list of rewards and what you can expect on the right hand side of this page,\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Longer Answer:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My name\nis Corey Kim Herlevsen (son of Herlev = Bar-Herlev) and, as ,mentioned, I have\nbeen a counselor, college teacher and pastor for 30 years this very month. In\naddition to many years of experience, I have a Bachelors and Masters Degree\n(both with straight \u201cA\u201ds) as well as a year of chaplaincy training. I am also a\ngeek of truly substantial proportions with an intense interest in pop culture\nwhich seeps into all my writing. While wearing my counselor hat, I specialized\nin walking alongside people who had been abused \u2013 often in church settings \u2013\nand in situations involving depression and /or substance abuse. As a college\nprofessor I was head of the counseling department but I also taught in both the\nOld and New Testament departments along with classes ranging from Ethics to Pop\nCulture. A few years ago I left secluded college life and became instead a\n\u201cstreet chaplain\u201d in a small heavily religious town which, despite having more\nthan 20 churches, had more than ample room for a street chaplain and counselor.\nIn the song \u201cStuck in a Moment\u201d, Bono sings \u201cI\u0027m not afraid of anything in this\nworld/There\u0027s nothing you can throw at me that I haven\u0027t already heard\u201d. I\ndon\u2019t think he\u2019s quite right about that because every story is unique and grace\nalways surprises as does the forms of brokenness we, each of us, carry. Still,\nI have personally experienced and/or walked through life with people who have\nexperienced pretty much everything. I have, in the same week, spoken to college\nconferences attended by suits and degrees and then had a loaded gun pointed at\nmy head by a wild-eyed addict when it was only me and him on that secluded\nproperty. Incredibly, I walked away from both experiences and many like them.  My experiences, along with my family\nbackground are the fertile soil from the midst of which the Bar Herlev scrolls\nemerged and are emerging still.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I am inherently\nallergic to any form of self-promotion so what am I doing here?  In part,\nI am honouring the requests of many students and friends who have repeatedly\nasked me, over the years to do some writing.  Now seems like a good time\nfor the folder of stranded articles, so far seen only by me, to get some\nattention. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I have recently had\nto \u201cretire\u201d due to the fact that I have multiple disabilities. I have bilateral\nMeniere\u0027s disease - a disease of the inner ear which, among other things\ninvolves severe hearing loss, tinnitus, regular bouts of vertigo and occasional\ndifficulties with speech. This is the same condition which caused singer Ryan\nAdams to retire for a few years. In addition, I have an arthritic condition\nwhich renders me unable to walk without the use of arm crutches. These\nconditions, and other health concerns, greatly limit my ability to work and\neven to drive. The same issues limit my physical volunteer work\npossibilities. After checking out Patreon, it seemed like a natural way to\nsupplement our monthly retirement income while also finally responding to the\nrequests of my students and friends to do some writing.  As I write and\nrelease these reflections, you will be effectively allowing me to continue in\nthe vocation of soul-crafting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So why Patreon?  I\nbelieve being a spiritual director, a \u201csoul crafter\u201d and a writer are all the\nnoblest of arts. So what you are going to get from this Patreon page is\narticles, musings and reflections upon spirituality and life from someone with\nmuch experience as a spiritual guide, counselor, teacher and writer. You will\nget the opportunity to share your own journey to the extent you choose. On this\npage, I want to renew the decades long conversation(s) with my students and\nfriends as well as begin new conversations with new friends. Patreon seems a\nmuch more suitable medium and format for this than other forms of social media. \u003cbr\u003e\n My goals include:\u003cbr\u003e\n- \u003cstrong\u003eTo have 200 \u201cpatrons\u201d join me on this voyage of reflection,\nmeditation and spirituality.\u003cbr\u003e\n-  To chat with my patrons and learn from each other. This can be done in\nwritten inter-action, face to face if and where possible, or by Skype or Google\nHangouts. If possible, I would like to arrange a spiritual retreat with some\npatrons. Concomitantly, I would like to have at least half of the patrons as\nactive participants in the conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\n-  To get enough feedback to edit and assemble these bits of writing into\nmy own spiritual practices as well as into a book on spiritual practices. I\nwould like to have the first book completed at the end of the first year.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
