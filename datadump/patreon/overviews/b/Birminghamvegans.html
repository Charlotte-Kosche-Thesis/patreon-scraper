As of January 2018 we have over \u003cstrong\u003e5,500\u003c/strong\u003e members, a number which has doubled from last year! The group is currently growing at over \u003cstrong\u003e200 members per month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe believe that helping the vegan community grow and prosper is a highly effective form of activism. We have seen hundreds of people transition to veganism thanks to the support of the group and friends they have made through\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eit at our free to attend events.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eThis is why we spend significant amounts of time every day\u003cstrong\u003e approving new membership requests and \u003c/strong\u003emoderating the discussions taking place within the FB Group to maintain a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. We also offer direct 1-2-1 \nvegan support to anyone who requests it via the membership entry \nquestion or by contacting an admin directly once within the group.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBesides our time, we have also incurred some expenses running the group such as advertisements, \nprinting costs (leaflets, business cards), vegan food/items for more \nevents and public engagement and venue/festival stall hire.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eAll group expenses over the last 3 and 3/4 years have been paid for by \nthe admins\u0027 own money and with a small amount of money left over from \nour Mr Singh\u0027s monthly pizza order where we receive a bulk-purchase \ndiscount of 10%. We believe with your support as Patrons we can do even more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e How about a continuous Facebook advert to people in Birmingham for the group? How about bigger and better free to attend vegan events with free vegan food and goodie bags? How about free vegan information leaflets for all our members? How about newspaper adverts? How about billboard advertisements? This is all possible if we have more funding.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
