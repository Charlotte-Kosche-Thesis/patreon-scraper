I have been fascinated with the sea since I was a young girl - I\u2019ve studied marine biology for years, and want to share my love and knowledge of sea creatures with you! \u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of BST is to educate, promote awareness, foster love and appreciation, and emphasize the importance of wildlife conservation. \u003cbr\u003eThe BST shop has been open online for 5 years now, and I\u2019ve been showcasing my artwork in Artist Alleys at conventions for about 3 years. With Patreon, I hope to increase the number of shows I attend each year and branch out to new shows, in new cities! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://bytesizetreasure.com/wp-content/uploads/whypatreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently work a full-time job as a Graphic Designer in DC to pay the bills, but I my goal is to make BST a full-time endeavor.

You can pledge as much as you want to get cool rewards based on your subscription level! \u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon operates on a monthly basis. Each month, I\u2019ll be very active - posting sketches that I don\u2019t post anywhere online, previews of upcoming merch, discount codes for my online shop, timelapse videos, digital and physical rewards, and much more! Expect to see lots of sea creatures - both real and imagined.

You\u2019ll also get access to the patron-only poll, where you can vote on what I work on next. Patrons also get early access to any new merchandise with discounts, plus dibs on commission spots when I open them in the future. I\u2019ll also have digital reward files for patrons to download (such as wallpapers, coloring pages, and more).
