    "summary": "Hello everyone and welcome to the relaunch of our Patreon page. I first want to thank all of you who have been here from the beginning. We hope you will stick around as we evolve. This has been very telling first year and, because the landscape has changed so quickly, we must adjust. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m here to introduce you to\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003e#BecomeUngovernable\u003c/strong\u003e. Our goal is to motivate people to join us in the battle for the common good, and that is taking control of our nation back from the elites and their puppets in Washington. In order to do that, we need people power, not politician power. After organizing since November 2016, we realize that the biggest stumbling block on our road to recovering our democracy is that people are not aware of the power they possess and, even if they are, they have no idea how to use it. We are dedicated to our cause, and have been using personal funds to set up our web site at \u003ca href=\"http://www.becomeungovernable.net\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.becomeungovernable.net\u003c/a\u003e as well as our site dedicated to the May Day, Labor Day and Election strikes planned for 2018 at \u003ca href=\"http://www.becomeungovernable.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.becomeungovernable.org\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRealizing that we have a whole universe beyond social media, we have contracted for #BecomeUngovernable Radio, and want to take the show on the road. However, now, we will be tapped out paying for a year\u0027s worth of our services, and have tried to raise money with GoFundMe and tee shirt sales.This has been sporadic at best.\u003cem\u003e If we want to reach people who are disenfranchised, elderly, or poor, we need to go to them\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur educational tour now becomes an action tour, bring real power to the people. Aside from strikes, we need continuous acts of civil disobedience, and a general refusal to cooperate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere can be no \"revolution\" from within this system. As Jill Stein has said, \"It\u0027s in our hands.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease take the time to look at our plans and our rewards program that goes along with being a supporter of #BecomeUngovernable. If you have specific questions, please feel free to email me at \u003ca href=\"mailto:become.ungovernable@gmail.com\"\u003ebecome.ungovernable@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANKS.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
