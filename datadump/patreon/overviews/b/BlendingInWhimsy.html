Whether my art speaks to you or not, it is a process just like you. It\u0027s fluid and changeable. Nothing is concrete. All is whimsy. What you embrace or deny is up to you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI assume that right now you are just blending in, getting by and afraid to make waves.

From art supplies to training, the expenses add up. Though I have the mind of an artist I have the heart of a mother and I don\u0027t want to deplete the family bank account as I pursue this passion. Money can be a dream killer for those of us on tight budgets. Expenses can (and often do) dull the vision and hinder the work of an artist. I don\u0027t want to be a starving artist, I want to be a thriving artist. I want to keep momentum and expand my portfolio.
