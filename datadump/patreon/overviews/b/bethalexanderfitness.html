The specifics you go into (screw your feet into the floor, push the floor away from you, etc) is what made every exercise target the exact muscle it was meant to.\u201d - Angela A.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u201cHave to admit it is the best fitness program I\u0027ve done so far and greatly recommend it!
