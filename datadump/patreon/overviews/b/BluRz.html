BUT, I can only turn this up a notch with your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(141, 179, 226);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLETS GET YOUR KNOWLEDGE ON PAR\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon and how would you be helping?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a website designed for creators, such as myself, who are looking for support in areas where they cannot do certain things themselves. Since the beginning of my channel, I have been doing everything myself, which includes spending hours on end editing videos, live streaming, capturing footage for the channel and more. Unfortunately this comes at a cost. Almost all of it costs the creator money, which at the end of the day, is for your entertainment. I have been able to cover almost all of the costs myself, but I feel as if we have reached a point where, in order for things to get better, more money needs to get laid down on the table, money that I unfortunately, this time around, cannot lay down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to get to the point where I can reward people and \"employee\" people to do things such as edit my videos, the coding behind my streams and/or even a camera man for better and more consistently posted vlogs!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO ULTIMATELY, WHAT WILL I BE DOING WITH YOUR MONEY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, first things first, is that I want to change the \"what will I be doing\" to \"what will WE be doing\", as I mentioned above, HIRE PEOPLE TO HELP ME.\u003cbr\u003eBy doing this, I can assure you that more content will be posted on my channel as we have more people helping around the clock, who I can then pay and support in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease take note of the following:\u003c/strong\u003e I have never asked for anybody\u0027s actual \"payment\" support. YouTube was suppose to be a hobby for myself, but now fortunately, other people enjoy it. I just want to make it more enjoyable with the likes of new equipment, and a better team!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is the part, where you come in.
