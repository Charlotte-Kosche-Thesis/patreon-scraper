Thank you for finding us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince our inception our mission has been to nurture and grow new music, ideas, talent, views and voices.\u00a0Creating high quality radio programming and bringing together Birmingham\u0027s arts and music scene is part of Brum Radio\u0027s DNA. Brum Radio is innovative, independent and distinctive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are building a unique online platform, championing Birmingham\u2019s Artists, Poets, Musicians, Actors and Presenters. We believe in our city and want to offer a viable alternative to mainstream radio. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince our launch in February 2016 we have had people tuning in not just from Birmingham but from all over the world, steadily growing to over a half a million minutes listening time - or over 17 hours a day. Our content has grown accordingly and we are now putting out more than 50 hours of live radio per week, ranging from specialist music shows, short stories and poetry, film and book shows and various interview and talk shows.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis output is bolstered by music programming that delivers music exclusively from local artists, both brand new and long established. This is a deliberate programming policy, cementing our links with our music scene; a scene we are proud to support and celebrate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBrum Radio has based  its home and studio in Digbeth, a hub of alternative thinking since the 1970\u0027s.\u00a0Brum Radio is not-for-profit and does not receive any public funding. Any funds we receive go straight back into the station and our programming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to keep developing and growing Brum Radio and we would love your help along the way. With your support we can keep making great radio in, about and for Birmingham - and the rest of the world. Radio that punches far above our weight. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.brumradio.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewww.brumradio.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/l/t1.0-9/14440858_1776111732669966_3710252141112213252_n.jpg?oh=078e4195636c9ccd5a85647426724793\u0026amp;oe=5866209B\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
