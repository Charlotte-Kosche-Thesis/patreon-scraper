It is in response to this that I have changed this Patreon back to having Brutalewd\u0027s Patrons donate \"per month\". I\u0027m still working on the next animated episode and have rough plans for more to follow, but how quickly that progresses has admittedly little to do with this Patreon. (It\u0027s more closely tied into how busy I am in IRL-life, and boy howdy has this year been a busy one.)\u003cbr\u003eThere is also a Brutalewd point-n-click adventure game in the pipeline, but it\u0027s a very on-again off-again experimental project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what else do I need besides money to keep the comics coming? I need your input! Primarily in the form of \"Asks\" directed at Brutalewd and Flutterschiavo! Look for the Ask-buttons on those blogs and send in your questions and suggestions, and you never know - you might end up cameoing just for asking a good question.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove \u0026amp; metalness,\u003cbr\u003e-BrutaMod\u003cbr\u003e"
