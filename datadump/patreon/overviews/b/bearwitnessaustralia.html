    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome may know me at Witness #1 but my name is also Lissy Jayne. I started Bear Witness Australia as a facebook page as an outlet for otherwise unused material and untold stories and soon to explore my interest in the art of photography.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been investigating, documenting and occasionally rescuing at farms, slaughterhouses, hatcheries, saleyards, zoos and more the past 4.5 years. A couple years into these investigations primarily with \u003ca href=\"http://www.aussiefarms.org/\"\u003eAussie Farms\u003c/a\u003e, I found myself swamped with unused material and untold stories. The goal of Aussie Farm has always been to unveil the hidden aspects of animal agriculture. In order to demonstrate the wide spread and representative nature of the finding from Aussie Farms investigations, we would\u00a0document as much of the happenings from inside as many of these facilities as possible to make the truths about them and their practices undeniable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough that, we meet incomprehensible amount of animals. Night after night of investigating a slaughterhouse we would be faced with hundreds more individuals we would briefly see, never to be seen again. At farms we could meet thousands at a time, all whose fate we knew too well. Some of them would befriend us; piglets wanting to nibble our feet and play, turkeys wanting to inspect our cameras and cattle trying to follow us home. A lot would fear us; as humans, we take the form of those who cut their tails off, take away their babies, and who would ultimately kill them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we documented the practices and conditions, a growing desire to to capture the essence of some of these animals I would meet along the way built in me. I increasingly felt the weight of knowing I could be the only person they would ever meet in their short lives who did not wish to harm them. This is when I started photographing with not just the intent to capture conditions and practices in mind, but also to the individuals. In order to best do this I started taking more of an interest in the intricacies of photography, taking opportunities to up-skill with some academic training and lots of practicing.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoon after that even photos didn\u0027t seem enough either. I often felt burdened by not being able to convey everything I felt and saw from behind the lens of a camera. Image, I believe tells only a portion of a story. I try, often in-vain to do justice to the complete experience with the camera. However photos could not describe to the viewer an eye-contact connection between the investigator and an imprisoned or the unique bitter sweet and tragic interactions one can have with them. It can\u2019t describe the density or the smell of the air- the cold, the humidity or ammonia in your eyes and lungs. And can not fully represent what it feels like to be in a facility with imprisonment on such a massive scale. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo endeavor to do the animals I meet justice to the best of my ability, Bear Witness Australia is my outlet to tell their stories with both words and photos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Bear Witness Australia\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBear Witness Australia  is a collective of photographers of varying skills who endeavours to share the stories of animals used in Australia via photo journalism of animals used in Australia. It began by one photographer as a facebook page into 2015 since become incorporated in 2017 and now compromises of 8 phtotgraphers/Witnesses from 3 states of Australia. Our work has been displayed at the \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/146500862585546/\"\u003eVegan Spring Festival\u003c/a\u003e last year, and used as campaign material (always free of charge) by organisations such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AussieFarms/\"\u003eAussie Farms\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/savemovement/\"\u003eThe Save Movement,\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BeFairBeVegan/\"\u003eBe Fair Be Vegan,\u003c/a\u003e and the biggest Animal Rights page on facebook around the world called \u0027\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/garytvcom/\"\u003eThe Best Video You Will Ever See\u003c/a\u003e\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBear Witness Australia Expansion\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have over time been inspired by other activists bearing witness. Especially those without a platform with no doubt catalogued stories they, (like I) have had in their hearts without an outlet; so I want to provide an outlet. I want to see Bear Witness Australia become a collection of images and stories from an array of people bearing witness to animal suffering where-ever it may be occurring. Whether it be farms, transportation trucks, vigils, zoos, pet shops, sale yards, hunting, circuses, Royal shows, animal testing, etc etc. Animal exploitation is so very laced through Australian culture, economy and tradition that once we become aware of it, we can bear witness to animal\u2019s suffering everyday. If you have an image and or a story you want to share, please send them through, (refer to \u2018contact us\u2019 page). The posts can be anonymously posted as \u2018guest witness\u2019 and can be sent to me via a Proton email account (encrypted email), or can be credited shared as your own story, photo and work or you may become a regular contributor as one of the Bear Witness Witnesses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
