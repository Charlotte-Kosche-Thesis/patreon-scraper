    "summary": "Hello, I am Nichole D\u0027Angelo.  From the first TRS-80 computer that I remember owning I have been an addicted gamer.  I remember my mom screaming at me to get off the computer as I waited the 10 minutes it would take to load flight simulator on that device so long ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs time went on my addiction continued to grow and my computers evolved into better, faster and more capable ones.  When I had my Commodore 128 I purchased a game at Walden\u0027s Books named Elite and that was the game that pushed me over the edge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe mid 80\u0027s until he late 90\u0027s my gaming centered around two genres, Flight Sims/Space Sims and Turn Based/Real Time Strategy .  The games I spent most of my time on were the Wing Commander and Privateer series, Civilization and it\u0027s sequels and the Falcon 3.0 and 4.0 series.  I played each of these games for hours and hours and never regretted a second of it.  If you asked me my absolute favorites, it would be the Space Sims from Chris Roberts\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years I was mostly into Flight Sims, and then in 1998 someone bought me copy if Everquest.  This was the first detour away from the above.  EQ lead to EQ2 and Str Wars Galaxies and eventually World of Warcraft.  I fell deep for this genre and even started a Podcast called The Addicted Gamer where I interviewed Developers, Podcasters and Game Players.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is where I have been unit last summers Steam Sale.  I purchased Kerbal Space Program and fell in love with building and launching rockets.  KSP reintroduced me to youtube and I began watching every video Scott Manley made on KSP.  Then one day Scott released a video named \"Before Star Citizen there was Wing Commander\".  I passed over it thinking, \"Oh no!  Has Chris Roberts suddenly decided to try to make real rockets and went about my happy days building rockets and heading off to Minmus, The  M\u00fcn and Duna.  Eventually my love for KSP lead to this video \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWFZwFfg-28\u0026amp;list=PLw3YqakMx_L1aUXojj9ChrapH2n2XHywX\u0026amp;index=2\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWFZwFfg-28\u0026amp;list=P...\u003c/a\u003e and so began my youtube channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell I eventually watched that Scott Manley video and I rushed over to the RSI website and created an account.  At the time I was broke, in debt and hurting as bad as anyone could financially.  I couldn\u0027t pledge for one of the amazing starships and instead had to wait. \u00a0Finally on August 27, 2013 I took the plunge and pledged for the game.  It was everything I was looking for.  A genre that included MMORPG elements, a Space Combat sim, trading, First Person Shooter and so much more.  I then subscribed and created a thread in the Subscribers Den that has now reached over 11,000 comments. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn October I started to play around with doing regularly released youtube videos on Star Citizen, KSP and War Thunder.  Little by little things started to come in line.  I now produce 3 different shows and a podcast.   Star Citizen AA for news related to the Star Citizen Universe, Let\u0027s Pew Pew with Nikki Batgirl D\u0027Angelo, for let\u0027s play videos related to Star Citizen and Elite Dangerous, and The Addicted Gamer which will be a collection of videos base on all the other games I like to play.  War Thunder AA and Kerbal Space Program AA are still there just in case I create a video for one of those, but they will not be regularly produced like the other three.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom here it all depends on how successful this campaign is.  I am looking to up the quality of the videos and introduce more compelling content.   So far I have started to create a set, and learn about lighting.  I am sure that with your help, my addiction will continue as will the content I create for all of you.\u003cbr\u003e"
