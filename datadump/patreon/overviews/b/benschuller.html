Last year I made the leap to the Music City: Nashville, USA. Jumping head on into the music industry has proven to be more than a full time job, and that\u0027s why Patreon is such a cool platform for independent artists like me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThink of this Patreon page as a Youtub tip jar.\u003c/strong\u003e\n If you were to pass me singing on the street and think you \nwould put a dollar in my guitar case, then this is a new, fun way to do just that (with perks!) Donating even just $1 per month gets you \nexclusive stuff just for Patreons! \u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour support would mean the world to me.\u003c/strong\u003e I want to keep making the best music I can for all of you, and your contribution, no matter how small, will help me \ndo just that. I will use your donations to improve the quality of all \nfuture songs and videos, and get them out as quickly as possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for visiting my page\u003c/strong\u003e, and please check out the different donation levels below to see what cool stuff you can get by being my Patreon!"
