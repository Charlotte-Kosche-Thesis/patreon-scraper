Since setting up the Meetup, it has also become a way to \u003cstrong\u003elink boardgame groups\u003c/strong\u003e with each other, \u003cstrong\u003epromote\u003c/strong\u003e a whole range of different events and help to \u003cstrong\u003ebuild a community\u003c/strong\u003e around this great hobby of ours.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs boardgaming is such a social pastime, we\u0027re always looking for new ways to  be part of the wider cardboard community - supporting designers through \n\u003cstrong\u003eplaytesting\u003c/strong\u003e, organising \u003cstrong\u003ego-sees and trips\u003c/strong\u003e to other boardgaming events around the UK, \u003cstrong\u003etweeting\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eblogging\u003c/strong\u003e from conventions and generally getting involved in conversations that celebrate the diversity of all things gamey.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can check out the Meetup group here \u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Plymouth-BoardGames-Meetup\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.meetup.com/Plymouth-BoardGames-Meetup\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhy do we need your help?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe events listed by Plymouth Boardgames Meetup are all run by \n\u003cstrong\u003evolunteers \u003c/strong\u003ewho enjoy\u003cstrong\u003e creating opportunities\u003c/strong\u003e for as many people as possible to \u003cstrong\u003eplay games\u003c/strong\u003e together. For this reason, all of the regular Meetup events at Prime are \u003cstrong\u003efree to attend\u003c/strong\u003e, costing players only the price of a drink of two which helps to keep it worthwhile for our venues and affordable for \u003cstrong\u003enew\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eregular players\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, listing events on Meetup costs money and that\u0027s what we\u0027re looking to recoup through this Patreon campaign. We\u0027re hoping that by encouraging \n\u003cstrong\u003ea few people\u003c/strong\u003e to contribute\u00a0every month, we can \u003cstrong\u003ebreak even\u003c/strong\u003e and if \u003cstrong\u003elots of people\u003c/strong\u003e are in the position to support us, we can make even\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ebigger\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ebetter events\u003c/strong\u003e. This is about a \u003cstrong\u003ecommunity coming together\u003c/strong\u003e and making itself sustainable in the long-run. If that\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003esomething you\u0027d like to part of\u003c/strong\u003e, you should definitely \u003cstrong\u003emake a pledge\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhat if I\u0027m skint?
