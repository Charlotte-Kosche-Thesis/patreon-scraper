I have nystagmus and oscillopsia, which \ncauses my vision to constantly move on its own, even when I\u0027m asleep (so\n I don\u0027t go into REM sleep). Since I can\u0027t drive, walk outside with out \nsupervision or work, I started using art and voice acting as an outlet \nsince high school and have become a person of trade to make up for what I\n lack! I work extremely hard on each piece I create and put a lot of \nlove into every creation. Since I can\u0027t work anymore, I have to try and make a living somehow, and using my art and voice acting to my advantage seems like the best idea! I have days where I\u0027m stuck in bed, and I\u0027d love to save up enough form a better setup that I can do from my bed, even when I can\u0027t move. I would love if you could help support me, so I can make better entertainment for you!\u003cbr\u003e"
