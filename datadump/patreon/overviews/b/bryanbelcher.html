Coming here is one of many ways you can support the work that I do. And each step is just as important. My work that I put out will always be 100% free to access but by using Patreon you can become a part of the action. So\u2026. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://imgur.com/a/4tego\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/AaggPDI.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWelcome to the inside of my brain.\u003c/em\u003e Patreon is the place to learn about everything that I\u2019m planning and working towards for the Half Empty E-Tank (HEET) Twitch and YouTube channels. Depending on your support, you may even play a role on what I end up doing! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an idea guy. I\u0027ve got a million ideas going through my head at any given moment but I\u0027m in a constant battle with time and money. I\u0027m hoping that through Patreon you can help me with that money issue. With your support, I\u2019ll be able to commit my full time efforts to creating new content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFAQ:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Bryan Belcher and why should I care about his projects?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m the creator and content director for Half Empty E-Tank (HEET) and Mega Man-athon (charity event). Do you like original content made for gamers in the 25 to 40 year old range? Because that\u2019s my wheelhouse. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Half Empty E-Tank?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/f8dpyYn.png\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHEET is and has been a lot of things. Currently we\u2019re a team of community streamers on Twitch doing a variety of streams every single day. You can tune in at 8PM ET to 12PM ET every day and find a member of the team streaming. I currently stream every Friday night and you can often find me playing retro games or beating myself with games that no one should be allowed to play. But you\u2019ll often find me on several other nights of the week as I pop up on Mondays, Wednesday and Thursday streams regularly. Otherwise I\u2019ll be in the chat under the \u201cHalfEmptyEnergyTank\u201d name. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that\u2019s not it! I\u0027m also the content director for the HEET YouTube channel as well. Currently a more behind the scenes player but that\u2019s a lot of what this Patreon is going to help with. I\u0027ve got around 5 new shows that I\u2019d like to add. You can see a few of my contributions as the main video editor but also as part of the cast of all the Club videos. I\u0027m also the special effects editor for our main show, Dear Diary with Brittany Saturn. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the Mega Man-athon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Uaq1FzH.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s a 72 hour Mega Man marathon to raise money for Child\u2019s Play. HEET hosts the event every year live at MAGFest and on the front page of Twitch. So far we\u2019ve raised over $21,000! We\u2019ll be back for Mega Man-athon 6 at MAGFest 2018!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill the money I spend here go directly towards HEET projects? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot directly. Most of the funds raised on Patreon will go to make sure that I\u2019ve got food on the table at the end of the day. Which will indirectly help HEET as that\u2019ll give me time to worry about projects for the channels. My life revolves around HEET and creating projects for it. Supporting me is supporting HEET. But more than likely none of the funds will help other members of the team.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
