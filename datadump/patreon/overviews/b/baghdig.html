    "summary": "Hi there, for those who do not know me my name is Baghdig, I started making videos as a hobby which then became a passion eventually starting 2 communities in Montreal\u00a0(\u003ca href=\"http://www.whatsupmtl.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWhat\u0027s Up Montreal? \u003c/a\u003e\u0026amp; \u003ca href=\"http://montrealyoutbers.wix.com/youtubemtl\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMontreal YouTubers\u003c/a\u003e). Being a recent graduate from University, I am expected to start a career, dive into the world of becoming a full fledged adult who has to pay bills and contribute to the society. I\u0027ve got no problem with that. The only stuff stopping me are these communities I\u0027ve started. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, these 2 projects grew at an expectational rate causing the impossibility of stopping them. \u003ca href=\"http://www.whatsupmtl.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWhat\u0027s Up Montreal? \u003c/a\u003e has over 40 contributors who collaborate to create content about Montreal\u0027s communities, arts \u0026amp; culture and things see and do in the city. This project enables an entry point for many artists and dedicated individuals to reach their dream to work in the entertainment industry. By providing internships and opportunities, the project members have created a sense of belonging within the community and has helped many overcome life\u0027s struggles of depression \u0026amp; low-self esteem. This project provides a platform for artists to collaborate and explore their abilities in the media industry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://montrealyoutbers.wix.com/youtubemtl\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMontreal YouTubers\u003c/a\u003e connects the Montreal YouTube content creators by networking on a regular basis and creating a physical space which will increase their potential creativity.\u00a0Providing a place to reconvene for more than 200 individuals has played an impact in the creation process of each artist who takes part in the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I will be able to fund some of the activities by donating a portion of your contribution. The other portion will go to newer equipment which will allow me to make more quality videos to entertain you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan on working in the entertainment industry for the long-run. If I can get your support, you are making my dreams come true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
