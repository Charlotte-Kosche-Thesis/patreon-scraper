    "summary": "First, I want to thank you for even clicking the Patreon linking and even debating if you should support the channel(s).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAbout The Creator:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo just a little about myself. My name is Jacob, but you can call me Jake and most people online just call me \"Breaking.\" I am a\u00a022-year-old undergraduate Film student and aspiring screenwriter for both television and film. I spend most of my free time reading, watching, or studying screenwriting. That\u0027s basically me summed up; I eat, sleep, drink, and upload screenwriting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWhat My Channel(s) is/are About:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, the only channel I have active is my Breaking TWD channel, Which is my channel dedicated to breaking down and explaining episodes, theories, predictions, characters, etc. From the hit, AMC tv show The Walking Dead and sometimes Fear The Walking Dead. I make videos explaining the hints to look out to see when a character is may be killed off, how a\u00a0plot character impacts the story, why certain events happened the way they did, why they writers changed some things from the comics, and much more. I have two other channels I wish to start uploading to, Breaking Movies, and Breaking TV. The former for breaking down and explaining movies, and the latter for breaking down and explaining other tv shows such as Bad Robot, Stranger Things, the Punisher, etc. However, I have not made it to the point where I can spend the time to make videos on those channels without it hurting my B-TWD channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eHow Does A Patreon Help Me? Why Don\u0027t I Just Get A Job?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst to tackle the job aspect, when my channel first started in Early 2016 I had a full time job as a custodian who was single-handedly responsible for 2 large government facilities one filled with science labs and both had over 100 people working there. I am used to working hard. However, between working there full-time and going to school, I was too drained to really make QUALITY videos consistently and to study screenwriting. A situation happened, where I quit the job and ever\u00a0since then I have been able to take my school work and my videos to the next level, and with your help, I can take it even beyond that. Since my main channel, Breaking TWD is a small channel, it is hard just to keep it growing. I can\u0027t go more than a few days without uploading while working on a video without it hurting it\u0027s\u00a0growth and views. Which limits the amount of information and work I can put in each video.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, even if you choose not to fincinally support me :)\u003cbr\u003e"
