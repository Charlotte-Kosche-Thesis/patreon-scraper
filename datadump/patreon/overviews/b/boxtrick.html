But we have been committed to bringing as much content as often, as possible. We have Videos on YouTube: Reviews, Unboxings, Pickups etc. As well as a Podcast on Podbean and iTunes. We want to continue to crank put as much content as possible, talking old and new games. If you like the SNES or Sega Genesis, RPGS, Hidden Gems, chances are this podcast is for you!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a great way to engage with the audience, and allows you to help support the show, it is not required, but always appreciated. We don\u0027t want to go down the ads route on youtube, as we feel it one is annoying, and two hurts the product. We don\u0027t want third party companies benefiting from our show, the only people we want supporting the show is ...well us, but you if you want to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you will get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEarly Access to the podcast and videos, we do at least one podcast a week, that will always appear on Podbean, iTunes etc. On youtube we do video game music remixes, as well as videos, that sometimes come from our podcasts. We focus mostly on the 8,16, and 32 bit era of games, but of course talk about new stuff as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
