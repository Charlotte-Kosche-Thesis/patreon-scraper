Unfortunately, love doesn\u0027t pay the bills. \u00a0Besides the basics of food, shelter, etc, I also have student loans that I\u0027m trying to pay off. In order to fund all of that I have to work a lot, which means I have less and less time to dedicate to writing and editing and making decent stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny and all money that you can give me here will go towards paying off those bills and reducing my stress. \u00a0With more time, I can dedicate myself to writing and editing more every day, and give you all better quality work on a more regular basis. And what\u0027s not to like about better quality?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if I don\u0027t hold up my end of the bargain, I don\u0027t deserve your money. \u00a0If I miss posts, then you won\u0027t get charged. \u00a0That\u0027s only fair, right? You give me what you can, and I\u0027ll make sure to give you the work I\u0027ve promised. That means that you get at least one story a day, all posted up on butsowhat.wordpress.com. So, donate what you think is worth those little rambles.\u003cbr\u003e"
