    "summary": "The Boots\nOff Podcast was created to allow military veterans to share their unique career\ntransition experiences with prospective recruits, current service members, and\nother veterans in a casual forum. Air Force veteran Mike Lahrman welcomes BOP\nguests to discuss their journey into the military, highlights of their time in\nservice, and their transitions into the civilian world. The Boots Off Podcast launched\non Veteran\u2019s Day 2017 and is currently a monthly show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe podcast\nis a passion project. In addition to his full-time job and being a husband and\nfather, BOP host Mike Lahrman produces the podcast solo. He coordinates episode\nplanning, conducts interviews, edits, and uploads each episode. He also handles\nthe show\u2019s social media presence. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThere is no\ncharge to listen to the podcast, and guests are very gracious to donate their\ntime as well. Aside from the time invested in running the Boots Off Podcast, there\nis a financial cost to maintain a web host. There are no sponsors at this time,\nand there is absolutely no intent to bother the valued listeners with ads for\nunderwear, hiring websites, website websites, or anything else that\u2019s typically\nmarketed at a high volume on nearly every other podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Boots\nOff Podcast is and will continue to be a valuable asset to those currently\nserving in the military as well as anyone who is interested in the experiences\nof military veterans. That includes everyone from graduating high school\nstudents to civilian hiring managers; from soon-to-be-retired military members\nto Airmen/Marines/Sailors/Soldiers wondering how to deal with being medically\nseparated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you\nfor your time. Download the Boots Off Podcast on iTunes or Google Play to\nlisten!\u003cbr\u003e"
