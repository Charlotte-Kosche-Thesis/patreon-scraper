    "summary": "Hello visitor!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m working on some interactive, erotic games. The first is called \u003cstrong\u003eThe eWardrobe\u003c/strong\u003e, currently being developed in Twine\u0027s Sugarcube 2.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe eWardrobe is set it in the near future, where pretty much everything is the same except most modern homes have a cloud-based electronic closet, which allows them to manage a huge clothing library. You play as the job-hunting Danny Jones, a young man who\u0027s spending the summer at his aunt\u0027s cottage in a new town. Danny didn\u0027t bring any clothing him, and his aunt\u0027s eWardrobe thinks he\u0027s Sasha, his \"partygirl\" cousin.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe eWardrobe is currently in its alpha stage, with a few deep storylines and choices that are both cosmetic and plot-changing. I would like to see each storyline have a finished conclusion, with unique endings highly tailored to the players\u0027 choices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is an older version that is free to download. There\u0027s a current version that is accessible for patrons. Please do not play either unless you\u0027re old enough to use erotic entertainment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent Projects:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003eThe eWardrobe.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eTwine game, story-driven. \u00a0Cross-dressing, XXX content, m2f changes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy should you be a Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003eI didn\u0027t know much HTML before working on The eWardrobe. I\u0027ve spent a lot of time re-doing the same content because I would learn something new and realize I\u0027d been doing everything incorrectly the whole time. A lot of time was spent figuring out how to Google what I wanted to know. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m making progress on The eWardrobe and feel like my Twine understanding is growing with it. I\u0027m already excited about what the next project will involve, and plan on it being a sandbox style game.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve sunk a lot of time into The eWardrobe so far, and would like to continue. I plan on releasing large monthly updates through the end of the year. Once The eWardrobe is done I would like to continue with more games, such as the sandbox style idea. In order to make The eWardrobe even better (such as by adding media) and in order to make more games I\u0027m hoping people will pledge their support. If there is no interest that is totally fine! The eWardrobe will be finished regardless, but I won\u0027t spend money on media and I\u0027ll likely retire from game creating after it\u0027s complete.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledges will be on a monthly system. Each month a new version will be posted and the previous version will be made public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have a question, please leave it here or email me at brickdoorway@gmail.com. Thank you so much for stopping by, I hope you have a great day."
