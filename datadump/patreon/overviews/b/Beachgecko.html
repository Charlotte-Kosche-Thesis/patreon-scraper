    "summary": "Three years ago, I started doodling little drawings with the intent to make stickers. People seemed to really love that idea! So, I kept on doing it and eventually quit my full time job and worked part time to do my art store full-time. Things have slowed down in the recent year, so my goals shifted to more traditional art and prints. Art is no longer my 60 hours a week job, just the way I want it to be!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still do trade shows with my artwork on tables, but now it\u0027s more of a hobby again. I still have so many fans, acquaintances and close friends I met through my artwork, so I wanted to give back to all of you while still making a great thing out of my art at the same time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon makes this possible! Helping me through school now to the next part of my life. The more pledges I receive, the better equipped I am for school and the less time I have to work at my day job while doing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat am I going to school for? To be an engineer and use my love of the environment to better the renewable energy we have already begun to delve in. One step at a time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt can help make this all possible. Art is life.\u00a0"
