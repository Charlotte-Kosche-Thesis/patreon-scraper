    "summary": "Hello Bat-Fans!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Robert Wood, husband, father, hacker, and the guy behind\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://buildingthebat.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBuilding The Bat\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0This is my project to design, develop, and execute on a blueprint for how a person could build themselves into a hero like Batman; ultimately becoming the best version of themselves. Why do this? I believe that everyone has potential in them, potential that can do some good in this world and that there are many different ways to contribute to everybody\u0027s benefit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started this project from the question that many have explored as to whether Batman \u003cstrong\u003ecould\u003c/strong\u003e exist in this world? I believe this is the wrong question. I think it\u0027s more appropriate to ask whether he \u003cstrong\u003ewould\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0choose to exist as we know him?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBatman is adaptable, flexible, and always training to prepare for the next threat he may face. In this world, we face threats that are just as crazy in many rights as those detailed in the comics and movies we love. Using his guiding principles, how might we develop the skills we need to be a force for good in this world, to change things, to help people, to raise the next generation of leaders? These are all questions I strive to answer through this project, using myself as the front line experiment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e100% of support funds will go into the development of the project, everything from the website hosting, equipment, training, to experiments. Regardless of whether you choose to become a patron, I am super appreciative of you stopping by and I hope you enjoy the content as much as I enjoy creating it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
