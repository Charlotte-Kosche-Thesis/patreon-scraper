Whether its the cameras and lighting, the computers that record and process the teachings, the high speed internet connection to perform live streaming, as well as maintaining our website and other online services, and engaging professional contractors to develop and protect our online services, there is a complex infrastructure that needs to be maintained and upgraded from time to time, in order that people around the world can hear dharma for free. Along with Ajahn Brahm and the wise monks and nuns, and two dozen volunteers who donate their time to get the work done, it is donations that keeps the Buddhist Society of Western Australia producing regular teachings online, for no cost to the listener. It costs us less than $0.01 to deliver a teaching for free to a listener online.
