(pronounced: \"Ray tee\", in case you were wondering) I am a professional freelance illustrator of 4 years, and so far, have done artwork for books, games, and logos. I studied illustration at BYU-Idaho and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in art in 2012.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is my website, so you can take a look at the kind of work I do: nargothrondbrian.wixsite.com/brianraty\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love doing illustration work, particularly drawing and painting fantastical creatures, people, and places where I can be inventive and unleash creative thinking at perhaps it\u0027s max. I like to try to portray things at least a little differently from the norm in fantasy art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why am I here at Patreon? I am a husband and a father of three, and that has required me to work outside my discipline to support my family. While this has been fine for the most part, it has been very difficult to move ahead in these employment situations. I would much rather utilize a skill I am good at and passionate about to support my family and satisfy my need to create. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first goal is to make enough to allow part-time hours dedicated to my artwork. Later, I hope to eventually make my work into my main source of income. Financial goals aside, my goal is to be an influence for good in my work, and to deliver high quality art to help fill the visual needs of today\u0027s literature and media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support can help me free up the time to do this as well as spread the word and viewing of my work. With more clients, I can put my work into more games, picture books, graphic novels, etc...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo how does it work? You pledge an amount to pay per month (this is tier-based and you can cancel it anytime and set a limit on how much you pay per month). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, I will post my work during the month. In return for your patronage  I will give rewards for each month. These may include (depending on your tier of support): video drawing/painting tutorials, question/answer videos, free jpeg file pics/wallpapers, insights and work in progress posts seen only by my patrons.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for your support and helping me bring a dream into reality!"
