    "summary": "I\u2019m an Eisner nominated cartoonist and my current work is my series, The Infidel, featuring Pigman. I have three chapters currently available on Amazon Kindle and ComiXology. I\u2019m the winner of the AFDI Mohammad Cartoon Contest organized by Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, where two jihadists attempted to murder as many of us as they could, but were cut down by a cop in Garland, Texas. The attack made the contest far bigger than it would have been otherwise and it also brought me more attention than I\u0027ve ever had in my life, the good and bad kind. I\u0027ve gotten more death threats since, but I\u0027ve also gotten great support from individuals who love free speech. And unfortunately, it\u0027s also made me infamous with most of the publishing world. I still get paid work from outlets that aren\u0027t afraid to be associated with me, but my winning the award has also lost me opportunities that I might have had otherwise. I\u0027m not here to bitch about it, but I am here to make it clear that I want to work, I want to produce cartoons, comic books and graphic novels, and with the help of those of you reading this, through your willingness to contribute, you can help me keep my work alive, and keep myself alive. We don\u0027t live in a world where all cartoonists support Free Speech by drawing Mohammad, so it\u0027s the few of us who do who \u00a0become more isolated targets for the enemy, and therefore need to take more precautions while continuing to produce their work. So thank you for reading this and for your consideration, I will be able to better continue producing my work with whatever amount you\u0027re willing to give to me."
