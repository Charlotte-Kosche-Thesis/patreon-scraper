    "summary": "Hello and welcome to my Patreon!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Kalia, more widely known as Beloved to my internet people, and more commonly addressed as Lia by my friends. However it is that you know me, by now you have probably noticed that I love to write. \u003cem\u003eA lot\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a concept introduced to us in childhood that the best way to earn a living is to finance doing the thing that you love somehow. For me, writing is on the top of that list. Currently, I\u0027m working on several novels that are unpublished and unread for the time being. While I hope to someday finish them, share them with the world, and ideally make buckets of money from doing so -- I have also come to accept the reality that my true passion lies in the form of shorter, more intense storytelling.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis little corner of the internet is where I share the most in-depth\u00a0and close to home writings of mine. Things that are inspired by my own personal spectrum, and by this beautiful planet in all the colors that I myself see in it. These writings are pieces of where I\u0027ve been, what I\u0027ve done, what I\u0027ve seen, and at their very best -- who I am. They are pieces of my story and of myself that I am more reluctant to give away for free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to invite anyone who would like to support me just for the sake of doing so to donate. I would also like to invite anyone who would like to peer further into my work and into my joys, sorrows, grievances, and delights to commit\u00a0to a small monthly subscription that will allow you to receive\u00a0exclusive access to my original works. The works you will find with a paid subscription \u003cem\u003ecannot be found anywhere else on the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever brought you here, I wish you the best in all of your endeavors, and thank you very much for taking a look at mine!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
