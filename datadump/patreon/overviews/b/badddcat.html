Welcome to my Patreon page!!! Woop!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Ana \u0027Vee\u0027 Valdez, but you may know me as my pen name Badddcat. I\u0027m so happy and grateful to be here, all I want to do is create!!

My dream is to eventually be able to illustrate children\u0027s books that include representations of not only people like me, but also others who are underrepresented. This will not be the only avenue I will be exploring on my Patreon though!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSpeaking of, What is Patreon exactly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a fantastic platform that lets artists like me supplement their income in a really fun way! If you choose to support me as a creator you not only get access to some neat-o exclusive rewards, but we get to interact directly. Most of what I will be posting will never make it to the eyes of my other social media followers, which means you\u0027re in my \n\u003cem\u003esecret club\u003c/em\u003e! Process posts, sketches, unused drawings, WIPs...Check it out for yourself!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPayments for this Patreon \n\u003cstrong\u003ewill be charged at the very beginning of each month\u003c/strong\u003e and rewards will be distributed throughout that month. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eYou are allowed to cancel or change your pledge at any time! \u003c/strong\u003eLet\u0027s say, one month you might feel like treating yourself and want the pen pal or watercolor portrait reward, be my guest!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get as a patron??\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003eAll patrons will get access to my Patreon feed that gets updated with various new illustrations, WIPS, sketches and journal posts every week!

Unfortunately to do any of this I need some coinage to get printing done, pay for supplies and to just cover my own cost of living in California (it\u0027s a stretch). I\u2019m not trying to get rich here, I just really want to be able to make lots of artwork and not be stressed out about bills because it is a tremendous weight on my shoulders currently. All of the money from my patreon goes towards printing, supplies and events that I will be attending as a vendor!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs always thank you so much for your support and kindness! I appreciate every single one of you, because you keep me at this and on track!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWishing you well and sending lots of love your way,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAna V.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/8fe9bdde62c0243060d2daf87a0f8e82/tumblr_ogazetMP371tctbb8o1_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can take a look at my work and find me here:\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy Tumblr :\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://badddcat.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eClick Me!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy Website:\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://ana-vee.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eClick me!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003eMy Instagram:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/badddcat/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eClick me!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003eMy Tictail:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://nonobadcat.tictail.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eClick me!\u003c/a\u003e"
