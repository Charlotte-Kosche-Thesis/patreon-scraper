    "summary": "Dear fellow Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou have given me the most precious gift of all, your time and attention, and at least I can return the favour by inviting you to follow my journey as I continue to expand my creative self filling the world with sound.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor over 15 years I have been in different\u00a0choruses and that has been my main source of practicing music. In the fall of 2016 I decided it was time to do something different, not only because I was growing sick and tired of the social aspect of being in a choir, but also because I have\u00a0a toddler and would rather have someting creative to do at home after Olof\u0027s bedtime and before mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing in a choir was not challenging enough. A couple of male-friends were creating music with analog modular synthesizers and it hit me that this way of music is something different than what I was used to. The rebellious side of me wanted to conquer the male-dominated field of synthesizers. If they can play with patch cables and make noise by turing the frequence up and down, why could I not?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt became clear that diving into the sphere of modular synthesizers would fulfill my urge to create and I bought a synth. I would consider myself a newbie with a crazy heart burning for sound making. Music is a wonderful way to express feelings and explore the spheres around us. You, my beloved patreons, will follow me on this journey of sound-exploring\u00a0 As a patron you will for example enjoy my music exclusively before everyone else. See you on the other side!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBettina Sir\u00e9n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
