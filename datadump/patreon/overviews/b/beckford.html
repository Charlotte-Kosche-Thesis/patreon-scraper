Brexit. Unelected world leaders. Rising inequality. The Grenfell tragedy. More privatisation. All previously unthinkable events occurring in an already hard-to-stomach reality. We are living in a dystopia far removed from a world which celebrates everything that really matters to us and makes us human beings.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHello and thank you for visiting my Patreon page! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have had a story burning a hole in my soul for over 15 years. A story about a utopia that makes my heart sing, that makes me feel good to be alive, that highlights all the magic and magnificence that already exists in the world, whilst calling out the systems and beliefs that crush it: the ludicrous, dangerous, cruel, unnecessary stuff that we all tolerate, because \u2018that\u2019s just how it is\u2019.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCreating this Utopia, bringing alive characters who embody the virtues I value the most and seeing them triumph over hate, division and greed provides relief and hope in such unsettling and scary times for me, and I hope for you too. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe, like many before me, that what we focus on becomes our reality. I want this Utopia to shine so brightly from the pages of these books, for all who read them, that all the dystopian elements of our world are overshadowed, and that perhaps even sparks of imagination are ignited in others who want to find their own ways to shine.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo What Is This Soul Burning Story About?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSet over a series of four books, we meet a group of children who are fighting to save their Utopian island from a dystopian regime that epitomises the worst aspects of our planet today. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTheir homeland and their values of fairness, fun, creative expression, love, respect, kindness, tolerance, community, ancient wisdom and knowledge and trust in the natural world are under threat from an increasingly consumerist, profit-based nation that despises and seeks to destroy anything without a financial reward.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe join Skyte Baur and her dog, Manoona, as she and her family flee this regime and set sail for one of the few remaining Utopias. Here we experience through Skyte\u2019s eyes how beautiful, zany, vibrant, exciting, diverse and mystical life on the Isle of Aepitou is, as she becomes part of a community so different in every way to what she has left behind... \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom free-range schooling outside of a classroom to the ingenious and quirky contraptions in every home; from streets filled with unexpected visual delights to the atmospheric remains of the Ancient seat of Power; from the enchanting and mystical Arboretum to the head-spinning, heart-racing delights of the Barmyval, a carnival with a twist. This is a world which celebrates all the possibility of what it means to be alive.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut Skyte\u2019s arrival on The Isle of Aepitou is not accidental. Her parents, Storm Hakam and Helio Ayas who were originally from this land, have many secrets and have returned here for a purpose. Skyte, and the children she meets soon realise that the fate of the Isle and its mysterious inhabitants, as well as all other Utopias, is in their hands. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCan they resolve their differences and learn to harness the powerful energetic forces of their ancestors that is needed to save their way of life? And will it be enough or is there something crucial that they are missing?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho Is The Soul Burning Story For?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, fundamentally it\u2019s a children\u2019s adventure story, but at its heart it\u2019s for those of us who are anguished, angry and appalled by the state of our world and are ready for change. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s for those of us who may sometimes need a good moan about all the awfulness we\u2019re surrounded by but we also know that by focusing on what we want to create rather than what we don\u2019t, is how change will come about. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u2019s for people who love nature, for people who love food, for people who love fun, and for people who know that there is so much we don\u2019t yet know about the world in which we live. It\u2019s for people who are fascinated by all the wondrous things that human beings AND animals can do and for those curious enough to want to learn more.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u2019s for people who want to do more than complain and moan; it\u2019s for people who are ready to take action...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support through Patreon can help me in many ways. As soon as you decide to become a Patron, at whatever level, you are supporting me by quite literally buying me time to write. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a single mum of two daughters and I have fibromyalgia. I want my children to have a role model of someone who has the courage to follow their dreams and not just exist within a system that doesn\u2019t encourage us to live fully in meaningful ways.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut it\u2019s more than just the financial, practical support\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs someone who - at the age of 43 - still feels like I haven\u2019t found my \u2018thing\u2019 or, more accurately, has known for years that writing this story is my thing but has avoided it out of fear and listening to the naysaying voices that \u201cthis won\u2019t work\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019ll never support yourself with your writing\u201d etc., it feels like it is now or never. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo have visible evidence of support helps to drown out those negative voices, helps keep me going in the face of adversity and helps me believe I CAN do this.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCreating a community of people who \u2018get\u2019 this - both the need to do this now and the story I\u2019m writing about - is a way to inspire, encourage, discuss, and involve, not just me but you too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to hear what a Utopia might look like for you, from economy to schooling, from food to fun. Somewhere for you to share your examples of wonder, joy, beauty and quirkyness that you see in the world that should be included in this riotous, joyful, modern day Shangri-La. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy rewards are all about your involvement in helping this evolve - from asking questions from people I plan to interview about relevant themes in the book, to discussing these themes and thrashing out what a Utopia might look like to us all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs yet I am not offering access to chapters of the book but these will be added further down the line and I am always open to suggestions of things that you might like to be added to the reward tiers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for reading this, and if you, like me, want to create a Utopia, I hope you\u2019ll consider supporting this one to grow."

Amazing to have you support me at this level.\u00a0\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this world of ours where youth and beauty are revered, it is easy to forget the wisdom of our elders. This Tier is a celebration of the Crone, a word that in our culture has negative connotations, but it used to represent the respect and veneration shown to older women for their knowledge and experience gathered over a lifetime as teachers, healers and matriarchs.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny form of utopia that I imagine, recognises the importance of the Crone so at this tier we have a full-on croning ceremony. Obviously the ceremony will be yarnbombed, held at Kansas City Public Library and have a romp (yes that really is their collective noun) of Sea Otters serenading the Crone!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to all that and to thank you further for your input and support, if you remain a supporter at this level for 6+ months, you will be mentioned personally in the book\u0027s acknowledgements for your contribution to its creation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoto Credit: Christian Newman\u003c/p\u003e",
