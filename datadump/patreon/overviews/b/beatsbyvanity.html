    "summary": "First, of, thank you for even reading what I have to say and considering becoming a Patron. I couldn\u0027t do what I do without the support from everyone who watches, comments and subscribers to Beats by Vanity TV and of course, my Patrons! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO AM I? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, my name is Matthew Oliver, online I go by the artist alias \u0027Vanity\u0027. I created and run Beats by Vanity TV, a YouTube channel that reverse engineers an artists sound, bi-weekly. I also created an audio sample pack company, \u0027\u003ca href=\"https://www.samplesbyvanity.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Samples by Vanity\u003c/a\u003e\u0027, that releases a sample pack alongside each tutorial, in the style of the given artist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started making music production tutorials selfishly. Because I couldn\u0027t find the tutorials I wanted to watch, I decided to make them. There\u0027s a quote from Austin Kleon\u0027s book \u0027Steal Like an Artist\u0027 that I live my life by: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cThe manifesto is this: Draw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, write the books you want to read, build the products you want to use- do the work you want to see done.\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy highest educational qualification in music production is a bachelor of science with honours degree. I only share this as I want everyone who watches my content to know that the information I present is, and will always, of the highest standard. You do not need a degree, nor any qualification to become a music producer, but with the age of the internet, I think it\u0027s only necessary that you know who your information is coming from. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e WHAT WILL I DO WITH YOUR MONEY? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, I won\u0027t be spending it on coffee, although, I do love coffee. I believe there are two ways to think about Patreon; one is a donation platform in where you generously give someone a donation because you enjoy their work and want to see more of it. I\u0027ve kept this tier at $1 as, with enough Patrons, this could become a substantial income for any artist or content creator. You can donate more than $1 if you wish, but it is not a requirement to become a Patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe the next four tiers are a combination of a donation and a product/service reward. I\u0027m offering various products and services at a 50% discount price. I call this a combination as you are still supporting me and the content I produce, but its less of handing me money and not truly knowing where it goes, and more of me providing you with some level of value in return. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd a BIG NOTE:\u003c/strong\u003e This is a vast experiment I am undergoing in public, so if there are any new features, products, new tiers, or anything you would like to see implemented, feel free to send them my way. A big part of my channel is a focus on collaboration with the audience and embracing our little community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTWO EXTRA THINGS:\u003c/strong\u003e I created a Beats by Vanity TV Discord chat for music producers, artists and creatives so that we could have a home outside of YouTube in where I could interact with everyone and vice versa as well as each other. It\u0027s gone way better than I expected and I\u0027m happy to say that I\u0027m learning so much from you all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second thing is my daily blog on creativity. Every day on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://beatsbyvanity.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBeatsbyVanity.com\u003c/a\u003e I publish a blog post ranging from my thoughts, ideas, or just something cool I found that day. I like to explain it as \u0027my public notebook for cool creative stuff.\u0027 It\u0027s a personal project of mine with no monetary attachments or annoying promotions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read what I have to say, I hope to see you in the Discord chat soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePura Vida, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
