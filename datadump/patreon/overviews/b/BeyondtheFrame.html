    "summary": "Let me start off by saying I find the concept of \u003cem\u003ePatreon\u003c/em\u003e and mainly the people who decide to help creators a beautiful thing. Like a lot of people I have mixed feelings about the evolution of digital technology; what it\u0027s doing to our brains and the way we communicate, but this, the idea of people voluntarily choosing to foster creation and building a community of learning and knowledge sharing... it\u0027s just a beautiful, beautiful thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/XUOcdUm.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Lu\u00eds Azevedo. I\u0027m an ex-film student and undecided as to my aspirations as an academic. I was born in Portugal and have lived here for most of my life (I\u0027ve lived for a stint in Hungary and another in England). I\u0027m no politician. I\u0027m just a fella. I think that puns should be lame and boots should be dusty. I think TV quote references shouldn\u0027t be explained. And Wes Anderson movies, well, I think that\u0027s just a little bit better. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve just finished my Master\u0027s Degree dissertation about essay film and video-essays. It was supposed to be about what\u0027s specific about the comedy of Edgar Wright. Its working title was\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Cinematographic Specificity of the Humour in the Films of Edgar Wright,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0but it should\u0027ve have been called \u003cem\u003eHow to take the Fun out of Funny\u003c/em\u003e. I\u0027ll probably publish something about this, but instead I decided to study video-essays and essay films, so I better understood the history and origins of what I\u0027m doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wigYwKm.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve made too many videos already about Wes Anderson and Louis CK. I\u0027ll make some more, but for now I plan on focusing on a few others of my favourite people. What I\u0027m bringing to the table is a series of video-essays, a few supercuts (mostly I won\u0027t include them in the supported posts), about mainly film and television. I\u0027ll approach them from perspectives which I find interesting. For example, how language is used differently in Louie or how the main characters of Mike Leigh are born in the outskirts of the narrative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are a few of the things I\u0027ll eventually talk about: stand-up comedy, Wes Anderson movies, TV shows (right now I\u0027m thinking about \u003cem\u003eBetter Things \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eWestworld\u003c/em\u003e), philosophy, Asian cinema, essay films.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/BztOFJj.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Magnificent Anders(s)ons \u003c/em\u003ewas the result of 1.5 months of researching, editing and narration.\u003cem\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/analytics?o=U#dt=nt,fe=17095,fr=lw-001,fs=17068;fc=0,fcr=0,fi=v-B9r1aYk_2Wg,r=realtime,rsc=1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLouis CK and the Art of Non-Verbal Communication\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003ewas a lot less (though I wasn\u0027t counting). These things take time, but I love to make them. I\u0027d love to make them as like... a job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I really want is to be a professional learner. I\u0027m passionate about learning and communicating about the things that keep me up at night. Video-essays might be the path to doing that as a career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/jETaQCy.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe short answer is I don\u0027t know. Until this project becomes financially feasible, I\u0027ll work when I can.\u00a0I\u0027m writing this after finishing a video which gave me incredible satisfaction. Work started every day at 7am. By the time sun set, I was still in front of my computer. I kept a notebook by my side which I filled in bed instead of resting. I got up and danced after making just the right cut, more times than I want to admit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut until this becomes viable I\u0027ll have to take other jobs where I find them, increasing the time between videos. Whatever schedule I propose myself would only be an ideal goal, but if I set them as an obligation, I\u0027d probably be forced to break them, which is less than ideal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope this is appealing enough. If it\u0027s not, I hope you still enjoy my videos. Thank you for reading through. If you want it\u0027s OK if you\u0027re... patronizing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/CpWLIQu.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
