    "summary": "Hi! We\u0027re Sean and Hollie Bryan, the creators of Brymore Productions, a boutique theatre company that makes immersive, engaging theatrical events that ignite imagination and spark creativity in young audiences. But unless you\u0027ve somehow just stumbled upon this page, you probably already know this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn hiatus from creating theatre for \u0027grown ups\u0027 Sean came up with the idea of Mortimer Sparks, a bumbling explorer, that ballooned from an initial, interactive podcast, to full 45 minute stage show. With Mortimer and his assistant Jinx starting to head out on exciting adventures, to great audience praise, we wondered if this was a calling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the end of 2016 we had worked on 4 pieces of family theatre. It was a fantastic first year and we wanted more. In 2017 we created 14 new production and played to almost 7,000 audience members at 19 venues across the United Kingdom, including the Edinburgh Fringe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve now worked alongside institutions such as Exbury Gardens, The Spring Arts \u0026amp; Heritage Centre, Waterstones Southampton, Big Family Festival, Winchester Discovery Centre, and Museums \u0026amp; Galleries Edinburgh. With every performance more people become aware of our work, and new opportunities arise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut with all that said and done, running Brymore Productions occurs primarily in our spare time. It involves lots of emails, reaching out to uncover new opportunities, on top of writing, designing, building, rehearsing and performing shows (and doing day jobs.) Because, yes, unfortunately no matter how great people think our work is, it currently does not pay all our bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s partially why we have this Patreon. We\u0027d love to take the pressure off trying to squeeze Brymore work around...well...work work. Even if we could work one day less a week, that would make a significant difference to the opportunities we could create for our little theatre company.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will also help us book venues, assist us in getting to all our performances across the UK, and contribute to things like registering for festivals. (Like the fantastic friends and family who helped us get to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe last year!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, your help allows us to inspire creativity and ignite imaginations in our young audiences. It helps bring theatre to communities and audience members who may not have experienced any kind of performance before. It truly makes a difference to every single child that sees our performances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, we\u0027ll get you behind the scenes on all we do we Patreon exclusive content. From Mortimer Sparks adventures, to magic tricks and potion recipes from Madame Manocchio. You might get to watch a rehearsal, contribute names or crazy ideas for an upcoming performance, or get to be part of one of our upcoming podcasts. It\u0027s going to be fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why not chip in $1 U.S a month (or more if you\u0027re able) and help us create incredible, immersive, interactive theatre for young audiences!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
