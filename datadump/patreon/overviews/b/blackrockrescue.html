    "summary": "For the last 4 years, I\u0027ve been working at doing Volunteer Road Rescues, helping those who need it wherever I come across them, and sharing those stories here on Youtube under the Chicago Road Rescues and Adventures Channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I\u0027ve moved on to the next chapter of my life. I\u0027ve moved cross-country to start anew. Over the last year, I\u0027ve undergone multiple incredibly deep transformative experiences, of which, I\u0027ve video documented the entire way. With this new chapter in my life, I\u0027m looking to also start the next chapter in my online storytelling, and the thus transformation has begun. Chicago Road Rescues has changed into Black Rock Road Rescues \u0026amp; Adventures, and so the epic saga continues.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I\u0027m homeless in Utah, living out of the vehicle that was supposed to enable the next chapter of my life. Unable to find a job, I\u0027ve devoted my focus to creating and telling the stories I haven\u0027t had the time to tell over the last 4 years. Ranging from Burning Man, to my craziest road rescues, to my various and insane adventures, including my transformation into my new character: Jaxx.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf you are like me, and you feel these are stories worth telling, I ask that you support this project so that it may continue to be a focus for me, and so that everyone else can also enjoy the stories I tell as well. Without financial support, I will be unable to justify my time spent on creation, and therefore, I fear these stories my be lost to the ethos forever.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me as a creator, you\u0027re supporting a range of good karma, good deeds, and good luck that you have come to expect of me as you\u0027ve come to know watching my channel over the years, along with the great storytelling process that goes along with that. This is my passion, and my hopes are that others not only believe in it, but are able to support it as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for all your continued support and patronage. This isn\u0027t an easy time in my life. But your support and help here, enables me to continue forward with my dreams and aspirations of creation. I look forward to sharing the experience with all of you first hand. I really do believe you\u0027ll love to see what I have in store once things get rolling.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith love, light, and happiness, I sincerely thank you all\u00a0\u2665\u003cbr\u003e-Jaxx Skellingtin\u003cbr\u003e"

This truck was destined to create the next chapter of the Burner Road Rescues channel, but without an engine, it\u0027s left me stranded and even more behind in my goals of escaping homelessness.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently have a goal of $3,500 to sponsor putting a new motor in the Silver Shadow, and therefore Kickstarting this otherwise hopeless next chapter of my life. With this money raised, I\u0027ll be able to tell yet one more success story here on the channel. And you can expect to see the magic unfold here on the channel as I go through the process of getting it repaired, and then the process of moving onwards and upwards with my goals of escaping this cold, homeless reality I\u0027m currently in. I know I\u0027m looking for a miracle, but I miracles can\u0027t happen unless I open myself up to them. You can expect to be featured and credited on the channel if you assist me with these goals, as you\u0027ll be helping me get back on my feet. And for that, you can be sure I\u0027ll be sending lots of magic back your way\u00a0\u2665 \u003cbr\u003e",
