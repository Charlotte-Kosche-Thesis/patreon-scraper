I can answer questions, talk about progress on projects, and just chat with people. Want to watch me play games? If my hardware will let me, you can!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStop Motion Animation! omg!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI used to do stop-motion videos a few years ago. I stopped when my software and hardware was super outdated. But I really miss making these, I did brickfilms, but also have interest in animating action figures. These will not be very often (They take SO LONG to make), but I will start when I can get better gear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLive action comedy? People like that, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have a couple ideas for live-action (AKA filmed with real people, not LEGO or toys) comedy skits. These will be further down the road as I would need better cameras, costumes, props, and friends to play roles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore Patreon rewards? Cool gubbins?! Woot!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I have a good amount of supporters and subscribers, I will be able to make more rewards and bonuses for them!
