     "description": "As most of you can probably understand, this $7000 per episode goal really helps us with reducing the expense of producing a series such as Brown Sub. Although we cut as many costs as we can to lower the total financial budget, it still actually cost at minimal around $9500 \u00a0per episode to produce and promote Brown Sub. We are accepting support through the purchasing one of our 7 gifts offered in exchange for your pledge. Items like our Custom Designer T-shirts. Each episode we will put up a different design on our Premium Custom Tees. Don\u0027t need a Tee, buy a custom iPhone cover. Or a custom skateboard or long board. We will give you several options to make it easy to support what we are doing. We hope that you enjoy what we are doing and continue to visit our channels and websites.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you\u003cbr\u003eBouston Blacke",
