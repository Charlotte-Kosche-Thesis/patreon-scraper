    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003eWhat we are doing\u003c/h4\u003e\nWe are creating a free and open learning platform that is focused on letting learners acquire lifelong mastery in an efficient way. We currently offer a Biology and a Geography course, but with your help, we will soon offer many more courses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrain Brooder lets learners achieve lifelong mastery\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce a skill or knowledge is acquired, it does not need to be forgotten. Yet this is exactly what is happening on a continuing basis. We learn psychology and biology, and then, even if we ace our exam, forget most of it within a year.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe already know that this problem can be efficiently mitigated using a spaced repetition system(SRS). Using an SRS, things we have trouble with will be ruthlessly repeated until we don\u0027t, and things we know well will be reminded to us just often enough not to forget them. Brain Brooder integrates an SRS with our core curricula, such that we\u0027ll still remember how our mind and our cells function when we are 80 years old.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrain Brooder lets learners learn efficiently\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf there are 50 students taking a course, it is very difficult to adjust the course to all of their needs. Inevitably, some of the students are underprepared and will face excessive difficulty, while others waste their time being bored while hearing an explanation for the third time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf we would have a map of the gaps in knowledge in the former group, and of the already known territory of the latter group, then we can plan a personal route for each of them, reducing stress and boredom, while increasing joy and effectiveness.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is why we aim to create a knowledge map, where every lesson shows its dependency on the knowledge gained in other lessons. In this way, when you start a course, you will clearly see which lessons you will need to follow as prerequisites, and which lessons in the course you can safely skip without missing anything.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrain Brooder teaches everything for free\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWikipedia has shown us that it is possible for a large crowd of people to create a free high quality encyclopedia, as long as the right mechanisms are in place to guard this quality. We plan to apply the same mechanism to education.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe will start by offering free courses that are either created by ourselves, or by OpenStax. Then, when we have a significant user base, we will ask users to suggest improvements and new lessons. All changes will first be monitored by us, and over time this control will be delegated to a growing group of users that are known to have made good quality contributions. The aim is to end up with an extensive knowledge map that covers many areas both widely and deeply.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy you should support us\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTogether with you, we can give the opportunity to people around the world to get really good education, no matter their level of income."
