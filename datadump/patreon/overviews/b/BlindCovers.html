    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Blind Covers?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlind Covers is a monthly webseries that turns making shit up into an art form. We give bands the lyrics to a song they\u0027ve never heard before, then they have one hour to write a cover of the song in their own style. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOften times the most interesting and creative art comes under pressure,\u00a0when we can shut off the voice in our head that says \"but is this REALLY good enough?\" and follow our gut. The bands on Blind Covers are always shocked by what they\u0027re able to do in just an hour, and you get to watch it happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere will the money go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe strive to make the show look and sound as good as possible, and all of the money we raise will go right into covering the costs associated with producing the show. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the cost breakdown of an average episode:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022Renting a recording studio (our biggest overhead cost about $400/episode)\u003cbr\u003e\u2022Renting additional lights/cameras (~$150/day)\u003cbr\u003e\u2022Feeding the crew/bands for the day (~$50/day)\u003cbr\u003e\u2022Paying additional editors to help finish episodes ($150/episode)\u003cbr\u003e\u2022We also have a lot of volunteers helping make the show happen, and in the future we\u0027d like to be able to pay them for their time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe usually shoot three episodes in a day, so that comes out to roughly \u003cstrong\u003e$500 per episode.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince we fund the show completely out-of-pocket (Youtube ad revenue doesn\u0027t really put a dent in any of this) those costs add up fast, which is why we usually have to take long breaks between episodes. With your support, we can produce Blind Covers regularly and reliably!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
