I\u0027m Bumbleworth and I animate weird characters! Animation is my passion and I absolutely love telling a story and seeing the reaction. I work a 9-5 day job and don\u0027t have much time to dedicate to animation currently. I\u0027m hoping this could help me find that time in the future or at least make it easier to keep my license for the software I use to create these animations. I\u0027m originally from Ohio and I now reside in Florida with my girlfriend, Alison, and 2 Scottish Fold cats. I\u0027ve animated a few commercials and also some children\u0027s cartoons in the past professionally. However, I really enjoy creating my own stories and having control over every aspect of a piece. It\u0027s also a lot of fun stuffing these things with easter eggs for everyone to find. My joy comes from a person\u0027s reaction to the animation. There\u0027s simply nothing better than making someone laugh or feel something.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eIt\u0027s no secret that YouTube isn\u0027t very kind to animation channels. Something like The Help Desk animation takes up to 3 months working on it by myself. The hours needed to make these videos really doesn\u0027t even begin to make sense if you\u0027re trying to earn a living on YouTube. Which is why I have a full-time day job and also why this Patreon exists now. :P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually, I would love to do YouTube animation full-time and be my own boss. This would mean MORE animation FASTER. Gosh, that is exciting to think about. Though that may never happen, I like to dream! In the mean time, small amounts could add up and help me pay for the license to animate in the software I use, Maya. It costs $1470 a year for a license. 3D ain\u0027t cheap y\u0027all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is also for the people that are really interested in animation and want to maybe get exposure to some of the stuff I do. Granted, I don\u0027t work the way a lot of other animators may work. :P\u003cbr\u003eOr maybe you just really love the videos and want more and more info about what\u0027s next? That\u0027s fine too as I\u0027ll be posting lots of progress shots and behind the scenes videos. I love opinions and more eyes on what I\u0027m doing to make it the best it can possibly be. You\u0027ll partially be helping to shape the animations with your feedback!"

I also have 2 cats and a loving girlfriend that need my attention. :P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis would also give me the freedom to bring in other creators, modelers, riggers, animators and artists to assist and take the quality up to the next level. This would mean animations get done much faster. It takes me 3 months to do an episode of something like The Help Desk. If I was doing this as my full-time job, The Help Desk could be done in weeks now that most assets are created and 50-60 hours a week would be dedicated to it compared to 12-14 right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a lofty goal and one I don\u0027t think will ever happen, but hey... have to aim high, right?",
