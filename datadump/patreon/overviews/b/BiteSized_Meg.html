Welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Megan. I\u0027m just a small town, gaming, anime loving, adopted South Korean, who is trying to get by in this crazy world! \u003cbr\u003eI am somewhat new to cosplay! I\u0027ve only been doing it since NYCC2016 in October! I fell in love! I\u0027ve always been one to dress up since I was a child, but didn\u0027t know what cosplay was until I was about 12 or 13 years old. I finally had a name to go with me dressing up at an older age. I didn\u0027t consider it true cosplay until I attended a con though. I still don\u0027t consider myself a \"true\" cosplayer. A lot of my cosplays are unfinished and aren\u0027t to my expectations, but I\u0027m so glad others like them! I\u0027m still learning and I have a long way to go, but I\u0027m motivated and would love to share some of my cosplay content with you! I also do lewd content for those who are interested. I\u0027ve done this since around December 2016 / January 2017. Believe it or not, I\u0027m still a little nervous! I\u0027ve gotten better over the year, but I had gotten pregnant and had to change things up some. We will see what this new year brings! Things will definitely be changing for the better this year!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also would like to mention you \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003edo NOT by any means, HAVE to become a patron!!!!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e It is for those who wish to support what I do even more so than they already do! In return, they will receive exclusive photos of my cosplays, lewds, blogs, polls, discounts to my online stores, and random stuff I decide to post on here. I TRY to treat this like a social media site. I usually post more than what each tier specifically states in the description. Now, with that said, it may not always mean I will post bonus pictures or sets. I like to get my patrons involved with what I do. It makes it more fun!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eGOALS!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eMake my own cosplays\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003ePhotography equipment\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been so inspired by other cosplayers and friends to make my own cosplays!!! However, I don\u0027t make enough money to do so. Making one\u0027s own cosplays is an expensive hobby and I need a little extra help with purchasing what is needed. It is also time consuming and a learning process. I will probably want everything to be perfect....I also work full-time and I am a new mother. Finding time will be challenging, but I will try my best!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing able to afford better photography equipment so I can take better photos/videos for all my patrons is something that I also want to do.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI also need the money to pay my photographers, Bethaney and Andrew. Bethaney is one of my best friends and Andrew is my husband\u0027s best friend. They both are personal photographers that I use. I also need to make sure I can pay Bethaney a little extra because she has been editing my newer sets since I had gotten pregnant.\u00a0 Andrew doesn\u0027t do as many of my shoots as he used to as of right now, but hopefully will soon! Bethaney needs lighting and some backdrop equipment in order to have better quality photos. It helps to have two different photographers with two different styles to accomplish the variety I want. With that said, I would like both to be of quality work, which is why my main goals are for making my own cosplays and to be able to afford better equipment. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eWISHLIST\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to help with my goals, but do not wish to be a patron you\u0027re welcome to take a look at my public Amazon wishlist (\u003ca href=\"http://a.co/7mF78Vi\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHere\u003c/a\u003e).

I have the PAY UPFRONT setup. This means at the time you pledge for the first time, you will have to pay right then. This means if you pledge on the 28th of a month, you will also be charged on the 1st of the next month (a few days later). This isn\u0027t a double charge, it is paying for two separate months. Advantage of this type of payment is that you will be able to see my content immediately after your payment is processed. Without pay upfront, you would have to wait until after the 1st of the next month to see content . This is effective as of March 12, 2017.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that if your payment is not processed correctly (such as you don\u0027t have the money in your account) Patreon does inform you. You will probably get a message from me as well. If this is not fixed within 2 weeks after being notified, you will be deleted and blocked from my Patreon and all rewards that come with the tier you pledged to. It wouldn\u0027t be fair to get content if your payment hadn\u0027t gone through. It would be the same as getting it for free, which isn\u0027t fair to those who pay for that content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease keep in mind, Patreon is for exclusive content. When you sign up you\u0027re agreeing that the content you receive are for you only. You\u0027re welcome to save anything I post, however, do not share them on social media or anything else (unless I state otherwise). You\u0027d only be cheating yourself. You, as a patron, are getting exclusive content that I don\u0027t post anywhere else. You don\u0027t want others to get what you\u0027ve had to pay for for free...do you? I didn\u0027t think so! So please, be respectful to other patrons, myself, and yourself and keep the content I post to yourself and other patrons. There are times that I will ask if you care if I post something from here onto social media. I ask you because you\u0027re the ones paying for said content. I wouldn\u0027t be a good creator if I posted something I said was exclusive to a public site. I usually ask for comments or I do a poll with a time limit. You want to make sure you vote in the polls to make your opinion heard.

So, please understand if rewards are not out by the 5th, it is because I do not run my Patreon like this as I understand most creators release sets around the first week of each month. My rewards are released throughout that month. I usually have to plan just days ahead, but I always let everyone know what my plans are and if they change. I have noticed people unpledge assuming I don\u0027t deliver what I say, this is untrue. I usually do MORE than what I say I will. If not, you may message me and I will try to accommodate\u00a0you.

However, usually my previews/ sneak peaks are from lower tiers. So, that should give you an idea :) You are still welcome to ask. I don\u0027t want you paying for something you aren\u0027t sure of and being disappointed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find and support me on other social media as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/BiteSized_Meg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bitesized_meg/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BiteSizedCosplay/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eYou may also email me at my business email.\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eBiteSized.Meg@gmail.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
