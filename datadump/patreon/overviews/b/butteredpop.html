    "summary": "Hi Buttered Pop fans! Since 2016, our collection of contributors have devotedly consumed pop culture and put in the countless hours behind-the-scenes in pre-production to create podcasts and content on all things pop culture. Aside from growing our collection of podcasts and digital content, we launched the \u003ca href=\"http://www.butteredpop.com/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eButtered Pop\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e website at the beginning of 2018 to give us a platform to provide you more of what you want! We truly believe in feeding your pop culture appetite and we want to do it the best we can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, thanks so much for visiting our Patreon! If you have already enjoyed and subscribed to the podcast, we greatly appreciate you! If this is your first time hearing about us, we hope you\u0027ll give us a look (or listen!).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy joining Buttered Pop\u0027s Patreon community, you\u0027ll be receiving access to exclusive content and contributing to the podcast\u0027s growth. With your monthly patronage, you\u0027ll be providing us with the necessary resources to create more content, maintain equipment and upgrade when necessary, design and produce merchandise, and give us the tools for successful long-term planning. We have a vision for the Buttered Pop network and you can be a part of making it come to fruition!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve always wanted to create an outlet for people on their commutes, at the gym, washing the dishes, or simply doing any of the mundane things in life that can be just a bit easier with an assist from a podcast. We\u0027ve ventured into digital image and written content creation to compliment our podcasts because people have been asking for more, and now it\u0027s our turn to listen. We even want to expand into digital video content in 2018. Buttered Pop has been always been about the listeners. We never want to stop elevating our production for you because we believe that we can always be just a bit better.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re so ecstatic about all the ideas that we have planned for Buttered Pop. More importantly, we can\u0027t wait to share them!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for everything,\u003cbr\u003eButtered Pop"
