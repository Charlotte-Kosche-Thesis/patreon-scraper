    "summary": "If you\u2019ve made it this far, chances are you know me personally, you\u2019ve heard about me, or you\u2019ve been following me on social media. Either way I just want to say THANK YOU for showing up and THANK YOU for hearing me out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFOR THOSE OF YOU UNAWARE I am a self-taught performing artist and dancer, motivational speaker, writer, activist, visionary, but most importantly your reflection. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE MISSION IS QUITE SIMPLE yet unnecessarily complicated- I want to inspire individuals to claim their identities through radical self-reflection and self-expression. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBUT I NEED YOUR HELP. With your monthly contribution, whether it\u2019s $3, $10, $50 a month, I will be able to do the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u27a4:::: Rent a room once a month and facilitate In Full Reflect, an online and in-person community meetup revolving around self-expression and self-reflection. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u27a4:::: Travel to communities nationwide to reach a wider audience through my speaking, lectures, workshops, and online webinars. Through these mediums I dissect the psychology of self-image and draw concepts from sociological aspects of cultural conditioning to demonstrate how we subconsciously shape our self-perception and body image according to the world around us. I offer solutions to individuals on how they can quiet their inner critic, filter out harmful messages, claim their individuality, exercise self-expression, and develop a healthy routine of self-acceptance which ultimately contributes to their overall well-being and success in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u27a4:::: Produce powerful dance and speaking videos regarding topics such self-image, body image, self-identity, social conditioning, media manipulation and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u27a4:::: Write a book where I share insight into how I overcame one of the most powerful mental illnesses of our time and reclaimed my identity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u27a4:::: Together, with you, come up with unique strategies, campaigns, and other ideas to bring this message to the masses in a way that is loud, outspoken, and maybe even obnoxious. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY SO SERIOUS? When I was 14 years old I was forced to stare death straight in the face as a result of one of the most powerful disorders of our generation, anorexia. Recovering from a mental illness with the highest mortality rate may be the hardest thing I will ever have to do in my life, but I don\u2019t believe I survived for no reason. I believe that only through the most difficult experiences in life can we gain the most wisdom, and if we are privileged to that wisdom, then we have an obligation to share it with the rest of humanity. Through education, awareness, powerful art, expressions, and storytelling, I believe that we can offer others hope and help them reclaim their individuality buried underneath society\u2019s daunting expectations. Do you believe it\u0027s possible too? Let\u2019s do this together."
