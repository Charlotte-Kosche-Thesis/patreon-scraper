    "summary": "Hey there. I\u2019m Richard Eisenbeis. I\u2019m a critic/journalist based in Tokyo who spends his time writing about Anime and Japanese video games. You may have seen my work on\u003cem\u003e Kotaku\u003c/em\u003e--or cross-posted on \u003cem\u003eAnime News Network\u003c/em\u003e. For the past few years, I\u2019ve been the managing editor of the site \u003cem\u003eAnime Now!\u003c/em\u003e but, unfortunately, that job has come to an end. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, with every ending comes a new beginning: So I\u2019ve decided that now is the time to write directly for you, the awesome readers who have supported me wherever my career has taken me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You\u2019ll Get\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what will you get for your support? One anime or Japanese game article a week posted over on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://biggestinjapan.com\"\u003eBiggestinJapan.com\u003c/a\u003e (it\u0027ll be largely anime-focused at the start). These could be anything from deep analytical examinations or reviews to seasonal anime guides or series explainers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, why only one a week, you may ask? Simply, what\u2019s most important to me is that I deliver what I promise--and I know for certain that I can hit that goal. Of course, this is just the starting point and the amount of articles per week could very well increase. We\u2019ll just have to play it by ear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of locking content behind a paywall, I\u2019ve decided that my reward tiers will be focused on letting you help decide the content. Have a show this season you want me to cover? Have a retro anime you want my thoughts on? Just have to know more about the latest big Japanese film adaptation? Here\u2019s your chance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Note: I am completely open to making more/different rewards if anyone has any ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I\u0027ve been thinking about things like a podcast\u00a0 or a reoccurring series of articles as goals, I\u0027m going to wait to decide on any until after I hear your suggestions for larger projects you\u0027d like. So like with ideals for additional reward tiers, feel free to comment."
