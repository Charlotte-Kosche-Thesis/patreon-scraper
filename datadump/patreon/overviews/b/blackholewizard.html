While we\u0027ve been scrimping desperately for free time to work on BHW for the past two years, projects like this can prevent artists from paying rent, unless they are funded.

We\u0027re also committed to producing a polished final product and that means paying graphic designers and an editor. They don\u0027t want to starve to death, either. We\u0027re going to churn out pages no matter how much we receive, but every dollar helps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get out of this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAssured damnation and our eternal gratitude. Also, we promise our patrons early access to pages as they\u0027re finished, digital art with which you may profane your personal computing devices, live-streams of Eliza drawing the comic itself and probably crude fart jokes, access to Simon\u0027s scripts as they\u0027re published, and god knows what else we think up as we go."
