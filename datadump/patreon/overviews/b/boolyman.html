    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I humbly create this Patreon at the request of many who have enjoyed my Craft Of The Titans modpack and are interested in supporting my future work.\u00a0 I was, and still am hesitant to set this page to active, as my packs are a labor of love, not a means to receive praise or reward.\u00a0\u00a0Realistically though, it\u0027s not fair to deprive those who have enjoyed the packs to show their appreciation.\u00a0 And for the reasons you will see below, I am immensely\u00a0grateful\u00a0for any support you send my way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Craft Of The Titans became a project due to some circumstances not many are aware of.\u00a0 At the beginning of last year I suddenly developed a very rare disorder called Guillain Barre syndrome.\u00a0 It caught me completely off guard, and within a two week span I went from a busy go-getter with a promising career, to being hospital ridden, building the strength to hold a spoon, and learning how to walk again.\u00a0 I couldn\u0027t even grasp a pen to write my name.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And that\u0027s where Minecraft came in.\u00a0 I found that playing computer games was the best physical therapy for my hands.\u00a0 Using the keyboard and mouse retrained the flexibility in my fingers, and allowed me to slowly regain strength.\u00a0 I had never played Minecraft before, but seeing others play it on Stream, I figured it would be the right speed to serve my purpose.\u00a0 Being out of work at this point, I dove in and spent countless hours in modpacks like Infinity Evolved, Project Ozone, and SkyFactory.\u00a0 As I played through these, I noticed some similarities in the progression that I wanted to change.\u00a0 I felt as though after a certain point in each of these packs, I just stopped having the urge to continue playing.\u00a0 Automation and ease had taken over for that giddy feeling that I needed to balance resources, watch my back, or explore new areas.\u00a0 The sense of reward for pushing forward just fell off.\u00a0 And that\u0027s when I decided to make my own pack.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then birthed Craft Of The Titans, my first modpack.\u00a0 I had never done any coding, json file editing, zenscript syntax, and was still fairly new to Minecraft itself.\u00a0 But I knew what I liked, and I knew what I WASN\u0027T seeing in the other packs that I had played.\u00a0 Seeing as I was \"blessed\" with a rare disorder that put me on disability, I had plenty of time to learn.\u00a0 And that\u0027s exactly what I did over the 6 months of near-sleepless nights it took me to make Craft Of The Titans.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 That\u0027s why Craft Of The Titans is more customized than any pack you will find.\u00a0 Literally every single line of every config file has been combed through on my quest to both retrain my hands to coordinate with my neurological\u00a0system... and fill the void left from other modpacks.\u00a0 An odd combination, I know... but one that hopefully brings hours of fun to all of you who play it.\u003c/div\u003e"
