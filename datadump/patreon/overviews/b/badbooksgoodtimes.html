It\u0027s run by two former English majors, Ariel and Matthew, who write about a new chapter four days a week, so people don\u0027t have to actually read these books themselves.\u00a0It\u0027s like SparkNotes, but for smartasses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past, we\u0027ve written these chapter-by-chapter summaries/scathing assortment of snarky quips for Fifty Shades of Grey, the Crossfire series, Divergent, The Host, House of Night, and Beautiful Disaster. We have also fondly reminisced (but also made many jokes) about Goosebumps and Sweet Valley High.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/h1\u003ePatreon is a service for people who create stuff (eg, Bad Books, Good Times) to receive monetary donations from people who like that stuff (eg, our readers). In other words, it\u2019s an easy way for anyone who would like to support us to give a monthly donation to BBGT, and get a little something extra back in return. If a lot of people do this, and BBGT has more money to play with, then we can afford to do even more. It\u2019s also non-binding, so you can stop donating at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhy is Bad Books, Good Times doing a Patreon?\u003c/h1\u003eBad Books, Good Times is free. That\u2019s never going to change. BBGT is and will always be a free source of entertainment/resource for why these books are just the worst. But it does take time and money to keep it going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have amazing readers, and we\u2019re curious what you\u2019d be willing to throw our way if we gave you a little extra in return. \u201cYou\u201d means two things here, really. \u201cYou\u201d the individual donor (or \u201cPatron\u201d, as the industry lingo goes) get a reward for your generosity that\u2019s just for you.
