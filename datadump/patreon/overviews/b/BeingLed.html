This way me, my family and the ministries that I am involved with can count with your support on ongoing monthly basis! EASY! And you can set a minimum and a maximum as in from $1 to $100 or more per month, this way it\u0027s easy for you and it\u0027s helpful for me. \u00a0:)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eConsider Joining me in this journey!\u003c/h4\u003eWhile doing missions for many years I realized that one thing that I will always have is, expenses!

I have been serving as a missionary ever since I was a kid, along with my mother when I was 6 or 7 years old. At the age of 13 I was already committed to serving Christ and having Him in my life as my savior! Throughout my life I have always been involved with ministry, church and missions and today I choose to continue doing the same because the joy I get in being able to share Jesus and His love while helping people is just what I want to do! Right now I am in Sao Paulo with my family, please keep us in your prayers and God bless us all!",
