Because it is important to me. You are important to me as is your time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEach day\nwhen I wake up, I ask myself what is my purpose in life? Why am I here? \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started playing at 2 years old, it was about the action of learning, playing and mastering. I quickly realised that music, and all art, is about\nconnection. That special connection we share with each other and the world as we appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n35 years\nlater, this meaning has not shifted. However, my experience of the world has transitioned, as has my perception and understanding of the music, art and business.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRecently I\nwas in studio at a major international record label. I was told to come back in a year or\ntwo when I have reached the right social media numbers. This presented a confounding challenge.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eTechnology and Social Media are amazing tools: it has the power to create connection and community which we all crave as fellow human beings. Its reach is\ninstant and global, and information sharing is more fluid than ever before. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut the\nfact that my social media reach isn\u2019t considered \u201cwide enough\u201d to seal the deal also upset\nand frustrated me. I felt like it discounted the experience of my fans, and my work. I know that fans love my songs, my shows and my art. There\nis real exchange. We are connected. And that has profound meaning.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI realise opportunity is as much about access as it is about having the skill to back it up. And choice. But it is also about asking and not being afraid to reach out for help.\nAnd so I am asking you. I see my fans and supporters as a community of\nlike minded people, all seeking a common goal. And that is what I want PATREON\nto represent and nurture. Us taking this journey together. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI joined PATREON as this platform places power\nback in our own hands, the power to connect on our own terms. To create exchange that works for us.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSimply put, your monthly support allows ME to create\nwork that WE wish to see. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou decide how much you feel comfortable pledging.\nAnd you can change, or opt out, whenever you wish. The developers have made\nit easy for us. 2 minutes is all it takes. No risk, no fuss.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBy joining me here we promote the idea of\nEMPOWERMENT: that WE can create the change we want to see in the world, through\nconscious and informed choice, and based on the principle of mutual\nexchange. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo give you a glimpse into the Patreon system, I have created some rewards in exchange for\nyour generosity. This is an expression of my gratitude. It may be a surprise that almost all my present and past patrons have not even opted for the incentives I offer. That kind of unconditional giving is rare and amazing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnother great feature of PATREON is the PRIVATE\n\u201cpatron-only\u201d newsfeed (like FaceBook, Twitter and Instagram). Here, I share my\nlatest thoughts, projects, ideas and information with YOU, my inner TRIBE of\nconnected friends. Most of this information will not be posted on other social\nmedia outlets. I want us to develop this space, like our own special and private universe. Moreover,\nI want to invite you to make comments and provide me with feedback and inspiration,\nso we can share this creative journey together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere are some of the independent projects that I\nam working on now and want to share with you:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCONTRAPUNTAL\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003econtrapuntal is my Creative Research Lab, Artist Collective and Creative Production House and we are currently negotiating a brand new home. Anyone who has moved house knows what this entails!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMUSIC x GENETICS \u2013 CAN WE PROVE MUSIC CREATES\nMEDICAL HEALING THROUGH SCIENCE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis project sits within the Science Department\nat the Moscow State Conservatory of Music in conjunction with the Russian\nAcademy of Science \u2013 it is a ground-breaking project revolutionising musical\nculture and theory, and draws scientific connection with music and its capacity\nfor human healing on a DNA level. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eANTARCTIC MISSION \u003c/strong\u003eto take site-specific field recordings and work with\nlocal Ice-Core scientists to create an artwork that draws attention to climate\nscience and the global warming debate\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eGRAVITATIONAL WAVES \u003c/strong\u003ehave been detected on earth for the first time ever\nand I have a team of scientists who made the discovery in the USA who want to\nsupport a multi media art project to promote their amazing ideas and findings\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eSYNAESTHESIA\u003c/strong\u003e multi media project\nusing 3D Virtual Reality Technologies for proposed installation in a Museum and\nat Festivals \u2013 this project builds on 2000 years of history in the subject and\nI have developed my very own system!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTECTONIC - ART INSTALLATION IN SACRED SPACES\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is my featured PATREON video, and shows the\nglobal launch of my hybrid art performance installation in sacred and religious\nspaces, this one being at St Stephens Church in Melbourne. I really just want\nto bring all people together, no matter what sex, religion or denomination they\nmay be. And sacred spaces by their very nature are beautiful and should be\nbetter utilised. I am speaking with spaces in Austria, Russia, Italy, Japan and\nIsrael, and very much need your support to give energy to the next chapter.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNEW ALBUM \u003c/strong\u003erelease \u2013 I am speaking with some awesome producers\nnow cooking up new ideas and a new direction to create what will be my sixth\nalbum\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eART IS MY REAL JOB! AND I\nLOVE IT!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSometimes people tell me I\nshould get a \u201creal job\u201d. And I tell them this is my job! But it does bring up a\nfeeling of fear that what I am doing isn\u2019t valuable or worthy. Then I remind\nmyself of all the people around the world who have already supported me, and\nbelieve in the power of what I am doing. So I keep moving forward.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSelling tickets to a concert, or albums, or an\nartwork, does not always mean positive income (profit). It may be hard to\nbelieve, but there are always hidden expenses, like the time spent in creative\ndevelopment and production of an artwork, which is mostly unpaid. Many artists\nfind themselves living in a constant debt cycle, juggling the costs of\nproducing new content and work, touring, presenting exhibitions, not to mention\ncovering studio rental and living expenses. More often than not, we finish off\nback where we started... back in debt! It sounds crazy, but this is a labour of\nreal love! And I think attitudes towards this are slowly shifting. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEven if PATREON is not for you, I still value\nyou as a fan and thank you for taking the time to read my words. Please do stay\nin touch and join my other social networks. I want the world to become a more\ndiverse and amazing place, and will do my best to contribute to this goal. Your\nsupport means more than you can imagine.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith love\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBenjamin Skepper\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
