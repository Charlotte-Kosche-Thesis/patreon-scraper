    "summary": "Hi everyone! We are Andy, Amber, Jake (6) \u0026amp; Daisy (4)...and we want out!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years back in Feb 22nd, 2011 we were having lunch on the 25th floor of the Hotel Grand Chancellor when the Christchurch earthquake hit. Christchurch was devastated with many buildings collapsed and 185 people tragically killed. The hotel we were in was badly damaged, the internal fire stairs collapsed and we were trapped. We spent around 4 hours in fight or flight mode, waiting for the building to collapse and be killed (so we thought). It was the most terrifying experience of our lives. But we were lucky that day and we escaped. However, the years that followed were harder on us than getting through the earthquake, we moved to a different country, Andy developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Amber Postnatal Depression after having our son, Jake. We realised how fragile this life is, it is made up of an undetermined number of hours, and we didn\u0027t want to spend those hours away from each other, working in jobs we didn\u0027t like so we could pay for fulltime childcare, and what else? A nicer car, comfier couch, bigger TV and flasher house. At the end of someone\u0027s life, who would say \"I wish I had nicer things\" or \"I wish I had a better career\" no way. They would say \"I wish i\u0027d spent more time with my family\" or \"I wish I had traveled and seen more beautiful things\" we decided that\u0027s the life we wanted, we wanted OUT of this prescribed \u0027normal\u0027 life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt took us a few years to figure out how we were going to do it, but eventually we decided to convert an old school bus into a tiny home! So that is what we did. Andy converted it all by himself, working on it 30-40 hours a week, as well as working full time. It took 12 months of working every single week night after work and every single weekend. We wanted to quit so.many.times! But we knew it would be a million times more worth it than we thought. And it was!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow here we are, traveling around New Zealand filming our lives as we go and putting it all on YouTube. We hope that by sharing our lives and adventures it will inspire a few of you to live a little more simply, buy a little less stuff, and be a little bit happier.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA huge thank you to our\u00a0amazing community of Patrons who support our dream to live this crazy life, without them we couldn\u0027t make these videos and share them. Thank you!!!"
