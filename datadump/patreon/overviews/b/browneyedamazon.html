    "summary": "Thanks for visiting and supporting my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is AnaYelsi (Ah-Nuh-Gel-See) Velasco-Sanchez. I am an IndoLatinx\u00a0mujerista who\u0027s simply trying to survive life in the Latin diaspora. I\u0027ve been working as a faith-based community organizer for a decade now and my experience both in inter-faith and multi-issue organizing has provided me a unique understanding of the complex work involved in bridge-building and unifying diverse people around a shared purpose. I am the former Organizing and Programs Director for The Reformation Project (TRP) and am now working as a faith organizer, consultant, public speaker, writer, and visual artist. I am also a member of the \u003ca href=\"http://www.evangelicalsforsocialaction.org/racial-justice-institute/\"\u003eRacial Justice Institute\u003c/a\u003e team (an initiative of Evangelicals For Social Action) and the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.affirmingchristians.org/\"\u003e Union of Affirming Christians\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work (in all its forms) seeks to do the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eKick up the dust around conversations of faith and spirituality- broadening these conversations beyond what has traditionally been provided by White/straight/academic gatekeepers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eActivate and cultivate a desire in others to examine their spiritual practice and its relationship to colonization, white supremacy, and nationalism\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreate art, space, resources, and relational opportunities to moving towards shared liberation\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI am currently pursuing this as a public speaker/facilitator/educator, freelance writer (with a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/browneyedamazon/\"\u003e weekly Patheos column\u003c/a\u003e), visual artist, and (soon to be) co-host of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.mysticsoulproject.com/\"\u003e Mystic Soul Podcast\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0with Teresa P. Mateus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page offers folks an opportunity to support my\u00a0ministry. I am dedicated to the work of liberation. The current political climate and the divides (in society and in the Church) amplify the urgency of this work. I am passionate about raising up leaders and facilitating spaces (virtual and real) that invite people into a deeper commitment to racial justice, LGBTQ affirmation, decolonization, and the dismantling of white supremacy in the Church.\u00a0I am working towards a vision of a liberating Church that faithfully pursues the biblical call to do justice in a way that honors Creator and creation. I am committed to this vision and so I am acting on faith and moving outside of traditional models of missional/prophetic work that hinges one\u0027s ability to pursue justice on their relationship with systems and organizational hierarchies. I am\u00a0is trusting in a community of believers to partner with me in this endeavor - freeing me to go when called and to act and speak with the integrity necessary to fulfill this vision.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in supporting me in doing this work, I invite you to become a partner today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to invite me to come speak or teach in your community? Please email me at anayelsi@browneyedamazon.com for more details. I am also available for consultations as faith communities, educational entities, and non-profits navigate the sometimes difficult call to \"do justice\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this together,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnaYelsi"
