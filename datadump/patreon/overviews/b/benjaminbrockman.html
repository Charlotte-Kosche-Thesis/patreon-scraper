I\u0027m fascinated and driven by stories, in all forms - from the stories of individuals, to the story of humankind.\u00a0In 2011 I found myself unwittingly embarking on a the mission of telling my own story. The details of this narrative and mythology are still slowly taking shape in my drawing, prints and paintings. \u00a0Today, I can say I\u0027ve been prolific and committed to this process, but there\u0027s a big missing piece.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i46.photobucket.com/albums/f117/heyrobot25/12472388_10153314410160267_372420230317314685_n_zpspklmftod.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Present\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years I have been struggling to balance employment and creative development. \u00a0I recently left my work with Autistic kids to focus on my art. \u00a0It was a risky move, and I knew it. \u00a0I left a fair amount of stability, benefits, and a job that I loved, because I knew it was time to make a solid go of making art. \u00a0My dreams have not changed since I was a boy: scouring the world for stories, and telling them in the biggest way possible. \u00a0The reality of this is that with rising rent, bills and studio fees, my income does not sustain my creative practice. \u00a0I seldom have time to seek those opportunities to show or sell my work, or have time for marketing (it took my 3 months to get this page together), let alone create with any kind of actual focus. \u00a0As John Cleese says: \"The enemies of creativity are anxiety and interruption.\" \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i46.photobucket.com/albums/f117/heyrobot25/13174179_10103443861266382_2865172327018450484_n_zpserykikbi.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s not to complain. \u00a0I sought the artist\u0027s life as it sought me - and it is a privilege. I don\u0027t regret my path at all, because I see the value of creativity and art as immeasurable, however abstract. \u00a0But an artist\u0027s life is HARD too, because one has to live in the abstract - dashing between the real world and maintaining clarity of a vision. \u00a0That\u0027s where you come in. \u00a0I\u0027m asking you to partner in the development of my studio practice. I\u0027m hoping you\u0027ll see that I am a great investment, a prolific, passionate, creative person with a deep belief in the healing power of art. \u00a0I take this very seriously. \u00a0It is my dream, my vision and my purpose.
