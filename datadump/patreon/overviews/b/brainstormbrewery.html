Our goal is to demystify the financial part of the game, and we come at that approach with a diverse group of cast members who each bring their own area of expertise. Are you a Commander player who wants to know the right time to buy-in before the next wave of popularity? Jason Alt is here to tell you what\u2019s what. If you want to keep your finger on the pulse of Standard or Modern, Corbin Hosler has own fingers in a whole bunch of cookie jars across the Magic content world, and we\u2019re lucky to have him. If you\u2019re trying to grind your way up in the finance world and want to take advantage of the niche world of bulk rares and commons, Doug is going to drop some serious #breakingbulk knowledge every week. Together, the trio has more than 15 years of finance experience. Of course all of this hardcore learning comes with some less-than-serious joking around and debauchery every week, to make sure you have at least one giggle or audible nose breath.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo help you make or save money in this rough world of trading cards, we\u2019d appreciate your help in reaching our own goals. We want to provide you all with awesome content and product; Your Patreon support will go towards a variety of our costs, which include but are not limited to;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePaying our editor JJ\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eServer costs for brainstormbrewery.com\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePaying artists to create new Tokens\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eShipping out those tokens, playmats, and other goodies\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u201cWhat\u2019s it worth to you?\u201d question has long been dead in the #mtgfinance world, but here we need to ask it of you. How many times has this cast taken the bore out of your commute, or kept you entertained on a solo drive to a PPTQ? How many times has one of our Breaking Bulk or Pick of the Week calls scored you enough money to \u003ca href=\"http://legitmtg.com/i-sold-my-fetchlands-and-you-should-too/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebuy a fridge for your significant other\u003c/a\u003e? If this cast is worth the price of your entertainment or investment costs, ask yourself \u201cHmm\u2026 how many dollars do I love each of these guys?\u201d We sincerely appreciate any and all pledges, and want to continue creating the best Magic finance podcast in the community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
