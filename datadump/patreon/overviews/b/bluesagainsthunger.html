     "about": "Since the summer of 2014, we have been traveling from city to city on the Blues Against Hunger Tour bringing musicians together to share the blues with music fans that help their communities. We found that the food drives and the blues jams are both very similar; those that contribute food, and the musicians that contribute their music are doing the same thing; they all come together to lift each other up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGet to know Sixx \u0026amp; Sweet better:\u003cbr\u003eSince the day we met, we have been traveling and involved in event promotion of production, the last 10 years of which has been primarily charity music events. When we married in 2003 we hit the road and traveled coast to coast with 3 kids. Once the kids were gone, we traveled and promoted a couple more years before settling and \"retiring\" in San Felipe Baja California in 2006. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a year, we realized sitting still wasn\u0027t our thing and in February 2007, we began publishing Mexico Living, a magazine on real estate and living in Mexico, which allowed us to travel, research and write on the country and region. During that time the Lion Club International had a new club being chartered in San Felipe and the new club ask us to help them produces a blues festival. We agreed and worked with them and did for the next 7 years. We are proud of the wonderful community work done by the Lions Club during that time and still today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2010, we slowed down and only produced the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/fUfsZ1qwiqU?list=PLklUBeDWRVGJ3OXSlu69OCQeVw_s4PEAT\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Baja Love Ride\u003c/a\u003e , a 4-day, 270 bicycle\u00a0rally to support regional orphanages. In 2011, were asked by another organization to help start and produce the Baja Blues festival in Rosarito Beach and we agreed. Two months leading up to the festival we had already planned the Baja Walk; a charity event to promote Baja. We walked from San Felipe to Cabo, starting in May and finishing in July. We returned home in August 2012 after the 74-day, 850-mile adventure, we hosted the first annual Baja Blues Festival at the Rosarito Beach Hotel. Lots of friends and family came both to the show and to welcome us home after the walk. It was a great event and we had a wonderful time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u00a0had been 9 non-stop years and we\u00a0were tired. The walk took a lot from us and gave us so much too; perspective first and foremost. We wanted to do something to help, but in a different way.\u00a0The next two coincidences\u00a0changed our lives forever. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the Winter of 2013 in San Felipe, we were producing weekly concerts and bringing artists from the United States and other parts of the region down to perform. We had a duo called Rio Samaya Band coming down to perform. When we finally spoke to them, we explained that things are going to be slow because tourism was down. They didn\u0027t care and wanted to come anyway, so we invited them to stay with us.\u00a0The couple Pancho and Sal became and are still very dear friends. It was June 2013 and they didn\u0027t know about the project we had underway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/hwbsARuBut8?list=PLklUBeDWRVGJ01nBvZQy2ABGi66qcN1fJ\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Chatarra\u003c/a\u003e Project\u00a0was our plastic bottle boat project. During the previous year when we walked down the peninsula of Baja, we realized problems with plastic bottle waste. We decided to build a plastic bottle boat and paddle it down the Sea of Cortez to bring awareness a to the problem.\u00a0Sadly, because of a mechanical problem, The Chatarra wasn\u0027t able to complete her journey and after a second attempt to rush and build another smaller boat, we missed the summer tides and finally had to give up. It was now the start of summer, an extremely hot time of the year in San Felipe.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePancho and Sal had stayed with us the entire month and help us build The Chatarra and when we asked, \"what we should do now?\". They replied \"Do what we do. Learn to play music\". We spent the next 3 scorching months in a small air conditioned office and began learning to play the music we had fallen in love with over the previous 8 years - the blues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn March 2014, after 8 months of practicing in \"the closet\", we were asked to help come up with an idea to support a food bank having difficulties. We decided to make our musical debut a food drive. We knew people were curious and would come out. We were right. The room was packed and nearly 400 people filled the room and the donations were amazing and moving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt that instance, we knew what we wanted to do. We had been looking for a way to make a difference at such a personal level and we found it. We wanted to combine our passion for helping others and our love of blues. Blues Against Hunger Society was created along with Sweet Sixx and Wild Pack band. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the summer of 2014, we have been traveling from city to city on the Blues Against Hunger Tour bringing musicians together to share the blues with music fans that help their communities. We found that the food drives and the blues jams are both very similar; those that contribute food, and the musicians that contribute their music are doing the same thing; they all come together to lift each other up.\u003cbr\u003e",
