    "summary": "The Battles of the First World War Podcast looks to go in-depth into the battles of the Great War of 1914-1918. The goal is to really go into the details of how and why these battles unfolded and happened as they did. In telling the story of these clashes we can revisit some of the stories of the men and women who lived, fought, and died during the first titanic struggle of the 20th Century. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe BFWWP will have a very heavy lean towards the Western Front for the foreseeable future, but we will get to the other fronts as well. The mountainous Italian Front and Balkan Fronts will be visited, as well as the forests and vast fields of the Eastern Front. We will campaign in Africa,where the British chased a wily German general around for years. We\u2019ll also be in the lands of the Middle Eastern Front, where imperial decisions and their consequences have led us directly to the geopolitical issues of today.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe men and women who were alive during this time and lived through this terrible ordeal deserve to be remembered. They deserve to be remembered as simply as you and I deserve to be remembered. If telling the stories of the trenches and battlefields of World War One is something that interests you, would you consider becoming a Patron? \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donations help to keep the podcast servers running, maintain the website, and purchase new articles, books, and research materials. the articles, books, and materials all lead to more detailed episodes on the people and events of the First World War. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best part of this project has been the opportunity to email, speak with, and even have the occasional drink with listeners! Thank you so much for considering becoming a Patron of the Battles of the First World War Podcast!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
