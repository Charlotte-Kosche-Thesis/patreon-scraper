    "summary": "I created Beople\u0027s Buddies Animal Rescue five years ago with the vision to support the interconnectivity of all life - animals, humans, and the environment.\u00a0 To me, kindness and compassion begins by recognizing our connection to all beings and taking care of the world we live in.\u00a0 I use my background in social work to fulfill the mission of Beople\u0027s Buddies, which is to promote forever homes through compatibility-based placements.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a small organization dedicated to rescuing buddies from Los Angeles shelters considered to be not highly adoptable to the general public.\u00a0 The majority of our buddies have been tagged by the shelters as behavioral, medical, seniors, or have special needs and are among the first to be euthanized when the shelter lacks space.\u00a0 Many of the buddies we rescue take months and months before they are able to successfully transition into a forever home.\u00a0 We make sure each buddy gets the medical care and socialization needed to ensure they are set up for success in their new homes. We work extremely hard to match each dog\u0027s personality with a pet parent\u0027s lifestyle so both can thrive.\u00a0 Every time one of our buddies is adopted, we celebrate by dedicating a tree in their honor through Tree People, a local environmental nonprofit organization, to help promote a sustainable future while also fulfilling our vision of the interconnectivity of all life.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was recently able to secure a base of operations for Beople\u0027s Buddies, which has been a dream of mine for many years.\u00a0 Having a location enables me to focus on the spirit of community and the creation of programs, such as Books and Buddies that brings together kids with disabilities to read to our buddies. We have also been hosting DIY card making events to make cards for kids in the hospital among other plant-based events that bring together people with companies trying to also promote a kinder world.\u00a0 Everything I do with Beople\u0027s Buddies is under the social work umbrella.\u00a0 Paying L.A. rent for a small nonprofit is very difficult.\u00a0 We offer services at our location that help us pay rent, such as grooming and daycare, but having the security of monthly income will allow us to continue to rescue and focus our attention on the shelter buddies who need our help most and deserve a chance to have the love they have always deserved.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for being one of Beople\u0027s People, for believing in my vision, and for supporting our PAWS!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
