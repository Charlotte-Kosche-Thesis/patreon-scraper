    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://securitybsides.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSecurity BSides\u003c/a\u003e keeps growing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month, we have several requests from groups all over the world that want to start new chapters. Sometimes, we\u0027ll see several requests per week! Each one of these events contacts BSides Global for more information, a walk-through of expectations and rules, and guidance on what to do next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOften, a regional event will take the information and run with it, throwing an awesome conference as a result. Sometimes, those making the request will need a lot of hand-holding and encouragement during the process. Every time, they want to know that someone at Global will be there to answer their questions, provide advice, and talk them over roadblocks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd while the BSides Global organization does not attempt to create a mold into which all other BSides events must fit, it does provide those necessary components; advice, guidance, and support, to ensure each event has the greatest potential to succeed as an individual and unique conference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might not know this, but Security BSides Global doesn\u0027t have a budget. Since 2011, BSides Global has been out of the fundraising game and has focused solely on being the \"Mothership\", ensuring that regional events just getting off the ground have the resources they need to be successful. But keeping on top of the requests takes time, and keeping up with the on-boarding, and keeping the Security BSides Wiki up-to-date with information for all of the events is a part time job in itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past, BSides Global was run and maintained by a dedicated\u00a0volunteer, someone who gave up many hours of sleep - and a lot of their sanity - to make sure that the regional events had everything\u00a0they needed. They did this while also working a full-time job, but eventually this led to a case of burnout.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where I come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Genevieve, AKA Banasidhe, and I\u0027ve been running BSides Las Vegas since 2012 and now, BSides Denver as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spearheaded the process of turning both of them into 501(c)(3) nonprofits, and recruited some of the best Board of Directors and\u003cbr\u003eSenior Staff known to BSidesdom East and West of the Rockies. I spend a good portion of every day working to make the BSides I\u0027m responsible for even better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I brought the idea of taking on the roles of BSides Global Admin\u00a0and Community Manager to Jack Daniel - the Founding Father of BSides and my business partner in BSidesLV - he gave his blessing and that\u0027s\u00a0good enough for me. I also asked a bunch of friends, a few of the BSidesLV Senior Staff members, and took a twitter poll, and all signs\u00a0pointed to yes.\u00a0But there\u0027s still no funding in the Security BSides coffers for an Admin and Community Manager, which is where this Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJack and I road-tripped together to THOTCon in May, talking BSides Global along the way. Think of it as a day and a half on-boarding session, where I got to spend the entire time picking his brain about everything BSides Global has been up to the past few years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause BSides Global is a non-profit, all financial numbers will be made public. Initially, this is intended to fund continuing efforts to ensure the growth and evolution of a mature BSides organization. As this fund continues to grow, it carries with it the potential to support other contributing members who also bring their time and effort to the table to support this process. Additionally, it\u0027s our hope that this fund grows sufficiently to begin supporting sponsorships and other hacker related charity efforts, in an effort to give back to the community. But it all begins with this one step.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me help the BSides community of events to become even more vibrant and prolific than they already are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016, there were 70 BSides events in 20 countries around the globe- including 15 first time event cities. That brought our historical totals to 302 BSides events, encompassing 100 cities and 26 countries since July of 2009.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are 56 global BSides events on the calendar for 2017, as of last edit, including seven new event cities that will bring BSides to three new countries. This movement is growing by the month, bringing local communities together through a mutual admiration and need for education, conversation and collaboration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat else will 2017 and beyond hold for the Security BSides Organizations? Let\u0027s find out together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
