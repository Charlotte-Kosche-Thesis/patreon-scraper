My hope is to build this to a point that allows me to have creative freedom without the worry of catering to \"Ad friendly\" guidelines, and to retain the ability to continue pursuing creation as my full-time occupation. Contributing to this is completely mandatory. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsider it a monthly tax for watching my videos. All you plebeians have been enjoying my content absolutely free for far too long and now it\u0027s about time I took what was mine. For all of you who\u0027ve been carelessly enjoying my content, you must now pay me a monthly fee. There\u0027s no way around the matter, all of you owe me something that will be collected at a specific time each month. If you refuse to pay up, I will penalize you with fines. \u00a0Lots of fines. And if you refuse to pay those fines, I will relentlessly call your house to harass you about not giving me money for all my grueling work. If you stop watching my videos altogether, you could be sentenced to up to 5 years in prison. I stress, these fees are MANDATORY and not paying your share may result in serious consequences.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere might also be rewards depending on the size of your contribution. Rewards ranging from access to a patron only Discord server, joining the myself and the crew for livestreams, to even receiving a pack of custom Breezy stickers every month. Just look through the rewards and see for yourself! For the price of a Starbucks coffee, you can support a privileged white girl.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I know what you\u0027re thinking, \"Bree, why should we have to support you for something we\u0027ve always had for free?\". That\u0027s a great question!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for the opportunity to entertain you, I hope I can continue to deliver underwhelming videos for the foreseeable future for all to enjoy. If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me an email at kulebusiness@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith love,\u003cbr\u003e~Breezy\u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/lQFCAMV.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor real though I have no idea how refunds work.

My ultimate goal is to provide my audience with free content at the consistency I\u0027ve been able to in the past, but due to YouTube\u0027s recent decisions that\u0027s becoming less and less of a possibility. My hope is that I\u0027ll eventually be able to pursue other means of sustaining my livelihood without having to rely on YouTube, or my viewers, to produce content. It\u0027ll happen eventually, but in the meantime this Patreon is a sort of make-or-break for my channel, so let\u0027s cross our fingers, eh? c:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Bree\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote: All rewards are sent out after payment methods are charged at the beginning of each month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
