    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for checking out my Patreon page.\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0The goal of BambinoGames on Youtube is to bring you entertaining VR and PC simulation game content while mixing in my HONEST opinions about games and computer related products. \u00a0Information that helps people make buying decisions and sparks discussion. You can be sure that when I receive a game or product from a company for review I will ALWAYS give it a fair and honest evaluation. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oJAFTsD9ngc\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did I start a Patreon campaign?\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve started this Patreon for two reasons: To build a stronger community with my fans, and to reduce dependency on YouTube ad revenue.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nProducing videos can be expensive. \u00a0PC gear, cameras, editing software, games.. this stuff is costly. \u00a0The goal is to have good gear and games to produce cool content for you. \u00a0Your Patreon support will help offset the reduction in advertising revenue Youtube creators are experiencing due to Youtube\u0027s video monetization problems. \u00a0I\u2019ve always relied on ad revenue to invest back into my channel but in the past few months this model has changed drastically. Full disclosure, BambinoGames ad revenue has dropped by over 50% which is ridiculous. This is due some of the biggest companies in the world boycotting Youtube for advertising creating a lack of ad inventory to serve to Youtube videos. \u00a0You may have noticed much less advertising on the videos you watch.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a way for people to pledge monthly support to BambinoGames. Your Patreon support will help offset the ad revenue loss and at the same time it will help build a community. This Patreon page will be a great way to interact directly. Something Youtube just doesn\u2019t provide or allow. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are multiple tiers starting at just $1 per month. Its certainly not necessary to become a patron but it will definitely be appreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for your consideration and have a great day.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBambino\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/BambinoGames\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/BambinoGames\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
