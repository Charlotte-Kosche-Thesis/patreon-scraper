    "summary": "Dear readers, followers, subscribers, and patrons:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a writer, an artist, an educator, a folklorist, and a freelance sorceress I devote a lot of time to research and writing in order to produce quality informational blog posts at bodaciousbanshee.com and acdemically informed classes and workshops around New Orleans. I also put a lot of research and divination into my talismanic art projects. Each drawing, sculpture, painting, and digital graphic is created after weeks (sometimes months) of reading and planning. It\u0027s not the most lucrative business, but in many ways my work is its own reward. I do what I can to make the world a little more magical in my own way. Sometimes I am commissioned to do spellwork for people, and oftentimes those people are young women in financial need trying to protect themselves or a loved one from abuse. In those cases I do not charge for that magical service, and I leave the donation option as strictly optional. I also tend to leave my divination fees as merely \"suggested donations\" because I do not believe that oracular services should only be accessible to those with money. I rely financially on the generosity and integrity of my clients, friends, friends followers.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs interest and demand for my work rises, the hours I have available for both \"a normal job\" and leisure dwindle. I\u0027ve been asked to be a guest writer on other sites, I\u0027ve been asked to start thinking about publishing a book, I\u0027ve been asked to help plan conferences, I\u0027ve been asked to start making videos, I\u0027ve been asked to teach more classes, and I feel blessed and honored by all this, but none of these things put food on the table or keep a roof over my head. My last muggle manager even went out of her way to make sure that I had no prep time before my weekly classes out of sheer spite, despite the business owner specifically telling her to work with my teaching schedule. The emotional and physical stress of that situation took quite a toll on me. I never want to be in a scenario like that again. My work within the magical community, locally and online, is a labor of love and like any artist I want to be able to support myself doing what I love.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf enough followers of my work join together in pledging small monthly donations it will alleviate a lot of my stress and allow me to commit more time to bettering the magical community and allow me to continue providing assistance to individuals at little to no cost. Every dollar brings me that much closer to publishing a book you want to read, making a video you want to see, recording a podcast you want to hear, making a painting you want to own, organizing an event you want to attend, etc., etc.. Each tier of my Patreon contributors will get their own, personalized perks and rewards, as well as access to exclusive content not available on my blogs or Facebook. With your help I can make your life\u2014and the lives of others\u2014a little more magical. I hope that you will chose to join me on this adventure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBanshee\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to make a one-time contribution, \u003cbr\u003eclick the button below to donate via paypal: \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations\u0026amp;business=AH7ZV5HKBZWR4\u0026amp;lc=US\u0026amp;currency_code=USD\u0026amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://bodaciousbanshee.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/donate_button-cropped.png\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e"
