I write, draw, color and produce the comic sometime\nbetween my suck-ass day job, my family life and sleep. The comic follows a group of twenty-something friends as they\nstruggle between crappy retail jobs and relationships all the while still\ndetermined to live life on their own terms. Many of the stories are biographic with the prevailing theme\nbeing that, despite lack of money, heartaches, and feeling lost about one\u2019s\nfuture, you will never feel more alive than the years you spent in your\ntwenties, surrounded by your friends, when your responsibilities were few, your\nvices many and you had nothing to do and all day to do it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Comic\u003c/strong\u003e, which updates twice a week (Monday and Friday) is set in Portland, OR., the comic\u2019s main focus is on strong\ncharacters with just a dash of absurd humor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTake warning\u003c/strong\u003e, The comic, although focused on characters and good story telling, does dip into adult themes and NSFW illustrations...much like life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI take great pride\u003c/strong\u003e in plotting out the stories and weaving the\ncharacter\u2019s lives within the others. I have years of stories in me and I can\u2019t\nwait to let them out and watch them grow organically. Often times I will post a one shot strip that\nmay seem innocuous at the time only to have it set up another story later on. I\nlove intertwining plots and sub plots while still maintaining a degree of humor\nand staying in character. The characters too will change and grow as the years\nunfold. Some you will empathize with, some you may not like very much. Often\ntimes they may say and do things you may not agree with. Keep in mind, these\nare just characters. They don\u2019t necessarily represent my own views. You may not\nalways like what they say or do, but I guarantee you won\u2019t be bored. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs for the art,\u003c/strong\u003e I put the comic together from beginning to\nend, slaving long into the night sketching it on paper, scanning it in, inking\nand coloring it in Corel Painter and laying it out and lettering it in\nPhotoshop. This is all me here (unless I\u2019m fortunate enough to have a guest\nartist grace the site every once in a while) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGrowing up,\u003c/strong\u003e all I wanted to do was draw comics. As I got\nolder I kind of forgot that dream and it detoured me to places I never\nreally wanted to go. Now I\u2019m back and determined to throw my hat into the\nhuge web comic arena. There\u2019s only so much dead-end retail I can stomach. And that\u2019s why I set up Patreon. I need to\nreturn to the dream I had when I was younger. Nothing would make me happier\nthan to see this comic take fire and be able to do this as my full time job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo on with the rewards\u2026"
