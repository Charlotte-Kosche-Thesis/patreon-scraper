I\u0027m constantly asked in comments, emails, and private messages how people can donate, so there\u0027s clearly interest. I\u0027ve always given my Paypal info, but I figure that this is an easier way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027ve gone ahead and done it. All help I receive here is appreciated more than you\u0027ll ever know. I have many bills to pay, and due to this, the quality and quantity of my videos is suffering greatly. All donations I receive here will go towards improving the quality of my videos in the form of new recording equipment, new blades, and new targets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGo ahead and check out the rewards, but remember that the primary reason for this is because you truly love my content and want to help me make it the best that it can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll that said, thank you for your continued support, and whether or not you donate, thank you so much for watching.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Will Keith."
