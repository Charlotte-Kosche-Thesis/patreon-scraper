This page will also hopefully help support me to become a volunteer coordinator and help so many more people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5OWRnGl.jpg\" style=\"width: 268px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Story\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy life like most has been filled with many negative experiences that have reaffirmed my negative core beliefs and caused me to create some very negative unhelpful rules in my life to protect myself from what I perceived as harmful to my life. These are rules like \u0027If you don\u0027t try, you won\u0027t fail\u0027, \u0027Say yes to everyone\u0027 which have come from my negative core belief of \u0027I\u0027m not good enough\u0027 which is so generalised and negative that it is untrue and unhelpful to my mental health.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was 30 after working in a dead end job for 5 years, the realisation that this might be it for me and even this simple job I felt like a failure at, I finally broke down and couldn\u0027t pretend I was coping any longer. This was the hardest time in my life but also the turning point in my life journey, it took another 3 years of thinking that my mental health label was who I was now and justified by my negative life experience. During this period I attempted to fight against my issues while also believing they where who I was now and that would never change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast year was the biggest turning point in my journey to recovery as I start\u00a0Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) once again but with a new motivation and energy to improve myself. It\u0027s not been an easy journey but nothing worthwhile in our lives should be easy, challenges are their to make the achievements important and huddles aren\u0027t there to stop us but to challenge us. I\u0027ve never felt this good in my 34 years of life and I know there is still a long road ahead with even bigger challenges but that is just the journey of life it\u0027ll never stop being challenging until it ends. My outlook on life before was life isn\u0027t fair because I\u0027d been dealt a bad hand which I couldn\u0027t cope with. Now I know that life isn\u0027t black and white, fair or unfair, it\u0027s just what we make of it and we are the only ones that can change ourselves. Sure friends, family and professionals can be very supportive and usually necessary to achieve our goals but they can\u0027t do anything if we aren\u0027t willing to put the time and energy into these challenges.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the past 4 years I\u0027ve done some pretty amazing things in my life from helping to set up a company to public speaking at conventions in front of hundreds of people but until now I\u0027ve ignored these achievements easily with my own self doubt but I\u0027m now not willing to believe those thoughts. I\u0027ve also while going through this personal journey shared my stories and experiences on my personal facebook profile which many people have commented how good it is to see them and how it has helped them in someway either realising something they need to do or just realise they aren\u0027t alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ILprzUS.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Do Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis brings me to why I\u0027m setting up a patreon page which for the past few months has been something I\u0027ve kept thinking about to potentially earn myself a little money while hopefully continue to help others or just sharing my experiences. I realised while going to my CBT that I\u0027ll not do it if I continue to block myself with \u0027What if\u0027s\u0027 and that I need to reaffirm the knowledge that it\u0027s better to try and fail rather than fail to even try.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo my goal is to start doing more videos speaking about my experiences, what I\u0027m learning that helps me and hopefully spread a positive message to anyone that needs it. Also I\u0027ll be sharing article or information that I\u0027ve found to my social media platforms to bring all my audience more content that could possible help them. At the moment I\u0027m on benefits seeking work, while attempting to get a career in the Volunteer \u0026amp; Charity sector with my new work coach who is a volunteer coordinator herself. But this means I have very little money and none to actually improve my equipment or do the positive self improving activities that I\u0027d like too and share with you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Will Your Pledge Be Spent On?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment any money that I earn from this page will go straight onto equipment and then probably travel or other things that I\u0027ll need to bring you awesome positive and hopefully useful content. If at any point this starts to earn me any significant money I\u0027ll most likely start to donate a potion of my earning to charities or even personal gofund projects to help others in need. I\u0027ll also consult my audience on any of this before I go ahead as it\u0027s your support and money that will be allowing me to do this in the first place, your support and voice will always be important to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cuCtBKu.jpg\" style=\"width: 346px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd Finally\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027d just like to thank anyone that does subscribe to this page as you should know any amount you give will be greatly appreciated and used to the best of my ability to help me continue to improve but also to give you better content. I\u0027d also like to specially thank all my friends, family and anyone else that has supported, encouraged and just been a great inspiration to me during my life. I know I couldn\u0027t have gotten to this stage in my life without you all and I\u0027ll continue to love everyone of you always.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve read all this and like me are usually far to poor to donate money to peoples Patreon\u0027s or KS\u0027s then please don\u0027t worry I appreciate support in always not just money so even if you just share this page onto your own social media pages to give me more reach, I\u0027ll be thanking you so much and if you tag in my pages so I see it you\u0027ll get a special mention on my videos just like a paid subscriber. Because for me it\u0027s not about what type of support as not everyone can give money and even though it\u0027s very important to live in this world it\u0027s not the most important factor in our happiness or life journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading and I love you all very much xx\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eFxOXFz.jpg\" style=\"width: 212px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
