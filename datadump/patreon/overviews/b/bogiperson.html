While the young noble is busy scoffing at the meager food and lodging offerings - standard for everyone else on Eren -, the feudal state is engulfed in organic matter from an Alliance bioweapon.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Ereni leadership ask Ranai if they would be willing to locate the weapon smugglers and defuse the conflict, and Ranai certainly has both the requisite diplomatic experience and the magical expertise.
