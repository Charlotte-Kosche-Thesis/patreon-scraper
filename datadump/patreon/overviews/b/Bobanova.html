Music is my life. Not just listening, but rather creating it in a lot of exciting ways. I am self-thaught keyboard player, sound designer, syntheseizer freak and audio mixing and mastering engineer. I don\u0027t percieve music through prism of genres, so everything that i create is a mixture of everything, which, from my point of view gives it a nice dose of uniqueness.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI approached Patreon because i think that, as a musician i can offer you guys some really interesting and unique content, and use the opportunities of this platform to earn for living. If you decide to be my patron, and support me, i can grant you access to some exlusive, or private stuff, even by order, or by your wish.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e"

Music definitely plays the biggest role in my life. Listening, of course, but creating is something that moves my bones. I am self taught keyboard player, sound designer and sound mixing and mastering engineer. I don\u0027t see music throuhgh the prism of genres, so almost everything that i create is a mixture of different approaches to music, and could not strictly fit into any mold or genre, which, in my personal opinion gives me some sort of\u00a0uniqueness. My dream is to earn for living from doing jobs that are related to sound and video. It can be making music, doing sound design, or engineering, shooting and editing videos, and i think that Patreon is a great point to start.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thanks for stoping by,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest Regards,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSlobodan Rekovi\u0107\u00a0",
