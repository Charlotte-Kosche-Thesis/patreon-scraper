So do I.\u003cbr\u003eI also love making videogames so adult games is just a logical conclusion.\u003cbr\u003eMy goal here is to eventually work full time making adult games that don\u0027t feel like a chore to play and getting the adult goodies: that you actually have fun. With your support I\u0027ll be able to achieve that and you\u0027ll get actually finished games in reasonable lapses of time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMain themes you will get are \ntentacles/monsters, futanari, demons and big boobs/penis/penetrations/cumshots. Though my main angle will most likely be comedy and light hearted \nthemes, expect to get a few darkish serious ones put to vote when it\u0027s time to \ndecide a new game to make. Yes, after a game is finished my plan is putting to vote what I\u0027m going to work on next from a long list of ideas I have had written over time and never made. Also during that time suggestions will be accepted.\u003cbr\u003e-------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eRight now, work on\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSexonomicon \u003c/strong\u003eis kind of on pause. Right now I don\u0027t have the time to make it the game I want it to be.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s an adventure game where you play as Lucia, a wizard, looking around a house for 4 seals to send a succubus back to her realm while running and hiding from your friend who is now a futanari controlled by the succubus.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://vid186.photobucket.com/albums/x4/Mazinkaiser_DX/HG1/scene3_zpsoo0e8eqr.mp4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eI tried making the game on RPG Maker VX Ace after trying on MV, but both gave way too many performance issues due to the size of the animation. Here are the posts with both versions of the stress demo so you can have an idea of what I\u0027m shooting for:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/vx-ace-demo-8115084\"\u003eVX Ace Version\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/sexonomicon-mv-8059408\"\u003eMV Version\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTower of Lust \u003c/strong\u003eis what\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m working on right now. It\u0027s a simple battle fuck game where you can choose to play with a futanari amazon or a halfling with giant blood (*wink*). A powerful succubus is gathering monster girls in a tower to rule the world with the most powerful weapon: sex! An elven village close to the tower has been suffering raids from them and getting their girls captured so they hired you, an acomplished... \"adventurer\", to defeat them in their game and free their girls.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll have the first demo soon released for everyone and then I\u0027ll release each version for patrons first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s it for now, you can also check my tumblr which will be used for minor updates or general posting of stuff I find interesting in a more constant manner:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://bbsoftg.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBBSoft Tumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHope you enjoy my works!\u003cbr\u003e"
