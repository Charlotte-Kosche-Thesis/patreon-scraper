    "summary": "We\u0027re a dogsled team in northern Wisconsin, run by two nonfiction writers,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.blairbraverman.com\"\u003eBlair Braverman\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/quincemountain\"\u003eQuince Mountain\u003c/a\u003e. We live on our farm with 21 huskies, and every year they run hundreds of joyful miles through the national forest by our home. Our priorities are happy huskies, involvement in our local community (as well as the literary/artist community), and plenty of dog-powered adventure in the wilderness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlair has been dogsledding for 11 years, since she was 18, and Quince is an experienced horse wrangler who\u0027s ridden covered wagons across the Dakotas and fell in love with sled dogs when he fell in love with Blair. He\u0027s the dreamer of the team, always coming up with creative solutions to problems. Since Quince is allergic to dogs, Blair takes on cuddling responsibilities for both of them. She\u0027s also the primary racer, currently working to qualify for the Iditarod, a 1000-mile race across the Alaskan bush. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u00a0both believe that the team consists of MUCH MORE than the dogs who are running at any given moment and the human standing on the runners. Our team includes our wonderful handlers, our wise and gentle retired dogs, the occasional puppy (sled dog wannabes!), our neighbors, our sponsors, and everyone else who loves and supports the pups. This dog family is Too Much Joy to keep to ourselves, and we love sharing updates with the community that\u0027s formed around the team.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning a dog team is expensive and extremely time-consuming (dog food alone is $40/day during training season, and a single training run takes 4-12 hours; it\u0027s a part-time job all summer, and more than full time, for both of us, from October to March). Our Patreon helps with the costs of dog food, veterinary care, equipment, races, and travel with the dogs. Having stable and predictable sponsorships is truly transformative as we work toward our current goal of qualifying for the 2019 Iditarod, a 1000-mile race across the Alaskan interior and a dream adventure for us and the pups.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve created this page as a response to our amazing friends and readers who have asked about ways to support the dogs. We\u0027d love to welcome you to the team!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eBlair and Quince\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
