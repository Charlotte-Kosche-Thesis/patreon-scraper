    "summary": "I woke up one\u00a0day and realised that I knew little to nothing about my history other than slavery.\u00a0 From that day onwards I have tried to seek out the hidden side of Black History from around the world and share it in as many ways with as many souls as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started this project, I was told by more people than I care to remember that \"Black people don\u0027t support other black people\" and that I shouldn\u0027t\u00a0bother.\u00a0 I didn\u0027t\u00a0listen and grew a social media family, 20,000 members, strong. Now things are moving to the next level, better content, requiring more in-depth\u00a0research.\u00a0 Once again I\u0027ve\u00a0been told that the support for this project isn\u0027t\u00a0there, once again I\u0027ve decided not to listen, and I\u0027m\u00a0hoping that once again the people will prove \"them\" wrong and us right.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSigning up to\u00a0Patreon supports me in two fundamental ways; the first and most obvious is financial, equipment, materials and other resources all need to be obtained and while some things can be borrowed most cannot, the second and maybe even more important way is motivation.\u00a0 Every positive comment like share and dollar received\u00a0adds another unit of the motivation I need to continue my research and studies into black history.\u00a0 I\u0027m\u00a0no academic, studying does not come naturally to me and so knowing that people are willing me, to keep going provides me with the extra energy needed to keep going when things get hard.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a ton of content already uploaded and loads more to come. So please\u00a0stick around, enjoy the page, enjoy the free content and most importantly if you learn something then share it with someone you love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to take this opportunity to thank you for taking the time out of your busy day to visit this page and for considering joining me on this beautiful\u00a0journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAse\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
