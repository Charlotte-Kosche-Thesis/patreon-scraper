And I want to continue to do it! I want to keep on supporting YOU by providing solid information from the most awesome birth professionals out there. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo I\u2019m going to do the PBS-thing and ask for your support\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nI\u2019ll let you in on a secret: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s become clear that this important resource requires more time and effort than I initially budgeted. In its current form the podcast simply isn\u0027t sustainable\u2013 but together we can change that!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile my favorite part of the podcast is sharing awesome knowledge and conversation with cutting edge birth researchers, there\u0027s A LOT more that goes into producing a podcast. Between connecting with guests, arranging interviews, researching the topic, preparing questions, recording the show, editing it all together, gathering resources and links, writing show notes, uploading the episode, creating graphics, posting on the website, and blasting it all on social media, I don\u0027t really have the resources to reach out and convince advertisers that this is support-worthy endeavor.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I know I don\u0027t have to convince you! YOU know the shows are invaluable! They save you time and money, and they are convenient. You don\u2019t have to read through tons of books or sign up for a class that may not work with your schedule. Nope, here you get to listen whenever and wherever you want, even while multitasking, with the assurance that you are getting fantastic information you can trust. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the last 4 weeks the show has gotten over \u003cdel\u003e8800\u003c/del\u003e \u003cdel\u003e16,200\u003c/del\u003e \u003cdel\u003e20,100\u003c/del\u003e 27,000 downloads, and it keeps growing week after week, as more people find out about it, and start gobbling up past episodes. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with the phrase \u201cif every one of you gave one dollar\u2026\u201d and it\u2019s so true!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(Just to give you an idea, I approximate that each show costs between $300 - $350 to produce.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eSo why through Patreon? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecause it will keep us closer:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon has a members feed. Yup. That is a way that you can connect with me and the Birthful community, in a smaller space and more significantly than say in Facebook or Twitter. You can give me specific feedback on what you want me to do next on the podcast, or outside of it. I can poll you for feedback. I will give you first access to any free printables or videos that I create. You can post your musings and recommend resources. Knowing you\u0027re a vested partner in the mission of The Birthful Podcast will strengthen the communication between us. And I want that!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecause we shouldn\u2019t need a middle man: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nConvincing advertisers that they should place ads on the podcast is a time-consuming challenge. Aside from say, the fabulous people of MailChimp, SquareSpace, Audible, and NatureBox, who\u2019ve created a system to work with podcasters, most companies don\u2019t have the time or the inclination to figure it out. Plus I *LOVE* connecting with you. How awesome to say that \u201cthis episode is brought to you by (insert your name here)\u201d instead of a company\u2019s name. As a listener, the first one makes me feel warm inside, the second makes me feel like I have to buy something. I\u2019d rather you feel warm inside.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecause you\u2019ll keep me accountable: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAside from growing the show, I\u2019ve been dreaming of doing webinars and online classes for years. But something is always more urgent, and easier to do. And so days become weeks, become months, and so on. I need that to change. YOU need that to change\u2026 after all, pregnancy has an end date and babies grow fast!!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecause you can support me at the level that is right for you:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon allows creators to set tiered reward levels, so that patrons can pledge what works within their budget. To be sure, ANY and ALL pledges make a difference, but by having tiered options, Patreon allows me to give you additional rewards depending on your pledge level.
