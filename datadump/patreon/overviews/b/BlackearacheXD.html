    "summary": "Hello there, I\u0027m Marvin aka BlackearacheXD. I\u0027m a musician on YouTube that favours playing guitar and covers video game music in alternative styles, mainly progressive rock and math rock.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GbmfhbIDXs\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Journey Creating Covers So Far\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo i\u0027ve been doing this VGM malarky for nearly 5 years now! The path that led to where I am at the moment has been filled with fun times disfiguring the skeletal structure of some of my favourite pieces of classic and/or sometimes obscure video games from my youth. And this is a hobby that has came to a burning point where i want to pursue a career in music somehow while still upholding a standard in quality with this niche hobby of mine. As much as I adore doing this for free, i\u0027m getting to a point in my life where I have to get real about what i want to do. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve decided to come here on Patreon to help those who know my work see improvement and progress in both quality and rendition by supporting me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon lets you donate the amount you want. So if you want to give me $1 per video then you can! Any set donations is highly appreciated! This ain\u0027t a monthly thing by the way, it\u0027s whenever i put out a cover or an original. No charges for tutorials/lessons or vlogs! If you don\u0027t want to donate, that\u0027s totally fine! \u003cstrong\u003eMy work will be free regardless you donate or not!\u003c/strong\u003e As long as you\u0027re watching me turn your favourite video game songs into something different and enjoying it, that\u0027s good enough for me! No mandatory rules here, just a humble tip jar open to whoever feels like supporting! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4b5ipLgIP-U\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to build this channel, whether I get donations or not!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRegardless if you can make donations or not, I\u0027ll still be adding content to my channel not matter how slow the output is. Music is more than a passion to me, it\u0027s a way of life. Especially after discovering YouTube where i have a platform to put out music with only a few people watching, at least i\u0027m able to go through the cathartic process of being creative and putting it out there for the world to see! if you want to see me progress as much as the tasty progresive rock music I jam everyday, your support will not go to waste!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2rsJcUuxAU\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e.\u0027x\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e"
