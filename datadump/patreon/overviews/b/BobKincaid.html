    "summary": "The HORN is live, progressive, non-commercial, advertising-free \u003cem\u003econversation\u003c/em\u003e radio. No \"Buy Gold Now\" ads. No pitches for dodgy Russian websites. No hustles for wood floors or radios or vaccuum cleaners that pick up bowling balls. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve built a community around The H.O.R.N. and it is that community that makes everything so special. The HORN Family/Community/Congregation interacts, laughs, cries, carries on \u003cem\u003etogether\u003c/em\u003e. Most of all, we talk together. You\u0027ll not find this format in commercial broadcasting. Calls are actual \u003cem\u003econversations\u003c/em\u003e, not \"That\u0027s enough about you, let\u0027s talk about me\" three minute exchanges followed by a seven minute break. Many people say this is unlike anything they\u0027ve ever shared their time listening to, whether live or in delay. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis campaign is an effort to build a base of 400 subscribers at $10 per month (\"The Fabulous/Fantastic/Fortitudinous/Far-out {pick one} 400\"). That works out to somewhere around 16 cents per hour of programming for each subscriber. It\u0027s a strictly voluntary effort. It\u0027s also not limited to ten bucks. George Soros is free to throw in as much as he can bear to part with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery new $10 subscriber will get a HORN bumper sticker. Subscribers at $20 get a HORN bumper sticker, -but wait, there\u0027s more- AND a \"They.Want.It.All\" bumper sticker, featuring a hog in a top-hat, both of which are exclusive to HORN subscribers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you aren\u0027t already a member of the HORN F/C/C, give it a try. Like many over the years, you may find yourself tuning in night after night. You may find yourself actually \u003cem\u003ecaring\u003c/em\u003e about the people you hear and hear from. You may find out that broadcasting can be something more than a way to direct consumers to products with some content thrown in between the breaks.\u003cbr\u003e"
