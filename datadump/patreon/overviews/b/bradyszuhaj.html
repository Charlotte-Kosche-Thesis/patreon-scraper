    "summary": "Hi friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always loved making stupid youtube videos. Sitting down and talking to a camera with the hopes to make someone laugh or simply improve their day is one of the best things I\u2019ve ever discovered possible on the internet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMLIC was an awesome way for me to express myself creatively. It taught me how to not be awkward as hell and put on a bit of an acting cap, video editing experience, project marketing and management and a slew of other things that will probably never help me in a professional setting. I got really good at making dinosaur noises and saying \u201cfuck\u201d repeatedly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ended MLIC thinking that I had grown out of that phase of my life- I was a little frustrated by the people getting the majority of attention on youtube for making pretty lack-luster content and thought that hanging in the towel would somehow do something about that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTurns out I haven\u2019t grown out of that phase. I miss being stupid, I miss connecting with people on the internet; I miss MLIC.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProblem is making dumb youtube videos pays basically nothing. After moving to Los Angeles and forming Best Kept Secret, all my time has been devoted to working on the band and rolling burritos at Chipotle (it\u2019s not as bad as you think. like.. really not that bad) to pay the bills. It leaves very little time to make videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, I still want to commit to making at least 1 video a week. Using Patreon, however, I may be able to start focusing on making videos and working on the band my full time job. The more monthly Patreon support I can get, the more content I can start pushing out each week. Hell, I\u2019d love to be able to put a video out every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can, your support would be wonderfully appreciated. I like to think of this as some kind of new chapter or next step. Let\u2019s see where it goes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003eBrady"
