I have built my channel on a foundation of a family friendly atmosphere and the idea to have fun. I honestly thought that nobody would watch my videos, but here we are 2 years later with millions of views and tens of thousands of subscribers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227,108,9);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy hobby has turned into something I wasn\u0027t expecting or prepared for. I am requesting help to maintain the consistency and improve the quality of my videos. The PC I built after saving my pennies for 2 years is starting to show signs of inadequacy from new games as they become increasingly more demanding. I\u0027d also like to expand my channel into doing a few vlog styled videos every month, but I\u0027d need help to purchase a new microphone and camera equipment. Patreon gives an easy way for you guys to set up a contribution each month to help support me in and the future of this channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247,150,70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227,108,9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003eIt\u0027s really humbling for me to type these words asking for donations, so I\u0027m glad\u00a0Patreon gives me the ability to set up reward tiers for your donations. I want this to be something of value to you, so I\u0027ve come up with some ideas that should make this fun for both of us. You can check them out below.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals and Milestones?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon has a very nice system set in place to track milestones for our community. I have built some short and long range goals into these milestones so we can see how we are doing. These goals aren\u0027t 100% set in stone.
