    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my Patreon page. I am here to make art and I\u0027m hoping you can help me do that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, a little bit about me. I grew up in a suburb of Los Angeles and found a passion in theater. After I graduated high school, I moved to New York City to pursue a career in theater acting and at the end of 8 years in NY, I moved back to California to pursue Voice Overs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy catalog of art spans from charcoal pencil to watercolor to oil to acrylic to textile painting to lace making to embroidery to writing music to singing to voices... the list could go on and on. I continue to learn and grow and expand my interests, because all of it is fascinating.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, what I\u0027m hoping to accomplish from having this Patreon page is to start growing my resources and do as much of my creation myself as I can afford to (time and monetarily). Once the resources are in place, I can start experimenting more with the tools I have, which means more goodies for y\u0027all!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd finally, for now I\u0027m going to keep this as a per project funding because I\u0027m not sure how much time I\u0027ll have to fulfill any rewards that people chose. If this works out really well and I can fund the resources I need for each project, I\u0027ll try going to a monthly subscription to see what fun I can have from there!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEssentially, I\u0027m putting aside my pride and asking for your help to keep this little artist growing and learning and giving back to the world the only way I know how: through my art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am very much looking forward to getting to collaborate with all of you and hopefully giving you a little insight into the colorful little world in my head.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and I wish you all the best on your journeys, whether they lead you here or to the far reaches of the world. May you find joy in the little things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
