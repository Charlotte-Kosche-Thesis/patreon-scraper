The game sets you in the role of a cursed young man who has inherited a food truck business, Sticky Stu\u0027s Burger Bus, from his deceased uncle. Sales are great thanks to the uncle\u0027s keen business skills, but also thanks to his special sauce recipe; mayo, ketchup, and a fresh load of magical semen that can induce immediate orgasms upon consumption. You had to have seen that coming (pun intended).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnsurprisingly the tainted sauce really helped drive customer retention or whatever, but it\u0027s not all roses. It\u0027s more like daisies ... being pushed up, because Uncle Stu died from an evil curse that has decimated the player\u0027s family for generations. With his uncle\u0027s untimely death, the player is now the last of his name. The eventual goal is to learn enough about the curse to break it, or just settle on impregnating as many women as possible to carry on the family legacy before the curse takes the player\u0027s life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/oJHcOCF.png\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFeatures:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eBusiness/Life simulated in an open world with time, weather, varying customers by time of day, day of week, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eCYOA style story events to move the game forward.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eMod friendly via text files.

I put a lot of effort into making things that are good, but progress is slow using my free time alone. Since 2013 I\u0027ve been gradually building and rebuilding the tech behind FUBS, going through several major revisions by making many game prototypes. Only now do I feel confident that the tech is good enough to support an ambitious project like Fucked Up Burger Shack.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMore than the tech being ready, I really love this game concept. I enjoy working on it, and I\u0027m super excited about the stories I want to tell about the player character\u0027s curse/ability. I\u0027d love to spend more than just my free time building FUBS, and that\u0027s possible with Patreon support. I\u0027m really enthusiastic about making this game and I hope that people see the potential in it that I see. Without support I\u0027ll continue toiling away on FUBS at a slow pace from my little \u003ca href=\"https://bunkville.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecorner of the internet\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/geUtJi0.png\"\u003e"
