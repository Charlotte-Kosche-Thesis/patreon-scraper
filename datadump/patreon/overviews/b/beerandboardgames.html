Join the fun, won\u0027t you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAaron Yonda and Matt Sloan have been making online video since 2006 and have over 900 videos on Youtube and combined over 120 million views. They are most well known for their Star Wars parody series \"Chad Vader - Day Shift Manager,\" which was chosen as George Lucas\u0027 favorite fan film of 2007. They also make Beer and Board Games together, and Aaron makes gaming videos on the GameSociety Pimps channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2010 Aaron Yonda and his brother Andrew were drinking beer and playing a game when they suddenly realized that it would be even more fun if they filmed it. Hundreds of episodes later the show continues to come out every Thursday, mostly because of regular fan involvement and support. Simply put: views alone are not enough to make a show self-sustainable. This is where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy subscribing to this project you make it possible for us to continue the series and also get the chance to get involved, keep the beer flowing, and even socialize with other fans if you want.\u003cbr\u003e"
