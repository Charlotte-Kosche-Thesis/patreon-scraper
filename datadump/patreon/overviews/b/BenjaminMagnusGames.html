    "summary": "Thank you for stopping by, now that I have you here, lets talk about YouTube, Twitch, and Patreon. YouTube is dying. It\u0027s the sick old man of the internet. Ad buyers pull out, ad revenue goes down, content creators insert more ads into their videos, so viewers install ad blockers. And the cycle of a dying platform continues unabated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI for one refuse to bog down my videos with obscene amounts of ads. For instance, a channel I enjoy, runs ads at the start, the stop, and every 3 minutes in their videos. A 9 minute video will host 5 ads. That is enough to drive a person mad trying to watch that with constant interruptions, and it made me stop watching the channel and unsub, rather than resort to ad-blockers. It means for me that profits from YouTube are down 50% over the past 18 months. A one dollar/month donation on Patreon is worth many hundreds of ad views.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat brings us to Twitch! I love being a streamer. My wife and I stream 6 days a week, and cover a wide range of time zones and games so people from all over the world can tune in live and enjoy. The only down side to Twitch, is that the site takes 50% of the profits from a subscriber, where as here on Patreon the Content Creators take home is closer to 95% of the donation. So your money goes far farther on Patreon than from any other source.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who like cold hard facts, here are some numbers to consider. I stream Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, for a total of 20-24 hours of fresh new content weekly. For those that can not make the streams lives, they are all edited into easily digestible 30 minutes videos and uploaded to YouTube for your viewing pleasure. Add on top of that traditional YouTube Lets Plays, CoOp streams with my wife, Community Games, and a mature and active community. You already pay 8 dollars a month for Netflix, 1 dollar for all that entertainment is a steal!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you once more for taking the time to help support an original content creator. Without you, none of us would be working the jobs we love.\u003cbr\u003e"
