This podcast is also known as the\u003cem\u003eUrban Shooter Podcast\u003c/em\u003e, hosted by Kenn Blanchard.  I started my gun rights activism in 1991. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2007, I have been providing a mix of entertainment, information and commentary in support of the gun rights community with this podcast.  Our podcast is family friendly, positive, and informative.  It\u2019s more than just gun reviews and politics on this show.  I am here to encourage you, share history, life lessons, news, training and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether we have created an online community for the \u201ccool people\u201d in the gun community.  You get it.

We have our own app. \u003ca href=\"http://blackmanwithagun.org/\"\u003eBlackmanwithagun.org\u003c/a\u003e (IOS) look for the android version on Google Play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Your sponsorship here helps me continue. Your support motivates me in the lean times and quiet times.
