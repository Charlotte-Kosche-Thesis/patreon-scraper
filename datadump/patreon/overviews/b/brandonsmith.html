    "summary": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m Brandon Smith, and I\u0027m an independent investigative reporter. I sued the City of Chicago and won, forcing them to release the video of Laquan McDonald being killed. Since the Laquan story, I\u2019ve won scads of journalism\u2019s biggest honors for columns about it in outlets across the web.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might think this page is about a donation. In fact, it\u0027s about a new kind of product. If you\u0027re into the idea of investigative reporting and holding powerful people to account, read further, or just read the \"rewards\" sidebar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want you to be a part of my stories from the inside out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith my accountability work, I\u0027m just getting started. Since 2015\u0027s push for the Laquan tape, concerned citizens from all over have brought me evidence of some serious fishy stuff. I\u2019m working hard, every day, to verify all this and surround it with context for publication. My primary objectives are to hold accountable those who have power\u2014the power to change things or ignore them, for instance\u2014and to advocate for leveling the playing field for everyone. In three words, transparency, accountability, and justice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I need your help. And there are some KILLER opportunities to get nerdy about investigative journalism awaiting those who chip in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do I need your help? Despite writing about Chicago for two solid years, landing in half a dozen well-respected outlets, from the Chicago Reader to The Guardian; from Al Jazeera to In These Times magazine, my average hourly wage in journalism remains less than this city\u0027s minimum wage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo to be able to keep doing the craft of journalism, I need contributions from people who love the results. Maybe you want to know more about the process. By supporting me, you\u0027ll get that, too. The sidebar labeled \"rewards\" describes all the different ways you can be involved in the process of my work. Or at least get to follow it, as if it\u0027s it\u0027s own story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe even more than money, I\u0027m using this as a way to get to know people who\u0027re gung-ho for this kind of work. If you\u0027ve read this far, I want to get to know *you*.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of freelance journalists like me as independent operators. We \ndon\u2019t rely on massive news organizations\u2019 selection bias to determine \nthe stories we work on. Independents produce a crucial chunk of our \ncollective knowledge about our world. Without us lone rangers, so many \nstories wouldn\u2019t get told. Laquan McDonald\u2019s story wouldn\u2019t have gotten \ntold as it did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI get volunteer help from non-journalist friends who think critically about the world. When I can\u0027t spare the time, they read and make notes about big batches of boring documents. (If you\u0027d like to help in this way, hit me up at hey@brandonsmith.com and we can meet for coffee.) But this doesn\u2019t cut it. I\u2019m still working from dawn to dusk: a few hours at various part-time jobs, and the rest of the time reporting stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows people who believe in my work to chip in monthly, at whatever amount you\u2019d like. The system automatically charges you each month, so once you sign up, you don\u0027t have to think about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the clincher: I don\u0027t care how little you give, but I want you to give forever. I want this to be a life-long relationship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor that to happen, I don\u2019t want you to contribute any more per month than would ever make you re-evaluate it due to the cost. Whatever amount would make you reconsider it later, sign up for less than that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, this isn\u0027t a donation but rather, a new kind of product. I\u0027m providing a service to folks who want to know more about what we muckrakers do. In the \"rewards\" sidebar you\u0027ll see that, if you choose to support me with any amount, you and I will connect in various ways going forward, and we\u0027ll each learn a bit about each other, and this process of digging up the truth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust a small disclaimer: if I were to land a full-time journalism job or a full-support fellowship, I would let you know, and I\u0027d temporarily suspend the Patreon. No need to double-dip with your hard-earned cash. But when the fellowship ends, or if I have to quit my job (maybe editors are being heinous about what I\u2019m allowed to cover!)... only then will I write to let you know I\u0027m re-starting the Patreon, and ask if you want to step up to the plate once again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I had a safety net like that, I\u0027d never have to bend to the will of big media executives, even if I worked for them. I\u0027d know you\u0027d have my back if I had to leave.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first goal is to get 250 supporters at a small average amount.\n My next goal is to cover all my expenses, which are small for Chicago at roughly \n$1600 per month. With an outpouring of support like that, I could put my full effort \ninto accountability reporting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you for everything you do, for me and for the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHope to talk soon,\u003cbr\u003eBrandon"
