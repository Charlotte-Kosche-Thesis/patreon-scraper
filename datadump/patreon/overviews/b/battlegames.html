I self-published the bi-monthly \u003cem\u003eBattlegames\u003c/em\u003e magazine from 2006-2011, which\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://payhip.com/gladiuspublications\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyou can still buy in PDF format from my Gladius Payhip site\u003c/a\u003e and, if you\u0027re lucky, in paper format from a few retailers who still have copies, or eBay (though they are rare).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://henrys-wargaming.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MWBG-372-cover-1024.jpg\" style=\"width: 83px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eFrom 2011-2016 I became editor of the merged \u003cem\u003eMiniature Wargames with Battlegames\u003c/em\u003e before I left to pursue my own projects. My first book,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://amzn.to/leWoNO\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Wargaming Compendium\u003c/a\u003e, was published by Pen \u0026amp; Sword in 2013 and I am currently working on its follow-up title, \u003cem\u003eWargaming Campaigns\u003c/em\u003e. I have dedicated a great deal of time and effort to supporting the miniatures wargaming community over more than a decade now, and was instrumental in helping to create the Don Featherstone Commemorative Weekend which takes place every spring at the Wargames Holiday Centre near Basingstoke in the UK.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://amzn.to/leWoNO\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://henrys-wargaming.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/TWC-frontcover-1024.jpg\" style=\"float: left; width: 91px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThe Wargaming Compendium\u003c/em\u003e became, to my surprise, a best-seller (let\u0027s not get carried away, I\u0027m no JK Rowling \u2013 miniatures gaming is an extremely niche niche!) and continues to sell steadily in hardback, paperback and ebook formats. I\u0027m incredibly grateful for this, and also for the interest shown in the \u003cem\u003eShot, Steel \u0026amp; Stone\u003c/em\u003e horse and musket era wargames rules it contains. These rules have been used at the giant imagi-nation games played at Ayton which featured in my magazines and on various blogs and their development and expansion continues. There is a Facebook page and group for the rules, and they will feature from time to time in my Patreon posts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://henrys-wargaming.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-CS_Logo_Flat_Main_RGB.jpg\" style=\"width: 171px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eMany wargamers also know me for my support of the Combat Stress charity which cares for veterans of the British armed services suffering from PTSD and other mental illnesses resulting from their service.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/battlegames\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Battlegames Combat Stress Appeal\u003c/a\u003e has been running for several years now, is still active and has, at the time of writing, raised over \u00a325,000 for this important cause. I intend to continue supporting and raising money for the charity indefinitely, so you are likely to see the Appeal featuring in my Patreon content from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://henrys-wargaming.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Dahlia-Chindrastan-regionsnamed-1024tall.jpg\" style=\"width: 127px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eI combine the skills of writer, designer and editor and, nowadays, videographer and podcaster too. I featured alongside Neil Shuck of \u003cem\u003eMeeples \u0026amp; Miniatures\u003c/em\u003e fame in our occasional\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.viewfromtheveranda.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eView from the Veranda\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e podcasts, and I show up from time to time on Jay Arnold\u0027s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-989538417\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Veteran Wargamer\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eshow and Jonathan Reinhardt\u0027s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://wargamingforums.com/podcast-2/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWargaming Recon\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m also known for my skills as a cartographer, both of simple wargame battlefields and highly detailed maps of fantasy and imagi-nation worlds. I intend to put all these skills to good use to provide high-quality and professional content for my Patreon subscribers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the most important thing about Patreon as a model is that, rather like the patrons of the arts of previous centuries, it creates a direct link between you, the consumer, and me, the creator. More than just a financial transaction, it creates a bond, a deeper level of interaction than is possible if you were just buying a magazine off a shelf or a picture off a wall. Your input, suggestions, feedback and requests will be crucial in creating my output, to build a body of work that is satisfying to both of us. Already, in the comments below the blog post where I floated the idea, potential patrons are helping to shape my ideas about what to create, how often and even at what size, such as the length of podcasts and so on. If you have a great idea, let me know and I\u0027ll do my best to make it so!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://henrys-wargaming.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/old-school-books.jpg\" style=\"width: 285px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eBut I suppose the biggest question you might have is: why am I doing this? I\u0027ve been a wargamer ever since I was a young boy. My father gave me my first toy fort and soldiers in the late 1960s, and when he died in 1971, I discovered \u0027proper\u0027 wargames books written by the likes of Charles Grant and Don Featherstone in the local libraries. Since then, this hobby has been in my blood and I\u0027ve been involved and highly visible in the industry, helping to promote this wonderful pastime, since 2005.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the last few years have been a struggle, and like many people, I\u0027m having to be ruthless about what I focus on in order to produce a meaningful income. I\u0027m 56 as I write this, and as a self-employed person I have little to look forward to in the form of pensions or other investments \u2013 my business life has been adventurous, yes, exciting, sure, but not very profitable so far. Restarting \u003cem\u003eBattlegames\u003c/em\u003e as a print magazine simply isn\u0027t possible \u2013 been there, done that, still have the scars to prove it! So I\u0027m being forced to make a choice about whether to step out of the hobby spotlight and pursue other career avenues entirely, or see if I can really make a go of providing meaningful and creatively satisfying content to a wide and varied audience via the internet and the multimedia communication channels that it offers. And this, dear friends, is where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://henrys-wargaming.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/henrys-wargaming-selfie.jpg\" style=\"width: 164px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eIn return for your investment in my passion to create wonderful content for the hobby, you can be assured that my productive focus will have you and your fellow Patreon investors front and centre as I put pen to paper, stylus to tablet or fingers to keypad. If you don\u0027t like what I do, you can change your pledge amount or cancel your subscription at any time, so it\u0027s to our mutual benefit that I continue to produce work that you like and find entertaining. Unlike a traditional business model, it\u0027s much more like a partnership in an exclusive venture, and I want you to accompany me on the journey for the long haul, not the short hop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to read this.
