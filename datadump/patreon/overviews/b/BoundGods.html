    "summary": "This page is a companion to the Bound Gods series found on Amazon:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bound-Gods-7-Book-Series/dp/B07CHNHXHZ\"\u003ehttps://www.amazon.com/Bound-Gods-7-Book-Series/dp...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis series is free to read for KU subscribers. If you\u0027re not on KU join for at least the free thirty days to read the series so you can enjoy this site. \u003cbr\u003eThe Bound Gods universe is based on the concept of people who have survived or accomplished feats that are almost inhuman in nature. These individuals are called gods. Gods are human, born mortal to mortal mothers. Upon consuming their first ambrosia bloom they gain immortality. The problem with ambrosia is once a god takes it, they can never stop. And the flowers are very slow to grow. To keep from losing their minds and raging war gods use Doxies to create stronger ambrosia. Doxies are young men able to take the flower once or twice in their life and produce it from then on. The nectar is strongest in a Doxie\u0027s blood but blood-letting was made illegal because once a god starts blood-letting, they can\u0027t stop. Instead, the ambrosia is taken through other body fluids. The second strongest source; cum.\u003cbr\u003eThe older the Doxie, the more potent the nectar they produce. But in order for a Doxie to learn how to produce nectar or not produce it, they must be trained. Pain and fear cause a surge of ambrosia to be released by their adrenal glans. Because the ambrosia is manufactured inside a Doxie\u0027s body, they too are addicts. And since pain and fear cause massive amounts of ambrosia to be produced, they take great pleasure in receiving the crop, whip, cane as much as they enjoy sounds, plugs, cages, and nipple clamps. The nature of a Doxie makes them gentle, lustful, open, and free with their emotions.  \u003cbr\u003eBeing human, gods are flawed, many cruel, all selfish on some level. Far too many of them don\u0027t appreciate what Doxie\u0027s give them. Those that do? Well, they will move mountains to keep them protected. \u003cbr\u003eBecause of the power some gods have, their abilities skating the edge of supernatural (others diving right off the cliff), they must be monitored. That job falls on the shoulders of goddesses. Women who also live through the impossible and often have abilities. Unlike the gods, their gifts tend to be benign and focus on knowledge, tolerance, and diplomacy. These women quietly run the world leaving politicians, corporations, and banks to believe they are in control. \u003cbr\u003eGoddesses receive no benefits from ambrosia, so they are immune to the flower\u0027s addictive nature. While they may not have the potential to live forever, they do hold the reins on all gods. Not because they are physically more powerful, but because they are the mothers of Doxies. No god who values his life would raise a hand to a goddess. \u003cbr\u003eAll these aspects of the Bound God universe remained hidden from world (except for a select few wealthy people, families who pledge sons to the gods, and political leaders given access to ambrosia) until the Economic Collapse puts society in a vulnerable state and the approach of a massive multi-verse phenomenon will change the course of the world completely and force the gods into the public. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Bound Gods series is a dark urban fantasy with a lot of kink, sex, questionable sex, naughty, dirty...well you get the idea. Yes there is a story. I\u0027d like to think it\u0027s a pretty good one, but sex is the nature of a Doxie and of gods. The Doxie Diaries located here will be light hearted, fun, humorous (I hope), and give a different perspective to the life of a Doxie. Later on I plan on adding the hard core graphic novel of the Bound Gods universe.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast but not lease (by any stretch of the imagination) I want to thank all the awesome readers out there who have made the series possible.\u003cbr\u003eThose who may be new to this universe, please read the following warning label with care:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis product contains nuts, glittery harem pants, butt plugs, cock cages, cocks\n(of all sizes and shapes), jewelry, jewelry with bells,\njewelry with bells being worn by boys, boys with boys and with more boys who are with boys, all those boys with gods, blow jobs, hand jobs, lots of lubricant\n(okay there might be a tad less than you\u2019d want but, hey), bad attitudes,\nhappiness, sadness, laughter, tears, moans, groans, loud screams, soft screams,\na one way trip to the Bound Gods universe that will include weirdness such as, but not\nlimited to, kink, sweet kink, wtf kink, impossible kink, sexy gods (really sexy gods) scary gods, arrogant gods, gods with parasitic twins, gods who don\u2019t look human...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd finally, Other\nThan Humans and Doxies.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf ANY PART of\nmythology from anywhere in the world offends you, LEAVE now.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNot responsible for\nallergic reactions. \u003cbr\u003eIf your symptoms\npersist more than three days, please\ncontact your therapist. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUse only as directed.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBatteries not\nincluded.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGetting mad and throwing\nyour computer is not advised.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor your safety, use\neye protection.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nContents not approved\nby the Food and Drug Administration\u003cbr\u003e\n\nand should not be\nused to treat existing medical conditions or as a suppository.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEnjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut responsibly of\ncourse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Adrienne Wilder and I am a full time writer.
