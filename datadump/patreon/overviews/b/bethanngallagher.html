    "summary": "I\u0027ve been getting ambitious about\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.spellboundbymovies.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSpellbound by Movies\u003c/a\u003e. There\u0027s so much I want to do with my blog, I want to invest more time in it to promote classic and silent films. While I say\u00a0Spellbound is sometimes irregularly, but always lovingly updated, I\u0027d like to get on a regular schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have expansion ideas. There are more post types I\u0027m itching to get to like more interviews, lists, or my usual obsessive reviews. The last can take my eight hours or more. I watch every film more than once if I can, and I fact check every line I can, including describing action in the movie.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut my expansion ideas go beyond what\u0027s on a page. Eventually I\u0027d like my interviews not just to be conducted via email, but also done over Skype or in person. I want to record those conversations and take their recordings and turn them in a companion podcast called SIT A SPELL.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven without adding on the cost of podcasting, there are costs associated with my blog. There are the annual hosting, URL, and Wordpress redirect fees. While I\u0027m comped some festival passes and books, I pay to attend other screenings and festivals, and I buy books to review and to build my film reference collection. Some of the festivals I attend require travel and/or hotels. All of these costs add up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what pushed me over the edge into creating a Patreon account. In the last six months or so, I\u0027ve been hit with two major and unexpected expenses--a large vet bill for a beloved and now passed away cat and losing my apartment to my landlords, who resumed personal occupancy. Having to incur moving costs and suddenly paying current San Francisco Bay area market rent was a double whammy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want either to detract from my blogging or from me being able to travel to film festivals and bring you coverage. Between\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.spellboundbymovies.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e, my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/missbethg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter account\u003c/a\u003e, and my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/msb3thg/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e, I try to share generously my movie experiences and love. There are two film festivals I\u0027d like to attend in April. Schedule-wise I\u0027d have to choose one or the other. Because of recent expenses, I think I should choose neither.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI blog because I love the process, love sharing my point of view, love lifting some of the movies out of obscurity, and love the community writing connects me to. I blog without pay, but isn\u0027t it better to pay writers than not? Is it egocentric to consider if someone else values my work, then maybe they\u0027d like to be a Patron to help it to continue? I\u0027ve gotten some very nice unpaid opportunities, which I\u0027m extremely grateful for. Maybe some day my blog will lead to a paying gig.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever happens my blog will continue to freely accessible to all, but for the few who become Patrons, you have my sincerest thanks and gratitude. I am the sort who will pay it forward when she can. My most immediate way will be writing more regularly.\u003cbr\u003e"
