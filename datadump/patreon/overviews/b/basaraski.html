    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eVideos will be released one day early on here to my Patrons.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started making videos early 2013, and have never had the idea of not continuing to make them. I live, breath, and sleep Football, especially the Green Bay Packers. I do my YouTube channel as a hobby, and I\u0027m really starting to like video production, and think I have a talent in it. I\u0027ve spent countless hours on all my video, making them perfect for all Packers fans to watch. If I don\u0027t like them, or I don\u0027t get chills on a pump up, I\u0027m doing it wrong.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently standing as the highest subscribed Packers Highlight channel on YouTube, and I\u0027m very proud of my work. I strive to bring the best Highlight videos I can create, and share them with the entirety of the Packers fan base, and anyone who enjoys them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently dont make a penny on my views. All that ad revenue goes to the NFL and the song creators of the songs i use. I do these videos for fun, In hope someday It will be my future. I currently am running on a PC I built in 2013. So it is quite outdated, and I dont have the money to upgrade it sadly. Every donation left to me, will go towards furthering my career in video making, and will be greatly appreciated. Every dollar helps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve really enjoyed making these highlights over my time, and I really would like to turn this into a career. I just turned 21 in March, and didn\u0027t have that much of a path prior to my video making. This is finally something I really enjoy, and it is one of my goals, it ENJOY what I do for work. Like stated above, this would help me put out more content, and further my chance landing something. Something where this CAN be my job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease don\u0027t feel obligated to donate, as I\u0027m just giving you an option, and a real background of where I\u0027d like my video making to end up. Even if you don\u0027t and/or can\u0027t donate, your support is just as good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Alex"
