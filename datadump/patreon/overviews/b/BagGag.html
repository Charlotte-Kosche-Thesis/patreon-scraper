We\u0027ve also been driving for a while and have great respect for law and order.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 We saw \nthe need to address the unjustified reckless behaviors certain people \nget away with in our society. We are fact-driven and couldn\u0027t really \ncare less about the aggressor\u0027s motives if in the end one is endangering \nthe lives of those around due to impatience, laziness and \nignorance on the road. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 All reports and research point to the same traits of a bad driver. Since most people will not go look for this information we hope to bring it to as many households as possible. We\u0027d like to do this in an entertaining manner using similar legacy graphics as the ones in the DMV driver\u0027s manual with our own twist added. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 It would be great if the videos were able to influence bad drivers over time and we realize that just being able to plant the seed in a bad driver\u0027s head will be a huge victory as this person will now be more self-aware on the road even if the bad habits persist. Once ignorance of the law stops being an excuse, we\u0027re only left with a handful of Douchey Drivers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\nAs of now, this project is being worked on during our free time in addition to our day jobs but this could become a \nfull-time gig if enough people agree with our premise and flock to our \nvideos. We can\u0027t do this on our own. We understand the power behind the Patreon community. We hope to not only voice our opinions, but to also allow our top Patrons to share their experiences and get them illustrated and animated\n for their own empowerment and enjoyment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 As our logo indicates, we don\u0027t pretend to take ourselves too \nseriously. The idea of having fun at the expense of a bad driver just \nsounds like too much fun. If we start seeing a decrease in road douchiness and collisions it will be because of you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
