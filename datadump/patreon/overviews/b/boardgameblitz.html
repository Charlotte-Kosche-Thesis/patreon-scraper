    "summary": "A conversation on Reddit in 2015 inspired three women who were total strangers to join forces and start a podcast. From that conversation between Ambie, Cassadi, and Crystal, \u003ca href=\"http://www.boardgameblitz.com/\"\u003eBoard Game Blitz\u003c/a\u003e was born: the first all-female board game podcast to regularly and consistently release content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe know that women are underrepresented in the board game industry and wanted to add our voices, talents, and opinions to the mix to help elevate and equalize gender representation in board game media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first episode was released on May 26, 2016 after months of planning, prepping, and getting to know each other\u2014and we\u2019ve released a new episode every two weeks since that date (the only exception being the one episode break we took during the holidays to be with our families).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery episode of the podcast is 30 minutes or less. We know that time is a commodity, so we strive to create content that you can easily digest on your daily commute, during your workout, or when you\u2019re relaxing at home after a long day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe three of us have different types of games we love and gravitate toward; this leads to a diverse mix of games discussed, varying opinions on the same game, and interesting discussions about game mechanics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also like to discuss accessories related to board gaming when it fits in with an episode\u0027s theme and every episode features the etymology of a word related to gaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the podcast, Ambie creates short how-to-play videos on our YouTube channel that have been praised as some of the best short-format instructional videos in the hobby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of all that, we also contribute video content to various shows and segments on \u003ca href=\"http://www.thedicetower.com/\"\u003eThe Dice Tower\u003c/a\u003e on a regular basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why become a patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile podcasting and making videos is a hobby that we love, it isn\u2019t free to do. We have to pay for web hosting, server space, equipment and more. And we spend a lot of time creating all of the content we put out. By supporting the show, you\u2019ll help us do a lot of awesome stuff like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay for our web hosting and servers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpgrade our equipment\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelp us get better prizes for future contests\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRecord a live show at a convention\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAttend more conventions!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur show will always be free to listen to and enjoy but we want to thank anyone who becomes a patron of our show with some exclusive rewards. Even a single dollar can make a world of difference. Those small pledges can really add up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to read this page, listen to our content, share it with others, and for just being you. We wouldn\u2019t be where we are without our amazing listeners so... sincerely, thank you from the bottom of our meeple-shaped hearts."
