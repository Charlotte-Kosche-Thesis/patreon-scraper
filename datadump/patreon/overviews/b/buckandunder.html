This is a place where you can directly support what we are doing. Our goal is to create content that inspires and teaches everyone to tell better stories and boost their creative skills.

Support our channel and you will get access to everything that we are up to : Behind the scenes of all our shoots, access to our new podcast \"Inspirographer\", our custom merch shop, Live hangouts, Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s, meet ups, and so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvery month we are planning to post 4 or more YouTube videos that either are designed to inspire you, or teach you valuable tips that will help boost your creative skills. Each time we do so, we share that YouTube video here and mark it as a piece of content that you\u0027re supporting. The number of YouTube videos we publish that month determines how much you contribute.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor Example, if you pledge $1 per YouTube Video creation and that month we publish 4 videos, you\u0027ll contribute a total of $4 for that month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*If you are concerned about going over budget, you can easily setup a monthly contribution limit when setting up your pledge payment info.
