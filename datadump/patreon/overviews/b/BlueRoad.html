    "summary": "They call me Patches O\u2019Nassis, I am the first person to live fulltime in a teardrop trailer pulled by a Harley Davidson motorcycle. I have been living simply on my 2007 Harley FLHT motorcycle (called Blue) pulling my teardrop trailer home (called TicTac) since October 2012. I travel with my dog, Yoska and my chicken, Esmeralda. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have dreamed of this life for many years never quite knowing how traveling, riding a motorcycle and living simply would ever work together. I live a life not many could maintain and I truly feel more at home in my little TicTac than I ever did in the modern conveniences of Babylon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am stopped for questions, pictures and greetings all day every day. Life is complicated yet simple as I have to navigate a life of very little privacy, trust of people who have fear of the unknown and sticking out, sometimes, like a sore thumb. I am different not only in the way I live, but also in who I choose to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI travel with the cutest, sweetest chiweenie named Yoska. He loves to meet new dog friends and human friends. He is a cuddler and very good travel companion. I also travel with a Silkie chicken named Esmeralda. She lays us tiny eggs which we eat and has the best personality to keep Yoska and myself entertained for hours. They both ride on Blue in their own travel crates. Yoska in a special motorcycle bag for dogs that attaches to the back seat and Esmeralda in a crate I strap to the tour pack. They both love to ride. Yoska gets very upset if the motorcycle is running and he isn\u2019t on it. Esmeralda likes to lay eggs while she rides and she loves perching on her water bowl so she gets a good breeze and view as we go down the road.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will your pledge support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBasic needs for Yoska, Esmeralda and myself.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSupport us going further into a self sustaining traveling crew.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRebuilding Blue into an electric, solar charged motorcycle\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpdates to TicTac for a more sustainable home\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFunding for:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBook about my life\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eChildren\u2019s book about Yoska and Esmeralda\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInteractive website about our travels, Yoska \u0026amp; Esmeralda and sustainability for young audiences\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWeekly professionally edited video series about our life, travels, sustainability\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat does your pledge do for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou get to follow our travels and adventures.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will learn how we are working towards a self sustaining, simple lifestyle.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMany stories you may not believe but are a normal everyday occurrence to us.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOpening the portal to ideas of other ways of living that might interest you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWatching the coolest dog and chicken grow and have their own little mini adventures in a life together.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy is this important to me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI believe as a woman, who lives life differently, it is important to share my life, goals and struggles to inspire other women to live their dreams.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe environment is important to me.
