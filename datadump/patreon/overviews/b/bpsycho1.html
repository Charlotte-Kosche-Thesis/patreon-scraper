Unfortunately, it is a moonshot to try to actually live off of such, and my day job pays peanuts, so I routinely struggle for money, which takes a toll on my mental health for obvious reason. With your help, I can maintain, and get at least gradually closer to a personal liberty of sorts, living for and off of what I am actually interested in.\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027ve been blogging in some form or another since 1998 (though my early works are gone because they were on Geocities) and have been creating music on my computer since 2000, beginning with the intention of producing beats for a rapper friend of mine to record over, and having sense branched out into dabbling in various electronic genres via instrumentals. My primary writing interest is politics, particularly things like analysis of economics, foreign policy, civil liberties, and the philosophical questions that may arise in relation, as well as the occasional Outrage of the Moment if it gets my attention enough. That said, I\u0027m open to writing about less heady things and have done so -- sports (I enjoy basketball, football \u0026amp; MMA), music, film (when I can afford to see a movie, that is...), food (I love BBQ, Mexican, Italian... generally anything large and/or fouling of the breath has my attention), the occasional beer review even.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do my writing at my personal blog \u003ca href=\"http://www.psychopolitik.com/\"\u003ePsychopolitik\u003c/a\u003e, as well as longer forms for publishing purposes for the \u003ca href=\"http://c4ss.org\"\u003eCenter for a Stateless Society\u003c/a\u003e.
