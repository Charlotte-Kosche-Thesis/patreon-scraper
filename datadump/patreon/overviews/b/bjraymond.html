    "summary": "Ever since I can remember, I\u0027ve been a creative. When I was just a kid, I wrote a Pick-A-Path book. I\u0027ve been singing for longer than I can remember. I wrote so many songs in high school. After I read about the Beastmaker game in Garth Nix\u0027s Seventh Tower, I tried to make my own version using cards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd today, I\u0027m still creating. But I want to be able to do that more. That\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have so many big projects I\u0027m trying to get happening. I\u0027ve written a script for a musical (with a friend\u0027s help); I\u0027ve made a board game; and I have four albums (FOUR) that I\u0027ve written that I want to get out there. I\u0027ve written a book for guys, talking about identity and God. And that\u0027s just the bigger ones! There are so many other little bits and pieces that I do as well, that I often don\u0027t have time for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can help to make these dreams a reality. Every dollar, every cent that you donate goes towards funding these projects. It\u0027s not going into my pocket, funding my video game addiction, putting fuel in my non-existent car, or buying me fast food. It\u0027s going straight into making these things possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd when you do that, I\u0027m going to make sure that you\u0027re also one of the first to see these projects come to fruition, and see them as they grow! Because I think that\u0027s part of the fun :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to have you come along on this crazy ride with me. I don\u0027t know what it\u0027s going to look like - but hey, where\u0027s the fun if you know how it\u0027s going to go? ;)"

I love being able to make things that can make other people laugh, smile, or think - or all three! Ideally, I\u0027d love this stuff to be my main focus, not my whatever-time-and-energy-and-money-is-left thing. Any help you could give towards that would be great :)",
