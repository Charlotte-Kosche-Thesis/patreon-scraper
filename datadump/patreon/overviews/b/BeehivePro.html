Unlike Kickstarter (where you donate, say, $25 once), Patreon helps supporters donate ongoing amounts at any level each time a new film is released.  You can set your level as low as $1 per film episode, and even set a monthly maximum so you\u2019re never charged more than what you want to contribute.  We plan to release two films per month, so think of it as your insider subscription to the best of independent roots music.  Yeah, its that cool.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe release our films to our Patrons first. \u00a0Its our ernest way of saying \"Thank you!\" \u00a0On a later date, we present them to the public ... but our Patrons always receive the premier first. \u00a0Every time we release a new episode or create a post,\u00a0Patrons receive notifications by email, or the super handy Patreon mobile app. \u00a0Want to see what we\u0027ve done so far? Click \"Creator Posts\" (floating just above our video on this page), enjoy the show, and help us make our next episode!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n(Still a bit muddled?  No problem!
