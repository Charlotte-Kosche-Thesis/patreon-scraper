    "summary": "My name is Brad Linder, and I\u0027m editor of mobile tech website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://liliputing.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLiliputing\u003c/a\u003e and host/producer of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://lpxshow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLPX podcast\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been writing about little computers at\u00a0Liliputing\u00a0since 2008. In that time I\u0027ve brought you news, tips, and reviews about netbooks, ultrabooks, chromebooks, tablets, smartphones, wearables, mini computers, Windows, Android, Linux, and a ton of hacker-friendly devices.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy I need your help\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile Liliputing is an ad-supported site and blogging is my full-time job, in 2016 I also launched the\u00a0LPX Podcast, featuring in-depth interviews with some of the people behind the tech. So far the LPX Show has featured discussions of modular laptops and smartphones, a version of Android designed to run on desktop and laptop computers, and the debate over whether (and how) the US cable and satellite TV industry should move beyond the traditional cable box.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have big plans for many more episodes of the LPX podcast, but it takes a lot of time to research, write, record, and edit each episode. That\u0027s where you come in: you can help turn the podcast from a labor of love into a labor of love with a small paycheck.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBut wait... there\u0027s more!\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOr if you\u0027re a regular visitor to Liliputing, but don\u0027t care much about the LPX podcast, that\u0027s cool too. Here\u0027s another reason you might want to consider making a small donation: Our audience is pretty geek-heavy, so I know that many of you use ad-blockers when visiting the site. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s fine with me... but the internet ad industry is undergoing a lot of changes. Ad rates aren\u0027t what they used to be, and with a growing number of people using ad blockers when they surf the web, it\u0027s not just the rates that are lower, it\u0027s also overall revenue.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSome websites try to compensate for this by devising new kinds of obnoxious ads that draw your attention away from the content. I figured I\u0027d try something different and ask those of you who use ad blocking software to consider making a small monthly contribution to help keep the site going.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo what do you get if you decided to back this campaign? Mostly, my thanks.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHonestly, I already work pretty hard on Liliputing and LPX and additional income isn\u0027t going to change that... although decreasing income might. If revenue from online advertising declines in the coming years, I might have to go find a day job or something.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf there\u0027s enough interest from backers of the campaign, I might be willing to add reward levels including things like Liliputing or LPX T-shirts, mugs, or USB flash drives or other things. Have other ideas? Let me know by leaving a comment below!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
