    "summary": "Hey guys, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of a huge thank you for taking the time to click the link \u0026amp; visit my patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Bobby G and I run a small but growing youtube sports management gaming channel which specialises in providing Football Manager, Cricket Captain \u0026amp; Rugby Union Team Manager content. The channel has seen superb growth over the last couple of months since I started in August 2017 \u0026amp; now sits with over 60k+ views, 250k+ minutes watched \u0026amp; 450+ subscribers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off let me say if you don\u0027t have the funds to donate on patreon please don\u0027t, your views on my youtube channel \u0026amp; support is more than enough. I am actually blown away by the views \u0026amp; the fact people take time to watch my gaming journey \u0026amp; interact - it really is a very special community \u0026amp; one that I feel proud to be part of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little about me - I\u0027ve been playing sports game\u0027s since since i can remember getting a NES with nintendo world cup soccer \u0026amp; an acorn computer with player manager \u0026amp; howzat cricket - great times. Alongside playing sport, sports gaming has long since been a passion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter 20 years of playing cricket, Rugby, American Football \u0026amp; several years as a pro wrestler back in September 2016 I suffered a very bad head injury in a pro wrestling match which was the straw that broke the camels back \u0026amp; had 6 months off work suffering from post concussion syndrome. Symptoms included memory loss, extreme fatigue, slurring, poor sleeping \u0026amp; anxiety. Over a year down the road and i\u0027m back to work but still every day I have symptoms from my head injury come back to bite me - some days they kick my ass - some days I kick theirs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I felt well enough that\u0027s when I started my youtube channel as an opportunity to reignite my passion for gaming inspired by other great youtube content creators, especially now I can\u0027t do any contact sports going forward. It has been an amazing journey one I have greatly enjoyed over the last four months. There is an awesome community out there full of superb football manager content creators \u0026amp; cricket captain content creators who all interact \u0026amp; support each other on twitter. I for one am very thankful that you chose my channel to view \u0026amp; support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith any donations I receive I will be able to justify the extra time spent on creating youtube content \u0026amp; either improve the production value of the videos - the first big buy I want to purchase is a green screen with lighting or\u00a0 supporting my wife \u0026amp; family who is due to go on maternity leave next year.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor any donations I will give you a shout out in one of my youtube videos \u0026amp; a personalised tweet on twitter. I will be eternally grateful that you have taken the time to support the channel \u0026amp; enhance my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t want to do any of the above \u0026amp; just donate to the channel you\u0027re more than welcome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe G Club\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1 you will become a member of the G Club.
