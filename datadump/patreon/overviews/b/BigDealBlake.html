    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Big Deal\nBlake?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ancient architects of the Internet foretold a prophecy of a voice\nthat will unite the masses against the cacophony of cynicism and redundancy\nthat assault our networks daily. This voice will broadcast original,\ninsightful, and amusing content on every platform and medium until our collective\nentertainment options are restored. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe voice is ready to be heard.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo avoid detection from the evil pundits, the child\nhad a nomadic upbringing. He roamed New York, Virginia, and Florida before\nbeginning his training in the suburbs of Illinois.  Here, the child studied the teachings of\nFranklin Roosevelt, David Bowie, Indiana Jones and Monty Python on a daily\nbasis. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHis regiment consisted of countless hours of video\ngames, endless stacks of comic books and many, many Chicago Bears losses. As\nhis expertise for visual arts grew, so did his confidence. The boy turned into\na man (who still acted like a boy) and was ready for his next milestone. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nForging his Chicago acting and improv education\nwith his multimedia design skills, a simpleton transmogrified into an entertaining\ncraftsman.  Through his visual outlooks,\nhe has become a man of the people with an eye on the people. The time has come\nfor the prophecy to be fulfilled. For the voice to step out from the shadows\nand be heard. The time has come for\u2026 Big Deal Blake.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are you funding?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnough of the theatrics, let\u2019s get to it. You are funding shows, podcasts, sketches,\ninterviews, editorials and insight through one man\u2019s persistence. Your funding\nhelps immensely to make a dream a reality. Plus I still kinda have to do\nthis based on the scripture you read from the beginning\u2026 prophecies,\nforthcomings, etc. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support BDB?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring your day-to-day monotony, I want to entertain, inspire and listen to\nyou. Why? Because I\u2019m right there with you. As a child of destiny, I am\nworking, commuting and communicating with the masses in order to understand the\nstruggle before I rise and break through the ceiling of daily confinement.\nHowever, even those who are prophesied need to pay for equipment, upgrades,\nhardware, software, hosting accounts, and clothes (scratch that, don\u2019t really\nNEED clothes).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003ePatreon is a two-way street: your support creates more content and I get the opportunity to create new content.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow are you still reading?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re one of those chums who reads the whole page, I give you a sanctified\npat on the ole back. Never hesitate to contact me and I\u2019ll do my best to get\nback to you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for inviting me into your brain.\u003cbr\u003e"
