You probably don\u0027t know why and how you even got here but if you already opened this page, why don\u0027t you stay for a little bit longer?\nI guess you have a lot of qustions and I hope I will answer most of them so make yourself at home and let me dispel this confusion from your mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Who are you? And why should I even stay here?!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s a very good question! I\u0027m known for many names but majority calls me Mr. G. I\u0027m working with 3D stuff, mostly as an animator, but I also dabble a bit in modeling and texturing ( though those two aren\u0027t my strong side ). I\u0027m a person who has one thousand ideas per minute and tries to put them all into animation world so anyone can see and enjoy them as much as I do. I try to improve everyday testing new things, new solutions, learning new technics and styles to help me make even more advanced works. I\u0027m rather a positive and honest person, it\u0027s rare for me to be angry about something but everyone has bad days so it happens. Sometimes I can be a bit lazy but once I grab enough motivation there is nothing that can stop me from doing something, even this little flaw of mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e2. Okay, so you are playing with 3D stuff. That\u0027s pretty neat but I will need more details about your work.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\nOf course! I\u0027m mainly focused on adult Warcraft animations but I also like to switch to few other games for a change like Overwatch, Dota 2 or Heroes of the Storm. To be honest, it can be everything as long as it catches my eye.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e3. So you make only NSFW art?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eNo, it\u0027s not only NSFW. Sometimes I make safe for work art too but people prefer the other option so I mostly stick to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e4. What software do you use to create your art?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThe core program I use is so called Source Filmmaker. It\u0027s pretty popular so I bet you already heard of it many times. I use it for creating animations for models I prepare in Autodesk 3ds Max. There I make my model edits and remakes. But before import them there I have to export them from the game. And here comes Warcraft Model Viewer. Using this little but amazingly useful tool I can get almost every model from World of Warcraft. There are many, many other programs I work with but they are not that important.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e5. How much do I have to pay to see your art?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eNothing! It\u0027s completely free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e6. That\u0027s easier than I thought! You know what? I want you to make something for me. Do you take commissions?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eYes, I do. It\u0027s rare for me to open them though.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e7. What\u0027s the reason of starting a patreon if you already have money from commissions?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eAs said before, I don\u0027t open commissions too often, mostly because of lack of the time. My work is free what means I don\u0027t earn anything for the time I spend on making it and without money it\u0027s getting harder and harder to keep it like that. That\u0027s why I ask for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e8. Is there any benefit for being your patron?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eEverything depends on the amount you pledge. Look at the right side of this page if you want to know more details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e9. Okay, I became a patron but there is something wrong because I can\u0027t see your work.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eAt the moment I don\u0027t post my work on patreon. You can see it on my tumblr blog.\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://my.mixtape.moe/vbjkwq.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eFollow me on my blog and streaming channel!\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://bombowykurczak.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://my.mixtape.moe/pxkjak.png\" style=\"width: 91px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://picarto.tv/TheGWorks\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://my.mixtape.moe/wnhhmi.png\" style=\"width: 92px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
