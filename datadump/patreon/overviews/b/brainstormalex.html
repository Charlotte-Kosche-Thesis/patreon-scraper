    "summary": "Hey there, I\u0027m Alex - I make magic on my computer for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been on YouTube since 2006 - and on my journey of creation, I\u0027ve been all over. It\u0027s only in the last few years I\u0027ve settled down with a brand and a channel I can say is truly \u0027me\u0027 - BrainstormAlex.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what do I make?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHonestly, I like to make everything! More specifically, I am known for my \u003cstrong\u003eanimations\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003evideos\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003emusic\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m mostly known, however, for my animations - namely the \u0027Everybody Hates Ponies\u0027 series, as well as the \u0027The Brony Community\u0027 series!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI love making stuff, it\u0027s my favourite part of life. It\u0027s what gets me up in the morning and what keeps me dreaming. However, I\u0027m also a full-time University student, with personal obligations, and so my time is limited. When I started University, I decided to take the time that I would have used to get a job (A.K.A. my free time), and instead use it for creating stuff - specifically YouTube stuff! The problem with this, however, is the way that YouTube treats animators. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn one word, poorly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube\u0027s algorithms and ad systems are designed for people who make large quantities of frequent and long content; something which is almost impossible to be achieved by an animator - especially one in University!\u00a0Rarely, I will get commissions, and those do bring some money in, but they are few and far between. And in 2016, I\u0027ve been making more stuff than ever! I started a new channel called BrainstormExtras, which has finally given me a place to express every creative project I want to make, and with all this freedom and inspiration, I really want to keep the momentum up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you\u0027re interested in supporting my work, you\u0027ll be giving me a chance to get closer to the dream - \u00a0to make art for a living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to continue to improve my craft and make more stuff for people just like me, no matter how weird, unconventional and sometimes just plain stupid!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all so much, I look forward to making some wonderful stuff for you. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[Please feel free to give me feedback via Twitter (@BrainstormAlex)]\u003cbr\u003e"
