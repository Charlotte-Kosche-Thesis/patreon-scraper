    "summary": "Beyond the Pale is a new tabletop roleplaying game focused on social interactions, combat and investigation work to create a truly memorable world to play in.\u00a0\u00a0Mixing themes from noir film, gothic horror and myths from across the globe, Beyond the Pale seeks to add a unique, interesting twist on the urban fantasy genre.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSet in an alternate version of the modern day, the supernatural flourishes behind closed doors, with most of humanity remaining blissfully unaware of it. Discover monsters of myth and legend, solve mysteries in a city puppeteered by innumerable, inhuman interests, or do battle with the paranormal to protect humanity!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe end goal is to produce a full tabletop RPG, including manuals, rule books for players and game masters, and required paraphernalia. \u00a0After the initial release, expansions will be planned and created.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to official lore and rules, I am also writing several novellas taking place in the setting. \u00a0These are used to flesh out lore, introduce new plot points and establish existing characters within the setting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, the project requires a lot of hard work to get off the ground.\u00a0 Your support and donations can help ease the pressures of working on this game and hasten its completion and release!\u00a0 Patreon supporters will be offered exclusive artwork and info, early access to content and the chance to influence the development process directly through polls!\u00a0 To everyone who pledges their support, \u003cstrong\u003ethank you so much! \u003c/strong\u003eThis all would not be possible with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo chart the progress of the project you can visit the blog:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://beyondthepalerpg.tumblr.com/\"\u003e here\u003c/a\u003e."
