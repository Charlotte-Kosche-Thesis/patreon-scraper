    "summary": "Hey everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Brent Aureli and I am attempting to become a full time YouTube content creator! Let me give you a little of my back story:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up in Texas I went to school at Southwestern Adventist University to become a Registered Nurse. I Graduated with my Nursing degree in 2009 and went on to work in a Cardiac/Medical Telemetry unit in Ft. Worth, TX for the next 4 years. In 2013 I decided to finish a Computer Science degree I had actually already started prior to being accepted into the nursing program. I went part time at the hospital I worked at and went back to school full time. After 2 years I have finally graduated with my 2nd Bachelors, one in Computer Science!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile at school the 2nd time I met an amazing girl both smart, and beautiful. Danesa was finishing up her degree as well with plans to become a teacher after graduation. When she did, she found a position as a math teacher in Mountain View, CA! This was exciting now only for her but for me as well, as I had always thought of Silicon Valley as my Disney World!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI followed her out to CA by taking a travel nurse position at a nearby hospital, with hopes of finding a career that would combine by two passions in Nursing and Technology. When I moved to Mountain View I started making tutorial videos for my old classmates back in Texas to help them over various topics. My videos started off very rough, without much editing, and with terrible sound. But after doing it for a couple months and obtaining some basic tools have definitely improved(Still lots of room to be better).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile doing these videos I found out that I learned so much in the making of them! I had to know so much more to teach a topic and to just implement it! And I started loving doing them! Those that watched gave nothing but positive feedback and that drove me to producing more and more on a weekly basis. Now I have found something that I am truly excited in doing! I love teaching, its an important part of being a nurse, and producing helpful videos gives me the opportunity to help others and learn more in the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIm asking YOU to help me live off doing what I am passionate about! I promise to produce content that is helpful to programmers/developers of all levels, and do it with a smile on my face. I dont take myself too seriously, I want to enjoy life. I want to be a person that people can approach and talk to without feeling judged. SMILE :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me help others learn by supporting my PATREON campaign!"
