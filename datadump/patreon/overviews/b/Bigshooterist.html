    "summary": "Thank you. YOU. I am allowed to do something I feel strongly about, because you and I share the same passion and interest in self-preservation and the tools that go along with that. We walk through the history and development of many fascinating platforms together, and we preserve it for future generations. \u00a0We discuss things honestly and openly, cutting through the bull-crap and getting to the root of our discussions. We can call it \"Sharing the Craft\" or simply \"Passing it On\" but if we don\u0027t document solid information, we stand the chance it will get lost in the multitude of urban legends and internet myths. \u00a0Having been intimately involved in the firearms industry for over 25 years, most of that time as an NFA Firearms Manufacturer, there is never a shortage of interesting subject matter. So come with me on this journey to share the truth, create brass rainbows, and \u00a0never let an illogical anti-gun argument stand unchallenged."
