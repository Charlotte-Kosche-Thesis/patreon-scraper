Besides the occasional commission, working on this comic is my full-time job. I treat every page of my comic how I would an illustration. With an estimated 8 hours of work per-page, given my current rates as an illustrator, I should be making $240 each page I complete. If a single chapter consists of 60 pages, thats $14,400 per chapter. I\u0027m asking for a fraction of that (12% to be precise), just to help get things off the ground. I make \u003cem\u003eUM\u003c/em\u003e out of love and a desire to see Blackness, queerness, and Afrofuturism represented and thriving in a corner of storytelling where it has been criminally deprived.\u003cbr\u003e\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\tWhat do you spend the money on? \t\u003c/strong\u003e Everything!

This one is no different. \u003cem\u003eUM\u003c/em\u003e could mean \"Urban Midwifery\", the underlying theme of the comic. It could be thought of as referencing the neuter gender suffix -um from ancient latin. It could just be the linguistic filler \"um\" English-speakers use when they don\u0027t know what to say. It could be thought of as a contracted form of the Hindu/Buddhist/Jain sacred sound and spiritual icon \"\u0950\".\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/a6d6ab0a8ff84b6751a2fdea8059018f/tumblr_p55an9Ma5w1vzdba4o2_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e//PROJECT DESCRIPTION\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/umwbtn\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eUM\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is the consciousness-awakening story of Eugen\u00e9e, a Black, nonbinary femme, who sees visions of shamans of the ancient past interacting with gods and monsters. One day Eugen\u00e9e manifests magical powers and comes face to face with The Goddess herself! With the help of their friends and a mysterious witch named Mama Chevron, Eugen\u00e9e uncovers the embodied source perpetuating Imperialist White Supremacist Capitalist Patriarchy, and must face it head-on in order to prevent its ultimate plan of global collapse from being realized.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWith a liberal dose of references to African/Diasporic Magical and Prophetic Traditions and nods to their continued lineage and heritage as background information peppered throughout global belief systems, narratives, and modes of thought, \u003cem\u003eUM \u003c/em\u003eis bound to awaken its readers to a world possibly concurrent with our own, but washed out by the blinding light of globalism\u0027s many concessions made in the hope of maintaining hegemony and erasing the highly creative, artistic traditions that helped lay its groundwork and form the many veins meandering through the matrix of modernity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBy centering a dark-skinned, Black, gender-nonconforming person in a narrative with global and potentially interplanetary consequence, \u003cem\u003eUM\u003c/em\u003e gives a marginalized demographic the tools to imagine themselves in the future both on and off our planet.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFor many years now I have wanted to put together a project that has the conceptual breadth, depth, and timescale to enable queer, trans (especially Black) people of color, to imagine them-/ourselves and their/our successors in a similar light to how mainstream comics have enabled both the imaginations of cis/hetero-conforming white people, and the cultural deification of such system-reinforcing apparatuses as The Justice League and Avengers. However, I\u0027m only interested in doing this while appealing as-little-as-possible to the tired tropes and narrative concessions that I and so many of my friends are sick of seeing over and over in easily accessible Science-Fantasy media. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/232f971b77a38c03bee29616fa361425/tumblr_p55an9Ma5w1vzdba4o1_1280.jpg\"\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI also feel interested in exploring the intersections between science and religion and how they both manifest similarly in terms of establishing social strata. In my mind there\u0027s very little difference between a conference of clergy and a review board at a peer-reviewed science journal. The implications of what they discuss and decide are potentially equal in their capacity to influence futures, and both groups, as well as other, similar manifestations of this particular form of oligarchy, are what maintain the systems of inequality and immutable-seeming corruption that inhabit human political systems. Giving marginalized people a conceptual arena within which they can combat this invisible/inaccessible threat to their everyday is essential in resisting its dedication to upheaval of their psychic wellness. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHomo Sapiens\u0027 globally-shared interest in mythology and epic storytelling can\u0027t be underemphasized. There is a gross lack of representation of stories invoking ancient myths and traditions with an eye on Black femme identity at their core. When doing research for this work I was constantly hitting dead ends or ending up in chaotic regions of the internet because there simply is no academic or definitive extant framework for Black mythology outside the dichotomy of oral folk-tale/religious tradition and Black characters created and/or appropriated by euro-descended authors meant to inhabit a world with primarily white perspectives\u2014the recent, extremely successful \u003cem\u003eBlack Panther \u003c/em\u003efilm is no exception.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSaying \"I think we \u003cem\u003eneed\u003c/em\u003e this\", would be a gross understatement.
