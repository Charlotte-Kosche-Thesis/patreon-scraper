You can read both series \u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://saintcomix.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Vapors is a jokeless comedy and a farcical drama. It\u0027s kind of like... Catcher in the Rye. Or King of the Hill. It\u0027s about sad nerds and is either funny or\u00a0depressing depending on your level of empathy. Two chapters are currently available to read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Champion is a fantasy story about a girl stuck in a job she hates. It\u0027s been compared to One Punch Man, but personally I think it\u0027s more like Watamote. 50 pages of the first chapter are currently available to read, but it\u0027s still early so I won\u0027t say any more about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI did a pokemon comic about a mamoswine called Brunswick that got pretty widely circulated as well. You can read it\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://saintcomix.com/b01.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI do every aspect of my comics myself - writing, sketching, inking, toning, and lettering, making it a pretty long and intensive process.\u00a0But you can help me commit the time necessary to get it done!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e1. Your support will allow me to spend more of my time making comics.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI have a normal boring job that pays the bills, but if I\u0027m getting paid through Patreon I can make drawing comics my job instead. Every 50 bucks I make through Patreon represents one day I can spend drawing instead of working. At 1000 bucks per month, I\u0027ll be taking EVERY day off to draw, and will officially be a real-life professional comics-man! That\u0027s the dream, my friends.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e2. Your support will allow me to hire an assistant artist.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eIf I made enough to support not just myself but another artist as well, I could pay an assistant to help with lettering, backgrounds, and tones. I could finish pages way, way faster and probably have a whole book\u0027s worth of The Vapors done in a matter of months.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e~REWARDS~\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming my patron, you help me get a little bit closer to living the dream and becoming a full-time professional cartoonist-mangaka-graphic-novelist-type-fellow, and for that, you deserve a reward. I\u0027ve decided to do things a bit differently than most creators on Patreon, and give rewards based on total, cumulative, lifetime amount given, rather than based on how much you\u0027ve pledged to give each month. Pledging enough for a higher-tier rewards naturally gets you all lower-tier rewards as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIf your total amount given equals or exceeds...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e$5 - \u003c/strong\u003eYou\u0027ll get exclusive access to speeddraw videos showing the process of drawing each new page, as well as a patrons-only gallery of sketches, concept art, WIP\u0027s, and general miscellaneous art junk, as well as status updates on upcoming projects.
