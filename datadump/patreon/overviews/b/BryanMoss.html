    "summary": "My goal is to to dedicate as much of my time into personal projects, both fine arts and comics. \u00a0I wear plenty of hats in this market which leaves very little space for any purely original content. \u00a0As a comic creator, my intentions rely in serving those who haven\u0027t a voice, those who are marginalized. My work in the comic medium is to communicate those oppressed, and often-times, silenced voices. \u00a0My goal for this would, of course, be to further continue this narrative - serving as a conduit for these communities and their experiences - but working larger and working louder. \u00a0As a painter, I utilize the craft to express a fantastical and sublime interpretation of \u003cem\u003emy own\u003c/em\u003e personal narrative. \u00a0My paintings are certainly more parallel to \u003cem\u003emy\u003c/em\u003e personal experiences, but are not directed to any specific audience or age demographic. \u00a0My goal is to make my stories \u003cem\u003eeven more accessible \u003c/em\u003eand to continue educating those, old and young, of the methodical, meticulous (and often-times, misunderstood) craft of painting. There is definitely a fine line between what I do as a comic book artist and what I do as a painter. \u00a0There is potential to overlap the two. \u00a0Building up my resources for a successful execution of that project, I would consider, another goal."

     "about": "Born and raised in Columbus, Ohio, Bryan Moss began his training at the age of 5 in the foundations of painting. \u00a0It was at age 10 where he had discovered comic books which had a compelling influence on the way he perceived art. \u00a0It was then that Bryan Moss knew exactly what he wanted to do for the rest of his life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a substantial portfolio in the making, Bryan spent much of his early 20\u0027s pursuing freelance work and was also able to get his feet wet in the world of commercial art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith his experience in commercial work and the demand of the modern audience, Bryan was able to market his art through clothing. \u00a0He had developed a run-from-home printing customized line. \u00a0This enabled him to push his artistic capabilities into the public realm and establish a base of intrigued and impressed consumers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot feeling satisfied with commercial work, Bryan made the decision to leave it behind. \u00a0Instead, he made the leap towards a more personally honest platform - rerooting his passion for painting and returning to the always inspiring craft of the comic book. \u00a0Since 2013, Bryan Moss has had 12 successful solo shows and more than a dozen shared exhibitions. \u00a0He has received grants from the Greater Columbus Arts Council, various teaching positions at the Columbus College of Art and Design and has an upcoming residency this Autumn at the Wexner Center for the Arts. He is in the midst of a few comic projects, as well; \"Rita\u0027s Dream,\" Space Woman\" and \"Celli Blue\".",
