I also happen to be a black woman in a predominantly white and male sport. While this year, I\u0027m hiking the 770-mile Grand Enchantment Trail, in the coming years, I intend to thruhike the Continental Divide Trail and the Appalachian Trail to complete the Triple Crown of long-distance hiking. It\u0027s a tall order, but I\u0027m a tall woman, and I\u0027m up for the challenges long-distance hiking has to offer - and I\u0027m hoping to show folk of all colors, particularly brown folk, that they\u0027re totally up for those challenges, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ve probably found this page from my blog,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.browngirlonthepct.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBrown Girl on the NST\u003c/a\u003e, from my articles in Backpacker Magazine and at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.backpacker.com/tag/pacific-crest-trail-2016\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBackpacker.com\u003c/a\u003e, from my appearances on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thetrailshow.com/the-trail-show-53-the-l2h/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Trail Show\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.soundsofthetrail.com/?p=368\"\u003eSounds of the Trail\u003c/a\u003e, from my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/browngirlonthepct/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e account, or from, y\u0027know, actually meeting me on the trail or at a hiker-oriented event. If you\u0027ve interacted with me in one of these ways, I want to thank you for being open, for listening to my stories - and for encouraging me to write more, which leads to why we\u0027re all here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page is set to help me with three things: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) Writing for the blog\u003c/strong\u003e, as it takes valuable time and focus out of my (hiking) day to be able to deliver 1000-or-more-word posts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Blog-related expenses\u003c/strong\u003e, such as hosting and keeping the site ad-free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) \u003c/strong\u003eIf there\u0027s any extra after the first two, \u003cstrong\u003eMore hikes\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0to give you more content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe bonus of trying to fund all of this with Patreon is that I can give back to you fine folks in the form of rewards, as delineated in the wee column to your right. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDonations will forever be voluntary\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e - you\u0027ll always be able to read daily accounts of any hikes I do on my blog for free, and I hope you do! And you could just totally leave it at that, or buy the eventual book when it comes out, or none of that. You do you. But even a dollar a month helps me worry less about how I\u0027m going to eat and more about how I\u0027m gonna get you more writing.\u003c/div\u003e"
