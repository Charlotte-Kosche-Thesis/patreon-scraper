I develop for the fun of it and switch my \nfocus based on my interest at the time.\u003cbr\u003eI taught myself how to mod over the last 4 years, and after a few failed projects, I actually publish stuff now, as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat...?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy most prominent project, that most people have probably heard about is \"Immersive Engineering\".\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a techmod that Damien Hazard and myself are developing together (he does the art, I do the code).\u003cbr\u003eOther works include Witching Gadgets, a Thaumcraft addon, Traveller\u0027s Gear, an RPG style inventory, AquaTweaks, a client-only mod to make underwater builds a bit prettier, Description Tags and BluDecorations.\u003cbr\u003eFurther details about those can be found in their respective Threads on the Minecraft Forums, or on Curse: \u003ca href=\"http://www.curse.com/users/BluSunrize/projects\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.curse.com/users/BluSunrize/projects\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.curse.com/users/Dawn_1006/projects\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy...?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, to quote a great SciFi saga: I\u0027m just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe. I do not believe in demanding money for my content, but I appreciate any support I might get! :D\u003cbr\u003eBasically, it helps me pay for stuff like phone bills, internet access and ice tea, my \u003cem\u003eaqua vitae\u003c/em\u003e ;D\u003cbr\u003eIt also pays, in part, for more extravagant expenses, like a recent trip to PAX East I took, a video game convention in Boston, where I got to meet a lot of cool people, including fans of my work! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd you get...?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy eternal gratitude for one! Also, there is a Jenkins build server linked directly to the IE github, where the latest development builds are located.\u003cbr\u003eAlso, there are (currently) two other pledge levels which allow you to get a unique skin for the revolver in IE and possibly even hide your own little reference in its manual! :D\u003cbr\u003eThese rewards will be applied at the start of each month when the pledges have been collected, since that makes sorting through patrons much easier ^^\u003cbr\u003eAlso, the higher-priced rewards include the benefits of the lower level (people who go for Manual reference will still get the revolver).\u003cbr\u003e"
