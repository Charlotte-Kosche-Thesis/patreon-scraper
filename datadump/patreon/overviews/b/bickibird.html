Instead of Kickstarter and other fundraising services that are more for funding one-off large projects, Patreon is for creators to continuously create content on a small scale. Supporters can donate anywhere from $1 upwards per set time period (e.g. per week/month or each time a creator posts something) and it is aimed towards continuous support. You have total freedom on the amount you want to give and can stop at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo here\u0027s the deal:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I will draw beautiful vulnerable, endangered or extinct animals using \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003etraditional media i.e. paper, pencils, pens, paint.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0All of my artwork is traditional and I don\u0027t use digital media to modify my art, like Photoshop etc (except when placing watermarks). By pledging your support to me, you support both my art and conservation. ALL profits I receive from Patreon will be donated to the following conservation societies (each society will be donated an equal amount):\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.wwf.org.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.wwf.org.au/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.conservation.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.conservation.org/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://oceana.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://oceana.org/\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.palmoilinvestigations.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.palmoilinvestigations.org/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am aware there are various other conservation organisations out there and I am open to suggestions on which ones to donate to.

No profits will go towards my own income. I will donate every time I post a new piece of art on Patreon and I will post receipts onto Patreon each time this happens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will you take donations and post new artwork? \u003c/strong\u003eMy Patreon page is designed so that \u0027pledges\u0027 are made each time I post a new art piece. That is, you will be charged however much you pledge each time I post something new. I can assure you with my busy schedule that this will probably be only once every 6 weeks, or once a month if I\u0027m lucky. Even if people pledge $2 and I post something every month, if we get several hundred people, that\u0027s several hundred dollars a month donated to important causes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy not just donate to these conservation organisations directly? \u003c/strong\u003eOf course by all means you can! But I am offering extra bonuses to people who pledge via Patreon (see all the rewards listed below). I am also using Patreon and my ability to draw to attract more people, especially those who would otherwise not donate to conversation funds directly. It\u0027s also a personal motivator and you are also supporting my art and my ability to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI just want a one-off commission from you, can you do that? \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve been asked this a lot and I am happy to do so! Please see the $45 reward listed below. All prices below are in US dollars but I am based in Australia and happy to ship internationally. To make a one-off pledge you must remove yourself from continuous pledges. Please see Patreon\u0027s FAQs for more info!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport me, support what\u0027s important. Every effort counts.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
