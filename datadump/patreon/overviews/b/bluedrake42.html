How does this work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is like Kickstarter... however\u00a0Instead of pledging large amounts of money once to fund single large-scale products (like games/books/etc) you\u0027re pledging smaller amounts of money over time to fund frequent ongoing releases (like vlogs/music/etc.) It is totally voluntary, and helps support the creators you love to continue creating the content you enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill my patronage help your gaming content as well?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbsolutely! Your patronage helps support everything I do, including my gaming content! I just want to give back to my loyal supporters in the only way I can, which just happens to be making music!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will I be charged?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will only be charged once a month, no more and no less!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThings you can look forward to by supporting me on Patreon:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTouring.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver wanted to meet me in person? Go paintballing, play games, rock out at a show? Supporting me on Patreon will help me make all those awesome things (and more) possible. My channel\u0027s entire angle is personal interaction and community. I want to keep taking that to the next level. We\u0027re not just going to break down the fourth wall... we\u0027re gonna nuke the balls out of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBetter Equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEver wanted to see a point-of-view livestream of PAX Prime? Maybe a milsim paintball scenario flying around on real helicopters? Or how about a livestream of me stage-diving onto 1000 people at Warped Tour? Having the budget to afford the rugged equipment I need to withstand the most extreme environments will help me take this channel to places we\u0027ve never been before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGuest Stars.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWant to see me record an album with one of your favorite musicians? Maybe make a video with a huge Youtuber? Or just fly to Europe and go on tour with one of your favorite bands? Having a Youtube channel with 100k subscribers and pointing to a Patreon with 1000 backers will make opportunities like this come much easier. As a backer, you\u0027ll not only make these moments possible... but you\u0027ll also have the opportunity to help me choose which people to approach for collaborations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s everything I can think of to answer! If you have any other questions or concerns feel free to email me at \u003cb style=\"\"\u003eBluedrake42@gmail.com \u003c/b\u003eand thank you so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
