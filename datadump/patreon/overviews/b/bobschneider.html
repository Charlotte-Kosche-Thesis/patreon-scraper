    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHi and welcome. As some of you may already know, I\u0027ve been coordinating something I call the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.npr.org/2013/11/24/246755925/for-a-few-musicians-beating-songwriters-block-is-all-in-the-game\"\u003eSong Game\u003c/a\u003e for years now. It started back in 2000 when I first started going out on tour. To pass the time, me and the songwriters I was with on tour would come up with a phrase and write a new song using that phrase every day of the tour. It was pretty crazy, but after a three week tour I\u0027d have written a couple albums worth of songs. I gradually started doing it more and more when I was off tour over the internet, and have been doing it continuously now for over 15 years. As you can imagine I\u0027ve ended up writing A LOT OF SONGS this way. In fact, all the albums that I\u0027ve put out since \u003cem\u003eLonelyland\u003c/em\u003e are comprised of songs that were written this way. The title of my song \"Honeypot\" was a song game phrase, as an example. The line \"they don\u0027t make a pretty pair\" in my song \"Let The Light In\" was a song game phrase. If you\u0027ve been coming to see ALL my live shows over the past 15 years, you\u0027ve heard some of these songs, but many of them I\u0027ve never even played live. They\u0027re in \u0027The Vault\u0027 as it were, and that\u0027s where they\u0027ve stayed until now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, with Patreon, I\u0027m finally able to release this material from \u0027the vault\u0027 to my fans each month, as well as the brand new songs that I\u0027ve just written. Patreon allows creators like me to connect directly with supporters like you, and it allows you to decide how much you want to support me. No matter which level you decide to go with, you\u0027ll still get all the songs that I put out each month, but if you can afford more we\u0027ve created some really cool rewards for those folks.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYou might be saying, \u0027But what about the studio albums you\u0027ve made in the past that we really love?\u0027 Well, that\u0027s the thing I\u0027m most excited about. Your support here on Patreon will allow me to continue to create the albums that I love making outside the constraints of \u0027the music business\u0027 or a record company. My favorite albums that I\u0027ve made were done this way: \u003cem\u003eLonelyland\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eLovely Creatures\u003c/em\u003e, and most recently, \u003cem\u003eKing Kong\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve never done anything like this before and I\u0027m really excited about getting these songs out to you and hearing your feedback, and I can\u0027t wait to see what we\u0027re going to be able to do together. Thanks for joining me here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eb\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
