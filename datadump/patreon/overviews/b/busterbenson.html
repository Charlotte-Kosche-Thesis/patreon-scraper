    "summary": "\ud83d\udc4b Hi! \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m Buster Benson.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0This is an experiment. I\u0027m only creating 1 level of patronage here -- it\u0027s the $1/month level, and you get ALL the perks! Because, I can\u0027t guarantee that you\u0027ll really get more than $1/month of value out of me here... I\u0027ll do my best though!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI love Patreon.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0So much, that I ended up wanting to work for them! Even if you don\u0027t become my patron, you should definitely\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/explore\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elook around\u003c/a\u003e and become a patron for other amazing people. I think the list of who I\u0027m a patron for is in the sidebar of my profile page... I\u0027m particularly interested in the webcomic artists on here, and people writing about science-y things, you will find.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBack to me!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eOkay, here\u0027s the idea. I\u0027m tired of getting into frustrating, recurring, arguments that never end up changing anyone\u0027s mind. You may have experienced them yourself. I\u0027m also tired of hearing all of the advice around becoming more \"rational\" and less \"emotional\" as the way to be more \"persuasive\". All of those words feel wrong to me... I feel like there should be a way to have conversations that doesn\u0027t require us to adopt slimy persuasion techniques and also doesn\u0027t turn into robots without emotion. Is that too much to ask?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow did I end up interested in this?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eMy obsession started with cognitive biases, and when I synthesized all 200+ known cognitive biases into my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecognitive bias cheat sheet\u003c/a\u003e it revealed to me that I wasn\u0027t the only person interested in this stuff. I was approached by Portfolio Books (part of Penguin Random House) and now I\u0027m writing a book about how to apply knowledge of cognitive biases to something truly useful: heated conversations. My book is tentatively titled \"Arguing is Hard\" and you\u0027ll be hearing a whole lot more about the process and the product if you become my patron.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m starting to explore ways to have more interesting arguments with people. Where, rather than trying to figure out who\u0027s right, we figure out why people have different opinions. Instead of trying to be more right, we can try to be less wrong.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, I had an interesting argument about whether or not it was okay to drink water that\u0027s been left out for a few days. I\u0027m generally not the kind of person that would do that! I imagine an old glass of water looks like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*zh3Jdmo7p9cC2dOcTqVxlA.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, after talking with a bunch of people about their reasons, and why some are okay with it, I found myself sipping a glass of water that had been out a couple days... just to see what it tasted like. Because now I knew that when you leave it out, the chlorine in the water evaporates, and that changes the flavor. And some bacteria will grow in there, but most likely it\u0027s totally fine. It\u0027s no worse than eating a piece of fruit that\u0027s been left on the counter for a while. I digress. In any case, it was interesting. If you want to read about it,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/thinking-is-hard/me-seeking-more-interesting-arguments-8f46cfe845e5\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyou can do so here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\ud83d\udc7b \u003cstrong\u003eWho believes in ghosts?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eAnother interesting argument, which got quite \"spirited\" was about whether or not people thought that ghosts were real things that existed. It got heated at times! But I also learned a lot about how people interpret their experiences, and how each of us has a rather personal system for drawing the line between real and imaginary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther interesting arguments that I want to have:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhich options around guns and violence would result in the fewest deaths?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIs there really still a debate about the shape of the Earth? What is the nature of reality and how can we talk about it?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eShould parents reconsider telling their children about Santa? Where is the line between truth, fiction, and belief in the magic of the world?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWho deserves help and who deserves punishment? Who decides that line and who enforces it?\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAre some people hopeless when it comes to having fruitful disagreements? What makes them that way? Are we ever part of the problem?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eYou get the idea!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecome my patron!\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ll update you on all the different interesting arguments that I\u0027m a part of, and will invite you to be the first wave of participants for all future arguments, and include your name in the book when it comes out. It\u0027ll be fun.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you! Here\u0027s to seeking more interesting arguments!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
