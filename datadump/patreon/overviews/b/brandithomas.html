I\u0027m a film composer, which means I write music for movies!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow Does This Thing Work?\u003c/h3\u003ePatreon is very similar to Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Seed\u0026amp;Spark, etc. Basically, there are a bunch of creators here running their own \"campaigns,\" if you will, but the campaign is ongoing! Patrons can choose to support once or on a per upload basis, and there are super fun rewards you get for supporting us! If you support on a per upload basis (thank you!) and are concerned about going over your budget, there is an easy way to set a monthly maximum when you enter your payment info. Hakuna matata! (It means no worries). Your ongoing support helps us continue to do what we love and bring you the best content possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will consider donating $1 (or however much you want) for each track that I upload. I will upload around twice per month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere Your Money Will Go:\u003c/h3\u003eI love working with my buddy Adam Klein (recording engineer) as much as I possibly can. He\u0027s a very talented guy, and talented people deserve to be paid for their work! (He recorded the track above, including the entire TAXII soundtrack!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is no bigger rush than recording with live musicians. Everyone\u0027s working together to make music. Words just can\u0027t describe the feeling. And sure, musicians don\u0027t complain when they get free coffee, but I want to pay them when I am able so that they can continue doing what they love too! Everybody wins.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease do not become a patron if you are low on money. Financial stress is the worst kind of stress and I honestly appreciate if you even just share this page or follow me on social media. Again, please do not feel obligated to support my work monetarily if you are struggling financially.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat\u0027s In It For Me, Huh?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so glad you asked.
