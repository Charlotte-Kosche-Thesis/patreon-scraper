I started up this channel mid 2016, whenever I bought a Harley Iron 883. I never expected the channel to get to the point that it has to be honest, but the channel and Blockhead community have grown at an amazing rate, and I can\u0027t thank \u003cem\u003eyou all\u003c/em\u003e enough! It\u0027s awesome the sense of community that has grown around the vlog, and very cool to be able to share videos of something that I truly enjoy doing with you all. Having like minded people come together to discuss anything and everything is incredibly rewarding! From talking about motorcycles and gear, to asking your advice about cats vs Christmas trees, we pretty much talk about it all. Nothing\u0027s off limits! It gets pretty diverse, and that\u0027s awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI was told to setup a Patreon by my Subscribers, because they kept asking me how they could contribute.

I like to keep it honest, as it gives you all better insight! In continuing with that here on Patreon, to make those of you that are considering contributing aware, I am in no way \u0027\u003cem\u003ehurting\u003c/em\u003e\u0027 for money. I have a professional career, complete with 401k and all that jazz. The Blockhead motovlog is a hobby. I do it for fun! My Patreon account is here for the purpose of supporting and growing the channel. Any funds raised on here will go towards investments relating directly to the channel such as mods, trips, meet-ups, maintenance, recording equipment, gas... you name it, if it\u0027s motorcycle or channel related, that\u0027s what it\u0027ll go towards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease don\u0027t feel required to contribute, but to those of you out there that have asked how to be involved and help the channel grow, this is the way! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027re ALL Awesome!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m big on community, and feel very lucky and grateful that you all tune in, comment, and interact.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Blockheads have given me some awesome opportunities, and are what continue to make all this possible!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, thank you all for the continued support, it means a lot!
