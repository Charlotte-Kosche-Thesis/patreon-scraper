    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are Ivar \u0026amp; Floris, two sailors who chronicle our sailing trip around the world in search of sustainable solutions for humanity and our planet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe route takes us around the world to sustainable solutions that work in practice. The solutions address various environmental and social challenges the world faces today. By sharing the solutions, we hope to provide you with the necessary concepts and practical tools to make sustainable changes in your own lives and communities. Traveling on wind energy, we left Amsterdam in June 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe visit, describe and share the sustainable solutions through our videos and articles. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese \"Sustainable Solutions\" videos show a successful initiative, often explained by an inspiring person who created or applies the solution. One such video is the lesson in permaculture we received from Helena von Bothmer, co-founder of an organic farm and restaurant in Sweden:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/198265453\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also create travel videos. These \"Logbook\" videos let you experience\u00a0our sailing adventure by showing you stunning nature, introducing you to the people we encounter and giving you a preview of the sustainable solutions we researched in the area we covered. An example is the video about our trip from Galicia in Northern Spain to the capital of Portugal, Lisbon:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/200074955\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, we want to show you exciting elements of life onboard, or unforgettable experiences along our world trip. We do so in our \"Impressions\" videos. In the one below, we show you how we made baggywrinkles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/200406163\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe keep the videos quite short (around 3 minutes), so they can be liked and shared easily on social media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeep us going\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe both gave up our full-time jobs for this endeavour, which we expect to take around 5 years to complete. We try to live a conscious lifestyle and participate in the giving and sharing economy as much as possible. Still, sailing around the world is costly, even if it\u0027s done on a budget. Things break and need to be fixed or replaced, as every sailor has experienced. Insurance premiums, for the boat and us, need to be paid regularly. Add harbour fees, diesel (as little as possible) and food and you get an idea what we need just to get by from day to day.\u00a0In addition, to visits sustainable solutions we often need to pay for transportation and lodging.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help as our patron, we can cover the necessary boat maintenance costs and travel expenses to complete our journey. With additional resources, we\u0027ll also be able to fully dedicate our time to finding sustainable solutions and creating inspiring videos, while we can also professionalise our research, videos and articles.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSail with us!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur patrons join a community that transitions to a more sustainable way of living.\u00a0As a token of gratitude towards our patrons, you\u0027ll be able to see our videos ahead of everyone else. Depending on your level, you may also get additional rewards. Note that\u00a0we aim to provide all our content free of charge to everyone so we can\u00a0inspire as many people as possible with the sustainable solutions we discover.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU for joining us on our journey!\u003cbr\u003e"
