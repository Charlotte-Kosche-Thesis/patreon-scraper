There is so much content circulating; it is extremely hard to get noticed. In the earlier days, people were hungry for new content, so it was quite easy to grow and promote new things. Now you have to fight to get noticed. In the earlier days, all social media platforms have less strict rules and that open space for more promotional solutions. \n\u003cu\u003eToday you can literally \"just pay their high costly ads\" to promote yourself, and that\u0027s all\u003c/u\u003e.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(229, 78, 57);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u00a0 \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(229, 78, 57);\"\u003e\u2192 That is the problem that I can partially solve!\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eThis is the reason I started SocMedClub on Patreon.\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://socmedclub.com/imgs-patreon/WHO-AM-I.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am a senior programmer and server administrator since the year 1994.
