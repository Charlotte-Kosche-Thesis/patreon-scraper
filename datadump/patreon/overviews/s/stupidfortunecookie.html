    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHey there. \u00a0Good to see you. \u00a0I\u0027d like to talk to you about our webcomic... \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cem\u003ewait.. please don\u0027t run away... \u00a0I\u0027ll be brief...\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are here, you probably know us from the \u003cstrong\u003eVinci \u0026amp; Arty\u003c/strong\u003e webcomic. That story has since been retired early, but there is so much more!  This comic has been in the works since its prequel strip was just getting started.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Vinci \u0026amp; Arty dealt with just the title characters, a 20-something pair who were learning how to strengthen their relationship. \u003cstrong\u003eStupid Fortune Cookie\u003c/strong\u003e, takes place five years later and expands the story outwards; V\u0026amp;A are still at the core, but other folks will get the spotlight too. The main theme of the comic is similar in that it stresses not judging a book by its cover, plus some emphasis on dreams and allowing yourself happiness. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is awesome.  You know what it really is or you probably wouldn\u0027t be here.  It\u2019s a great platform for interacting with supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere the money goes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt supplies to create the comic. Childcare services so that the artist (a busy mom of 3) can set aside enough time to work. Bills\u2019o\u2019plenty. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOTES On Pledge Rewards:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStrip Posting;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe artwork that will be in the feed will be strip related, but not always.  Strips will be posted here for patrons to see, days before they are available on other locations.  There is no plans to REQUIRE people to be patrons to see the strip.  Patrons, as a thank you, will get things earlier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhole Arc Posting:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the $100 level is the goal bonus of the story arcs being available in .cbz format for offline browsing.  They will be available upon arc completion.  More details if that goal is met, and when it happens. Similar to as is in the \"Jack\" Comic, a \"Whole Arc Viewer\" will be available on completion of the first whole arc, so the entire story can be read in one page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOC Inclusions;  Role restrictions for Stupid Fortune Cookie.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eCast member roles can be obtained in one of two ways, either by pledging a certain amount on Patreon per month or by entering one of the open casting calls. These roles can range from being a walk-on cameo, to a supporting role in a vignette, to playing a part in the feature presentation arcs. But there are restrictions that apply to all roles! Please read carefully before submitting your character, or else you may be turned down\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you are claiming a Patron perk and your character submission is turned down, you will be asked to submit a different character, or make alterations to your character. If you are entering an open casting call, you will only be able to submit one character.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReasons your character may be declined are:\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eMagic - Characters may not have magical abilities (changing forms, sizes, using spells,etc .) \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRarity - To preserve the rarity of certain species in the comic universe, we may have to decline certain characters. For example, there are likely only a few unicorns in existence in comic canon, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense to have multiple unicorn characters appear.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCharacter has too similar a backstory - We will likely decline characters whose backstory is too similar to a featured role. Ex. halfmask raccoons.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCharacter does not fit in with the general canon. ie: the one exception to the \u201cno magic\u201d rule or anything like that. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCharacter may not be related or close to canon characters unless previously cleared with the writers. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eActors - If you submit a character intended as a \u201cfamous actor\u201d on one of the shows featured in Stupid Fortune Cookie outside of a specific casting call. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReasons not included in this list are not guaranteed to be accepted.  The character should \u201cfit\u201d the universe and not be an outlier/exceptional.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThings to consider before submitting your character:\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour character will be part of the supporting cast, not a main character. However! We\u2019re always interested in short stories that could potentially become part of the canon as vignettes, so if you\u2019ve got a pitch that features your character in the starring role, send it to us. \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDO NOT send full scripts,  At most, a one paragraph synopsis.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis is due to the fact that, as with how Authors do not read \u201cfanfiction\u201d of their works, we do not want to accidentally read scripts. This is because we currently have several plots and stories in various stages of completion. If by coincidence what is in development matches what you have sent us, it puts us in a tricky position.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Mary Sue has a great article that explains in detail our reasons; \u003ca href=\"http://www.themarysue.com/writers-fanfiction/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.themarysue.com/writers-fanfiction/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSo, going into such a thing, we want to be able to say \u201cno, that sounds similar, we are taking a pass on this until (relevant story release date) and after this story is live, then we will listen.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf your character is cast as a player on one of the reality TV shows in the feature presentation arcs, you must be all right with the chance that your character is voted off. Certain votes may be presented to the comic audience and not be pre-meditated by the comic writers, so please be sure you will be all right with this! Please also make sure you are content with possibly being the first voted off as much as you would be with making it through towards the end, as anything can happen!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe vignettes written by the core comic writers have specific plots \u0026amp; endings. If your character is cast in a vignette, please do not hassle the writers to change the plot. We will take minor suggestions however, such as writing in a character\u2019s favorite food or a quirk!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe need all kinds of roles filled! From villains to heroes and everything inbetween! Keep in mind your character\u2019s actions at any time may be subject to audience scrutiny, and please try not to take it personally. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u201cCasting Call Plus\u201d - Reward tier;  at the $10 and above level, this would be the same as a  \u201cClosed Casting Call\u201d for the roles. If a character is not found, an \u201cOpen Casting Call\u201d to lower tiers will happen. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGiving us permission to use your characters is non-revocable. In plain words, if we use your character on page 5, you can\u2019t come back to us in the future and say \u201cYou no longer can use my character, remove page 5.\u201d We will of course not use your character in future works. You STILL own your character, you will always own your character as far as we are concerned.  We are just borrowing them as an \u201cextra\u201d.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuggest A Thing:\u003c/strong\u003e There will be times when we need names/places, Why not let our Patrons suggest the name of where to eat, or a shop they\u2019ll be at?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisclaimer:\u003c/strong\u003e While 4 pages/month is what is being shot for, health/family has higher priority. If unable to meet the agreed on levels, we\u2019ll do our best to make it up to y\u2019all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBonus Content:\u003c/strong\u003e Above a certain monthly goal, Vinci \u0026amp; Arty: The Lost Chapters will be posted. These bonus tales feature the events that would have taken place during chapters 4 and 5 had Vinci \u0026amp; Arty not been discontinued. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRaffles: \u003c/strong\u003eAny potential future raffles will be equal opportunity, and \u003cstrong\u003ewill not\u003c/strong\u003e require being a Patron to enter. \u00a0All raffle drawings will be video recorded as proof of fairness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLastly:\u003c/strong\u003e Due to issues in the past, we reserve the right to say no.\u003cbr\u003e"
