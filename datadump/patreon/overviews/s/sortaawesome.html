We - host Megan Tietz and her super awesome co-hosts Kelly Gordon, Rebekah Hoffer, and Laura Tremaine - take the mission of Sorta Awesome SUPER seriously. We\u0027ve heard from our community of Awesomes that both this podcast and the community that has grown around it have brought incredible changes large and small to their lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much fun and education and inspiration Sorta Awesome has brought to the world so far, we know the potential is there to create even more fascinating, dynamic episodes for each of you on a weekly basis. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe\u0027re dreaming of listening more closely to the not-awesome in the lives of our listeners and bringing in respected experts and compassionate speakers to encourage you in those issues.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe\u0027re imagining extra content for our supporters that tackles topics we would never talk about for the general listening audience.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe\u0027re believing that with support from the Awesomes, Sorta Awesome will continue to bring the awesome on a weekly basis for a long time to come.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough there are many podcasts popping up everyday because the barrier to entry into this medium is low, the reality is that to create a top-notch podcast that provides a stellar listening experience, a carefully-curated community, and personalized response to listeners, the cost to produce the show grows as our audience grows. To create the kind of show that Awesomes find to be truly amazing, we must not only cover fees for hosting and online storage, but also recording equipment, editing software, and lots of other administrative costs to keep the show moving forward. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, we want to keep the support process super simple, so we are asking you to commit to $5 per month (roughly $1 per episode of Sorta Awesome) to ensure the future of this show and the Hangout community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur culture thrives on keeping us hooked on news of the un-awesome. Now more than ever, we need voices celebrating the good, the exciting, the comforting, the educational, and the inspirational! We at Sorta Awesome are honored to be the voices in your ears helping you find the awesome in the everyday. \u003cbr\u003e"
