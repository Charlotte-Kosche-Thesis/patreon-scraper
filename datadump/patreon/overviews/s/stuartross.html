    "summary": "I am a scientist in a laboratory of words. Since I was a little kid, I\u0027ve been a writer. When I was a teenager, I began teaching creative writing workshops. When I was twenty, I began publishing little chapbooks \u2014 or stapled pamphlets \u2014 of my writing, and soon I was also publishing works by other exciting writers. In my thirties, established literary presses began publishing books of my poetry, fiction, and personal essays. To date, I have nearly 20 books published, and perhaps three times as many chapbooks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring these decades of writing my own stuff, I have given tons to my communities \u2014 in Toronto, and later in Cobourg. I have mentored many beginning writers, organized reading series and book fairs, helped writers find homes for their manuscripts, run a poetry blog, and, for the past nine years, I have been sending out a free weekly emailing of Toronto literary events to many hundreds of subscribers. And I\u0027m always working on a new mag or a new chapbook of someone\u0027s work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a writer who believes in the pure adventure of writing. And I want my readers to have new adventures. Unexpected pleasures. Fresh experiences. And interesting stuff to think about when they finish reading something I\u0027ve written.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have explored many kinds of writing in my work, so there are heaps of surprises from book to book. My writing is, at different times, surreal, realist, autobiographical, absurdist, imagist, and lyric. Some of my stories have plots; some of them don\u0027t. Some of my poems are just one word long; some of them go on for twenty pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe life of a non-commercial writer is economically tenuous. Did you know that a writer\u0027s total royalties for a book of poetry might equal half a month\u0027s rent? I\u0027m not kidding. I\u0027m grateful for the modest payments I receive from publishers, and for the compensation I receive for the use of my works in Canadian libraries, and for the occasional arts grant I\u0027m fortunate enough to receive. But, to pay my rent and put veggie burgers on my table, I still work very hard as an editor of others\u0027 works, and as a writing instructor who offers workshops and one-on-one coaching.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, right now I have 14 different writing projects on the go. I know that\u0027s a bit crazy, but that\u0027s how I work. I\u0027m writing against the clock, because as I finish one manuscript, I often add another one or two new projects. Sometimes I don\u0027t pick up a particular project for two or three years, but they\u0027re all there, simmering on the wordstove. Right now, I am working on three solo poetry books, two collaborative poetry books, a collection of poetry for kids, four novels, a memoir, a short-story collection, a book about writing, and a top-secret project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping the funds I receive through Patreon will allow me to take less freelance work and concentrate more on completing my own manuscripts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been very fortunate in that every book manuscript I\u0027ve ever sent out has been published, even though I\u0027m a real weirdo writer! I sure am grateful that these wonderful publishers (six of them have published me!) have such faith in me. So what I\u0027m saying is, if you support my writing, you\u0027re supporting writing that will almost certainly get published.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I hope you \u003cem\u003ewill\u003c/em\u003e consider supporting my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for taking the time to read this.\u003cbr\u003e"
