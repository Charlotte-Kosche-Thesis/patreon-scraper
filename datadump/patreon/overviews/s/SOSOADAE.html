We use African dramatic form (ADF) as a lens for story development and the understanding of fiction as \u201croot\u201d to all things healing and meaningful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you plant a seed to heal a fiction, it not only begins the process of your renewal, it has the added effect of allowing SOSOADAE to take bigger risks that create greater, more meaningful change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was a child, thought that God had made me of the lowest human form, to be both Black and female. My identity as an aspiring writer was all about being a Black woman writing about some elevated thing in some way that was not commonly associated with being \u003cem\u003eBlack\u003c/em\u003e. My selling point was that I was \u003cem\u003eBlack\u003c/em\u003e and writing in this \u003cem\u003ewhatever\u003c/em\u003e style that altogether should have been interesting enough to make me and the rest of it worthy of publication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt took a few personal embarrassments for me to realize that if the reader can\u2019t see that you are \u003cem\u003eBlack\u003c/em\u003e by the story, can\u2019t grade where it fails and excels on that particular curve. The story, alone, becomes just another story in competition with every other writer telling a story, and your story will fail where it does and excel where it does.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStories are not about how well we say \u003cem\u003esomething\u003c/em\u003e. They are about what we have to say and how well we communicate \u003cem\u003ethat to an audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eIn SOSOADAE, there is no such thing as non-fiction. There is only fiction. There are fictions designed by documented events and fictions that are in Swahili called habari wa kubuniwa, \u003cem\u003enews of imagination\u003c/em\u003e, but all of various persuasive tactics and intent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSOSOADAE takes writing instruction back to the very basics of figurative story-making and community-centered design by using ADF to help writers develop (read, \u003cem\u003eimagine\u003c/em\u003e) authentic, empathetic, and healing fiction.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003ePlant a seed, grow a dream / Plant a seed, heal a fiction.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*\u003cem\u003eThe word \"soso adae\" comes from Akan Twi and means, \"to dream.\"\u003c/em\u003e"
