My family consists of my husband, Simon (49), and my daughter, Sienna (5), and me (41...I think!?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter eight years of building a company I felt burnt out. Instead of staying in a job I didn\u0027t like, I sold all our\u00a0possessions and purchased an eleven year old Oyster sailboat. Since we left, I\u0027ve been documenting our journey through articles and videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReaders and viewers benefit from the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eExplanations on how and why it\u0027s beneficial to sell up and sail away\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLearning from our mess-ups rather than making them yourself (we\u0027ve made many!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReduced fears associated with becoming a full or part-time cruiser - fears about sailing, homeschooling (our daughter was 3 1/2 when we left land), safety, the overwhelming amount of things to learn and much more.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVideos about popular marina\u0027s, anchorages and destinations so you know before you go\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMy sincere feelings about what it\u0027s like to drop out of the rat-race and live the dream...It\u0027s not all good but it\u0027s definitely fulfilling.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEasy to make recipes that work well on a sailboat!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTips, tricks and things that the salty sea dogs fail to tell anyone (Did you know that painting your prop with egg whites works just as well as using any expensive store bought solution?)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow often do we post?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver week we publish at least one video and one article on \u003ca href=\"https://SailingBritican.com\"\u003ehttps://SailingBritican.com\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon fit in?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an awesome website that allows people to support content creators. We\u0027re spending a small fortune keeping the boat serviced, maintained and repairing breakages. All our money goes into keeping Britican running. When it comes to making videos, there\u0027s a whole host of other costs and they add up. Just getting Internet to upload a video can cost quite a bit. And then there\u0027s the cost of camera\u0027s, software, data storage, hard drives, hosting fees, education, necessary apps and the list goes on. For as little as $1/month a patron can support someone like us to keep creating and making better articles and videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support Sailing Britican on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause we want you to be a part of our family. Over the years we\u0027ve discovered that there are people that like to watch us from a far and there are those that like to get more involved. Simon, Sienna and I are super passionate about sailing and the sailing lifestyle. We\u0027re eager to get more people out on the sea and we\u0027re happy to share with you everything we know and are learning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome people think that Patreon is a platform for beggars or people that need money to live. I see it as an environment where Patrons can help support an artist, or artists, grow and develop. I also see it as a place where people can get more involved with the artist and help not just financially but with advice, feedback and any other support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions, suggestions or advice for us, please email me at Kim@SailingBritican.com\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBig smiles,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKim, Simon \u0026amp; Sienna\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSailing Britican\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "In 1974, I was born in Rochester, New York were I went to school and University (Geneseo State). At the age of 22, I decided I needed a change of scenery. For a year I lived in Berkeley and Oakland working in San Fransisco.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the young age of 23, I went into an Irish bar and met my future husband, Simon Brown.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimon was doing a charity jail break for kids with Lukemia. He was a British prison officer that pretended to break out of his prison, Aylesbury, and get to Alcatraz in 24 hours. Simon and his team raised over \u00a330,000 for the charity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from raising money for charity, Simon also acquired a new girlfriend - me! Not long after our chance Irish bar meeting, I left San Francisco and moved to Aylesbury, England. We got married within a year and spent my life doing normal things. I worked at various jobs, enjoyed a lovely social life and became a British Limie.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my thirty\u0027s I stared a company, however it wasn\u0027t the right path for me. After eight years of hard work I felt that my life needed a new direction. Hubby felt the same. We had a baby in 2010 and that seemed to change our priorities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of wanting to climb the business ladder I felt more like being a mum!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimon and I decided to sell our house, car and possessions so to sail around with our, at the time, beautiful 3 1/2 year old, Sienna.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rest is history!",
