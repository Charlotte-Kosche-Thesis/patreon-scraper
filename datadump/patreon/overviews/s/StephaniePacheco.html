I post my freelance articles, explanations about the Catholic faith, my random epiphanies, book reviews, occasional thought-provoking pieces by other writers and explorations at local bookstores. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon, I would like to support and grow my blog so that I can develop a convivial online community of readers who interact with each other and me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to add features like direct email-sign up and free e-books for download. To do this however, I need my own url and server space, which cost a good deal more than the free site that I run now. With funding, I could do this and also help support my family, since I am a stay-at-home-mom and writing is my only gig. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ask for monthly patronage rather than per post because sometimes I post a whole bunch, and I don\u0027t want anyone to be surprised by the charges. Also, please only support me if you can. If you can\u0027t, that\u0027s okay. I don\u0027t want to run anyone into the ground. Only you know your own situation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, a disclaimer: your patronage is an appreciated donation. It is not a guarantee of content or of pleasing content. If you are ever unsatisfied, feel free to end support as soon as possible. I cannot be held responsible for dissatisfaction with my posts. That being said, I will always aim for high standards in my work, and I usually post about once a week.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
