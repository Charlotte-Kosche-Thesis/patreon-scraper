So I graduated with a degree in Drama, but aside from that, my true passion is all things geeky! Along with gaming, voice acting and video editing, cosplaying is one of my favourite hobbies, something I hope to make my career one day. I absolutely love anime, gaming and animations and revolve myself around factitious characters almost all day! My dream is to one day be able to cosplay as characters that I\u0027ve voiced over... Wouldn\u0027t that be something? I hope you guys can join me along on my journey and help me change a dream into a reality. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2 style=\"color: #cc66ff;\"\u003eTHIS IS MY JOURNEY\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started cosplaying about five years ago\u00a0after finding out that there are actually cosplayers here in South Africa! I went to my first convention in a very badly made Erza Scarlet from Fairy Tail and since then my love for Cosplay has exponentially grown... and so has my skill! I believe that you never really stop learning, and as quiet a young cosplayer, I still have many skills to learn and equally as much \"growth\" to be had! I hope you Kings and Queens will join me as I discover the far reaches of my abilities and keep pushing myself in this beautiful art we call cosplay. Thank you for the ever-growing support!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"color: #cc66ff;\"\u003eSOME OF MY OLDER WORK\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1I1voWo.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"color: #cc66ff;\"\u003eMY OTHER PLATFORMS\u003c/h3\u003eFacebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/ScarletQueenCosplay/\u003cbr\u003eInstagram:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/scarlet_queen/\u003cbr\u003eYouTube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/user/DiViNeInSanEneSS/featured?view_as=subscriber"
