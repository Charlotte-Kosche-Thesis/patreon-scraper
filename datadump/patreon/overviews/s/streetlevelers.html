It has evolved and developed to become a full story connected to approximately 5 arcs, but has the potential to continue further passed the originally planned story, and plenty of space for side arcs.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always been heavily inspired by traditional superhero comics such as Teen Titans (my favorite), The Avengers, X-men, Static Shock, ect... \u003cbr\u003eI wanted to create a superhero series of my own that could focus on the progression of Heroes from their humble beginnings. Hence, the name \u003cem\u003eStreet Levelers, \u003c/em\u003ewhich is known to be the lowest level of Hero.\u003cbr\u003eI was also heavily inspired by many action animes and shonens to push the envelope of the norms, and accelerate the threat in fights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the art like?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy art style has been very much inspired from anime, and it shows quite prominently. However, I do have more of a less-detailed, more cartoonish approach to drawing characters. And while colored comics is the more American approach, I\u0027ve found comfort and less time wasted by drawing in black and white, manga style.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had artists come and go from this comic, and am always looking for new talent to hop on board this project. As of right now, the team is quite small!\u003cbr\u003eArtists who have drawn chapters:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSoco:\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0https://twitter.com/spookysoco\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eChocolatechip:\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/chocolatechip.rocketship/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAlkinz:\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0https://www.fiverr.com/alkinz\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best reason to donate is because you genuinely enjoy the comic and want to see it continue. The fact of the matter is, money and time is invested into a comic to make it as decent as possible. If I lose money, I lose time, and I lose my ability to continue the comic. It\u0027s sad, but that\u0027s how it goes.\u003cbr\u003eBut of course, putting money into the patreon will also grant you many privileges! You\u0027ll have access to art I won\u0027t post anywhere else, and even private videos going more into depth about characters.\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to go even higher with your donations, you can request reaction videos or have a personal art piece made just for you with my signature!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless whether or not you\u0027ve decided to donate, thank you for reading and considering your support for my webcomic.\u003cbr\u003eI hope you read my comic and become a future fan. :)"
