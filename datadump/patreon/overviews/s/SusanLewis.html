You\u0027ll remember them and isn\u0027t that what a good story is supposed to do? Change you, stay with you, and add something to your life that you never had before and didn\u0027t know you were lacking?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI worked with criminals for many years as a volunteer. I really do have a ton of stories to tell and before you start to think I\u0027m a bleeding heart - stop it. Far from it. How I ended up doing it IS part of the book and it\u0027s been a long, strange trip.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFortunately, or unfortunately (as the case may be), I had one hell of a good time and it also broke my heart. After this story comes the one about my work in Juvenile Hall. The time there still haunts me but also showed me that no matter what situation a person finds themselves in, an outstretched hand is a life saver. Makes me smile to remember those kids.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want you to hear these stories, talk to me if you want, and feel better about people in general. I want you to read the stories and smile and for a moment, understand another person a bit better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s a journey and I am a prolific writer and I\u2019d like to have you along for the ride. I think that would be great and I\u2019d like to know that what I\u2019m saying to the great cosmic universe is making a difference. Maybe it is or maybe it isn\u2019t, but I\u2019m sticking with my story that it is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
