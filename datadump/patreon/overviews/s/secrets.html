So it\u0027s about RPG gaming, storytelling and character creation in a tabletop setting. Most of the advice you will read here and on my blog can be applied to most contemporary RPGs, because they tackle city creation, new technologies, character creation and how to think about character drama.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what you\u0027ve read of me before, if you\u0027re interested, please consider subscribing for extra content, premium access and other things!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBeware!\u003c/strong\u003e Cat pictures might happen, as well as controversial topics. \u003cbr\u003eAfter all, we are talking about vampires, in a gruesome world, full of monsters, , so there may be discussions about abuse, power, racial , religious and gender issues and other things. I will approach those in an adult and informed way as much as I can, as a tool for us to enjoy a deeper, more interesting game experience, but I do not endorse any hateful speech.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy subscribe?
