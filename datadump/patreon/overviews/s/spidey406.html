    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px; text-align: justify;\"\u003eHello, my name is Arturo. I am the\ncreator of all the animations you see in my channel. In 10 years I\u0027ve\nmade 1 hour and 30 minutes of animations. And generated over 18\nmillion views. I created all these animations on my own. If I was able\nto do all this on my own, imagine then what I could accomplish with\nyour help? \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThis is the point of my Patreon page.\nI can only get so far on my own. You guys can single-handedly super\ncharge my channel by supporting my content financially. Now you might\nbe saying. What could one viewer do? One dollar may not seem like\nmuch, but if all of you gave one dollar, then that would be a huge\nhelp. The greatest part is that you can already see what I am capable\nof. You have seen the quality of my videos grow with every new\nanimation. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\tIf you give you\u0027ll also get back some\nrewards. You\u0027ll see my content before everyone else on YouTube.\nYou\u0027ll have access to exclusive tutorials and behind the scenes\nstuff. You can even get your name in the credits on one of my future\nanimations. Or, you can get custom animations with your name as well,\nlike the logos and titles I create for my own animations. You can\neven get a custom animation of whatever you want. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\tAlso, it is important to note, that\nyou are not paying for every single video I take out on my YouTube\nchannel. You will only pay for my Computer Animations or Stop Motion\nAnimations with their typical 2 to 5 minute length. And as you all\nknow, these take a long time to create. So you won\u0027t be paying very\noften. Moreover, you\u0027ll only get charged when I deliver the content.\nIt\u0027s that simple! So I ask you to imagine the possibilities. Imagine\nwhat we can create together. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
