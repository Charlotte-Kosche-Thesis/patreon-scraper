    "summary": "I make games. I have a laser and I use it in a home office. I do everything from design to production and distribution, coming up with new ideas and crafting them myself with no one in the middle.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a strange thing, making tabletop games without going through a production company, a marketing agency, a distributor, a fulfillment service, and a \"brick and mortar\" storefront. For better or worse, I do all of that. I come up with a game idea, test it at places like Philly Dev Night, design components on my computer, list completed games on my own website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.spriteborne.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSpriteborne.com\u003c/a\u003e, craft everything with my laser, pack everything up, and personally deliver the finished product to the post office so it can make its way to you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a lot of work, but it means I don\u0027t have to wait for the approval of some company to make what I want to make. The only approval I really need is yours.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoing things this way leaves me vulnerable to the ebb and flow of sales, which is tough. Some months I\u0027ll do well online or show well at a convention, other months I\u0027ll barely sell anything. This makes it hard to pay the bills with any sort of regularity. Crafting, be it for games, glassware, or anything else I can make with a laser, is my full-time gig and even then it never feels like I have enough time for everything I want or need to do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. If you like what I do, if you\u0027re interested in getting an inside look into how all of this works, or if you simply want to support me as a human being, that\u0027s what this Patreon is for. Your support would help me get away from being at the mercy of a good or bad sales month. In exchange, I\u0027ll keep you well informed about what\u0027s happening behind the scenes here at Spriteborne and how it\u0027s all going. You\u0027ll get the details about what I\u0027m working on, you\u0027ll see projects before they\u0027re unveiled to the general public, and you\u0027ll get to know about all of the things that may not ever actually see the light of day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking something means little without an audience. Can I count on you to be part of mine?\u003cbr\u003e"
