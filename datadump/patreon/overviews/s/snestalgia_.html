This Channel is going to cover everything Gaming: Reviews, Discussions, News, Tech Reviews etc. As you may have guessed by my name I really like The Super Nintendo, well you\u0027re right, the Super Nintendo is my favorite video game console! If you stick around long enough, I\u0027m sure you will find something that you like. I love making content, and I think I\u0027m a very creative person. I just don\u0027t have much time to do so with a full time job. Plus after making some poor financial decisions I don\u0027t really have the resources. I believe that this will help me to be able to make better content for you, and be able to get better equipment so that you will have a better experience. This is where you come in! It will never be a requirement to donate, but any donation will be greatly appreciated and won\u0027t go unnoticed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will my pledge go toward?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny donation made will go directly into the channel, (\u00a0paying for any props, equipment, editing time ). If you do decide to help me, like I said, it won\u0027t go unnoticed. I hope you will take this decision into consideration!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour friend in time,\u003cbr\u003eTaylor"
