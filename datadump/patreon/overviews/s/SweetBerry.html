    "summary": "I am the main writer on a interactive story project called Sweet Berry: Perversions, based on an original IP done by me, based on discussions with a friend who formerly did writing within the IP. The artwork is currently going to be worked on solely by a very generous friend of mine named Re-Maker. What this Patreon allows is for me to rely less and less on my own funds and personal time for creating new material.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Sweet Berry?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn a parallel future, A burgeoning all-ages franchise is exported from Japan, starring and helmed by the enigmatic \u0027Sweet\u0027 Berry, a pink-haired girl who promotes friendship and togetherness. At the same time, a set of laws passed in order to effectively render paedophilia extinct, by teaching sexuality to girls in their early teens. What no-one expected was that \u0027Sweet\u0027 Berry seemed to be almost waiting for those laws to pass, as she wormed her way into the minds of her fans, creating a generation of girls who felt that exploring D/s and bondage play with other girls was right.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Sweet Berry?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSweet Berry is a faux-lolita girl of apparently around 16-18 years old, who is actually millenia old, who is nicknamed by one of her long-term victims \"The Red-Eyed Mistress Of Desires\". When a girl is on the cusp of 18 in her world, she appears to them as her real self, the first time they\u0027ll remember seeing her as such, and takes them into her realm to find completion in themselves within an endless adult fantasy, their desires enslaved by Berry.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does this have to do with the Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe various narratives in the adventure game will be, using various characters from numerous media, the enslavement of their desires to Berry, as their mortal form is trapped within Berry\u0027s realm. When a narrative arc is finished, the Patreon users will be given a chance to choose which path out of the many on offer will be \u0027correct\u0027. When a character has no paths left to map, the same users will get to choose which path is considered as canonical for that character.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAm I allowed to write stories in the Sweet Berry universe myself?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSure! Just try to use original characters, except if you have an idea for how one of the \u0027captive\u0027 characters within a narrative could have got there, or you wish to use a franchise I haven\u0027t.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does my money buy me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, among other things, versions of the art done for me by ReMaker that aren\u0027t on deviantART. Other things include stories written within the Sweet Berry universe, as well as the game itself, when it\u0027s done.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will the game be finished?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e...Don\u0027t ask me that, I don\u0027t even know. Even if I kept to just the girls listed, I could be at it until the day I die of old age. I do not have unlimited time to work on this, but I will say this. There will be playable builds posting at least bi-monthly once I have completed the numerous revisions needed to just make a playable alpha.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you profiting off this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e(Checks my empty Paypal) Nope.
