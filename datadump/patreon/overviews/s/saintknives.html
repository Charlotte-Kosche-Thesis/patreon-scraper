    "summary": "Hello, potential Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Saint Knives. I am an artist of many trades, but my passion first and foremost since I was a young child has been writing. I have been writing short stories since primary school, and then began getting poetry published in local newspapers and compilations when I turned 14. After a long stretch of time in my life where I somewhat abandoned writing in favour of music, I fell back in love with poetry shortly after realising that I was ready to transition and fully embrace my womanhood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy career has certainly picked up since then. After self-publishing a well-rated but quietly received chapbook in 2015 by the name of \u003cem\u003eChinese Art and American Girls\u003c/em\u003e, I used the experience to get a feel for what the industry was like. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn April of 2017, I self-published my first full-length poetry book, \u003cem\u003eLa Mer\u003c/em\u003e on the Amazon Kindle Store, with a paperback edition following in August. \u003cem\u003eLa Mer\u003c/em\u003e debuted as the number one new release in Gay \u0026amp; Lesbian Poetry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn September of 2017, I self-published \u003cem\u003eI Wish I Was Dead\u003c/em\u003e, also on Amazon. This collection peaked at number two in the same category.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese two works allowed me to gain enough attention to land a one book contract with BlackGold Publishing, with the option to possibly get signed for more in the future. My first professionally published book, titled \u003cem\u003eLook at Us Shake the Sky, \u003c/em\u003ewill be released in stores and online retailers in April of 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, as successful as I have been, considering, poetry is not a particularly well paying art, especially for a black trans person. I have bills and legal obligations that I must take care of, and that\u0027s where you, hopefully, come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am disabled, however I am fighting with Social Security so that I can try to be granted SSI. Another issue is that most employers simply do not want to employ a trans person, especially when race is factored in as well. I want to keep writing and bringing joy to people, but that\u0027s so difficult when I spend every day wondering when my next meal is going to come to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a list of all of my current and near-future monthly expenses:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRent - 600\u003cbr\u003ePhone - 110\u003cbr\u003eFood - 50\u003cbr\u003eEmergency - 200\u003cbr\u003eTravel - 100\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat brings the total to $1060 monthly that I need to account for, and I currently have no real income that I can count on. I have had mixed experiences with crowdfunding via Paypal sharing and GoFundMe, so here\u0027s hoping that this will prove more fruitful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will get access to monthly status updates on what I\u0027m doing (book progress, bookings for readings, other artistic pursuits) as well as early looks at work I am writing and other things about my life and creative process that you won\u0027t see anywhere else."
