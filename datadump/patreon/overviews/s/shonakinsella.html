    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m \u003ca href=\"https://shonakinsella.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eShona Kinsella\u003c/a\u003e and I\u0027m a writer. My debut novel, \u003ca href=\"https://unbound.com/books/ashael-rising\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAshael Rising\u003c/a\u003e, is being published by Unbound and is expected out Spring 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014,\u00a0I took a career break from my day job to care for my children. I decided to turn my hand to writing while I had a little time and very soon I was lost. I love writing. Whatever happens now, I will continue to write for as long as I possibly can. I had expected a very long slog before ever seeing my work in print but my story is quite unusual; the first draft of my first novel was accepted for publication by Unbound. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few months ago, I was given the opportunity to volunteer to leave my day job for good. Pregnant with our third child and about to have my first novel published, I took that opportunity. I am incredibly fortunate that I was able to do so. At the moment, I\u0027m writing full time, while also looking after my children full time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to be able to spend more time writing and doing other associated things like attending writers conferences etc. but the majority of my day is spent caring for my children with writing squeezed into little odd corners of time or the evenings, after my husband has come home from work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently working on the sequel to Ashael Rising but I also love short-form fiction. I love the different skills and stories involved and I have ideas bouncing all over the inside of my skull. I have been sharing some flash fiction on my blog for free but with very limited writing time, I really need to focus on work that will bring some pay. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReceiving some income from Patreon will allow me to\u00a0continue to spend time on\u00a0short form fiction as well as helping to free up some of my time, allowing me to be more productive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatronage of the arts is not a new concept - Charles Dickens would carry his work in progress around pubs in London and read sections out to the customers. If they liked it and wanted to read more, they paid him, allowing him the time to continue writing the stories. Can you imagine the depth of works that we would have lost without those patrons? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I don\u0027t compare my own work to that of Charles Dickens, I do think patronage is a great model. It creates a link between the patron, the artist and art. It gives you control over art, something you don\u0027t have when we are all beholden to big publishers whose main concern is their bottom line. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have enjoyed my work and want to read more of it, then your patronage will be hugely appreciated. If you have any questions, please don\u0027t hesitate to get in touch."
