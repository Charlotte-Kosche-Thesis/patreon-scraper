I make art of many varying subjects, made in all sorts of different mediums. I mostly create illlustrations, but I am trying to focus more on plush making. The main issue is, of course, the cost of materials. But there are also many mediums that I have not had the opportunity to try, or improve my skills in, mostly due to financial issues. Things like music, painting, prop making, and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\nBy supporting me, you will be giving me the opportunity to work harder on my art, especially on things like sculptures, plushies, and clothing.
