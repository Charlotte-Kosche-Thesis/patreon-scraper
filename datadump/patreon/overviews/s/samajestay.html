    "summary": "Hello everyone, my name is Sam.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a French gaming enthusiast and I have been playing videogames ever since my grandpa gifted me a Game Boy Color when I was 6. Now that I am over 20, I mostly play on a PC that I built myself and wish to keep up to date hardware wise. This is one of the many reasons I decided to start this patreon. The goal of this page is to somehow support this hobby that a lot of us share and help me develop my content further than my current means allow me to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of you know me for my Guild Wars 2 content. Despite the content droughts and desperate times, I have stuck to this game that I love and have constantly tried to produce content that would appeal to my viewerbase, be it through YouTube or Twitch. I have been part of that scene for about 3 years now and while I have always been an average, medium effort content maker, I wish to go further with that and eventually become good at this hobby of mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy content is directly influenced by what motivates me and what I like. I am a Finance person at heart and have been working in that field for 2 years now. I can say that I love it and it can be felt in the videos I make about the economy, trading and in general money making. Of course, more diversified content will be happening, including on other games, but the main purpose of my channel has always been Guild Wars 2 Economy :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinancial help will go to building a better PC, getting a N3DS capture card and financing my other hardware (mice, keyboards, mic, etc...). These are expenditures I have so far covered by myself, implying I could keep doing it, however help would mean buying better components, instead of always settling for compromises.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I can offer in return is relatively simple. As my content mostly focuses on information about Guild Wars 2, a head-start on trading videos is a given. As a patron you also get more luck in giveaways I organize on YouTube. Finally, pledging to me means you are part of a community I want to nurture and grow. Your opinion will directly influence the content and you can find pride in being part of a team effort towards making this channel even better than it is today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince as of late August 2017,\u00a0I, as a\u00a0Content Creator, am\u00a0now partnered with ArenaNet. This means that I receive sponsorship from them, and in return try to further improve the content I make with them in mind. What that means for you, the patron, is that you are automatically entered in a monthly giveaway of gems. Contact me on discord for more information on how this is held!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that despite being partnered, my word is not that of the studio. My opinions are mine only and do not represent ArenaNet in the least.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you still wish to support me, go ahead and pledge and I will do my best to meet your expectations :) All of you remain equal, however much you might pledge and whether you want to keep it up or not. You can access the full posts with just a dollar and I would like to keep it that way, so that pledges mean you care about what I do!\u003cbr\u003e"
