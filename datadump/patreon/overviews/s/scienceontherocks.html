The profound health benefits brought about by this unique combination of breathing techniques, cold exposure, and mental focus are now featured in scientific publications such as Biology textbooks and peer-reviewed journals. More than a hundred thousand people around the globe are practicing Wim\u2019s techniques, and science is increasingly picking up on this topic, too. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThis podcast is for you if you\u2019re hungry to learn more about the scientific facts behind the Wim Hof Method from an educated source you can trust.

The manifold positive effects we experienced in ourselves when we picked up the Wim Hof Method made us curious to seek answers to the many questions that popped up in our heads. Seeing that there is a great hunger for solid and well-organized information from trusted sources across the Wim Hof community we heard our calling and the idea for \u201eScience on the Rocks\u201c was born.\u003cbr\u003eOur mission in this podcast is to sniff out and digest scientific evidence related to all aspects of the Wim Hof Method and to present them to you, our audience, in a fun, intelligible and compact format.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support us?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s true: we love researching the hard facts and creating content for Science on the Rocks!
