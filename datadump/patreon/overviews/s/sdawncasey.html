    "summary": "Music changes people\u0027s lives. I currently work on that positive life change by teaching children and adults piano, recorder, and harp lessons. Most of my in-person students are homeschooled, with their large families living on one income. Knowing this, I offer highly discounted group lessons, usually ending up as less than $10 an hour for quality music instruction. Some kids can\u0027t afford that, and pay half the tuition. Some are in my class for almost-free, paying as they are able.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t make a lot of money with my classes. The money I do make goes for all the paper and supplies I use in my classes. Since \"making new musicians and using music to change lives\" is my goal--not earning piles of money-- I don\u0027t earn a lot of money from teaching! I have watched the therapeutic effects of playing music first hand in children as young as four and in people older than myself. I want to continue, and expand what I do: offering quality music lessons to anyone, whether they can afford it or not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I do need to make enough money to pay for something: College! I currently have my Associate\u0027s Degree, with my course of study having been Music and Accounting. I desire to become a board certified Music Therapist, with my B.A. being in Music: Harp Performance and my minor being Psychology.\u00a0I have more than 110 credits already, but need 50 more credits (in psychology, and some higher level music theory classes) in order to graduate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to pay cash for things and avoid going into debt. To continue following this plan, I would have to pay for college without taking out any loans!\u00a0Therefore, I figured I\u0027d ask The Internet to help me out. Even $1 a month is helpful, useful, and greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e"
