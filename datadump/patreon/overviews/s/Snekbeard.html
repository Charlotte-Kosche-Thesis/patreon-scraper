The thing I take away from that is that I like making things. The trouble is I\u0027m terrible with my hands, but I am pretty good with a computer.\u003cbr\u003eI love that Patreon allows people like me to focus on what we love to do rather than trying to fit into some little box and grinding away at life to get to the next month.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a freelance video creator for a few years now and I realise more and more that I would rather be doing this: making things for people who really appreciate it. So if you decide to support me in my ridiculous adventure, thank you. Thank you so much for being the kind of person that wants to see people succeed in something they love. You are the best at being human.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will not ask for money for everything I create but many things will be put up here and here alone. Anything big or ambitious is going to need your support obviously (That\u0027s why we\u0027re here) and I appreciate anyone willing to give any amount for anything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will endeavour always to make things worthwhile for you, from videos to writings to more ambitious projects and beyond. The only thing I know I have to do is make things and your support in that venture means the entire world to me."
