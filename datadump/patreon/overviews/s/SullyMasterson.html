Well let me\u00a0 tell you some thangs!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a writer by day, acting student by night.I happily enjoy crime shows, Law \u0026amp; Order SVU being my favorite. Pre-Stabler departure only. I tend\u00a0write out my character bios on note cards and stick them on my wall because it helps de-clutter my brain when there are too many characters fussing about in there. It\u0027s my unfulfilled ambition to own a\u00a0Savannah cat someday! (check them out, they\u0027re awesome!) And, I\u0027m a night owl constantly stretching my imagination to see what kind of stories I can come up with. An avid learner from life experiences. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t worry, I\u0027ve got a bit of an education of the formal type as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born in Missouri, but I\u0027ve been fortunate enough to travel to places all over the United States, Japan, and Aruba which only furthered the coloring of my imagination as a creative individual. I started writing at a young age, and despite my quiet demeanor, I\u0027ve always had a thing for romance. As I got older and experienced all the pleasures and heartaches of love and lust, my writing evolved giving it a solid, much more rounded, complicated feel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe erotic nature of my writing comes from a few places. What I take in from lovers past and present, the awareness from my surroundings, and the constant musings and inquiries from my own ideas on the subject. No matter how imaginative the story, there\u0027s always a little bit of me in there as that\u0027s the first person I\u0027m writing for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m a self-published author in every sense of the word.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf that isn\u0027t enough information, being a self-published author can be taxing on one\u0027s financial situation. I love what I do, don\u0027t ever doubt that, but in order to be able to write the way I want, and put out the content the way I want, I must look to you, the ones I want to give my best to. With the help that you give, it allows me the ability to continue working my imagination, create wonderful stories, and put food on my table!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think Patreon is also a way to show that you\u0027re ready for a higher caliber of work. People already appreciate what I do, but the sky\u0027s the limit when you have the backing. One of my biggest obstacles as an independent writer is the ability to market to a broader audience.\u00a0My first book, \u0027In Her Own Time\u0027 was completely on my own, except for the cover. I can only go so far by myself to get the word out about my book. But, with the help and support from you, it not only allows me to build on my humble audience, but create more! Most importantly, I\u0027m wanting to share my creative work with YOU! Knowing you\u0027d be a patron of my patreon,(see what I did there?) means that I\u2019m able to continue to grow as an artist and share all of my creative energy with you. Maintaining social media, producing new content, and putting the finishing touches on all the projects in Sully Masterson\u2019s universe which are largely impacted by you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThings I Offer to you!!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m doing different tier levels because, as stated earlier, as much as I write for myself, I want you involved!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwitter/FB Shout out:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eJust for showing your support, I\u0027d love to tell the world about you! Because you have no idea what it means to me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEarly Access:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m always working to get things out earlier.
