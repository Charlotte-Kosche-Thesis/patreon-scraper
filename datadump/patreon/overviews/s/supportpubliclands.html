I originally intended to hike several long trails in the south and eastern United States, but repeated threats to public lands in the west derailed those plans.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://hikingtrailsforamerica.org/access-to-public-lands-is-one-of-the-few-remaining-democratic-institutions-we-have-in-the-united-states-says-public-lands-advocate-michelle-markel-super-classy/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOur long trails are only safe as long as the land beneath them is protected.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring my travels, I\u2019ve met up with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.neorenbohemienne.com/public-lands-project-2017/public-lands/locals/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elocal adventurers\u003c/a\u003e to discover some of their favorite recreation spots and activities, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.neorenbohemienne.com/public-lands-project-2017/public-lands/partner-associations/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enon-profits\u003c/a\u003e dedicated to the outdoors, whether specific places, or with the mission to get more people out into our wild places. Additionally, I learned that the outdoor recreation industry contributes nearly $900 BILLION of mostly sustainable dollars to our national economy EACH year, so I began profiling\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.neorenbohemienne.com/public-lands-project-2017/public-lands/businesses/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebusinesses\u003c/a\u003e whose revenue primarily depends on our continued open access to public lands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhile I didn\u2019t get to hike much in 2017, I plan to remedy that in 2018 to coincide with the 50th Anniversary of the National Trails System Act of 1968. I\u2019ll be spending most of the year on foot, approximately 7,000 miles thru-hiking the Florida, Appalachian, and Continental Divide National Scenic Trails, as well as the Pinhoti National Recreation Trail.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.neorenbohemienne.com/journal/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI\u2019m going to keep spreading the word\u003c/a\u003e about the importance of preserving and protecting our public lands, but in \u201818 it\u2019s going to be from the ground, almost a solid year of trail time. I\u2019m excited to share with you the beauty of so many more of our public lands, but this time, at an average pace of around 3 miles per hour. Hikers hike!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY are you doing this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nThe short answer: My time on public lands has unquestionably changed my life for the better. I\u2019m stronger, more resourceful, more creative, and more capable, among other gains, as a result of thousands of trail miles and countless days and nights spent in the outdoors in just the last five years. I believe strongly in the importance of keeping our public lands open and available to any and all individuals who also wish to benefit from time spent there.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe long answer: Wallace Stegner said that \u201c[n]ational parks are the best idea we ever had,\u201d but without the concept of public lands, our National Parks system wouldn\u2019t exist, and public lands are frequently at risk due to special interests and the prevailing political climate. However, public lands are a non-partisan part of the American heritage that are truly democratic: they are open to all, and they do not care what gender, color, or ethnicity you are. They don\u0027t differentiate or discriminate based on religious beliefs, socioeconomic status, or sexual orientation. The beauty they offer is equally available to each of us.\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately, forests, mountains, deserts, lakes, and rivers don\u2019t have voices or millions of dollars to pay lobbyists to advocate for their own survival. I\u2019m concerned about the escalating number of threats and risks to the sanctity and stability of our public lands and our ongoing open access to them that have arisen recently. As public landowners, we are responsible for ensuring they remain intact, and awareness of how vital they are to so many people in so many ways can be an effective strategy to motivate advocacy for them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy hope is that by capturing and documenting some of the beauty, wonders, and opportunities that abound in our public lands, and spotlighting the broad diversity of people who already live, work, and recreate on them, more people will get outdoors and into our wild and natural spaces, or at least be moved to actively advocate for their preservation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho ARE you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nHi! My name is Michelle Markel. On trail, it\u0027s SuperClassy\u2026 my primary activity on public lands is long-distance hiking. If you follow me long enough, you\u2019ll understand that my trail name is mostly ironic, but I do like to pack out wine when I can, and I almost always hike in a dress.\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve always loved the outdoors, but when I became an adult, I was rarely able to get off the couch, too exhausted from adulting. In 2012, I set for myself the goal of hiking at least 100 miles. Since then, I haven\u2019t looked back, and although I stopped keeping track in 2014, I estimate that I\u2019ve hiked around 4,000 trail miles over countless days and nights, including the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail in 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\nI volunteered as a Fire Lookout on the San Bernardino National Forest in Southern California during the 2014 season, and since finishing the PCT in 2015 I\u0027ve been a full-time adventurer, spending most of 2016 exploring Ecuador and Peru, including hiking the Quilotoa Loop.\u003cbr\u003e\nThru-hiking is essentially a selfish venture. While undoubtedly I am a better person for it, this project is my attempt to give back in some small way - my love letter to the outdoor spaces that are open for all of us to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccess to the website and all the info in will always be free, just as I believe our access to public lands should be. However, the costs associated with producing all of the content on the site are considerable. I appreciate your support of both the project, and my mission to protect and preserve our public lands via increasing awareness of and advocacy for them by becoming a monthly patron!"
