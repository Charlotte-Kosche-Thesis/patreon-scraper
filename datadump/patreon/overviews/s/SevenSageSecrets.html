Consider: How much is actual prediction of the \"wave form\" (as Muad\u0027Dib referred to his vision-image) and how much is the prophet shaping the future to fit the prophecy? What of the harmonics inherent in the act of prophecy? Does the prophet see the future or does he see a line of weakness, a fault or cleavage that he may shatter with words or decisions as a diamond-cutter shatters his gem with a blow of a knife?\"\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cem\u003e\n\t- Frank Herbert, Dune\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/em\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\tWe can believe in a beautiful future or an ugly one and our beliefs shape the paths forward we can see. People only take purposeful steps down the paths they see. I can see a path to the future we want in clear detail through the lens of history. If I can share that detailed vision... if I can show real, direct and meaningful steps that can be taken... and we all see it, perhaps we will begin to walk it and make real the \"magic\" of prophecy together.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWHO IS SHIVA MEUCCI?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\tI\u0027m a former software engineer who has spent the past decade researching the history of theoretical physics, neuroscience and the deterministic physical crossovers between them. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThroughout the history of physics, I found how interpretation taints the data. I found that all the magical effects reported were entirely interpretation and we were not being told about valid and more rational interpretations that better fit the data without changing the maths.
