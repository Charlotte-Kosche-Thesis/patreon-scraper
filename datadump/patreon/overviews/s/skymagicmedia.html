I love what I do and it\u0027s so rewarding to be able to contribute something positive to so many people around the world. I\u0027ve been interested in weather since I was young, but instead of forecasting, my passion has been to get out and experience it, combining the most beautiful and dramatic scenes with the diverse and scenic backdrop of New England.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery photoshoot has a story behind it, more than can be captured in a tweet or an Instagram post. The Patreon platform is the perfect home for SkyMagic Media because I get to work directly for you and take you along on my journey. Together, we\u0027ll explore new places, cover more dynamic events, and continue on the pursuit of skymagic.
