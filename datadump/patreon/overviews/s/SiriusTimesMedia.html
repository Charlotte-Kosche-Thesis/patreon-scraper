    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eGreetings Family! \u003c/strong\u003eAs some of you may be aware, we\u0027ve been around creating, collaborating, and marketing black consciousness videos to the community over the last 20 years. From VHS tapes, to DVDs, to streaming files, we\u0027ve had to adapt and change with the times. For the last couple of years we\u0027ve been uploading and sharing our videos, and they have been well received by the many subscribers to our four YouTube channels. Without question, the biggest draw on our channels has been the noted eschatologist and lecturer, \u003cstrong\u003eBobby Hemmitt\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBobby was prolific, and presented literally hundreds of lectures from 1996 through 2011, when he basically retired from the lecture circuit. We began our collaboration with Bobby in 1998 when we began to produce lectures (in Atlanta) with Bobby and coordinating the marketing of his videos (and many others). Then in 2000, after we co-produced the \u003cstrong\u003eGathering of the Masters Conference\u003c/strong\u003e in Atlanta in collaboration with Cultural Communications, we began our web site \u003cstrong\u003eSiriusTimes.com\u003c/strong\u003e and publishing the\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSirius Times Journal for Evolving Consciousness\u003c/strong\u003e newsletter and catalog.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn 2013, Bobby suffered a stroke.\u003c/strong\u003e Although he has recovered much of his ability to speak, he still has mobility issues and other issues that have so far prevented him from resuming his public speaking. When we started our YouTube channels we made sure that Bobby was taken care of from the ad revenue we received monthly. Recent changes at YouTube, however, have caused our ad revenue to dip sharply, affecting our ability to help Bobby. So we are starting this patron-only page on Patreon to give our many subscribers, and \u003cstrong\u003eBobby Hemmitt supporters and fans\u003c/strong\u003e, a way to help us and Bobby directly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we will continue to upload videos to YouTube, our patrons will get early access to the videos by as much as a week. These videos will include all of the various scholars and lecturers you can find now on our YouTube channels and even more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the remainder of the dozens of Bobby Hemmitt videos we have yet to share \u003cstrong\u003ewill only be available in their entirety to patrons who contribute at the Gold level or higher\u003c/strong\u003e. We will still publish the first hour or so of the lectures to YouTube, to promote \u003cem\u003eThe Sirius Times Archive\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0on \u003cem\u003ePatreon\u003c/em\u003e and hopefully to turn more of our subscribers into patrons. We appreciate all of you who support our work to make this information available. But only the Gold level patrons will have access to the \u003cstrong\u003efull version\u003c/strong\u003e of the Bobby Hemmitt lecture videos we upload.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to ultimately share as many of the videos in our catalog as we can and make them available to all of our supporters and patrons who appreciate the value of information and connection to our history and culture. Your support is vital to our ability to continue to provide this service. So, we urge you to become a monthly patron of the \u003cstrong\u003eSirius Times Video Archive\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0so that we can continue to share our catalog of videos with the community and continue to support \u003cstrong\u003eBobby Hemmitt\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe invite you to still take advantage of the hundreds of hours of free video content we have already uploaded on our four You Tube channels here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/siriustimesmedia\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSirius Times Media TV\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRor0nkC7chc7W1xX0krYbg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDJED TV - Hidden Wisdom\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSTpKlpw-V5O6oe932jlLxw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTAOS TV - The Ark of Sothis\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/tv108theblackside\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTV108 - The Black Side\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can browse our complete current catalog of videos on our web site at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://siriustimes.com/estore\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSiriusTimes.com\u003c/a\u003e.
