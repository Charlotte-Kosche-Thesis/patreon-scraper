    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003eGood strategy is like a loaded gun.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGuns are inherently dangerous: They can take a life or save a life. They can cause a fight or prevent one. They can incite a war or encourage peace. Like a loaded gun, good strategy is both powerful and dangerous. And in the right hands at the right time, strategy makes any number of outcomes possible, no matter how unlikely.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThose who live life strategically succeed. They choose the right careers, they make the right financial decisions, they marry the right spouse, and they beat their competition. Strategic thinkers breed confidence, action, and results. They evoke those qualities in the people around them. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nStrategy is more than the right point-solution for a specific problem, it\u2019s a process. Sound strategy should drive our decisions - how we spend our finite resources, time \u0026amp; energy. Strategy is something we should always have in our back pockets, even if it can sometimes feel like a loaded gun.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHaving written about strategy for the past few years, my pieces have been\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-business-to-start-with-the-lowest-overhead-if-I-don%E2%80%99t-have-a-lot-of-money-and-no-real-skills/answer/Andrew-Bellay#\"\u003ebanned\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/08/25/startup-best-kept-secrets/#yM8aO3zrZSqS\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estolen\u003c/a\u003e,  in one case, used for an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://andrewbellay.com/mobclix-cursed-or-blessed/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eenormous acquisition deal\u003c/a\u003e and read by hundreds of thousands of smart people all around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eAnnouncing Straty.com\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nStraty is the home base for all things strategy - theory, concepts, terms, examples, resources, tools, and - with your help - maybe even a podcast or online community. You\u0027re currently on Straty\u0027s Patreon page and when you back Straty, you support the creation of high-quality strategy content that you can put to use in your industry, business, start-up, and professional life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eRead all the way to the bottom to find out how to become a \u003cu\u003eFounding Member.\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat Is Patreon? How Does This work?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a crowd-funding platform for creators. They will process $150 million in payments by the end of 2017 and are a reputable company. They\u0027re like Kickstarter but for subscriptions and communities. Patreon gives creators the option to ask their partons to support them on either a monthly or \"per creation\" basis, where a creation is a post, video, book chapter, drawing.. etc.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve setup up Patreon to bill patrons only when I publish a paid post. Most posts will be free to everyone - even non-patrons - but I plan to publish 2-4 \n\u003cem\u003epaid\u003c/em\u003e posts each month. I\u0027ve decided on the \"per post\" option for two reasons: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eI want to feel pressure every time I hit the submit button for a paid post. I want to be creating content that\u0027s worth your money.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eI don\u0027t want to be on an artificial (monthly) schedule. Some content takes a lot of time, energy, and focus to write and I want to be able to take that time without feeling guilty that I didn\u0027t hit some arbitrary monthly quota of posts. For example, this\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://straty.com/tag/diamonds/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e5 article series on diamonds\u003c/a\u003e took me about 10 weeks to research, write, rewrite, edit, and publish and I still have a lot more to say on the topic.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\nI plan to post at least twice per week but only some of my posts will be paid posts. And fear not, even if I have an unusually prolific month, \n\u003cstrong\u003eyou can (and should) \u003cem\u003ecap\u003c/em\u003e your total monthly pledge in your pledge settings\u003c/strong\u003e to whatever amount is right for you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat Are Founding Members? (\u265b)\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFounding Members are Straty\u0027s initial group of supporters. If you become a Founding Member, you\u0027re buying into me and my vision. Founding Members will always get the top tier rewards and perks without ever having to increase their pledges. This perk (denoted by the \u265b) is only available to Founding Members and this tier will only be available to join for a limited time."
