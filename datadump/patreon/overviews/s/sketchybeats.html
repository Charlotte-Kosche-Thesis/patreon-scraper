    "summary": "Sketchy Beats Cafe is a non-profit arts space in Leith, Edinburgh. The place is an open platform for creatives of any kind to use and share their ideas. Having started off as a monthly life drawing session (featuring a live musician, an improv dancer and a live DJ) in the basement of a restaurant on Leith Walk, money was raised through a crowdfunding campaign to open a permanent space where creative events could take place all the time - created by the people, for the people.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe main aims behind the space are to make it accessible and affordable to people who might have never organized events before or performed in public before. It acts like a stepping stone, allowing creative people to test out and share their ideas with like-minded people, building confidence and making connections.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo keep the space affordable and available to people who are in financially unstable situations, we don\u0027t charge anything to book the space and we keep all our prices as low as possible, so that money is not an obstacle preventing people from pursuing a creative idea.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEach month we have to turnover \u00a31,121 to cover the monthly expenditure of the running the space. The things we have to pay for each month are the rent for the premises, electricity, water,\u00a0 internet, mixed and glass recycling collections, cafe insurance, phone bill, stock for the cafe and finally, repairs to equipment. No one gets paid a wage, we offer our time voluntarily. Most months we just about scrape this together, thanks to payments for hot drinks, corkage and your generous donations. We are honestly so grateful for every donation left in the cafe, whether it\u0027s a musical instrument, a speaker or amp, books for the book swap, artwork to put up on the walls or a bit of change in the donations jar. Without them, the cafe would be nothing!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe don\u0027t want to increase our prices or charge to book the space, as it goes against the principles of the place. Since the cafe was born out of crowdfunding, we think this is our best option going forward and it\u0027s in line with the ethos of the cafe: for the people, by the people! One day in the future, you never know, maybe Patreon will provide enough money to make everything in the cafe free for everyone! Imagine that... It\u0027s still a long way away but something to aspire towards.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTestimonials (some of the reviews posted on the Facebook page):\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJen Lynn\nDavis (\u003cem\u003e5 star\u003c/em\u003e) 10 March\n2016 \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can:t\n\tbelieve a place like this exists in Edinburgh.
