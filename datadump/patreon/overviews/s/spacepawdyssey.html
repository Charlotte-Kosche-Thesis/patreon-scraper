    "summary": "Space Pawdyssey was born out of my desire to make people smile while at the same time growing my own skills as an illustrator.\u00a0 After years of putting my hobby on the back burner for various reasons, I finally decided enough was enough. I wanted to start doing what I loved to do so many years ago. I wanted to get back to drawing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpace Pawdyssey is more than just an artistic outlet for me.\u00a0 It\u0027s also very much a means of working out the personal struggles I\u0027ve dealt with over the years.\u00a0 Each character struggles with their own ideas of happiness and finding a purpose in life just as I\u0027ve struggled with those same challenges. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFelix aspires to be more than what he is.\u00a0 He also suffers from hero worship and a desire to be recognized by those he respects.\u00a0 Lex isn\u0027t satisfied with where he is in life and often fails to appreciate what he has.\u00a0 Connor is seen as a leader and hero to many but worries that he cannot possibly live up to the expectations of others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach of these characters embodies worries I\u0027ve had as I\u0027ve grown and worries I still fight with today. I hope to breath life into these characters as they bumble their way through space -- just as we sometimes bumble our way through our day-to-day struggling to find our own happiness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpace Pawdyssey is intended to be a weekly comic series released on a Friday schedule or as close to it as real life will manage.\u00a0 I will often stream my work on Picarto (\u003ca href=\"http://picarto.tv/frostclaw)\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://picarto.tv/frostclaw)\u003c/a\u003e for those interested in seeing how I work. I\u0027ll also be doing various fan art from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will help me focus more of my time and energy on this strip, its website and the marketing and structure around it -- be it support through Patreon contributions or simply by following the characters\u0027 stories and passing it along. It will also help with printing costs for upcoming print comics and with the hosting and updating of the website and related materials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not seeking a massive fan base.\u00a0 I just want to improve my skills and evoke some emotion, be it laughter or at times sadness -- from my readers.\u00a0 I hope to create characters people can connect with in some way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can follow along at \u003ca href=\"http://spacepawdyssey.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://spacepawdyssey.com\u003c/a\u003e or follow the comic on tumblr at \u003ca href=\"http://spacepawdyssey.tumblr.com.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://spacepawdyssey.tumblr.com.\u003c/a\u003e New updates will be published twice a week!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
