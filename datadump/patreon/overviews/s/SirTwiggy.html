This in turn means that I can help and support developers who are wholesome and stay committed to bringing their visions to life for our growing community! So if you too have an\n enormous passion for Indie games - especially survival ones, and enjoy my content enough to desire contributing to my success, please consider using this Patreon service! I like it much more than a regular donation because it allows me to rely on, track, and provide a wide variety of dandy rewards and milestones for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy approach to streaming is educational, \nrespectful and interactive, and has earned our community the attention of the \ndevelopers of Project Zomboid, and other developers, who have become regulars in chat! The last time I journeyed to England upon the invitation of fellow streamer Sacriel (and Shannon), we went to the UK gaming convention called Rezzed and I was invited \ninto the Twitch livestreaming booth to show off Project Zomboid with the \ndevs! Then, upon a very successful presentation to over 2k viewers in the \nTwitch chat, I was invited back by the creator of Luftrausers to host another interview! An important aspect of streaming to me is that we all make a very good impression on \nindie developers who are learning that streamers are a great resource for the \nsuccess of their game. Why? Because this gives US - the players - more interaction and voice in the development of our favourite titles and brings all sides of the gaming industry closer together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy I moved to the UK: Newfoundland is rural and remote. My opportunities were being \nstifled by my location. After I visited the UK, I fell in love with this country and its gaming opportunities and decided to move here! Over the \npast 8 months, I have been working 50-60 hours a week and saving so that I could \nafford to move here (at a temporary cost to my stream schedule). I recently arrived in the UK and immediately began streaming\nevery day! I commit to stream 6 days a week \nand working hard to further establish our channel in the Indie gaming scene, the UK streamer community \nand at events. I am truly thankful for all who support me by viewing, spreading the word, and enable me to make my dreams come true! Thank YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
