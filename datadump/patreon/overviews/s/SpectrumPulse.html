    "summary": "Hi folks, welcome to Spectrum Pulse, where we talk about music, movies, art and culture - and this time, the conversation is about \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, not like that, or like that either. For those of you who are not aware, my name is Mark Grondin, I\u0027m the host of this series, which includes critical reviews, year-end rankings of songs and records, Special Comments, and of course my weekly series Billboard BREAKDOWN, where I dig into the twisted and often chaotic mess of the Billboard Hot 100. And over the past three to four years, it\u0027s been astounding to watch this community of over twenty-three thousand people grow, developing friendships, collaborations, and even memes - and while there have been some contentious moments, I\u0027d like to think that we as a community have helped forge something special. And this... now it\u0027s time to take a step I\u0027ve been considering for nearly two years, a chance to open up the floodgates to you, an experiment I\u0027ve seen refined and tested in so many quarters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI speak, of course, of Patreon. Founded in 2013, this was a service designed at its core to better connect artists with their fans and audiences, cut out the middlemen to build the symbiotic relationship, inspired by the old concept of \u0027patron of the arts\u0027. At a deepeIt r level this was forging a connection, allowing the audience insight into the process or even direction of the art created. It\u0027s enabling talent, allowing great things to grow...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd yet, I don\u0027t really fit into the traditional definition of \u0027artist\u0027. Yes, I\u0027m a published author, but I fall more in line as a critic leaning even towards journalism, and while there is indeed value in sparking that conversation, I\u0027m convinced it needs to be treated in a different way. YouTube, in a way, has already started to change this critical dichotomy, harkening back to an older tradition of individual men and women describing, analyzing, and critiquing art, not corporate entities with a brand delivered from on high. For the most part, over six hundred reviews have given you evidence, you know where I stand - and this means the next step is bringing the conversation to you. \u003cbr\u003e"
