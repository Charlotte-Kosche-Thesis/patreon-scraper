The money we\u0027ve raised has been reinvested in recordings and instruments. Since November 2014 we have played over 16 festivals (including Maldon, the Basin, Newstead, National Celtic, Beechworth) and numerous gigs.

This is where I would appreciate your help. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe recently started working with a range of musicians and studio producers including RangeMaster (David Carr).
