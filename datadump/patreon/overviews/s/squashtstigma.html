You don\u0027t \u003cem\u003ehave\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eto\u003c/em\u003e become a Patreon to view my websites, stories, videos and more. Contributing on Patreon is a choice, not a requirement. Which is one of many reasons I like it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m Here On Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are all kinds of expenses that go into each session, story and set of images on my website and in video productions.  From prints and framing to cameras and editing equipment to website hosting and email services, everything adds up and it adds up pretty quickly.  While I could probably make a small amount with adds on youtube and posting adds all over the website, that\u0027s just not the direction or how I want the site to me.  It\u0027s a common misunderstanding that with all the weddings I shoot I must have all these funds to do this on my own. However with two kids, two dogs and a house, that\u0027s just not the case. If that were the case, we wouldn\u0027t be here on Patreon. We self fund everything and always have. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ve Reached a Crossroads\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile for the past 10 years shooting weddings has been and will continue to be my passion and has become a serious full time, 50+hr a week job. And while I will continue to rock out weddings the way they deserve to be rocked out, I also long to give back to humanity in a big way, with this squashing stigma project... \u00a0And well, I can\u0027t shoot 50 weddings a year and be able to balance both passions.  Which is why we I am at this crossroad. And this project will happen so maybe I need to find a way for these two passions to run on the same road in the same direction... Forward.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile it\u0027s unrealistic to think that I can make the stigma squashing a full time thing, I long to watch it grow and help others take on their dreams.  I see two ways of making this a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Preferred Way\u003c/strong\u003e - With your help I can continue to focus on real, personal experiences and authentic stories and keep every piece of every story real....\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe \"Other\" Way\u003c/strong\u003e - I load up our site with ads, promote the latest cell phone and make stories and videos that include paid endorsements.  This isn\u0027t what I want and I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s what you want to see this either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSOOOOO.....\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon created this video which does a great job explaining what Patreon is.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wH-IDF809fQ?rel=0\" width=\"853\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I like about Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt provides an opportunity for us to set goals together and provide rewards to those that want to help me achieve these goals. It becomes a collaboration, a conversation, a community and something way more interactive than a simple donate button! You literally become a part of my production team.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou will ROCK!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u2019re getting in on the ground floor and it will be \u003cem\u003eyou \u003c/em\u003ethat helps shape the rewards I will offer. You will help me decide on future stories, photography and articles. I don\u2019t want to offer things like stickers, t-shirts and koozies unless that\u2019s what you\u00a0\u003cem\u003ereally \u003c/em\u003ewant. Maybe you\u2019d prefer virtual and/or in person hangouts or\u2026perhaps you want the opportunity to come travel with me for a few days?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel Patreon is the perfect platform to support creative artists and become a part of the production process itself.  I\u0027ve set a few goals and rewards already.  Once you become a Patreon, you\u0027ll get access to what\u0027s going on behind the scenes.  I want you to join in on the conversation to help me figure out what\u0027s next. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe last thing I feel like we \u003cem\u003ehave \u003c/em\u003eto mention is that I\u0027m not asking for a handout. Shoot you\u0027re here by your own free will and that\u0027s what makes it awesome. I\u0027m not asking for anyone to pay for me lifestyle, random traveling, me adventures, or anything like that. This is about building a community, creating something meaningful and sharing it with the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027m saying, is that if you find what I do a good job at creating and sharing the stories of these individuals, if what you see is inspirational, and you want to keep it going, I\u0027d be thrilled and oh so thankful to have you on my team. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s good to note: Pledges are \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eper story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- You can set your max monthly amount in case we go on a video upload spree\u003cbr\u003e- I am going to do my best to begin with 4 stories per month ( about one per week)\u003cbr\u003e- You are the bomb diggity for taking the time to support what I have the drive \u0026amp; passion to do \u00a0(or to even consider it)"
