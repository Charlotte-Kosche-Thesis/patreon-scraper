Follow along through a\nworld of puppets and miniature sets, as a boy and a girl set out on an\nadventure to touch the sun. This book is a collaborative effort by myself and a small group of artist who all share an interest in this art form.\u00a0Matthew Pugh and JP Li will be doing most of the illustrations and concept\nwork. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0537/9261/products/mattJPimages3_grande.jpg?v=1453396441\" style=\"width: 724px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKoji Nagao is the artist behind the puppets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0537/9261/products/double_koji_grande.jpg?v=1455506990\" style=\"width: 733px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOther contributing artists include director of photography David\nDriver, set designers Jose Loyola and Scott Nordlund, gaffer Mike Van Dine, and\nTroy Corriea on post-production.

The rewards being offered for your support are prints of these art\npieces - storyboards, final book illustrations, character and environment\nconcepts, photographs of the finished sets and puppets- as well as original\ndrawings by Matthew. All prints will be signed and printed on high quality\npaper. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0537/9261/products/300DPI_copy_2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1448121245\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe funds raised will help with all of the production costs-\neverything from materials and photo shoot expenses, to the final printing. About\n13 different sets will be built and photographed, making up the 32-page book.\nWe are hoping to photograph at least half of the book images during an artist\nresidency I have at the de Young Museum in July. If you\u2019re in the San Francisco\narea this summer, please stop by and say hello! Many of the sets and puppets will be on display\nin various stages of completion. Museum visitors will be able to see the different processes and techniques that go into\neach stage of planning, building and photography. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis account will also serve as a blog that will document the process in much more detail than our other social media outlets.

My work crosses many disciplines including film, television, stop motion animation, books, video games, and collectible toys. Over the past 15 years I\u0027ve collaborated with a variety of clients including KidRobotSF, The Academy of Sciences, Cosmic Debris, Sony Pictures, Hewitt Packard, and HBO. This children\u0027s book utilizes many of the skill sets I\u0027ve picked up throughout my career as an artist,\u00a0and is by far my most ambitious project to date. I will be showcasing many of the sets and puppets at the de Young Museum\u0027s artist in\u00a0residency program next summer for the month of July. If you\u2019d like to see pictures of all my current art projects, I post regular updates on my Instagram @steveferrera. You can also see examples of the sets and puppets I built for our film Cicada Princess on my website\nsteveferrera.com under \u201cportfolio\" -\u0026gt; \u201dcicada princess\". You can contact me at steveferrera@steveferrera.com. Thank you.",
