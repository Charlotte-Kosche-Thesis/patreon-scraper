    "summary": "Hello !\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve never tried this before, but if any time is right, the time is now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way for artists like me to get funding to help them create their art, and I think that\u0027s pretty neat. In response to your patronage, you will get exclusive access to the \"what\u0027s\" and \"how\u0027s\" of what I make. I think that\u0027s a beautiful give and take.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven more so, it\u0027s a way for me to share my art and what it means to me. Patreon is a way that you can share what my art means to you. I think that\u0027s a beautiful give and take.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to focus on making short films and documentary style videos for stuff that interests me. I\u0027m gonna cover most of the marching band season at my school, but I\u0027d like to branch out even more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also like to make paintings and drawings and poetry and such. Art, to me, is a way to communicate, and I want to build my art as though I would a relationship with anyone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: I am currently in high school and facing the imminently grand decision of \"what I want to do with the rest of my life\" a.k.a. College. It would be a dream of mine to be able to go for something creative, but I\u0027m not gonna ignore the importance of being able to get a job and make some sort of living no matter what I decide in life. I see Patreon as a way for me to test out if it\u0027s possible- if it\u0027s even worth it to try to make art and film into a feasible career.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is me- asking you- for help. I\u0027m asking for support to help build my dream into something tangible enough that I have the courage to chase it. Support to show me that my art is worth something to someone and that it\u0027s worth trying for. And I will do my best to make this worth it to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is new to me. I want to give you things that mean something to you to show how much your support as a patron means to me. Feel free to post here with questions, concerns, and ideas about what I can do to achieve that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this is important to me, no matter what or how much you support me, it all means something. We\u0027re all in this crazy world together trying to do something to make us happy. This happiness is something to be shared in any and every way possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt is the only way I really know how to share that with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s what I\u0027m going to do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a thank you. For reading this, for supporting me, for caring- for letting any of what I\u0027ve said mean something to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou have no idea what it means to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
