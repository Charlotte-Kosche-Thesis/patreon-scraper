    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s this all about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a while now, I\u0027ve been writing about Quaker faith and spirituality, practice, and my own experience.\u00a0You can see my blog at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://quakeropenings.blogspot.co.uk/\"\u003ehttps://quakeropenings.blogspot.co.uk/\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0I write about all sorts of things related to the Quaker faith, both from my personal perspective and to give an overview of what I have learned of others. This also includes \"written ministry\", writing that comes to me in the same manner as ministry in Meeting for Worship. That comes as it will, and I feel compelled to share it, but most of what I\u0027m writing now is written deliberately; I choose what to write, and spend time thinking about it and researching and so on. This is a wonderful experience for me, and when I know that other people are reading, discussing and reflecting on what I write, that\u0027s a fantastic reward in itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI love to write about my experience, share ideas that other Quakers - and anyone else - might find interesting, stimulate and participate in discussion about area of current concern to Quakers. The Religious Society of Friends is hugely diverse, and I want to see everyone in it have a better understanding of everyone else. But I can\u0027t afford to spend as much time on it as it deserves, and if it\u0027s not making money, I have to prioritise anything that might make money over it; it\u0027s just a fact of life that living takes money. I don\u0027t have a regular job that I do this in free time from. I\u0027m self-employed, and have to earn a crust.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is about patronage - in the old fashioned, \"I pay someone to be creative for me\" sense. These patrons of old were especially keen on public art, so that the work they funded could be seen by everyone. Unlike the old fashioned patrons, like the Medicis of the renaissance, you don\u0027t have to be fabulously wealthy to support such public creative works now. With Patreon, everyone can contribute a small or large amount to support the creative work that they like to see. You can get some small things out of it for yourself, as mentioned in the reward tiers on this page, but most importantly you support work that you believe in, and allow it to be enjoyed by everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe difference you can make\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support me, I\u0027ll be able to dedicate time to this writing, guaranteed, as outlined in my goals. I\u0027ll also be more financially secure and incredibly grateful. If you enjoy or otherwise value my work, please consider supporting it, however little you can contribute.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there\u0027s enough support, I\u0027ll be able to spend time on longer form writing on the same sort of subjects, and maybe branch out into other activities than just writing. I don\u0027t know where that could go yet, and won\u0027t until I start to get there, but the possibilities are exciting."
