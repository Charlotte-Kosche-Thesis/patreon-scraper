    "summary": "Hello fellow bohemians. Many thanks for finding your way here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to Sunday Best where dreams of innocence conflict with the bliss of ignorance. Where religion and conformity are challenged, and where societal poison secretes through the melancholic soul, the blueprint of my flesh. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho I am.\u003cbr\u003eI go by St.Merrique and\u00a0through this website you can help support my self expression through art. As an international traveling art model and freelancer, I spend a lot of my time planning, packing, networking, booking. I manage myself and this has been my career path for over ten years. A lot of time is also spent away from family and friends, and well... for the sake of art. By subscribing to Sunday Best you can help support and be a part of my ongoing creation of art and music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you will see on Sunday Best.\u003cbr\u003eFair warning. Sunday Best goes against the grain. I want to deliver the type of art that will provoke real senses and show the beauty of our imperfections as a human species. This will be in a combination of my personal work as well as my modeling without the censorship of social media.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you will get as a supporter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFor $1 a month You will have access to patron-only content including my images as a model, writings and ramblings, and behind the scenes content from time to time. These posts will be directly on Patreon for you to view and enjoy. Some content NSFW. Access is granted to my new patrons after the first (1st) of the month as a supporter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFor $5 a month you will have access to patron-only content including my images as a model, writings and ramblings, and behind the scenes content which I will post throughout the week. You will also get instant access to all my work as a photographer, and music track demos when I have an itch. Extra content will be shared from my 5Tier Google drive alongside the content posted here on Patreon. Some content NSFW. I will post freely throughout each week. I will post new private material every Sunday ;) Access is granted to my new patrons after the first (1st) of month as a supporter. \u003cbr\u003eFor $10 a month you will have access to patron-only content including my images as a model, writings and ramblings, and behind the scenes content which I will post throughout the week. You will also get instant access to all my work as a photographer, track demos when I have an itch, and private videos. Extra content will be shared from my 10Tier Google drive or through Vimeo directly on Patreon. I will post new private material every Sunday ;) Access is granted to my new patrons after the first (1st) of month as a supporter. \u003cbr\u003eFor $25 a month you will have access to my patron-only Firmament Collection in addition to my images as a model, writings and ramblings, and behind the scenes content which I will post throughout the week. You will also get instant access to all my work as a photographer, track demos when I have an itch, and private videos. Extra content will be shared from my 25Tier Google drive. Access is granted to my new patrons after the first (1st) of month as a supporter.\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to contribute as much or as little as you like.\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to contribute more towards my art you\u0027re always welcome to do so in the form of materials, props, wardrobe, photo stuff, etc... send me a message.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy should you become a patron?\u003cbr\u003eWith your support I can spend more time composing, processing film, and building in-home studio sets. Earnings will go towards that, and in return you\u0027ll get more content. In addition, if you have a concept that will suit Sunday Best, I do customs and commissions. I\u0027ll do my best to deliver and credit you as a creative partner.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI confidentiality agreement will be sent to you after your patronage, due before the end of he month to assure you have access to content by the following first of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
