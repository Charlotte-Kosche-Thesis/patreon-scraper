I run Sorenzo Props where I make replicas of awesome props and costumes that you seen on your screens, it\u0027s a dream job really! \u00a0I started out over 5 year ago with two goals, to make the coolest, most awesome prop pieces possible and to share my experiences to help encourage and support others to be creative, oh, \u00a0and to have a damn good time doing both (Ok, that was three things)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the years my business has grown and I have worked on dozens of projects and I have learned a LOT! \u00a0I have no shame in saying that most of it was learned from others who had taken the time to catalogued their experiences on-line. I have tried to do the same, regular posting about my work, the materials I use, the techniques I employ and even the mistakes I have made and this is something I hope to not only continue to do in the future, but also to greatly expand upon, which is why I\u0027m launching this Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is this Patreon thing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform aimed at supporting\u00a0creatives, like me, to do what it is they do best,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eCreating Awesome Content.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically it kind of works like a Crowdfunding/Kickstarter except instead of lots of people \u00a0buying a one-off product or service they make small regular payments direct to the creator so they can use it to make/produce/grow/improve or enhance their creative content. It\u0027s pretty sweet, there is no obligation, you can choose how much you want to support and even put a monthly limit on how much you contribute and you can really help the creators you admire most.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why do I need your support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs I mentioned earlier, Sorenzo Props. is my full time profession, but this campaign is not aimed to replace the income I generate from my commission work, merely to supplement it, to give me more freedom to do make more free content. Working on commissions can be very demanding on my time.\u00a0My ultimate goal is to make more content, but do it bigger, better, more often and more regularly than I have been doing it so far. It is something I tend do on a daily basis with social media, progress pictures, tips and tricks but quite often finishing a commission takes precedent to making a detailed video or writing a full build tutorial. My hope to gain enough support which will allow me to take more time to produce awesome content, particularly videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6sRxyST.jpg\" style=\"width: 663px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I goona do with your money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving a regular income from Patreon supporters should mean I will find it much easier to dedicate time in my schedule for producing more free content. I aim to produce a multitude of videos, everything from detailed build tutorials, step by step guides, \u0027One Day Build\u0027 challenge videos, Live Streams from my workshop, and even interviews with other prop artists and cosplayers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy YouTube channel already has a selection of these types of videos but with your support I can make more of them, make them WAAAAY better and make them much more regularly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MNtfPMe.jpg\" style=\"width: 210px;\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rMWszTb.jpg\" style=\"width: 211px;\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7GSVuYY.jpg\" style=\"width: 210px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy should you support me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, you don\u0027t have to if you don\u0027t want to, nobody should feel obliged. It might take you a bit of time to get your head around it, but think of it like a Crowd Funding campaign, but instead of getting a huge big wad of cash to help make something massive happen it\u0027s about collecting a small amount from lots of people on a regular basis do keep regular content flowing. Simply put, if you like the content that I have put out in the past and would like to see more and wouldn\u0027t mind parting with a few bucks each month to help that happen. . . . . . well, this campaign is for you! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOh, and there are rewards too, did I mention the rewards? \u00a0Below you\u0027ll find a list of rewards for people who choose to contribute, again there is no obligation and you can increase, decrease when ever you like or even stop contribution, but we don\u0027t want you doing that now do we.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find me. . . .\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, everything I do will end up on \u003ca href=\"http://www.Sorenzoprops.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.sorenzoprops.com\u003c/a\u003e (once I get it finished) and you can subscribe to my \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/sorenzoprops\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube channel here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\nDay to day I post a lot on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sorenzoprops/?ref=hl\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy Facebook page\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sorenzoprops/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e and if you\u0027d like to chat you can get me on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SorenzoProps\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nI will now be regularly updating my patron-only feed so that my patrons get first preview of what I\u0027m up to. \u003cbr\u003e\nSo even if you choose not to support this campaign, please feel free to connect with me and join me on my endless journey of making a building.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/lH0u8UK.jpg\" style=\"width: 642px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks so much for checking out my page, and any type of support that you give.
