    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003e\n\tHi. I\u0027m Kate.\u00a0I have been studying a ball on the end of a cord for about ten years now. Yeah, a ball on a cord. Why? Because I think it can change the world. In a really big way.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eA ball on a cord? What are you talking about?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m talking about something called poi. It\u0027s a ball, on a flexible cord, that you spin in circles around your body. People have been doing it for a long time, starting with the Maori in New Zealand. Today there are lots of different types of poi, and it is practiced all over the world as a form of play, meditation, and performance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://voortrek.com/images/patreon/typesofpoi.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, so why do you think poi can change the world?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePoi happens to combine a lot of special elements: it engages both the body and mind, it is rhythmic, customizable, and most importantly, fun! I was hooked from the moment I felt that thing orbiting around me...just spinning it in a circle was engaging but relaxing. And I\u0027m not alone...people are falling in love with poi all over the world!\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.spinpoi.com/yourstory/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI\u0027ve actually been collecting stories about it.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSure, that all sounds fine and dandy, but is there any proof that poi can improve health?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBeyond personal experience, no. At least, not until now! I have just completed the first scientific PhD research on poi, working between the Centre for Brain Research and the Dance Department at the University of Auckland, to measure the effects of poi on physical and cognitive function in healthy older adults. Here are the results!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JLuDjemm0sw\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd here\u0027s a more in depth documentary about the study.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l7oM5raj-MI\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSeems like it\u0027s going great, so, why do you need Patreon? Isn\u0027t it easy to get funding for health related research?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOne would think.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/StASHLru28s?t=17m12s\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTake it from Adele Diamond\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0one of the 15 most influential neuroscientists in the world:\u00a0\u201cMy grant applications to fund basic neuroscience research, like the role of dopamine in prefrontal cortex, sail through scientific review and have been continuously funded by the government for over 25 years. But when I request funding for solid research on the benefits on dance, music, or heaven forbid youth circus, reviewers eyes glaze over. They say \u2018Study dance? That sounds flaky.\u2019\u201d No matter how well prepared my grant applications are, they are still about a ball on the end of a cord, and I have had little success securing funding.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo what will my money help support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make a lifelong career out of poi and health. I want nursing homes to turn to poi like they turn to Tai Chi. I want schools to turn to poi like they turn to spelling bees and jumping jacks. I want scholars to turn to poi like they turn to the Rosetta Stone. I want to change the world with poi, and seeing as this is the first research study ever conducted, the field is wide open for a lifetimes worth of work. While I wait to defend my PhD, I am in the beginning stages of starting my own poi/health business, helping organizations and communities begin and grow their own poi programs. While I am keeping spending to a minimum, getting off the ground inevitably requires funding. I also have another poi project which I would love to continue work on, and even incorporate into my poi and health research:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theorbitar.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea digital musical instrument called the Orbitar\u003c/a\u003e. If poi alone can improve health, imagine poi which can be used to make sound and light compositions! The possibilities are endless, and so is my passion for this field.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat happens if I become your patron, and I want to change my donation amount or stop giving?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo problem!

I have worked extensively with this population, from teaching wheelchair bound adults at a retirement village, to teaching healthy older adults as part of a community fitness class. I would love to create some in depth online resources around poi and older adults, including video tutorials which potential poi instructors could use as training. These videos might include what moves to focus on (how to do them, and how to teach them), stretches to do before and after playing poi, what type of poi work best for different populations, etc. I could also expand this resource beyond older adults, for example how to start a poi program for youth. This project would be quite an undertaking, but with enough Patreon support I would be able to quit all my random time-consuming jobs and put substantial focus on it.",
