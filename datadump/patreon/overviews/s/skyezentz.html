I have been a song creator for just about my whole life, but I started taking myself more seriously and doing it as a job about 7 years ago. Its been a wild and unpredictable adventure, but I\u0027m looking forward to expanding the scope of my art and treating it more like a grown up (100% Full Time) job, and I could really use your help to make it happen! Making homemade videos and demo recordings has always been a part of my job as a musician but I\u0027ve never been paid for that part of the process. That\u0027s where Patreon comes in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou all have shown me such kind, unbending support over the years, and I know that I would be on a much different path right now if it weren\u0027t for your consistent love and cheer-leading.

In other words, with pledges from you, I can finally buy updated recording equipment, new musical instruments, a couple crazy cat surveillance cameras (JK!) and make better looking physical goods (CD\u0027s, T-Shirts, etc) some of which will be available to you as incentives for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227,108,9);\"\u003eWhat\u0027da I do now?
