    "summary": "In the multiple wars that have occured in recent history, many veterans have come home\u00a0damaged both mentally and physically.\u00a0 Many of them have a need for a public access animal (service animal), usually a dog, that they can rely on to assist them in getting through their daily routine. All service animals should have a vest that clearly designates them as a service animal to ease access to the places that they go.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVeterans have pride in their service to this country\u00a0regardless of the injuries received.\u00a0 This project is born out of desire to link the service dog to that service.\u00a0 Each vest will be an individual creation that is an expression of that service.\u00a0 The vest will utilize the actual uniform shirt, unit patches, name tags, specialty badges, and even the veteran\u0027s rank insignia if they choose from their military service.\u00a0 We will endeavor to create a vest unique\u00a0to that\u00a0veteran and the relationship they have with their\u00a0new \"battle buddy\" (everyone in the military has a battle buddy that watches out for them).\u00a0 The best part is and it is the hope of this crowd funding exercise to provide these at no charge\u00a0to the veteran with the option to donate to another vet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a project inspired when I went looking for a vest for my service dog.\u00a0 I am a disabled veteran with PTSD and I utilize a service dog and needed a vest for my dog.\u00a0I wanted a vest that was personalized to my military service to share that honor with my dog that helps me function and serves as a constant \"battle buddy\".\u00a0 I found someone who had started a service to make these, but it sadly seems to be inactive, so I made my own.\u00a0 Once two of my fellow veterans that have service dogs saw the vest,\u00a0 they wanted one so I made them one.\u00a0 Thus an idea is born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA donation to this campaign will help pay for patches, thread, some fabric (for those without a usable uniform item), it will also pay for the aquisition of a more robust sewing machine than the one I currently have to undertake this project. Once again the idea to give these to the vet as free of any charge as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will also create original, individual vests for individuals with\u00a050% of the total cost\u00a0\u00a0being used to create a veterans vest. Each vest whether a veterans vest or a non-veteran will strive to be a creation that expresses the indivduality of the person that needs it.\u003cbr\u003e"
