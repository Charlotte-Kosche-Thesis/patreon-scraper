I\u0027ve been a tattoo artist and freelance illustrator for over 10 years. And I love what I do. I\u0027m very passionate in creating things for people.\u003cbr\u003e\nBut. . .\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve had this long running dream of mine that I never thought was possible: to draw comics. Since as far back as I can remember I\u0027d doodle my own stories, from Spider-man to Superman. To be honest with ya, I grew up in a pretty poor family, so drawing my own comics was the only real way I could get a hold of them, and in doing that it eventually became a hobby. I would go beyond the *insert animal here*-man stories and start conceptualizing my own ideas and characters. As I grew older, however, I started to realize just how hard that dream was going to be for me to achieve, and I put it aside for a long number of years. Until now.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs of now I am working on two separate series at the same time and my Patreon is to help keep that comic train a-chuggin. New series might come and go as I complete them, but the main focus is my original graphic novel. So, without further delay, I would like to present you all to my long efforts of years of failures, self doubts, practice, and sacrifice in my original graphic novel I call \"\u003cstrong\u003eGravehill\u003c/strong\u003e\".\u00a0 And the comic book adaption of the highly praised and critically acclaimed Vektor album \"\u003cstrong\u003eTerminal Redux\u003c/strong\u003e\", that I will be working with closely with the singer, Dave, to complete as authentically and accurate as possible\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Gravehill\" will be on a FREE 2 page per week release period on my website, and \"Terminal Redux\" on a FREE 1 page a week period. BUT through Patreon I will be offering my patrons access to early pages to both series once completed (about 3 chapters ahead of the website), exclusive prints by me and other guest artists mailed to you, chapter bundles when an issue is completed, and other various neat goodies! (I\u0027m working on making shirts soon too)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe live in an age where most things we can dream are possible. But regardless if this comic sees any kind of mainstream support doesn\u0027t really matter to me. This is my passion project. This is my dream. And I will do it even if there isn\u0027t anyone reading. But I do want to say \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU\u003c/strong\u003e to anyone that \u003cstrong\u003eDOES\u003c/strong\u003e want to help and support. I am beyond grateful and humbled by the 1 or 100 who make that decision to help this old artist, and I will be forever appreciative. I will treat you will love and respect as you have shown me.\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"GRAVEHILL\" SUMMARY:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\"Gravehill\"\u003c/strong\u003e is a western based story about \u003cstrong\u003eoccult magic\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ewitchcraft\u003c/strong\u003e. It takes place in a different\n world where witchcraft forms the highest religion and everyone \nworships. Those who don\u0027t follow the written word are punished by the \nfire and the gun. Our story follows an unnamed hero, who comes from a \nsmall town named Gravehill, as he fights tooth and nail, to get revenge \nfor his murdered brothers. Along the way he befriends Death and they \nmake a pact to rid the world of the evil holy patriarch and his Crimson \nCoven of 7 witches that reign with an iron fist. But first the hero must\n traverse vast landscapes and grueling trials to battle each witch so he\n can win the 6 towers they guard. Once all 6 are won, he will be given \naccess to the lost 7th tower, where the Red King of Witches waits. Will \nhe have his revenge? Or will the witches be fed?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/24g999w.jpg\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"TERMINAL REDUX\" SUMMARY:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eAwoken from cryosleep a lone astronaut fights for his life and his sanity.
