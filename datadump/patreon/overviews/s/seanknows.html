I have charged lots of money. \u003cbr\u003eNow I am starting to do business differently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s so simple it\u0027s often too simple that some miss the value of this.

Olivares and I started a blog called Sean Knows in 2010. I started by sharing all kinds of information about health, emotions, high performance strategies, and how to do better in business.\u00a0\u00a0Lot\u0027s has changed in 6 years and I\u0027ve noticed a few things that matter to most people in this new place of technology and connection in a noisy world of information. \u00a0I have done blogging and poetry to videos on all kinds of topics to get the best and fun info for you. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter about a year, I actually started getting hired as a coach and consultant to individuals and businesses. \u00a0I started speaking and traveling a great deal too and blogging slowed down. \u00a0While I was blessed to work with people one on one and in workshops I wasn\u0027t keeping up with all of the people who loved my content and followed me online and looked forward to all that I had been sharing. There was something wrong here because I knew that it was the masses that deserve to be moved too. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eAnd it wasn\u0027t just about scaling the business, marketing or \u0027hustle\u0027. \u00a0There was something fundamentally missing in the entire business model after working with so many people.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI lost a lot of my readers and viewers but found many more as social media changed and I am always researching and learning the best strategies for inspiration and success from the best in the world. \u00a0I scratch the surface and dive deep sometimes because I know that one of my greatest talents is teaching and it really depends on where a person is in life at that time. Developing great content across several platforms takes work and it is a balance between keeping my business going and creating more online for those who want it and need it. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a few things that make this Patreon page so important with all that I\u0027ve learned in 2016 to connect with more people:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ea) I want Sean Knows to go on for a long time. The beta test is over. It works. People want inspiration and information that they can use to improve their lives and reclaim the energy and spirit that the know is still there. \u00a0I have a growing number of followers on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and sign-up lists. \u00a0I\u0027m obsessed with connecting and reminding people that life and business is or can be amazing,miraculous,and exhilarating, \u00a0and there are simple ways to get there. \u00a0I\u0027m obsessed with finding ways to reach freedom and fulfillment and sharing that. \u00a0It\u0027s what Sean Knows has always been and I love it! \u00a0Now, as I move to Live Broadcasting on Periscope,Twitch, and other places, I keep finding that people want more and \u003cstrong\u003ein a new different way\u003c/strong\u003e. This should continue for a long time, in some form or another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eb) I need to make Sean Knows self-sustaining for this to work. Taking on clients and using keep this passion going worked to some point but it\u0027s not balanced as you see from the lack of content. \u00a0It isn\u0027t sustainable. Affiliate marketing works but it gets too heavy on sales and advertisement for most people. \u00a0The other company is trying to grow and needs every dollar it can to invest in itself. If Sean Knows is going to go on for a long time, it has to be able to support itself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThinking about the long-term self-sustaining plan, we decided we don\u0027t want to use ads. Ads are annoying and hurt the user experience, and we can come up with a better way to do it. So far, we have two methods:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) The Sean Knows Inspiration Store.\u00a0This has definitely helped, but it doesn\u0027t even get us half of the way to self-sustainability. Maybe when we have more time to further develop the store, it\u0027ll do the job by itself, but it\u0027s not enough as it is now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Donations Model. I\u0027ve received donations from generous followers and clients ever since I put up a PayPal button in the Support Sean Knows tab, but a lot of those donors, along with other readers, have suggested that Patreon is a better way for readers and viewers to support the site. So we\u0027re trying it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way Patreon works is a person can donate whatever they want per month and the donation is recurring each month after that. So anything, from $1/month up, is hugely helpful to the cause. \u00a0This means that people believe in me and what I do and they pledge to support that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat We\u0027ll Use the Money For\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur initial goal is $5,000/month. That money plus the store income will be enough to keep Sean Knows going, indefinitely. Here are Sean Knows costs:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHosting. I need a robust enough hosting plan to support the highest spikes in traffic we ever get so we don\u0027t crash during those moments and ruin my happiness. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMailChimp. The service we use to email posts out to the subscription list. This fee grows as the email list grows.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOngoing web development. It\u0027s a website, so there are always upsetting glitches coming out of nowhere and occasionally, we add a new site feature. I do limited programming skills, so I need to pay someone for this. \u00a0It can get more intense than you think.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFacebook post \"boosts\". When I announce a new post on Facebook, this makes sure that the announcement gets onto 1/3 or 1/2 of our Facebook followers\u0027 News Feeds.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMe. I need to continue to eat things and wear things and turn lights, \u00a0while looking for the most inspiring topics and information to share. \u00a0Occasionally, I travel to major events to meet with leaders and peers so I can get the latest and greatest but that comes out of other business budgets. \u00a0My kids are grown and off to college so my needs are minimal.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOne employee and virtual assistant. I need someone to handle things like translation or redistribution requests, spam comment deletion, store upkeep, store customer service, and a bunch of other little jobs. These things end up adding up to a few hours every day, and without this employee, I end up doing it all and have much less time to write posts.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eConnecting with you and this is a HUGE ONE! Part of this whole new game is being able to have a real connection with you without charging the price for coaching. \u00a0There will be a donation option so that you get all the content exclusively as well as time with me if that is something you want without having to pay the usual consulting fee to my other business. \u00a0This is key for low-cost option for coaching. This leads into PART 2\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 2\u003cbr\u003eDUN, DUN, DUN!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAfter several years of uncovering some primary problems in the personal development industry and how transformation was taking place and 1 entire year immersed in live broadcasting communities to understand why and how people where connecting and what the majority of people were truly interested in and investing in for their daily lives, I figured something HUGE out. \u00a0It took me several months of working through the gap and how to shift a paradigm of the information age, business, basic psychology, coaching, and connection with people. \u00a0It was baffling until I found that there was a large segment of highly talented coaches, trainers, healers, artists, and others who weren\u0027t aware of how to build their businesses and brands in this newly uncovered economy of real world transactions. \u003cem\u003e\u00a0(BTW this will work with any individual starting with nothing and huge gains for businesses)\u003c/em\u003e. It\u0027s been an intense year and I\u0027ve knocked heads with the greatest in social media, coaching, and technology to figure this out and THIS, my patrons, is what I\u0027ll be sharing and showing with anyone and everyone who is a part of this community. \u00a0I\u0027ve learned a massive amount in 7 years of how things really are. I\u0027ve seen behind the curtain and looked for the magic. \u00a0There have been some major shifts it how it all works and is going to be and anyone can find passion, purpose and prosperity if you can get just this one major shift in who everything is changing. \u00a0The model is proven and works and it will just be a matter of us stepping into it and using it. \u00a0It\u0027s a simple thing I\u0027m going to show how this is really kind of a big deal so that person is valuable on the market of their choice and they can, or you can, simple be paid for being you, for your essence. \u00a0I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s easy get rich quick thing at all but it IS a simple concept. \u00a0Shifting the value perception that we have been taught that a person is worth is what it will come down to. \u00a0 It\u0027s much bigger than I\u0027m going to say here but it\u0027s what my patrons will learn. \u00a0This isn\u0027t some hook to get you. \u00a0This is really my current work that I will give to those who are supporting me to deliver this work. \u00a0Step one, embrace the idea of consciously supporting the things you believe in. \u00a0If you believe in me and what I do to inspire people, make them laugh, teach, and be there for them, then consider being a patron. You will not be disappointed. \u00a0The more you give, the better life gets and faster we can move. \u00a0This is my life and I\u0027m enrolling you in this evolution. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the basics. With those pieces covered, Sean Knows can support itself and you in a model that will be disruptive to any industry.\u003cbr\u003e"
