    "summary": "Hey there! My name\u0027s Shannon Morse and I run a youtube channel called Snubs Report. It\u0027s my little place on the internet to share travel videos, tech \u0026amp; geek pro tips, motivational videos, and life hacks I\u0027ve learned. I do new videos each Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. My personal channel has helped me gain more confidence in front of a camera, build my editing and graphic design knowledge, and also learn more about the way online video algorithms work, which has in turn been very beneficial for my work at Hak5 and TekThing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making videos for several outlets since 2008, for channels like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hak5\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHak5\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/tekthing\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTekThing\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve been growing my expertise as a tech influencer and security advocate, and have built a business for myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning a personal youtube channel does come with its own expenses. While I do monetize my content, this doesn\u0027t cover all costs associated with building out my channel. Monthly costs include paying for Adobe Premiere Pro and utilities, while ongoing expenses include paying for royalty free music, upgrading equipment, and travel for work related conventions. My goal is to get Snubs Report to a point where it\u0027s paying for itself via YouTube monetization. I don\u0027t intend to get rich off this channel, I just want to cover expenses.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you can help! Consider Patreon to be a way of showing your support for my channel in a small way. I want to continue sharing my life with y\u0027all in this little way as a creative outlet. All of my videos will continue to be free and publicly available. You\u0027ll be able to enjoy my videos whether you contribute or not. \u003cstrong\u003eIf you back my Patreon, you get access to travel tips and high-res versions of my travel photography!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers and thank you!\u003cbr\u003eShannon\u003cbr\u003e"
