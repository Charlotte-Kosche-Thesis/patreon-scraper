I want this to be fair for you guys.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eI also reserve the right to reschedule or postpone these events. Rest assured that if this happens you\u0027ll still get what you paid for and an explanation of why it was delayed. The reason for this kind of delay would likely only be something outside of my power. Sometimes PCs explode, power goes out for a week, or as I learned early in 2016 you suddenly need to go to the hospital for a week and have an organ removed. I will make up for the event, but I\u0027m putting this here just so you\u0027re aware that life happens some times.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e",
