    "summary": "Hello, my name\u0027s Stu Thompson and I\u0027m an ex graphic designer who turned full time artist in 2008.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI specialise in realistic drawings \u0026amp; paintings, working in pencil, oils, acrylics and watercolours and I\u0027ve sold my work all over the world including the USA, Greece, Spain and Australia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is share my work and to inspire and show my supporters how to create wonderful artworks of their own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy did I pick Patreon to do this? Patreon is the ideal, trusted platform that brings together creatives and supporters and makes it easy for creators to get paid. Creators do this by offering rewards in return for a patron\u0027s financial support. For instance for two dollars per month, entry level supporters receive high res jpeg images of my work which they can print out themselves and use for whatever they wish apart from resale. As well as my back catalogue there will be at least two new artworks a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor five dollars per month I will endeavour to show you how to draw and paint like I do but without any formal lessons. We will jump straight in at the deep end and start creating your first drawing straight away. The beauty of this system is that you actually do the learning as you create. For every piece of artwork we create there will be a video and a written description of how to apply the techniques you need to hopefully, become an accomplished artist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will show you every tip and trick I know that will save time and improve your work. Also, because I don\u0027t believe in throwing money away, I will tell you where I buy my materials and equipment from, which could save you money. Of course you are not obliged to follow my suggestions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more rewards, see the rewards section to your right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Every week for a year they tried to kick me out of art college.\u003cbr\u003eEvery week, usually on a Tuesday an odious little creep called Radcliffe would open the door of our room and utter the same old words: \u0027Thompson, bring your portfolio to Mr Slade\u0027s office.\u0027\u003cbr\u003eAt the time Radcliffe was Slade\u0027s deputy at the college of art and design at Newcastle Polytechnic where I was to study graphic design and I believe he was the instigator of my weekly torture. He was was a man who didn\u0027t stand out in a crowd at five foot six or so and he always seem to wear a brown suit. His trademark, if you could call it that was never to use five or six common English words to describe something when one obscure one would do. This meant that most of the students didn\u0027t really know what he was talking about and I suspect neither did he.\u003cbr\u003eBoth he and Slade, to my knowledge were beaurocrats as opposed to artists. If they did have artistic inclinations they kept them well hidden  so to me it was a bit like being a singer on X Factor and having Scary Spice say you\u0027re crap.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, despite their best efforts, they failed to shift me and after a year the \u0027critiques\u0027 as they were called got fewer and fewer until in the end I think they just gave up and I completed my course.\u003cbr\u003eThe legacy of this was that for ten years or so I never so much as picked up a pencil or brush other than to write something or paint a wall.   to be continued......\u003cbr\u003e",
