    "summary": "This podcast is a labor of love, and something we deeply believe in! But we\u0027ve been paying out of pocket thus far (about $150 per episode) and we can\u0027t sustain that much longer. There are a number of fixed costs that go in to creating the podcast which include things like hosting the website and paying our audio engineer.\u00a0 And the biggest cost that goes in to making the podcast is our time- keeping this going takes anywhere from 20-40 hours each week. In order to sustain this conversation in the future, we need to reach out for your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur core content is now, and always will be, free. But this site allows our community to make small ongoing contributions to help fund the show on a voluntary, per episode, basis. If you dig what we do, would you consider contributing a dollar or two or five per episode? If enough people in our community did this, it would make a big difference, and it would allow us to invest even more time and energy as we move forward. We have visions of a YouTube channel! Live shows in other cities! Paying our guests! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love doing Sex For Smart People. It has changed out lives for the better; it keeps us honest in these conversations that we care so much about.\u00a0 We hope that it has been good for you, too.  Thanks for considering helping us out with a contribution, and as always, we are so glad and grateful that you are in this conversation with us!\u003cbr\u003e"
