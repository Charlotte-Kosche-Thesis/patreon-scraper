    "summary": "Labor rights are the most violated human right in Georgia. Workers are mostly unorganized and new to waging struggles collectively. Solidarity Network - Workers\u0027 Center is an independent democratic trade union that also has a workers\u0027 center component. It was created out of a need to support the workers in the growing service sector, who are often left out of traditional trade unions. Despite the paucity of English translations of our work, the video which has English subtitles posted captures the problems facing young women who are often the majority of those employed in the so-called low skilled service sector. It was stories like these that compelled us to form a workers\u0027 center that would have the necessary flexibility and quick response as well as the gender sensitivity absent from mostly male industrial unions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to stay true to our original mission, we strive to reduce dependence on foundations to create a more horizontal funding structure through our members locally and our friends internationally. We want to be accountable to our members and sustainers--not corporate funded donors! That means we are dependent on small donations like yours to keep our work going. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSolidarity Network - Workers\u2019 Center is a critical organization that advances labor rights and increases labor standards in Georgia. It is building a member-led, democratic, and fighting union. Your support as a sustainer is vital to our everyday survival. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been actively campaigning for two and a half years to put workers in the service sector in the forefront and improve their working conditions by aiding them to organize themselves for dignity at work. We have been building a strong and resilient membership-led trade union through deep organizing in the most anti-labor conditions: there is virtually a nonexistent labor code of conduct enforcement, weak labor code of conduct, no working occupation health and safety regulations, no unemployment insurance, barely any pensions, and lack of jobs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have also been doing research studies about the local political economy, the labour market and the wages in the service sector to aid us in our work to strengthen the collective capacity of workers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore English translations and posts of our studies are forthcoming here on Patreon and our website. If you would like to know more, please email us \u003ca href=\"mailto:solnetworkerscenter@gmail.com\"\u003esolnetworkerscenter@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e and please visit our website,\u003ca href=\"http://workerscenter.ge\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://workerscenter.ge/en\"\u003ehttp://workerscenter.ge/en\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also believe in accountability, so we will post updates regularly for all of our sustainers via this Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease become a sustainer.\u003cbr\u003eIn Solidarity,\u003cbr\u003eSolNet Coordinators\u00a0"
