With three pen names and nearly 100 publications, I have a lot of experience and opinions that I want to share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn Sex For Money, I talk about the latest changes on social media and how this impacts your efforts to promote your work, I feature author guests who have extensive experience and plenty of passion for the erotic word, and I will soon take the occasional deep dive in a complicated topic (like, how does PrEP change the depiction of safer sex in MM erotic romance? Or how do we accurately represent bi characters without depicting them as closeted lesbian women / gay men?).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSex For Money is a free podcast -- and will always be free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBy asking for your support, I want to make my podcast better -- but it will always be free. With your help, I can get better equipment, I can devote more time to making more podcasts, and I can be more responsive to the ever-changing self-publishing landscape.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you, once again, for your support and your interest!\u003c/strong\u003e"

     "about": "Cameron D. James is a life-long lover of books, voraciously reading everything from the classics to sci-fi, romance to science and nature, and thrillers to erotica. Understandably, a love of books led to a love of writing, having penned his first story in grade seven (about stolen baseball cards). Having written millions of words by now, Cameron now focusses on one of his favourite genres \u2014 gay erotica.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCameron is a fan of Star Trek, having seen every episode of every series (including the animated series) and every movie at least twice. In addition to Star Trek, Cameron also loves physical exercise and seeing how far he can push his body. He\u2019s taken kickboxing, Bikram hot yoga (that\u2019s the super hot and tough one), diving, personal training at the gym, and likes his regular Wii workouts (seriously, they\u2019re a lot more intense than they look).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther interests include listening to electronica music (particularly Armin Van Buuren), puttering around the house (and attempting to grow a garden), and gawking at cute twink baristas at the various coffee shops where he\u2019s such a regular that he\u2019s known by first name.\u003cbr\u003e",
