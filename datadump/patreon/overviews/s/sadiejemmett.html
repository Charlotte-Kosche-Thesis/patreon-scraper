    "summary": "\u0027Welcome Sadiests\u0027!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all thank you for finding me on Patreon! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe musicians live in strange times, the arrival of online streaming sites has meant that whilst you can get your music out and be discovered by the whole world, unfortunately, your music then also becomes free, there is sadly very little revenue to be made through selling albums any more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been lucky (or crazy, depends which way you look at it!) to scratch out a living from playing music since my early teens. Along the way I have busked my way around Europe, released two studio albums and a live album, and had a separate career composing music for theatre. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough all of\u00a0 this I have single-handedly brought up my beautiful daughter, Thalia, who is now starting to make her own way in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past year or so I have been hunkering down in my little home studio and wrestling with the new songs for my next album. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can join my little exclusive commnity\u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203913709-How-do-I-become-a-patron-to-a-creator-\"\u003eFor as little as a dollar a month,\u003c/a\u003e (you can pause, cancel adjust your contribution at anytime) and become an active part of this beautiful, creative journey that I am about to embark on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first album, The Blacksmith\u0027s Girl,\u00a0 was recorded in LA by Grammy winner producer David Bianco. For my second album, London Love Songs, through some generous friends, I was lucky enough to record part of it in the legendary Abbey Road Studio 2, where the Beatles made all their records!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an artist I like to keep things fresh and constantly challenge myself, which is why I have accepted an offer from world class music producer, Joby Baker (The Bills, Cowboy Junkies, Miten / Deva Premal et al) to work with him in his much sought-after Baker Studios in Victoria BC, Canada. Joby is one of the West Coast\u2019s top producers, whom I greatly respect, and I am beyond excited to have the opportunity to create my next album with him!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am doing everything I can to make this opportunity a reality, I will be singing for my supper and playing as many gigs as I can while I am over there this summer, hell, I may even do some busking!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, If you know my music and it has enriched your life in some small way, and you would like to hear new songs and recordings\u00a0for as little as $1 a month? why not become an \u0027official Sadiest\u0027, and, if you are feeling generous and want to pimp up your contribution and help keep me fed and watered and on the road over the coming year, then I would love you to be my champion for only $5 a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor hardcore Sadiests, there are even more special rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever much you wish to contrbute you will receive special regular rewards for your sweet generosity and I will make it up to you with a fantastic new record that you will hear exclusively first - I promise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I said at the beginning of this post, we musicians live in strange times, but there is an upside (isn\u0027t there always?) to the way music is distributed these days, that upside is that there are now far few middle-men, corporate suits, hangers-on or record labels, guarding the threshold and telling us what to listen to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow it can be just you and me, connecting in the most beautiful way, empowering change, sharing and enjoying the music we love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy contributing you are directly supporting me and my music, so go on ... won\u0027t you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSadie\u003cbr\u003exx\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out my music on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.deezer.com/fr/artist/471927\"\u003eDeezer\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/7cXRrGzxAtpjn4csu0JfDK\"\u003eSpotify\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/artist/sadie-jemmett/480121235\"\u003eiTunes\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/sadiejemmett\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSoundcloud\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sadiejemmett.com/\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003esadiejemmett.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatreon allows people who like my music\u00a0 to support my work by making a monthly pledge.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePledge as little or as much as you like (imagine 1,000 people pledging $1 each...your contribution will make a huge difference)!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou are charged when you pledge and then ongoing at the beginning of each month.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can cancel your pledge or change your pledge amount at any time.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
