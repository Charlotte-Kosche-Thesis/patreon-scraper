    "summary": "If asked, I will tell you that I started writing at 15, when I first published a piece of poetry online. The page is now defunct, but I remember the thrill of seeing my name on the byline. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis would be, not a lie, exactly, but not the entire truth.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was in fifth grade, about 10 or so, I was supposed to write a short mystery story as an assignment for a class I was in. We had a week. The night before it was due, I remember my mother typing it up for me on a typewriter (it was before she bought a PC, back when the internet was still mostly dialup). It was seven chapters long, and amazed everyone. It had grown up vocabulary, and historical context, and my parents still have a copy safely protected in plastic pages.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is also not when I started writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoing through my my mother\u0027s filing cabinet, looking for my birth certificate so I could apply for a passport, I found a file of papers from my kindergarten class. In that pile was a short story about an alligator--a class assignment--and my journal, which was filled with bits of story and scenes and dialogue--all in my barely-legible five-year-old handwriting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, in truth, I began writing from the moment I learned how to hold a pen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd by the time I finished Grad School, I knew what it was that I *wanted* to write.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI heard the advice: Write what you know. Don\u0027t write what you know. Write in the morning, write at night, write when the mood strikes, write all the time, write on a schedule...Then I was told \"Write what you care about,\" and I realized that I care mostly about Queer themes and Genre Fiction, and there aren\u0027t enough queer people in these stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here I am, telling stories of lgbtqa+ people--of lesbians and gay men, asexuals and bisexuals and pansexuals. I write stories that challenge gender and sexuality, but more, I write the stories I want to read: adventure stories and romances and mysteries and fantasy and space opera--and I fill my casts with gays.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve found me via tumblr, then you\u0027re familiar with my fanworks. This proceeds from this patreon will help me pay my bills so I can focus more on writing, both the fanfiction that I love and the original novels that I plan on publishing. Then, this will also help me pay for publishing cost, marketing and editing costs, and other unanticipated publishing expenses.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all so much for being there, for reading my stories, and enjoying my work so much that you\u0027re here with me, on this journey. It means the world to me."
