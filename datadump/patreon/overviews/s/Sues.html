    "summary": "Despite all of it\u0027s natural beauty, creating art in NH is not easy. \u00a0There are no truly artistic cities with the infrastructure (venues, patrons, interest) to facilitate creation. \u00a0Because of this, wonderfully artistic people leave this area regularly for Portland, Boston, New York, and the West. \u00a0Sue\u0027s Space is a member funded creative facility that wants to give creative people a reason to stay, and everyone else, a reason to come. \u00a0Sue\u0027s is a birthplace and stronghold for artistic expression and entertainment that puts creation first and everything else second. \u00a0We believe that education and the arts are meant to be shared, not commodities to be bought and sold.\u00a0 In our first 8 months of operation, we have hosted music, workshop, film, dance, theater, clothing swap, wrestling, fundraising, and comedy events, all of which are donation-based. \u00a0Your support will strengthen the already active member-based support system, and ensure our creative community can grow and thrive for years to come. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAround 60 people currently fund and facilitate donation-based entertainment and education at Sue\u0027s (the members). \u00a0Our members range from early twenty year olds to recent retirees. \u00a0Carpenters, cooks, restaurant owners, mechanics, baristas, and farmers alike all lend their time and talents to put on events. \u00a0Members join forces routinely to help facilitate each other\u0027s events, creating bridges between age groups and social circles. \u00a0Because of this, our music, film, theater, and workshops aren\u0027t pigeonholed to a single genre, but instead encompass a wide variety of perspectives. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy largely removing money from the equation, we have built an environment where the only motivation is creativity itself. \u00a0The only reason anyone organizes anything at Sue\u0027s is because they want to create and share. \u00a0This is the basis of community. \u00a0Giving without wanting anything back, helping without being asked to help. \u00a0The namesake of the space, Sue Russell embodied all of these traits up to her last days this past Winter. \u00a0Sue was living proof that service to the community and those you love should be above everything else. \u00a0She lived a busy and beautiful life and was loved deeply by everyone who knew her. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0As much as we are told otherwise, we are a pack animal with a common consciousness. \u00a0We thrive in an environment where everyone wants to be part of the whole. Together, we are able to go well beyond our capabilities, and we need to reminded of this regularly. \u00a0To be human.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this far. \u00a0Please consider becoming part of our group, or at the very least, swinging by and seeing the space. \u00a0Hope to see you at Sue\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Joey P.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
