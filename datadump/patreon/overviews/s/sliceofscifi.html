    "summary": "I\u0027m Summer Brooks, and long-time listeners to science fiction themed podcasts may know me from the long-running show \u003ca href=\"http://www.sliceofscifi.com\"\u003eSlice of SciFi\u003c/a\u003e, a show I\u0027ve either hosted, co-hosted, or produced for over 12 years, plus some other genre favorites like \u003ca href=\"http://www.babylonpodcast.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Babylon Podcast\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.kickassmysticninjas.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKick-Ass Mystic Ninjas\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSlice of SciFi means a great deal to me, in part because of the fans and friends I\u0027ve encountered over the years who\u0027ve also loved the show, and also because of the talent we\u0027ve all watched on television and in films who I\u0027ve been able to talk with about their work. On-air personalities change, show formats change, but I still think the heart of this show lies in showcasing the talent that\u0027s out there making the science fiction, paranormal, and horror entertainment we all enjoy... and sometimes make fun of!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still love interviewing those creators with stories to tell, as much as talking to the people who have helped others get their stories told... a poetic way of saying how much I enjoy talking with writers, directors, actors and producers. It\u0027s something I plan to keep doing for as along as I can, and having as many other geeky voices in the mix as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother large part of my love of genre media includes books, and that led to the creation of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.writersafterdark.com\"\u003eWriters, After Dark\u003c/a\u003e, to not only focus on authors, but all writers. The goal is to interview story creators across various mediums: comic book writers,\u00a0 fiction writers of short stories \u0026amp; novels, and screenwriters and playwrights -- we\u0027ll see how deep down that rabbit hole I can go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the goal for now, to support Slice of SciFi continuing to be a weekly show, and bringing Writers, After Dark up to speed as a regular show alongside it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of these goals need more support than I can provide by myself right now. It requires hosting for the websites to house the feeds, hosting for the audio shows, and most of all, quality time to keep recording \u0026amp; producing the shows, and keeping the team supplied with new review materials and events to attend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support definitely makes this easier, and I believe that support will help me improve the shows as we keep moving forward, and that\u0027s more fun for all of us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
