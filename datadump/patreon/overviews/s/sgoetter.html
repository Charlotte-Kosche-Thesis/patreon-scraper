Years later, I\u2019m halfway across country, but I still need help with student loans and I dream of being able to quit my retail job, haha. But in that time, the support I\u2019ve gotten from Patreon has been so appreciated, especially as I was dealing with a lot in my personal life and my art output wasn\u2019t so great. Now that I feel like I\u2019m finally in a more stable place in my life I\u2019d like to finally update my Patreon and my rewards to reflect that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI completed the first volume of Boozle in the beginning of 2017 and since then I\u2019ve decided to switch to a different comic, a semi-autobiographical, semi-slice of life, semi-fantastical comic called \u003cem\u003eMy Cat Can Talk and Honestly I Hate It\u003c/em\u003e. The story follows Helen Wampole, a young woman that\u2019s perfectly content to live quietly until one night she accidentally hits a magical talking creature with her car. As time goes on, however, it\u0027s obvious that her new talking cat is not the biggest problem in her life. It\u2019s slated to debut sometime in 2018. For this soft relaunch of my Patreon I intend to focus my efforts on this comic to get it out there for everyone to read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://boozle.sgoetter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/promo.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo let\u2019s talk rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://sgoetter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018spot1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$1: Business as usual\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar counts!
