    "summary": "Who Am I?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m one of several \u201cSarah Beach\u201ds to be found online, at least two of whom are also writers and artists. I had anticipated this years ago,\nback when the internet was barely wired (and you had to dial in on phone lines\nto anything), so I created the band name \u201cScribblerWorks\u201d to distinguish myself\nand my work. But that doesn\u2019t really tell you much (other than \u201cscribbling\u201d\ncovers both writing and artwork). Even though I have had work in print (mostly\nliterary scholarship) for over 25 years, I knew I needed a nametag that really\ncaught people\u2019s attention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter I survived the rigors of academic training and won the\nrewards of a Master\u2019s degree in medieval English literature, I then plunged\ninto the work arena of clerical library work. From there I jumped into Show\nBusiness and landed my first job with a little quiz show that kept me employed\nfor 18 years researching and verifying information. That\u2019s answers and\nquestions for you. But eventually even such things end, and my specific\nposition got downsized, casting me out into the world to fend for myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do freelance editing and writing (primarily web content\nfor search engine optimization). But I would much rather be spending my time\nworking on my own creative projects. Which leads to one of the reasons I have\ncome to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy I Am On Patreon\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeeping myself inspired about my own work isn\u2019t always easy\nwhen I\u2019m doing bread-and-butter work for clients. Up until now, I haven\u2019t had a\nregular audience expecting the latest installment of anything. Because I\u2019m one\nof those people who responds better to external deadlines, the structure of\nPatreon \u2013 especially the monthly subscription form \u2013 struck me as being just\nthe motivator I needed. Having a ready and appreciative audience can inspire\nand encourage me to work more diligently on my own creative projects. Gaining\npatronage can lower the need for bread-and-butter jobs, and allow me to\ncomplete the wide variety of projects I long to share with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage will give you advanced access to what I am\nworking on. Indeed, at a key level, you will be given PDFs of draft chapters of\nworks-in-progress. At higher levels of patronage, you are invited to offer\nsuggestions for certain aspects of work, and even receive discounts on services\nI generally offer to the public.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough most of my work is literary, I will from time to\ntime include art projects as time, space, and materials allow. Just as with the\nliterary work, you\u2019ll get behind the scenes looks at the creative process, and\nfirst chance options if I put any work up for sale. In the future, I hope I\u2019ll\neven be able to take on the occasional artwork commission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be thrilled to see every Patron that comes on board. Active encouragement of my efforts is nourishment to my creative energy. You have my deep felt thanks.\u003cbr\u003e"
