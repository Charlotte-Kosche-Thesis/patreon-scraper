    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to my Patreon! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn attempt to build a little more organisation in my life, and get out into the scene with the community more, I\u0027m starting this up with the hopes that the support will open me up to more opportunities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore you say it: \u003cem\u003eno, I will \u003cstrong\u003enot \u003c/strong\u003ebe paywalling my artwork here\u003c/em\u003e. At most, I will be delaying posting Patron commissions outside the art feed, but I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll end up seeing that artwork outside the feed eventually and I am perfectly fine with it. All commissions finished become the property of their commissioners, and they are allowed to post anywhere they please.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdvantages to supporting me here: \u003c/strong\u003eI will be uploading full-resolution finished images to the art feed in all their unrefined, disgusting glory (so none of that horrible Twitter image compression!) as well as (most of) any personal sketches I happen to draw for myself. You can also help vote on personal sketch ideas for me to draw too! Heck, you could even be the one suggesting these ideas, if you pledge enough!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHigher tiers allow access to a Discord server I\u0027ve set up, which will give you the opportunity to get a little more personal with myself and some close friends, and ask for critique in artwork (and get answers not limited to 140-character tweets).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of you know I currently host sketch streams roughly three times a week, and I do plan on maintaining that, however \u003cstrong\u003eone of these sketch-streams each week will be specifically for Patreon donors!\u003c/strong\u003e There will still be public sketch streams hosted through Twitter as usual however, so please do not feel like this will be the only option. \u003cem\u003eUsually I would recommend this tier for donors who wish to support me, and feel the monthly fee is worth bypassing the hassle of dealing with the RNG and timing elements usually encountered applying for the public sketch streams on Twitter.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, these sketch stream commissions are priced at \u00a310 GBP per character with a maximum of three characters per picture, and additional costs may apply, so please inquire if you feel you need to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy level 1 and 2 tiers are currently some of the only ways to get these levels of commissions, though again will not be the only way! I plan on incorporating these commissions regularly into the public too, primarily through Twitter, but as of yet these have no planned schedule to them. Unlike the sketch streams, these are priced in USD, and prices for these commissions vary to be determined using the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://swizzlestix.github.io/\"\u003eCommission calculator\u003c/a\u003e. Each tier however includes a percentage discount on the commission\u0027s final price, rounded down to the nearest dollar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs this is my first attempt on the foray of Patreon, I\u0027m fully expecting I\u0027ve missed out or forgotten a detail here or there. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to hit me up on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SwizzlestixUK\"\u003emy Twitter\u003c/a\u003e, where I am currently most active. I really want to get this working as actively as possible, and will always truly appreciate any support you guys have to give me. Thank you!"
