    "summary": "Hello Patrons! If you made it to our Patreon page, no doubt you have watched one of our videos on YouTube. But just in case: We are Pete and Cheryl along with our children, Jacob and Austin, and we have untied the lines to live a life of adventure on our 45\u0027 Hirsch Gulfstar sailboat. We are recording our entire trip and sharing the beauty of sailing, the constant repairs required on a boat, what it is like to homeschool our boys aboard, the amazing locations we visit, and the people we meet along the way. And let\u0027s face it, even the best sailors have the occasional mishaps, so we will certainly be sharing those as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of people ask us about having our kids on board and how they feel about this trip.\u00a0Our kids had no hesitation leaving land life behind. Every day offers a real life lesson. The people we meet are leaving lasting impressions on our family. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of planning and saving went into this trip. We prepared as much as anyone could. We have budgeted to cover all of our living expenses. However, making videos to share with the world comes at a cost. Internet, equipment, editing software, and the time it takes to create a video.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating a 10-20 minute video takes hours of editing time. We record our day to day activities so the footage adds up quickly and unfortunately we can\u0027t share it all. Taking into account the time spent watching footage over and over again to find the best parts, inserting it into our software, and making it as enjoyable as possible for our viewers, we spend about 20 hours to make 1 video. We post 2 videos a month as well as updates on Facebook. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLiving in an ocean environment, our equipment takes constant abuse from salt air and water. Your donations would ensure working equipment to continue to bring you quality videos, as well as the cost of internet to get them uploaded. And maybe even cover a treat for the kids while they patiently wait for hours for our adventure to load.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are committed to at least 3 years aboard, starting in the Eastern Caribbean and ending who knows where. But as every good sailor knows, never be on a schedule. Who knows what the tides will bring.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will we not use donations for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have planned maticulously what we are going to do along the way. Our costs have already been factored in for port entry fees, dining out, provisioning, cocktails, occasional marina stays and fun activities. No donations will be used to finance living expenses for our trip.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is your dream?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone has a dream. Have you ever thought about what your life would be like if you made it happen? If our videos inspire just 1 person to make their dream come true, it is well worth it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur dream was formed in 2009 when we got married. The plan was to move onto a boat when the kids moved away and after retirement. Then, our dear friend, Don, was diagnosed with Melanoma cancer 6 years ago. He reminded us that you never know what life will hand you and urged us to take our kids and go while we could. The final push to take this trip was in 2014 when we lost Cheryl\u0027s mother suddenly at the age of 57. So the plans were put in motion, and in 2016, Don sold us Magic Genie. Our dream, now a reality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecoming a Patron!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe once heard a saying: You understand why it is better to have a friend with a boat, than own a boat yourself. So come aboard with new friends, and become a Patron. We are greatly appreciative of any amount that our Patrons can give. You can donate \u003cstrong\u003e$2-$50\u003c/strong\u003e. Every little bit goes a long way. Our videos will always remain free through YouTube, however, if you feel a little extra supportive of our dream, than please donate so we can continue to share it with all of you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s how it works...\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/wH-IDF809fQ\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/wH-IDF809fQ\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur family is extremely appreciative of the support and love we get from our followers. Your donations mean so much to us to continue our adventure! Thank you for taking the time to check out our page and we look forward to having you along for the ride!\u003cbr\u003e"
