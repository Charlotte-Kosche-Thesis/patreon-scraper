This project will start as a podcast, but I\u0027d like it to grow into a whole lot more. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo for starters I\u0027m using the podcast to make a record of my plans, of my ambitions, and of all the ideas I have for this project. I\u0027ll also be having roundtable discussions with friends about current events, and interviewing other creators that I encounter. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also plan to make some instances of this podcast into something that resembles a fanzine. I\u0027d like to collect audio from listeners as they talk about a subject that ignites their passion (primarily it would be people who have all attended the same event), and then I will paste all of that together and create what I\u0027m calling an Audio Fanzine. The idea would be that people from around the world can get an idea of what it is like to be a part of something, not from self-appointed authority figures who decree a rating, but from the fans themselves. Maybe people in Manchester could get an idea of what a night out in Brooklyn is like, and Brooklyn can learn about Seoul, and Seoul about Lagos, and so on. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d also like to incorporate video at a later stage, and then even host live events, and then broadcast said events worldwide. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, there are a lot of ideas that I\u0027m kicking around. But before I get ahead of myself, I\u0027m starting with a podcast. If these ideas interest you (or even if they don\u0027t) I\u0027d be grateful to receive a pledge of \u00a31 a month. I\u0027m hoping that\u0027s small enough to possibly be painless, and it would encourage wider participation which would help to gather the momentum needed for these ideas to come to fruition. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s me. My name is Roy and I am creating a podcast, for now..."
