You might know me as the creator of \u003ca href=\"http://www.maiagame.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMaia\u003c/a\u003e the hyper-complex space colony base building game, or perhaps the developer who ported \u003ca href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/70300/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eVVVVVV\u003c/a\u003e to Windows, Mac, and Linux, or maybe the guy who did the effects in \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va-NXzhciVM\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKinectimals\u003c/a\u003e, the creepiest game ever made.

I\u0027m a 2d and 3d artist, and also a programmer. Either way you are still reading so that\u0027s a good start.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://maiagame.com/images/BlogScreens/delay/blogScreens1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you probably know, I am very keen on building and supporting communities around games and art, but have struggled to find a platform that lets me build and maintain them. Selling on Steam is often antithetical to trying risky new ideas and formats. Kickstarter was great, but many backers saw it as a pre-order and haven\u0027t wanted to discuss, critique or get stuck in to the creative process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HPk2LAIAIequTG1s2caocIO4cZbYOxz0o0sSkdUDuHgV_3Ewv61EcIDzg2Q9l8MeK8mnF4V8=w2560-h1440-no\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to use Patreon to eventually turn my development efforts away from hit chasing and audience appeasement to experimentation and creativity. I feel this platform might give me a good shot at that. I want to involve more people in the process of the creation of my games. I want to work with new indies and jam with them in my office to create exciting new things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.machinestudios.co.uk/images/Paint007.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst up I will be completing Maia. For anyone who missed this Kickstarter, this will be a great way to get the level of access to the development that a Steam purchase does not, with downloadable builds of every early prototype, some of the backer rewards and even the ability to grab some of our physical items produced for the campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://maiagame.com/images/BlogScreens/delay/blogScreens4.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Maia isn\u0027t the start, nor is it the end. I have many ideas that I want to explore, a lot of people I want to work with, a lot of code to write and at least seven pixels to paint.\u003cbr\u003e"
