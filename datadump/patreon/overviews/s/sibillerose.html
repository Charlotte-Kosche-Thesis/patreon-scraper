    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s a great question. I\u0027m a writer, stage manager, editor, lover of the arts, reader, and crafter (just to name a few things).\u00a0I have been fortunate and happy to create fiction as well as write my book reviews and creative musings on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sibillerose.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSibilleRose\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m even happier that real people read this work and appreciate what I\u0027m doing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy writing fantasy or supernatural stories, but every now and then a poem likes to weasel it\u0027s way in to my fingers. I also write straight fiction, but I love magic more than the real world so I always wander back to my fantasy worlds. Currently, I\u0027m working on two stories and I have\u00a0inklings for two or three more, along with writing short stories and flash fiction to develop my skills when I can\u0027t devote as much time to the longer stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also write about theatre life. I am working on writing stories centered around the life of live performance individuals (no, not actors, but the people who make them look and sound even better), and I\u0027m in the planning phase of writing an origin story about a prevalent theatre superstition (the Scottish Play anyone?).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI joined Patreon as a way to fund my writing efforts and to turn my aspirations into goals. I would love nothing more than to be able to work on my writing full time. But to do that I need to make a living, which right now is working as a theatre intern and writing when I\u0027m not in a production.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contributions will help me to have the freedom to keep writing and creating magic in the theatre without having to split my time with a \"real job\" and my preferred job. All of my work (posts, short stories, plays, poetry, musings) will still be available on my website (\u003ca href=\"http://www.sibillerose.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSibilleRose.com\u003c/a\u003e) for free, but my patrons will get access to my creative writing first as well as get access to a lot of information that wouldn\u0027t normally appear on my website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!"
