I started streaming in March of 2014 and love every minute of it! I want to be able to spend my time streaming for, playing games with, and discussing everything from Wrestling and Football to How to Mix Bar Drinks with each and everyone one of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I here? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spend around \u003cstrong\u003e50-60 hours and 6-7 days a week \u003c/strong\u003elive streaming on my twitch channel - twitch.tv/spectrumdominus. Add to that that I work 30+ hours a week to help fund the stream and that leaves little time to sleep, eat and work on improving the stream from the offstream aspect. I hope evetually that I can support my stream through donations and subscriptions, however Patreon is a unique way for viewers to help me reach my goal as the stream continues to build.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo anyone that supports me in any way, whether that is financially or just clicking the follow button. I appreciate any and all support given and hope that each and everyone one of you feels you are recieving as much (if not more) than you deserve, entertainment wise, based upon the support you are giving."
