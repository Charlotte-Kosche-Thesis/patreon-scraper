Though, BlackNews102 began its journey by making available\neducational programs and educational debates concerning the history and current\nissues of the Black Community it has recently expanded its programming. Now\nBlackNews102 in addition to its educational programming covers the gambit of\ninnovative news reporting affecting our community, elections critical to our\npeople, sports events, celebrity news, business, science and technology news.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNo other channel has the mix of experts that BlackNews102\nhas in its programming. We are proud to feature Phds, Professors, Doctoral\nStudents, Politicians, Community Activists and experts in their fields. We also\nfeature Celebrities, Entertainers and experts within that area. However, we are\nmost proud of giving a voice to the powerless, to the up and coming leaders, to\nthe community. We are also very proud of the Business Experts that we have on\nour shows that give cutting edge tips to give our community financial literacy\nand a pathway to economic freedom.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe believe empowerment begins with the Right Programming to\nits audience. Content Producers like myself have been recently censored by\nadvertisers who do not like our critique or our programming. They withdraw\ntheir ad dollars if we comment on Racial Politics that affect our community.\nMany of our programs that simply critiqued the system for institutional racism\nhave been demonetized. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are now seeking alternative methods to produce our\ncutting edge content and one of those methods is to ask you to be a Patron of\nour Station.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are asking for a commitment of just $2.00 a month to\ncontinue our great programming. For you this is less than ten cents a day. Of\ncourse some of you can afford $5.00 a month and more and we would certainly\nappreciated that, however you can help us today by your commitment of just\n$2.00 a month. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur initial goal is 5,000 subscribers. With this we can\nexpand our programs and actually give back to some of our content producers who\nwork hard for free to give you great programming because there work extends\npast the dollar.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBlackNews102 is not only the Leader but the Pioneer of what\nis called Konscious News and Entertainment and has launched a nationwide\nnetwork of shows just like this.We\nfirst began our Journey with publishing on Video Tapes, then to DVD media, then\nto You tube and now to Live Streams. However, the technology cost us greatly and\nthe lack of ad revenue is hurting us.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you do not support us then unfortunately our community\nwill be feed the same dis-empowerment content that keeps our community\ndis-empowered while others profit on our patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecome a Patron today and the only thing that you will be\nthinking about is why you did not do this sooner.
