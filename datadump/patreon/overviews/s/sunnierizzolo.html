I\u0027d LOVE to be able to turn these photos into a coffee table book. It\u0027s such an awesome, unique project.\u003cbr\u003e1. This will allow me to focus ONLY on shooting and editing the most girls, being able to afford the most awesome locations, and being able to prep and show you the newest content even faster\u003cbr\u003e2. This will fund the Bunny Mask Project, as a physical book, which will then become a reward for Patrons like you!",
