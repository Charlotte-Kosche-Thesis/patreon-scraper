    "summary": "Scars is a dramatic series that focuses on the intertwining lives of four friends and their struggling journeys. They each work to sort out their intersectional identities, and overcome difficult obstacles in their lives. Scars honestly examines the relationships we have with each other, and with ourselves through the narrative of these four characters. We explore what those connections mean and what happens when they break, leaving us fragmented and broken.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis show is geared towards those in the mid-twenties to mid-thirties range who are LGBTQ and also for anyone who has dealt with depression, self harm, bipolar disorder, borderline personality\u003cbr\u003edisorder or suicide. This show is for those who need to be reminded that they are not alone. Despite how dark \u201cScars \u201d will get, it is ultimately about hope in the face of overwhelming despair.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting this patreon, you are directly helping this show come to life. For web series, funding is limited and usually requires other funding. Scars is ambitious, especially for a web series. We\u0027re shooting in 4k and are a bit of a location heavy show. Your contribution goes a long way towards covering those hard costs. A monthly cashflow also means less time in between shooting and releasing episodes. We\u0027re hoping to go into production on episode one in August so we can bring you the very first episode by November at the latest. Your support means we can do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Scars\" is for anyone who has suffered any kind of mental illness, for\nthose who have been to the edge, and everyone who has lost someone to that\nsteep, dark cliff. Let us be that shining beacon, and follow it back. Know that\nthere are others who love you and care about you, even if you haven\u0027t met them\nyet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are not alone."
