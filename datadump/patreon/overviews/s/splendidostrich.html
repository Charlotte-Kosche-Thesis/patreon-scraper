You can still create a character with a huge degree of customisation, go out to clubs, meet men, go on dates, accidentally (or deliberately) get pregnant and of course have lots of sexy fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game\u0027s been in active development since 2013 and I expect the project to take at least a few more years before it\u0027s finished. I hope that this will let me make one of the deepest and most enjoyable adult games out there, even without fancy pictures or animations!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI shouldn\u0027t need to tell you about the game here though - it\u0027s completely \u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0to download and play. As long as you\u0027re old enough to enjoy explicit erotic content, you can get a copy at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://splendidostrich.blogspot.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e and try it for yourself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWorking on Newlife takes a lot of time and development effort. My financial situation isn\u0027t particularly good, and that\u0027s something that works to players\u0027 benefit because the reasons why it isn\u0027t good also mean that I have a lot of time for adult game development.\u003cbr\u003eA 3-5 year project is a major commitment to make without getting any income from it. I do intend to keep on with Newlife regardless, but without financial support I\u0027ll eventually need to spend less time on it and more on projects that earn me money - I have bills to pay after all!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBy raising money on Patreon I can continue putting long hours into improving Newlife while still making it available for free and as a special bonus, I won\u0027t even have to starve!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhat do you get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003eI like to think that people will support development if they\u0027ve taken enjoyment from the game and want to show their appreciation. I do think that if you\u0027re contributing to support Newlife then you deserve my heartfelt thanks and I certainly intend to offer rewards to show it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first reward level is early access. That lets you get hold of new releases of Newlife before they\u0027re made publicly available. Considering the amount of extra content that\u0027s already gone in there because of your support, I think it\u0027s fair that you get to see it just a little bit earlier!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second reward is voting on\u00a0new releases. A major update can take many months, so your decision has a big effect on what direction development will take. You\u0027ll also get to decide on smaller changes such as choosing a new skill to be added to the game or picking which sex scene is written for a milestone reward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe third reward for exceptionally generous patrons is to be a member of the Inner Circle group. This gives you access to posts about development progress and opportunities to give feedback on changes as I\u0027m working on them. I\u0027ll also sometimes send out pre-release versions for early testing to Inner Circle patrons and patrons who\u0027ve been helpful in finding bugs, although these are usually very buggy compared to the release versions so this isn\u0027t much of a reward!\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect most people to pledge at this level. Overall, the inner-circle level is for people who are very interested in the game and want to be as involved as possible in its development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fourth reward, quite simply, is that you get three votes instead of one when I run a vote for voter-tier patrons.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions about this Patreon or about the game in general then you can ask me here, in a comment on my blog, or on one of the forums I post on. I really enjoy talking about the game, and I get a real buzz knowing that people are playing \u0026amp; having fun with it. Thank you for reading this, and have a great day :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

As a milestone goal, I\u0027ll aim to add it during my free time when I normally wouldn\u0027t be working on the game.\u003cbr\u003eThis will give you the option to pick one of several possible choices for your starting wardrobe instead of having to buy your own. For example, you could start with a cutesy wardrobe full of adorable pink outfits, or a sex-kitten one with skimpy dresses and titillating nightwear. These will give you a much wider selection of clothes than the minimal set you currently start with, along with a wider variety of pre-created outfits.\u003cbr\u003e",

In fact, I can probably guarantee that they won\u0027t be.
