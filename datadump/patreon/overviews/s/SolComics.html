Sol Comics\u2019 short\nstories delve into\nmultiple genres, themes, and tones \u2013 from sci-fi and fantasy, to horror, to\nordinary life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSol Comics\u0027 History\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSol Comics began in 2011 when I first sat down to write \u003cem\u003eThe XII\u003c/em\u003e. \u00a0There have been plenty of setbacks and a lot of learning, but I love these stories too much to quit. Before creating the website, I had already written 16 issues of The XII, a graphic novel, and several short stories. I worked hard to ensure that I already had several stories colored, lettered, and ready to go so that I could offer a consistent, weekly product to my readers. We\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow You Can Help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne way or another, I will make Sol Comics \u00a0thrive, but with your help I can do it a lot faster. As a writer, my biggest contribution to the comic making process is scripts. But in order to bring the stories to life, I need artists, and that costs money. There are numerous costs to bringing a comic to life, such as web hosting, printing costs, and travel expenses, but as a writer, the cost of artwork is vital. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI only work with the best artists, and I want to continue to do so. With enough funding, I can focus more and more on comics. I can print more comics, attend more conventions, meet more fans, and spread the word about my comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Bit About Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSol Comics has come a long way since I first started on \u003cem\u003eThe XII,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and if it\u0027s going to reach the next level, I\u0027ll need your support. Every dollar counts. All of your donations are just that, donations. The content on the website is still free, and you can opt out at any time. You can pay as much or as little as your want, \u00a0but however much you donate, know that your dollars are paying some tremendous artists to work their magic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI can\u0027t tell you how much your support means to me. Sol Comics started as a labor of love, but with your helpit can be so much more. I love writing these stories, and I hope you love reading them. Thank you for reading. Thank you for your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
