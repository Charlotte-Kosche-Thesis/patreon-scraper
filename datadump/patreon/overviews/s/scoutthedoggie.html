All I want, is to keep doing what I do. This is how I like it, but I need support. Hopefully you\u2019re here because you like what I do too and you might wanna throw me a buck or two.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve always felt a bit weird about taking money from people who want to give it. \u00a0But in order to continue, I need to replace equipment, cameras, computer upgrades and buy new stuff such as a drone, without this, well..\u00a0I might as well give up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u2019s nothing wrong with you enjoying my work and there\u2019s nothing wrong with me accepting your support. I hope you are willing to be part of this with me :) I know it\u2019s a commitment, but you can road test it if you\u2019re scared and you can pull out before you\u0027re charged at the end of any month, so it\u0027s risk-free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease help however you can and I promise I\u2019ll do everything I can to earn it with the best airsoft videos and photographs I can create. \u00a0We\u2019re here to make this work together, and we will.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u2019s do this.\u00a0\ud83d\ude0e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScoutthedoggie\u003cbr\u003e............\u003cbr\u003efrequently asked questions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: \u201cwhy per month??\u201c\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: I did a Twitter poll asking people how they\u2019d prefer to give and Per Month was the winner. It feels unfair charging people random amounts of money at random times. A general giving seems simpler.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: \u201cWhat if I just wanna give you one-off money now and then?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: You\u2019re welcome to pledge for a month and then cancel it after the payment goes out - just do that whenever you feel able. Or take the ten pounds you have (for example) and give me \u00a31 every month so it\u2019s all spread out, increase/decrease as you see fit? Whatever makes you happy :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: \u201cHow much actually helps you?\u201c\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: everything helps :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: \u201cDoes Patreon accept PayPal?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Yes :)"
