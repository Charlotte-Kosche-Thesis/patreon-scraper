    "summary": "Hello, Dear Reader, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to show interest in my work;\nyour support is truly appreciated. As a Lunar Gemini, I tend to dabble in,\nwell, everything! Here, you may stumble upon paintings, music reviews, video\npieces, found sounds, and myriad other artistic endeavors. As someone whose\nearly art education was a stressful experience, I have shied away from formal\ntraining and am just recently learning to treat my creativity as a safe place\nto learn and grow.I am eager to learn and grow with you on this improbably\njourney through the cosmos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGiven my desire to share with you, I do not -- nor\nwill I ever -- require that anyone become a patron to engage with my work.\nComing from a lower-class, rural family myself, I am aware of how critically\nimportant the free access of information is. All I ask is that you please\nconsider pledging whatever amount you can afford if you find yourself enjoying\nmy work and want to see more. Patrons will receive simple expressions of my\ngratitude for the duration of their contribution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a white, gender-questioning individual, I implore you to\nalso support those artists who are most often overlooked by critics and\nhistorical narratives. I embody an extraordinary amount of privilege that\nsafeguards my body from a glut of structural oppression. As \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/adriennemaree\"\u003eadrienne\nmaree brown\u003c/a\u003e writes, \u201c\u003cem\u003eWhat we practice at a\nsmall scale can reverberate to the largest scale.\" \u003c/em\u003eWe all can -- and \u003cem\u003emust \u003c/em\u003e-- do better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, I appreciate your patience as this ever-evolving\nproject takes place. I am simultaneously ecstatic and nervous. I undertake\nthese works with your words of encouragement, constructive feedback, and\nfinancial support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe well,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShaun\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
