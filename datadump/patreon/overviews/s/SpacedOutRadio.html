     "about": "Spaced Out Radio was established in October of \n2014, when Host Dave Scott, and good friend and mentor, Jonny Enoch \nstarted setting up the puzzle pieces to create a quality, journalistic \nradio show delving into the most arcane topics not discussed on the \nmainstream. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe idea for Spaced Out Radio came after Jonny suggested Dave got back \non the radio to discuss his own personal experiences with the experts in\n their fields of research.  The idea behind the show was to be different\n from what others in on-line radio were doing.  So at the beginning, it \nwas decided that Spaced Out Radio would run seven days a week at two \nhours per show.  On November 30th, 2014, Spaced Out Radio went live for \nthe first time with guest Alfred Lambremont Webre, discussing \nexo-politics.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQuickly, Dave learned that many experts were looking for a new show to \ndiscuss their topics, that was serious, hard hitting and took a \njournalistic approach.  Rarely, right from the beginning, had Dave \nreceived declines on invitations to come on SOR.  Dave ran the show for \nthe first six weeks, seven days a week, before a brief chat on social \nmedia with James Tyson, led to James becoming the host of Spaced Out \nWeekend.  James, is a paranormal investigator and empath who has been an\n integral part of SOR, and has been hosting the Weekend Edition since \nJanuary of 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince its inception, Dave and James have had many of the top experts \npartake in the show.  From Andrea Perron, whose family experienced the \ntrue story of \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d, UFO Researcher, Stanton Friedman to \nCrypto Experts like Linda Godfrey and Lyle Blackburn.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSpaced Out Radio is a Canadian show, that has developed fans literally \nacross the globe, with listeners tuning in from Great Britain, France, \nCroatia, South Africa, China, India, Australia and New Zealand.  Show \ntopics that fans are most interested in are real life stories from \npeople who\u2019ve experienced the strange and unbelievable. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe common theme of Spaced Out Radio is to ensure the show stays true to\n the honesty and integrity its created since its introduction to online \nradio.  The questions are hard hitting, and direct.  However the motto \nis \u201cWe believe everybody, because we haven\u2019t stepped in their shoes to \nunderstand their experience\u201d.  Everyone\u2019s experience is different.  Dave\n and James plan to continue searching for the human stories to what is \nhappened here on earth and beyond the stars.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you wish to book Dave Scott or James Tyson for an interview, \nconference, or group discussion about Spaced Out Radio and/or Spaced Out\n Weekend, please use the contact information below.",
