Since then, it has taken us on an incredible\njourney. We spent a year wandering around the coast of Venezuela, two\nyears traveling back and forth between Panama and Colombia, and\nanother year in the Bay Islands of Honduras and the Rio Dulce of\nGuatemala. Over the rest of the past decade, we\u0027ve traveled\nthroughout the Bahamas, Eastern Caribbean, and up and down the East\nCoast of America.\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a reason that\nour boat was so cheap. It was largely unfinished, and it had been\ngrounded on a reef in a tropical storm before we acquired it. In\naddition to our new goal of bringing you entertaining and\ninspirational videos about doing it the hard way, we will continue to\ndo ALL of our own boatwork ourselves. It has given us a new measure\nfor what we value most in our lives, and we hope that we can find a\nway to share what we\u0027ve learned with you.\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003eWhile we occasionally\nhave regrets about our choice of such an ambitious project, it didn\u0027t\ntake long for it to spawn into a wonderful travel adventure. Over the\nlast decade-plus, we have learned a lot of things about following our\ndreams. Our efforts have illuminated an incredible amount of naivete\nthat we first had about the kind of energy and dedication it takes to\nbreathe life into them, but it has also shown us some unexpected\nrewards. \n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\n\t\tMore than likely, if\nyou\u0027ve found your way here, you\u0027ve already seen some of the other\nsailing vlogs about what it\u0027s like to be \"Out Here.\" Anyone\nthat has ever made a serious effort at abandoning the life that\u0027s\nbeen prescribed for them, and instead following what\u0027s in their\nhearts can certainly attest to feelings of swimming against the\ncurrent. But the cliche doesn\u0027t necessarily ring true. Sometimes,\nthere\u0027s just a little disorientation when you first jump in. We\u0027re\nalways going to be surrounded by those folks at the coffee machine\nwhose only goal seems to be convincing you that there isn\u0027t another\nway. Through our videos, we\u0027d like to share with you our most\ncompelling evidence to the contrary.\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003eOver a decade and 25,000\nmiles later we are still struggling, but also, continuing to reap the\nrewards of choosing our own direction. Our full time ambition is to\nreconstruct/finish our thirty year old boat and take you on an\nadventure with us to the edge of the Northern Icefield.
