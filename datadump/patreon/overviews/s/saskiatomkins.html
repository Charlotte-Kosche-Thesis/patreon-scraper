It\u0027s not always easy but it fills my soul up and seems to please others too. I love playing, I love performing, I love creating, I love teaching. Lucky me for having such a life. I also created 3 amazing children, which though totally wonderful people, are expensive to keep. \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(151,72,6);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149,55,52);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany years ago, artists relied on patrons to support their art, but they became less common. Now, Patreon.com is filling that need again and uniting modern creators with the necessary funds to keep doing what they do. I think a big shout out to the genius behind it, Jack Conte, is in order! I am so delighted to have stumbled across this community, and am looking forward to you doing what you do best, to help me do what I do best, so I don\u0027t have to sell my children (just kidding!). Luckily for me, they are insanely talented too, and they sometimes join me performing on film. You are welcome to\u00a0 watch my youtube videos for free, and I\u0027d never want someone to give what they haven\u0027t got, but if you can give financially, in return for your support, I have much to give back. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49,133,155);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49,133,155);\"\u003eA bit about me: I started violin when I was 7 years old in a school near Canterbury in England. Fell in love with Celtic music age 11 when a fiddler came to teach at my school.\u00a0 Spent my entire teenage time gigging in pubs, busking on street corners and playing in orchestras. I learnt to read the dots, to improvise, to swing, to have fun with music. While studying for a degree in jazz/popular music, I was introduced t\u003c/span\u003eo eastern European music, playing for dancers and the viola - what a wonderful instrument! I also fell in love with the Nyckelharpa but owning that instrument came into my life much later. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(36,64,97);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49,133,155);\"\u003eI toured with theatre companies (About this time the \u0027cello wandered into my life). I subbed for fiddlers in bands, I played around with electric sounds, rocked out with singer-songwriters, punk and Cajun music and ceilidhs. Then I met another amazing musician, had 3 children, moved to Canada, and here I am. I also play viola in an orchestra and play on peoples albums. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149,55,52);\"\u003eI have several groups with albums: \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Steafan-Hannigan-Saskia-Tomkins-and-Clan-Hannigan/143020335852397\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eClan Hannigan\u003c/a\u003e (my Celtic family band),\u003ca href=\"http://2ish.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e 2ish\u003c/a\u003e (a rootsy/jazzy duo), \u003ca href=\"http://www.cairdeascanada.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCairdeas\u003c/a\u003e, a Celtic trio with world music twist, and of course a duo with my husband \u003ca href=\"http://www.steafan.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSteafan Hannigan\u003c/a\u003e.
