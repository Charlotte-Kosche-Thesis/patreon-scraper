    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI love to teach\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been working as a teacher now for about 8 years and I really love it. To support my teaching a few years ago I created a YouTube channel so that students that missed my classes or were struggling with the material could learn in their own time, at their own pace. To my surprise the view count on the videos started to grow, as did the number of subscribers to the channel!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople from all over the world have started using my videos to learn 3D modeling skills using Maya. This ranges from people that can\u0027t afford to educate themselves or buy books and expensive online courses to people that are learning in college or university and need a little more help to get to grips with the material. I love that I can help out such a range of people and hope to continue to do so for years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I need your support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love creating these videos but I want to take what started as a quick way to improve my teaching, then became a hobby I am passionate about to the next level. I simply can\u0027t research, plan, shoot, edit and promote the videos as quickly as I\u0027d like to be able to. I have recently created a 40 step course on Maya 2016 for beginners. This should have taken me around 2 weeks at most - but 2 months in and I\u0027m still editing. With your support I\u0027ll be able to devote more of my time to creating my educational videos. This will mean that I can deliver content more often and to a higher standard. I\u0027ll also be able to cover all of the other topics that I\u0027m desperate to dig into. I have mostly covered 3D modeling skills and theory on my channel but I have so much more to give. I\u0027d also like to produce content on traditional animation, media production and media studies as well as study skills in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently work full time as a Media Production Lecturer and I love my job. But with your support my hope is to work 4 or 3 days as a lecturer and then devote some quality time to educating via my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Shane Whittington. I live in Worksop, UK and I\u0027m a full-time lecturer and a full-time Dad. I have a degree in Media Production and specialised in what used to be called New Media (now called digital media - or just media!). I\u0027ve been teaching since I was 22 and I love it. I was initially asked to deliver four three hour sessions on Adobe Flash eight years ago. I delivered these sessions and was then offered the opportunity to become a lecturer in the north of England. Seeing people grow in confidence as they learn something new is really rewarding and I\u0027m constantly looking for new ways to improve the way I teach.\u003cbr\u003e"
