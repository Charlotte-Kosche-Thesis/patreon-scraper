    "summary": "Hello,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://swordandscale.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSword and Scale\u003c/a\u003e fans! \u00a0Thank you for showing and interest in helping to support your favorite podcast. \u00a0Please consider donating monthly and becoming an official Sword and Scale Supporter. \u00a0I\u0027d like to take a few minutes to explain to you why this is important...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat it has taken to get here\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started this podcast in January of 2014, I wanted to create the best true-crime podcast anyone had ever heard. \u00a0I spent months before that planning, getting logos designed, getting the website built and the server set up, ordering equipment \u0026amp; software and testing it, and sound-treating a spare room in order to get pristine audio quality. \u00a0I spent thousands of dollars of my own money and an inhuman amount of time create this program, which many of you have now come to love as much as I hoped you would.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBetween the show\u0027s launch and today, there have been 105 hour-long episodes. \u00a0This show is very different than most podcasts. \u00a0Rather than a live recording of a conversation, we strive to tell a story using immersive production techniques. \u00a0Because of this, the average time to produce a single episode is much greater than your average weekly podcast, which oftentimes is recorded live with no editing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach of these episodes represents an average of 20-30 hours of research, fact-checking, preparing for interviews, interviewing, recording, editing, mixing, selecting artwork, writing show notes and site maintenance. \u00a0That\u0027s a total of 2,010 hours, or 251 full-time days,\u00a0of work. \u00a0For the first two years of the show\u0027s existence, this was all accomplished while holding down a full-time job in order to pay for mortgage, car, daily expenses, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine working two full-time jobs for two and a half years, with no end in sight. \u00a0It\u0027s been a lot of work to get to this point, but our true fans continue to make it worth it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLuckily, since those early days, fans have responded in droves and assisted us.\u00a0 That assistance has allowed us to hire a small staff to make more regular episodes possible, including the new bonus show we premiered last year called Sword and Scale PLUS which is our version of Sword and Scale which is just for supporters.\u00a0 Beginning this year, we\u0027ve announced that Sword and Scale PLUS is now also bi-weekly, which means that if you support us that the $5 level, you\u0027ll either get a commercial-free early release of Sword and Scale or a brand new episode of Sword and Scale PLUS...\u00a0 EVERY SINGLE WEEK!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe ask for your assistance too.\u00a0 Please give what you can and help us to continue to provide this high-quality content week after week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe New Show\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of last year we launched a new podcast produced exclusively for Patreon Supporters. \u00a0It\u0027s called \u003cstrong\u003eSword and Scale Plus\u003c/strong\u003e and you can get access to the entire back catalog as well as any future episodes starting at just $5 a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the beginning of Season 5 there are 20+ episodes available for instant access.\u00a0 Starting this season we will be releasing a new episode of Sword and Scale PLUS every other week, in between early commercial-free releases of the regular Sword and Scale Podcast.\u00a0 That means, for just $5 between both shows combined, you will have access to a new show every single week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that Sword and Scale PLUS is not the same thing as Sword and Scale REWIND.\u00a0 REWIND is an aftershow, independently produced and hosted by Lynette Carolla and Stefanie Wilder-Taylor.\u00a0 PLUS is a version of the original Sword and Scale podcast, hosted by Mike Boudet, which is available exclusively to Patreon supporters.\u00a0 It mimics the format and style of the regular show but contains brand new true-crime stories, insider insight, and is designed to provide a lot more of what our audience craves and expects from Sword and Scale.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease Contribute\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough we have had incredible success with our Patreon, the vast majority of listeners still do not contribute anything. \u00a0Our current number of supporters represents less than 1% of our listener base. \u00a0Imagine how much more we could do if every listener donated at least $1 a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please take a moment to think about what this podcast means to you and how many hours of content we\u0027ve already produced for you. \u00a0Then contribute anything you can afford, but consider some of the higher tiers if you can afford it, but even the smallest contribution is extremely helpful. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your continuing support and we hope you enjoy Season 5!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mikeboudet.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMike Boudet\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHost \u0026amp;
