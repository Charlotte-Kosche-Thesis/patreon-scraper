I\u0027m a guy who lives in Lowell, MA, a constant poet, a mildly hungry artist in search of a snack, the owner of the currently-on-hiatus-literary-magazine \"Shakespeare\u0027s Monkey Revue\", the proprietor of Anstey Studios at Western Ave Studios, the collector of a bunch of comic books, the owner of a very old orange cat and a man with an insane desire to create something truly sublime and great. I release an average of 1500-2000 poems per year on many social media and blog type sites, and I have done this consistently since 2005. As an artist, I also create sketches almost daily, more than a painting a month, and dozens of digital collages each year incorporating poetry and visuals. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Am I On Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027d love for you to be a part of my journey. I\u0027m going to create art every day whether your\u0027e with me or not, but in order to keep paying rent at my studio, and to re-start my magazine which has been on hiatus since 2009, I\u0027ve joined Patreon to raise money and share my work with people who enjoy and value poetry and art. I hope this is you. I\u0027d love nothing more than to build a relationship with you where I create art that you love and appreciate, that enriches your life and creates a dialogue between us that makes us both richer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat DO I make in My Studio?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. A lot of Poetry\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, this is the thing I do the most. Depending on how much time I have to spend doing other things (meaning, other jobs and work) I will be continuing to write a mininum of 3-5 poems a day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Shakespeare\u0027s Monkey Revue\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOnce I have the money to pay artists for their work, I will restart the Revue. This is a printed journal, which, again depending on resources, I will be expanding the online access and components.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Paintings \u0026amp; Drawings\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs long as I have my studio, I\u0027ll continue to pain, draw and create digital art. The amount and types of art depend on resources. Digital equipment, Paints, canvases, frames etc all cost money and time. But regardless, I\u0027ll at very least continue to make an image or two every day based on time and resources available to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. Occasional Videos\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is something I\u0027m excited to do more with, for patrons though, I\u0027d definitely offer video content of me reading my poetry, animations of poetry, and possibly commentary and Q\u0026amp;A if you\u0027re interested.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
