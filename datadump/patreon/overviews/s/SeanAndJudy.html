In the past, we happily forewent salaries and comfort because we love what we do. But now we have someone who needs us to become more responsible, more sustainable, less stressed\u2014and a bit more clean and tidy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe needed to change our lives to include a new priority, to provide a good home and future for our baby girl as well as all the animals here in Taiwan who need our help. What we realized was that we must create a way of bringing in money for ourselves for once, but in a way that helped us help more animals. And this is it\u2014and here you are, making our dream come true! Your Patreonage means we can focus on what we do best\u2014helping animals\u2014without worrying if we can pay the rent on time or keep our electricity from being cut off. It also means we can spend a little more time creating quality content that we hope moves you, entertains you, educates you, gets you thinking, or encourages you to guide our philosophies, policies, and direction\u2014we always want to engage with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to bring in enough money to cover what a fair salary would be for what we do. If we bring in more than that, we intend to use the extra income to do some benevolent travel, visiting places where we can help others help animals, raise awareness, or perhaps just help a dog or two become less fearful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2014Sean and Judy\u2014want to say THANK YOU for being such an important part of this new life we are entering together with our baby girl. We appreciate more than you could ever know\u2014and we\u0027ll say more about that in one of our videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLots of love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSean \u0026amp; Judy"
