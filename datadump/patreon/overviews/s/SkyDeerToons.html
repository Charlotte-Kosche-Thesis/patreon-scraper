    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eI\u0027m an animator and programmer, who makes furry porn. And I focus on the kind of things I enjoy and are personally interested in. At this point I could really not see myself doing anything else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking the kind of animations I do requires various body parts to be separated on different layers, so that each part of the image can be moved individually. Doing the separation is unfortunately a process that I find very tedious, and it adds a significant amount of extra work, on top of making the animation itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut with your support, I will be able to pay artists to not only provide the artwork, but also have it prepared to be animated. And the plan is to split the money equally with the artist, since I couldn\u0027t make animations without their art. This will allow me focus on animating and programming so that more work goes in to that, and it will keep me more motivated and excited to keep on doing it. I also hope that this will be a great opportunity for you to support the artists, big or small. And hopefully it can inspire some of them to start making animations themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to support me, you will be pledging once per month. However, if I don\u0027t release any new animations or games, I\u0027m going to make sure that you won\u0027t get charged for that month, as I want to make sure I give you something back for your generous support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find all my finished work over at \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/skydeertoons/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFurAffinity\u003c/a\u003e. But if you don\u0027t have a FurAffinity account, you can still get access to my latest animations and games here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
