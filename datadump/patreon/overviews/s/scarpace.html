    "summary": "Hello Art Patron, Fan, or casual observer ...\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve spent my life creating art, and a good portion of my adult life helping others to create and enjoy art for themselves. Much of it can be found on the internets, my website (www.ipaintfish), and in my personal home, studio, and gallery.\u003cbr\u003eI am here to share my work, and to help others reach their goals, as well.\u003cbr\u003eI am a professionally degree\u0027ed, educated human being and artist, a family man, a Dad, a Husband, and also, importantly - a creative type! \u00a0I LIVE to create my art, to help the next generation of artists, and to see the art of others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy art is widely collected around the world, and some of my art has been avidly used by art teachers across the globe to inspire, assist, and enhance both art students AND art educators \u0026amp; teachers toward enjoying the creation of art (often via my fish, as a theme, subject matter, or basis for learning an art technique or style).

I recognize the importance of learning and thinking skills, problem solving skills, and positive psychological benefits for the young artist or art student. :-) Your Patronage helps me to provide dedicated time, daily, to answer students\u0027 questions (and art teacher questions) received from all over the world. I enjoy knowing that I might of made a small difference in thelife of a student I will never meet, with my time and resources; I humbly think that YOU might enjoy knowing you have made a difference, too. :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a college-degreed, State Certified Public School Teacher, I have taught and instructed art in public school: Kindergarten through College, and I have many years and thousands of hours of experience teaching art and creative concepts for learners of all ages. Prior to completing my formal education in Education, I instructed at private schools, churches, home-school organizations, and at two different thriving Art Centers, one of which is renowned! As such, I\u0027ve volunteered thousands of hours teaching and instructing art for young artists from underserved neighborhoods and situations beyond their control. Via art, many smiles have been made and earned! Your patronage helps me to continue offering my art and life\u0027s work so that future generations might also be inspired to continue learning about art.\u003cbr\u003eKeep reading, more below ... :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-dft4-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/10390967_10152415942736943_7338503480901161376_n.jpg?oh=b32a370b16da0b8dc07f9baf3eda7df7\u0026amp;oe=5868563E\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee much more on my Patreon pages and listings (below), and at my website (www.ipaintfish.com). \u00a0If you like, \u0027Google\u0027 my name to view some of my past works (Scarpace + Art), or check out \"Abstract Fish Art + Scarpace\" there, as well.
