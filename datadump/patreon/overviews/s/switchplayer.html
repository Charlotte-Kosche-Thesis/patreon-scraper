If you love the Nintendo Switch, or you are keen to learn more about it and the games it has then you are in the right place!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho are we?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe are an independent Nintendo Switch magazine founded in 2016 and dedicated solely to\u00a0the Nintendo Switch. We released our first issue in February 2017 and we also have a website which you can check out via this link \u003ca href=\"http://switchplayer.net/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. Not now, though, read all this stuff first. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur magazine is\u00a0packed with loads of awesome Switch coverage, whether that\u0027s the latest reviews, features from amazing journalists, interviews with Switch developers and community contributions.\u00a0You don\u0027t have to go far on the internet to find Switch coverage online, as it\u0027s new and shiny and very popular but we hope that our little magazine will offer a unique, relevant and detailed impression for everything from the world of the Switch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why a magazine?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhy indeed! Websites will always win with lead times over magazines. They can update and react to current events and publish reviews far closer to release dates than magazines can. So the obvious question is why are we making one? We think that there is something cool about magazines. Having all that content in one place, being able to read at your convenience, and with a print edition, actually having something physical to hold. It also makes sense to us. I grew up with Mean Machines, then Nintendo Magazine System and a whole myriad of Future-based publications like Total! and Super Play before becoming a moderator on the Future-published Official Nintendo Magazine Forums\u00a0many years ago. Official Nintendo magazines may now be defunct but there is still that passionate and dedicated audience that wants that coverage and we hope to provide it for you! Interesting news, interviews and features, not to mention reviews that you can look at in an instant when you are looking for a new Switch title.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat can you do to help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe are making this for you, and the best thing you can do is to read it! Each issue will be released on digital viewing platforms for FREE each month, showcasing all the latest news, reviews, interviews and Switch content we can create. Read each issue, share each issue, tell your friends and even interact with us about it! We especially want YOUR feedback on how we can make this even better!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOf course, if you really believe in what we are doing then we would really appreciate some financial support, if you have the means to do so. Whether that\u0027s $2 for EXCLUSIVE PDF access or perhaps $6 to get yourself a PRINT copy posted to your house ($9 for those that don\u0027t live in the UK!) any help will be gratefully received! We even have a higher level of support for those that love the magazine!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen will issues be released?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs of January 2018, issues will be released every FOUR weeks - just like \"proper\" magazines. New issues will be issued in PRINT to supporters (and digitally to those that are eligible) before being released for FREE later on. We have so far released FOURTEEN issues. Issue 15 is out on May 3rd, with Issue 16 following on May 31st and these will be posted to everyone that pledged before April 29th 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe print version arrives to us shortly after your pledge successfully clears, we then post them out immediately. However, depending on where you live you could be waiting over a week to get yours, especially internationally; Switch Player originates from the United Kingdom. You will be charged from the 1st of each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of charges, our Patreon is set to \"Per Creation\"\u00a0which means you will only be charged every time we create a new issue. The long-term plan is to release specials too, which means you could be charged more than once per month - you can set the amount of times you are happy to be charged in your settings. We will always tell you when we are creating issues and will never create more than two in any month - but that\u0027s a long way off yet!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere can I find the complete collection?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe online version is hosted on Issuu, and you can access it via \u003ca href=\"http://www.issuu.com/switchplayer\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e link.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe PDF copies can be downloaded and are EXCLUSIVE to Patreon supporters, you\u0027ll find them as private posts here on our feed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat else do I need to know?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe print version will come at A5 size. For postage reasons and to keep costs down the magazine has to be under 100 grams for international orders. Magazines will always be a minimum of 40 pages, yet where possible we will exceed this - Issue #1 is 48 pages. Issues #2 and #3 are both 60 pages. Issue #4 was 56 pages and you get the idea. Going forward (and with the sheer number of Switch games being released) you are looking at 60 page issues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m new. How do I get previous issues?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThanks for joining us! Your first issue will be the next numerical issue which hasn\u0027t yet been charged, which is currently Issue 17. We have limited quantities of back issues available via our shop, which can be accessed \u003ca href=\"http://www.switchplayer.net/shop\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. We also have bundles available sometimes which saves you money on the magazines AND postage - for example our 10 issue package os available for \u00a329.99 with FREE UK postage meaning each issue is just \u00a32.99...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u0027t get my copy. What happens now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes the post likes to go missing, especially when sent over huge distances like our magazine is (thanks Royal Mail...). If your magazine doesn\u0027t arrive and your pledge successfully processed we will happily replace it. If it happens more than once or twice then we might have to look into why. There\u0027s also a chance you are in the wrong Patreon pledge. If you pledged $6 and live overseas then you will not be getting your issue monthly.\u003cbr\u003e"
