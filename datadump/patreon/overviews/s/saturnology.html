Do you like Internet videos about games that may or may not have a significant historical impact on the gaming industry as we know it? Then chances are you\u0027re a fan of the Sega Saturn, Sega\u0027s short lived and under appreciated 32-bit console that ate the dust of its competition as quickly as it was forgotten into obscurity. Have you ever wanted to learn more about this ill-fated console in one convenient place? With videos of varying length that go in-depth on the console\u0027s library of gems and duds? Then do we have the show for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is Saturnology!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ZDCuXOWk8sY?rel=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSaturnology is me, David Lewis, taking a look at the games, peripherals, and just plain weird stuff of the short lived and under appreciated Sega Saturn. I talk about a wide range of games from the Saturn library; stuff like racing games, platformers, puzzle games, shooters, and the occasional obscure import game. I generally make videos with a direct, no fuss, up front review style where I talk about the game, its quirks, pros, and cons that vary in length. While I\u0027m primarily a Saturn focused show, I do like to dabble in other Sega related stuff every so often, with my Saturnology Sega Show episodes, which covers a wider spectrum of Sega games on all platforms. I also do a livestream show on Youtube every Monday night at 9 PM EST called Saturnology LIVE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/RiFBhJGGyHo?rel=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSounds great, but what\u0027s with Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the very start, Saturnology has been produced on a shoestring budget (no budget). While the equipment I use ain\u0027t too shabby, it can be better, and I know that the show can improve greatly with some better equipment. Stuff like a new camera and lighting equipment, or more advanced editing software. iMovie is only capable of so much, and for some cool things that I\u0027d like to do in future, I need something better, preferably Adobe Premiere. Thats where Patreon comes in. Patreon gives awesome fans, like you, the ability to contribute to their favorite content creators via a monthly donation of moneys. With this monthly donation comes different perks, depending on what you donate. With me being a broke college student, I can\u0027t really promise any kind of physical goods right now, but what I can do is give fans and viewers some neat opportunities to be involved with the show. Stuff like access to a Patreon update blog/vlog, exclusive contributor livestreams, and Q/As. If you\u0027re gonna donate money to my sad excuse for internet programming, then I at least want to give you some cool opportunities to contribute to the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/zkoIM6M96Rk\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027ve convinced me, but what\u0027s the catch?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere isn\u0027t any catch, but I should make one thing clear. Saturnology is and always will be a free show to watch. I don\u0027t believe that adding any kind of production value to an internet review show about video games can warrant people having to pay to watch it. That sounds pretty dumb if you ask me. What I hope to accomplish with this Patreon is to give my fans the ability to contribute monetarily to the improvement of the show, and only if they choose to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eClosing thoughts\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen I first started making Saturnology in July 2012, my intention was to make more people familiar with the Sega Saturn with detailed, quick, and interesting videos. A few years, many episodes, and countless livestreams later, the spread and popularity of the series has been a phenomenal experience for me. This is something that I absolutely love doing, and until I run out of Saturn games, I don\u0027t see myself stopping any time soon. It\u0027s people like you, who love the Saturn and love the series, that keep me going. You have my thanks and undying gratitude for how far the series has come since it\u0027s inception. Now let\u0027s make it better, together!\u003cbr\u003e"
