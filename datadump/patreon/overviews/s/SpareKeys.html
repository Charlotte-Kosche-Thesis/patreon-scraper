I successfully finished my first\nproject, \u003ca href=\"http://www.kaspall.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKaspall\u003c/a\u003e, and I\u0027m now working on my\nsecond. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sparekeyscomic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSpare Keys for Strange Doors\u003c/a\u003e is a collection of short stories about Toby Hathaway and Marion\nSark; a couple who work as Specialists (paranormal investigators) in\na nondescript city in modern day England. They deal with a wide\nvariety of cases and creatures \u2013 some of which you might recognise\nfrom myths and legends, and some that I just flat out made up because why not? I love the idea of something strange being just around the corner, and so the stories mix the mundane and the magical - with some of the real-life challenges people can face (both large and small) thrown in as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpare Keys for Strange Doors updates weekly, and will always be free to read online. You can start at the beginning \u003ca href=\"http://sparekeyscomic.com/index.php?comic=20110715\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, or catch the latest update \u003ca href=\"http://sparekeyscomic.com/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve loved comics ever since I was a teenager, and putting my own \nstories in front of an audience and hearing back from readers makes me \nvery happy. The webcomics medium especially suits me down to the ground -\n it\u0027s a great opportunity for learning, experimenting and making \nprojects that are close to my heart, without worrying too much about \nmistakes or other peoples opinions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past, I\u0027ve paid for the comics out of my own pocket ... but now I\u0027ve got a family, and with more money heading out of the door these days, it\u0027s about time I got my \u003cdel\u003eobsession\u003c/del\u003e, sorry, \u0027hobby\u0027 to start paying its own way a little. The money from this Patreon campaign will help support my work, by providing funds for things like art supplies, software, hardware, ad spots and printer cartridges. With your help I can turn my comics into something that brings money into the household, rather than taking it out - for which I would be enormously grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll patrons will get access to Spare Keys pages at least one week early, with further rewards if you donate a little more (as detailed below). Anything that you can give would be a big help - and, as always, thanks for reading! \u003cbr\u003e"
