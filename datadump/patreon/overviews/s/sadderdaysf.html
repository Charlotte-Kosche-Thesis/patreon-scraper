    "summary": "Sadderday is monthly emo, pop punk, and post hardcore dance party in San Francisco California. We aim to embrace the totality of the movement, without the elitism that has enveloped the community in recent years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month we come together to celebrate the music that means the world to us and our friends. We dance and sing all the bad parts away with friends, family and strangers alike. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn our aim to be as inclusive as possible our goal is to not ever charge a cover for the party, to be safe space for a subculture defined by it\u0027s inherent outsiderness that continues to today. But as the party continues to grow month to month, the costs mount.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are someone who is able to help, this is your opportunity! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want this to be the best thing it can be, and have a vision for ways that in can grow and get better but are limited by money, like all great things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny money we are able to make through here will directly go to bettering the monthly Sadderday party. This can be as simple as: better/more decorations, party favors or advertising, and hopefully as time goes on, better equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will never begrudge your for not being able to give here, and if you come out to the party and tell your friends we will still love you! But this is also an opportunity to make this the best thing it can be and gives you an inside track on being part of it! We love this scene, we love this music, and we love the community that has been built here and we want nothing more than to continue to help foster its growth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you of course for all your support, whatever shape it takes! We will see you the second Saturday of the month like always!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;3 Holly Hox + Douglock\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. As always, if you have *any* questions whatsoever about any aspect of this Patreon, the Sadderday party itself, or anything else, don\u0027t hesitate to let us know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
