Being financially stable enough to actually continue the comic version of Survivor Island, the story of Anime-Toon Institute, and work on new comics on top of that for my watchers is what drives me to do this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m someone who never dreamed I\u0027d get as much love and support drawing a bunch of cartoons in funny, silly, and embarrassing situations. The fact that people love all the goofy faces and weird situations is the kind of joy I\u0027d only ever imagined could exist but to see it as a reality is a humbling experience. Whether you pledge something or nothing at all, if you\u0027re reading this and you enjoy my weird stuff, then thank you truly from the bottom of my heart."

Nothing would make me happier then to be able to provide my audience with consistent comics and content that have been on the back-burner for so long now. My Survivor Island series could be a full comic again. I could continue Anime-Toon Institute. I could even make entirely new comics on top of that to get out all the ideas I have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHumiliation and embarrassment were the things I experienced and avoided a lot growing up but with my hands I\u0027ve crafted a way to make it a fun and funny kind of experience that brings people together through the matter of various cartoonishly exposed undergarments and painful knocked out expressions for fictional characters. If you\u0027re into that kind of stuff then join me on my journey to help pay the rent and maybe even make this a bit of a job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Ideas\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA while ago I made the painful decision that if I were to continue some of my projects they\u0027d have to be scaled down to being just a single character image and a story. But truthfully I don\u0027t want that to be the case. I\u0027d like to have it so that if I start something out as a comic I get to finish it as a comic and one of the ways I can do that is by making enough money to make it a viable thing I have to pay attention to. Non-stop comics sounds like it\u0027d be a fun thing to do again should it be something I don\u0027t have to stress over not having enough time for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve still got kinks to iron out for the rewards I\u0027ll offer but I want to let everyone know that I\u0027m not planning on making it too restrictive. If everything goes well, I should be offering you some special pictures and comic pages for supporters every month. Some of it may end up on my normal outlets but some of it may not depending on what it\u0027s about. I\u0027ll have to wait and see. But on the whole, I do want there to be an extra special something you all get as a way of saying thanks for allowing me to do this. Tiers are going to be hard to figure out but I want to do something fun as a group effort for all those who participate eventually. Stay tuned.\u003cbr\u003e",
