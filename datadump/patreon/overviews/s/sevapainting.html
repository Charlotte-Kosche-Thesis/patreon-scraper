    "summary": "Thank you for being a part of my creative process. I have set up this Patreon page to share my stories and art, as well as create community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I\u0027ve been drawing since I was a child in Ukraine, I first began to make paintings in 1995 -- soon after coming to Mexico. I lived in Mexico for a few years before moving to the United States. Though I\u0027ve tried other mediums, my favorite one is acrylic on canvas or wood panel. I\u0027ve shown my paintings around the Pacific Northwest in various venues.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve included a more lengthy interview about my art below, if you\u0027d like to know more about me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again -- I really appreciate your support. The various levels of rewards are listed to the right. Don\u0027t forget that I\u0027ll give away a painting once I reach 100 patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can check out more of my art at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sevasart.com/\"\u003ehttp://www.sevasart.com/\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. On another note, I also teach many languages online (\u003ca href=\"http://sevalanguages.com/\"\u003ehttp://sevalanguages.com/\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen did you get interested in art?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is impossible to say when I started to be interested in art. It seems like I have always been interested, even before I knew what the word meant. It\u0027s clearly a family trait as everyone in my family draws or paints. I grew up between Kiev\u0027s artistic environment and a tiny village near Chernobyl -- is the same as it was hundreds of years ago. The clash of the urban and artistic with rustic and primitive created tension that resulted in my necessity to paint. My somewhat unusual life experience produced somewhat unusual vision of the world. Later, my extensive travels and my interest in stories increased the urge to paint and to tell my stories through painting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is art to you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArguably, art is impossible to define. Nobody knows what art is. The infinity of its definitions proves it. The only thing I know is that art does not \u201cprogress\u201d or \u201cdevelop\u201d; it is not better today than it was ten thousand years ago. It is probably not worse, either. Joan Miro used to say that art has been deteriorating since the time of the cave paintings of Altamira. The good thing that it has not disappeared and looks like it is not going to. I explore the brighter sides of what we call \u201cart\u201d and since I am a painter and not an art critic, I have given up trying to define it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere do you get the ideas for your paintings?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy paintings are almost always connected to words and stories. Most of them are illustrative and are connected to a variety of folk tales, myths, songs, stories and proverbs. Some are easily recognizable and some are obscure, but the storytelling element is almost always noticeable in the paintings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho inspires you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe painters that influenced me the most are Niko Pirosmani, Mexican muralists, Henri Rousseau and Ivan Generalic as well as the anonymous creator of the Paleolithic paintings of Altamira.\u003cbr\u003e"
