On tournament and stream alone, I\u0027ve found a living in smash, arms, and cuphead... but that doesn\u0027t make it a comfortable one. Ideally I would like to exceed my needs for the purpose of hiring staff to grow out my channel and even create an organization one day. The people I\u0027ve met on this amazing journey have driven me to unforetold heights of happiness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It goes without saying that supporting me through Patreon is in its own right an act of charity. You\u0027re going above and beyond to help me.\u00a0I wouldn\u0027t be here without you guys, and that\u0027s why I\u0027m pushing so hard to realize my dream to its furthest possible extent. Thank you for supporting me on this journey. I will always fight to be the peoples champion. Afterall, I would be nothing if not for the grace of my friends and fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0~Sol\u003cbr\u003e"
