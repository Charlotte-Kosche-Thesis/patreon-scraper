Although I have found success in nuclear chemistry, due to personal reasons I am no longer working in that field. But, what many would view as a major mistake, I choose to look at as an opportunity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wish to become a published author, but not only in scientific journals. I want to become a published author from the fictions I write. I know that many authors will abandon their work, which can be frustrating for the readers, but I assure you I will not. Even if I lose both arms and go blind, I will dictate the rest of the story to someone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eG3RZGZ.jpg\"\u003eBecause self publishing is expensive! Although I plan on doing much of the work myself, there are some things I just cannot do. I will need to hire an editor, proofreader, pay for ads to promote my work, pay for publishing, and as proud as I am of my meager skills in Photoshop, hiring a cover artist is a must.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tSR3HLi.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow you may be asking, \"why should I help this guy reach his goals?\", and that\u0027s a very valid question. The reason is, I will not just shamelessly take your money, I offer perks! Though the perks may be small now, I intend to expand on them as I grow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, everything I post on RRL is just my first draft. It is not a finished, polished product in any way. However, for just $1 each month you will see the rewrites of my fictions which will not be posted anywhere else, and you also get early posts to chapters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease read the reward tiers carefully and decide if they are enticing enough for you to sign up. And thank you for supporting me in the creation of my fiction!"
