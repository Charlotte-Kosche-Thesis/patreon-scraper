To climbe over this giant 1001-Wall will force him to sketch a lot in traditional way with pen and paper and will bring his craftmenship to the next level. Certainly he will loose the scare to make the first strokes on paper.\u00a0All the faces he will doodle in a black sketchbook.\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\n\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWHY HE IS ASKING FOR SUPPORT?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eNot because he do not have anything to eat. Mostly he eats corn, vegetables and lenses - and this is quite affordable in his location. Not because he want to trawel around the world with your money to produce a lot of entertaining \"selfie\" videos from places where you will never be. And not because he want to pay a assistant, a sherpa, a donkey, 6 huskies and his mom to carry around the havy expensive equipement.\u003cbr\u003eHe makes enough money in a 9 - 5 job in the industrie. His problem is that he like to draw and he would like to make a living with it. But, what he do not know is. That there are a lot of higly talented artist around the world from expansive artscools with lot of connections in the creative industrie.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHe thinks with your help it would be able to spent more time\n on his self-education in sketching and drawing. He thinks nothing was ever handed to him. He thinks all he know about drawing is hardly gained experiance from working alone on own art projects - but come on he is doing it sice he is five. He never went to an art school. He is thinking the cost are to high and the way is to far to move to Asia or States to take classes in special schools. But again, this guy he had enough time to gain some money. He used to work as a shepherd by reaching 6th grade in a small belorussian village to help his parents to sell more milk on the market. - \"Where is all of this easy money Evgeni?\" \u003cbr\u003e\nSo guys, please don\u0027t hesitate to not support Evgeni in his stupid \nchallege. This guy is just to cool and to lazy for his cossy 9 - 5 job.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you support him just because you can you would not help him to \nchallenge his challenge. You would just give him more reasons to stay at\n home, to sleep as long as he want and to be his own boss someday maybe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBy the end of this challenge he want provide all the created sketchbook pages scanned in high resolution. And as a special reward the last 5 sketches will be the faces of his first 5 level 1 supporting Patrons, if he will get any.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWARNING!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003ePatreon could turn to his main source for financial support for creating creative stuff for you!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e"
