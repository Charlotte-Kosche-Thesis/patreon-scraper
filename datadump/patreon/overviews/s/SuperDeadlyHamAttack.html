    "summary": "Hi everyone. Super Deadly Ham Attack here. I\u0027m using Patreon basically as a tip jar; if you\u0027ve enjoyed my stories over the years and want to throw some bread in my jar (not literally. That wouldn\u0027t even fit, silly), here you go - and thanks in advance; regardless if you want to contribute anything or if you\u0027re just a fan, I appreciate your time reading my stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for what I write, it\u0027s erotic combat - usually pro-wrestling or boxing, but also streetfights, catfights, sexfights, etc. try to vary the tone a bit, so some stories are silly, or sweet, or dark, or personal and bitter. As for what they have in common, all of these fights always include combat, and always include sexual content - sometimes the winner getting the loser off to subdue them, or getting them off as a humiliation move or power play afterwords, or getting themselves off. In addition to this, all of them have three basic rules:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- No underage content - everyone\u0027s at least 18. (Fair amount of MILFs, too)\u003cbr\u003e- Nobody\u0027s really getting hurt in these stories - whenever I ask my wife to read one over, she\u0027ll scroll down a few sentences into the fight and suggest I add \"Then I went to the hospital to treat my concussion,\" but there\u0027s no permanent injuries in my work; I am for a kind of cartoon violence where someone can get punched a dozen times, take a few elbow drops and a piledriver and the only thing they\u0027ll have seriously injured is their pride. (That said, I am working on a deathfight series, but it\u0027s in virtual reality. Like you get into a memory lounger from Fallout 4, and it plugs directly into your mind, so you feel everything in VR, but of course you don\u0027t really die, you just wake up. Wow, this point is getting way long)\u003cbr\u003e- Everyone is aware of the stakes - in other words, all the fighters in my story are giving consent to whatever happens to them if they lose; nobody\u0027s an unwilling participant, so you don\u0027t have to feel bad if someone loses a match after literally putting their ass on the line. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor what to expect from this Patreon - after thinking it over, I don\u0027t want to put anything on here that will require you paying to read a story, so there\u0027s only one reward tier ($1), and it only unlocks a small bonus feature: Regular looks at upcoming stories I\u0027m working on. Of course, if you want to give more than $1, go for it! The more I\u0027m earning on here, the more motivated I\u0027ll be, or at least the worse I\u0027ll feel when I set aside an evening to write and end up watching dumb YouTube videos instead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, here\u0027s where you can actually read the stories themselves:\u003cbr\u003eMy blog - everything should be posted here: \u003ca href=\"https://superdeadlyhamattack.blogspot.com/\"\u003ehttps://superdeadlyhamattack.blogspot.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMale vs Female forum (almost everything should be posted here): http://www.malevsfemale.org/search.php?do=finduser\u0026amp;u=66320\u0026amp;starteronly=1\u003cbr\u003eFree Catfight forum (only F/F stories posted here): \u003ca href=\"https://www.freecatfights.com/forums/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;sa=topics;u=15726\"\u003ehttps://www.freecatfights.com/forums/index.php?ac...\u003c/a\u003e - should also link right to my threads, although this forum shows them all on one page, so you can just scroll down and read everything. (And if anybody knows how to stop this forum from converting \" into ?s, let me know)\u003cbr\u003eOh, and my books! Here\u0027s my Amazon author page: \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Susan-Alexander/e/B018PJO8D2/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.amazon.com/Susan-Alexander/e/B018PJO8D2/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think that\u0027s it! If you want, you can get ahead of me here, comment on my blog, reply to or private message me on either one of the linked forums, or email me at superdeadlyhamattack (at) yahoo.com. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003e"
