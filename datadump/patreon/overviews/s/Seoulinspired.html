Originally from New Zealand I have a love for traveling and blogging (as well as photography!). In Korea I have been able to realise my passion for blogging and have been regularly posting for around a year now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, managing work and school while also trying to manage such a time consuming and expensive hobby hasn\u0027t been easy and it is taking its toll. I am creating this page in an effort to be able to create a source of income from something that I actually enjoy, something that I have a passion for.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRecently I have started my new blogging site at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://seoulinspired.com/\"\u003eSeoulinspired.com\u003c/a\u003e which will be where I post regular blogs and updates on my life and my travels. There will be a variety of content ranging from photos, to blogs, to possibly videos in the future. Wherever I travel I will be sure to make blogs, so you can also expect more than just content from Seoul!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI understand that many people can\u0027t financially support me, and that\u0027s okay. Any support at all is appreciated. However, for the people that support me here on Patreon I will provide special offers and content to. To see more details please have a look at the rewards on the right of the page!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
