    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eHi, I\u0027m Tobias - otherwise known by my online handle, SorcererDave. I run two a YouTube channel and a Twitch channel where I make gaming videos and streams for you wonderful folks on the internet to enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making gaming videos, mostly in the \"Let\u0027s Play\" format for about six years now. I guess you might consider me part of the \"old guard\" of Let\u0027s Players, who were doing this hobby before YouTube became owned by Google, in what some might call the good old days, I guess. While I\u0027ve noticed a lot of channels move on, and the trend has become \"short, snappy, with silly thumbnails = popular\", I\u0027ve chosen to stick with the old way of doing things - I firmly believe that there are people out there that still enjoy the slower, more thoughtful, less cut up format, where quite often I\u0027m also playing old games that I feel deserve the limelight more than the newest, most popular releases. In a rapidly changing world, I like to think my content has become something of a stable anchor for folks to return to at the end of a long day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been doing all this for almost six years in total now, and it\u0027s safe to say that on the internet, six years might as well be a lifetime - things have changed a lot. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI got started doing this purely as a hobby, but it soon evolved into something altogether more serious, and my channel became popular enough to support me through my university education - more as a happy accident than anything else. Since then I\u0027ve worked to make a living through doing this, and so far it\u0027s gone pretty well. However, where once upon a time ad-revenue was enough to live by, these days it\u0027s not really the case any more. Huge economic changes lately in the wider world combined with the now over-saturated market of monetized YouTube channels means ad-revenue is the smallest it\u0027s ever been. This is where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon, my viewers are able to directly support me through the power of their wallets, independent of any other institutions like Google or Twitch who want to extract their pound of flesh, making sure I have food on my table every month, and can continue to produce this entertainment for you for the indefinite future, no matter what content platforms and changes come and go in the years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy the videos and streams I do, then you may want to consider contributing to their production - and this page is the place to do it. You can pledge as much or as little as you like and cancel your subscription whenever you wish, but all contributions are greatly appreciated by myself - more than silly little words typed here can really express. To be able to not only do what I love for a living, but also to know that I have complete security no matter what changes in the world of google, advertising markets and the economy in general, is a great gift - and I thank you all every day for choosing to give it to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003c/div\u003e"
