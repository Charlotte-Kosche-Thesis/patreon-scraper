    "summary": "Working from the script born of the imagination and talented wordsmith, I am in the process of creating the first episode of an eight part Graphic Novel. Bound to silence until the initial release, I can only express my excitement and dedication to the visual realisation for this project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the initial release, my attentions will be focused on the remaining episodes. Furthermore, along with it\u0027s co-creator I will recommence\u00a0work on another Graphic Novel \"Broken\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe seeds of this story began back in 2008, the combination of an offhand comment and an innocent misbelief, seeded and quickly took root in my mind. Originally the concept was to be nothing more than a short comical story based on those events. Over time the idea grew into what was to be my first foray into comic book art. As with some creative endeavors, that simple comic concept refused to allow itself to be resolved. Over time it evolved in depth and complexity all that remains\u00a0from its humble origins was a character name.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBetween conceptual and metaphorical layers intermingle subtext with idealised musings lies\u00a0what\u00a0\"Broken\" became. A collective title for the core narrative trilogy (along with several shorter side tales) centered around the (anti) heroic journey of a neurotic freelance investigator and his assistant. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those interested a selection of development art work can be seen on my website. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://silentimage.weebly.com/broken-a-graphic-novel.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://silentimage.weebly.com/broken-a-graphic-nov...\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eFor a taste of the incomplete Prologue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://silentimage.weebly.com/prologue.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://silentimage.weebly.com/prologue.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
