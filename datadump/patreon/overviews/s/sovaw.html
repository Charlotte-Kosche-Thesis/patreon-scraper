    "summary": "We\u0027ve been\u00a0dealing with and working on diversity in tech since 1999 focused on women and girls of color in tech.\u00a0 Social networks have failed at the social part despite the focus on building communities and engagement. We are focused on the ways to highlight the problems and focus on the solutions. This includes data on all the nuances of diverse communities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwenty years ago, the Internet as we know it did not exist, save for a few early adopters. Most of these pioneers were men, with women comprising less than 1% of users. This rarity of women appeared to prompt unsolicited comments of a sexual nature, but as they were few and far between, the potential challenge seen today remained unacknowledged. However, just recently, Pew Internet Life reported that American use of the internet is at an all-time high of 73%. The result? Sexually- and racially-charged comments continue to reach new heights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStop Online Violence Against Women, raises awareness and funding to stop online harassment. SOVAW addresses inadequate laws and policies that lack protections for women in particular women of color. The focus is on online violence against women laws, legislation and policy change at the local and federal level of government agencies. It is also holding technology and social media companies accountable for their\u00a0actions or inactions. SOVAW will serves as a resource of services and options for women and women of color, based on their level of harassment or violence, and hopes to include diverse stories of women who are willing to share their experiences. We highlight and include partnering organizations, legislators \u0026amp; companies who are working together to address this important issue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport this work by contributing here and supporting the work that allows us to collects data, stories and media analysis on this important issue that ultimately affects all of us as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/president-obama-applauds-every-brave-woman-speaking-out-against-online-harassment_us_56eab776e4b065e2e3d88f2f\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePresident Obama has agreed and supports\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will continue our work in the following ways:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCollecting data, surveys, and reports\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe spend an enormous amount of time reviewing and collecting data on the ongoing changes in the online environment.
