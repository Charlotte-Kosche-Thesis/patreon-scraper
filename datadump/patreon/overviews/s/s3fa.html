    "summary": "Who is Site 3 Fire Arts? We\u2019re a collective of engineers, artists, programmers, and makers based out of Toronto. We\u2019ve tackled several big ambitious projects in recent years including: Super Street Fire, a live-action adaptation of Street Fighter 2 where you punch fire at your opponent; Riskee Ball, a fiery reimagining of classic skee ball; and the Charcade, an entire fire arcade at Burning Man 2013. We\u2019ve exhibited our work at Maker Faire, Burning Man, Nuit Blanche, FIGMENT, and many other art festivals across North America, including a segment on Daily Planet this summer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://site3firearts.ca/patreon/maxresdefault.jpg\" style=\"width: 628px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cfont\u003eRiskee Ball as part of the Charcade, Burning Man 2013\u003c/font\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy do we need your support?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPeople loved the Charcade in 2013 so much that we\u2019ve decided to make something even bigger and more insane: a fire carnival, otherwise known as the Charnival. We\u2019re hoping to create a festival-within-a-festival showcasing incredible fire art carnival games, rides, and other freak shows, with better gating and entrances and even more spectacle. We already have plans to renovate Riskee Ball and are talking through the details of another large and delightfully death-defying build: bumper cars!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://site3firearts.ca/patreon/crash-and-burn.png\" style=\"width: 541px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cfont\u003eConcept art for Crash and Burn.

We unfortunately don\u0027t break even, either - as a labour of love, we build these interactive fire art experiences to share with our own money, unpaid time, and personal equipment. We\u0027re supported by the generosity of organizations such as Burning Man, Maker Faire, and other local arts groups, which goes a long way but never completely funds our endeavours. We\u0027ve never charged pay-to-play, and we hope to keep it that way.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBe a patron of art as well as education?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSince fire art isn\u0027t something that\u0027s taught in school, we make it a strong priority to teach others the skills we\u0027ve learned over the last five years, and we want to share that information with you as well.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe will be holding flame effect workshops for other artists and groups interested in participating in the Charnival.

We make cool stuff, teach you how to make cool stuff, and then you build on it and make even more cool stuff!"

     "description": "Ontario has the strictest fire art laws in North America. All public displays of fire art are required to have a high value insurance policy behind them, and the TSSA has to inspect installations each time they are set up.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf, by some miracle, we reach this level of funding, we will be able to maintain our insurance policy independent of specific events. We\u0027ll also be able to afford greater interaction with the TSSA (at $190/hour). By having our plans reviewed and familiar to the TSSA, our per-event inspection cost will be significantly cheaper - allowing us to set up at far more events in Ontario.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWe\u0027d love to set up our art at home more often. Please help us make this happen?",
