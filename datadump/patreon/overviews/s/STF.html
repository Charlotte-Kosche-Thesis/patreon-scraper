    "summary": "STF has over the last few years devoted a lot of time and effort to play and promote The Hobbit/The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game. We have also broadened our range of systems. The systems we want and are able to produce videos for are: Middle-Earth SBG, Age of Sigmar, Bolt Action, Blood Bowl, Guild Ball, Frostgrave, Infinity and several more miniatures and board games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have because of startup help been able to invest in terrain, books and camera equipment and have from March 2016 produced our SBG Grand Campaign, an effort to tell the entire story of middle earth chronologically from before the battle of the Last Alliance to the Scouring of the Shire. At the time of writing we are 40+ episodes in and have just completed filming of The Hobbit Unexpected Journey. In 2017 you will see the complete Hobbit Trilogy unfold as well as a special series from The Fall of the Necromancer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything we do is a community effort as preparation of models and terrain are shared between different contributors. But we want to improve, with your help we can invest in our youtube channel as well as over time rent a studio for the sole purpose of shooting videos. Better lighting, microphones, editing software, a secondary camera, specialized terrain and more is some of the things we would be able to invest in in the short term with a studio being the ultimate prize.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur regular Youtube content will always be free but you as a patron will get early access to some of the videos as well as an exclusive video each month, for which the patrons will choose the system. On our super secret patron group on Facebook there will be a monthly poll where you can decide on which system we will play. The winning system will be removed from next months poll to provide constant variety.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will get access to a register of all the exclusive video\u0027s so you don\u0027t miss any.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur 10 dollar or more patrons will also get access to several discounts \u00a0from businesses we promote (commission work, battlemats from \u003ca href=\"http://www.deepcutstudio.com%29/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDEEP-CUT STUDIO\u003c/a\u003e and more discounts will be added as we go along)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eYou can pledge as much as you would like, the set pledges are a suggestion, you will recieve all rewards of a equal or lower amount that you support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeet our hosts:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAndreas \"the Norwegian Viking\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe founder of STF and has almost 25 years of wargaming experience.
