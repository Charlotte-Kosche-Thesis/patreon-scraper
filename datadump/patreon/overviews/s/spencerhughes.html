    "summary": "Some of you may be familiar with my radio career that has spanned three decades on ABC Radio, Clear Channel, Cumulus Media, iHeart Radio, and Fox NewsTalk. From terrestrial radio to satellite radio, from Internet radio to podcasting, I\u0027ve enjoyed sharing my views with you on everything from pop culture and politics to philosophy and the Paranormal. I\u0027m really into motivational thinking and the Law of Attraction. Spirituality and the mysteries of Life are some of my favorite topics for discussion. As the father of six beautiful kids in a Brady Bunch blended family, family related stories and topics are also very popular with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt age 11, I decided I wanted to be a radio talk show host. Ten years later, I was interning at one of the legendary newstalk stations in radio history. In less than three years, I was hosting my own talk show in the 4th largest radio market in America, San Francisco.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTalk radio continues to lose its soul and spirt, largely because very few people are still willing to think outside the box. That\u0027s why everything sounds like a clone of everything else. There is so little originality anymore. My quest is to bring back the magic of radio--magic that held me spellbound as a young kid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt Patreon, YOU my friends and fans and audience support me DIRECTLY as I create daily content for you. The more support I get, the more content I can provide. And it keeps on rolling along that way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have the amazing opportunity to share my skills as a talk show host and observer and commentator of life while working hard, directly for you. YOU are who my content was always for anyway. Now I can just cut to the chase and provide hours of content a week for my loyal and encouraging supporters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease share this site with everyone you know. Let them know that for as little as a buck a month they will get the most engaging and eclectic content anywhere. Give it a try. You have nothing to lose but sofa change, right?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe average American spends $3 a day on coffee and $100 a month on junk food. Think about it. My Podcast starts at 3 CENTS a day. And $100 at that rate will get you more than 8 YEARS of my Podcast!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome fans have asked if there\u2019s a way they can help support what I do without having to subscribe (usually because they just don\u2019t have the time or Internet or app skills to make this a viable way to listen to me). The answer is YES. Here is a link where you can help the Podcast go round without becoming a Patron:\u00a0\u00a0paypal.me/radiospencer. I\u2019m very grateful for your support in whatever form you choose to show it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s make broadcasting fun and original again. This is Personality Podcasting at its best. And I hope to have you along for the adventures...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers and peace to you."
