    "summary": "School Sucks Project is a podcast, a You Tube channel, and a lively on-line\n community dedicated to \u003cstrong\u003eredefining education\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWow that\u0027s ambitious\u003c/em\u003e, you say?\u003cbr\u003eIndeed. But it\u0027s necessary. School and education are not the same. Look at the state of America\u0027s public schools. How could anyone argue that they are successful? (Even by their own metrics)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.podomatic.com/ts/81/89/a0/schoolsucks/0x0_11506030.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorse yet, look at the level of discourse in our colleges and universities - people crying over Halloween costumes, demanding protection from free speech, shutting down controversial events, etc... Isn\u0027t it painfully obvious that too many young adults are ill-prepared to thrive in the real world?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.podomatic.com/ts/81/89/a0/schoolsucks/0x0_11506029.jpg\" style=\"width: 594px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven WORSE YET, how about the predicament that America\u0027s voting-age adults are getting us into this year? Not a lot of evidence of critical thinking there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.podomatic.com/ts/81/89/a0/schoolsucks/0x0_11506038.jpg\" style=\"width: 594px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo School Sucks?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes. My name is Brett Veinotte and before I created School Sucks Project in 2009 I spent over a decade teaching, tutoring and college admission consulting. In that time, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"school sucks\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e was the most common phrase I heard students use to express their feelings about \"public education.\"  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYet this seemingly bitter and reductive slogan is \nactually a very astute\nassessment of the system. The 15,000-hour \nprocess of schooling has a dramatic effect on the mind of a \nchild. When we first enter these institutions at age six, many of our \nbest personal attributes are already in place. We are curious, \ninnovative, unique, creative and hopeful in ways that we will rarely be \nable to replicate throughout the rest of our lives. But over time, \n\u003cem\u003eschool sucks\u003c/em\u003e those essential attributes out of too many of us...and \nreplaces them with predictability, obedience and apathy. Just look around.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, for over a century this process has been referred to \nas \"education.\" It isn\u0027t. Our aim is to reclaim that word, to take it \nback from those who wish to use institutionalized schools (at all \nlevels) to mold impressionable minds into desirable and predictable \nfinished products. Education is a journey by the individual, for the \nindividual.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe School Sucks Project encourages students and parents to take matters into their own hands. And we provide the tools and knowledge to do so.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough our content, we aim to provide people the \u003cstrong\u003ebuilding blocks of intellectual, financial and lifestyle independence\u003c/strong\u003e. This includes in-depth explorations into higher-level thinking, organization and productivity, emotional and physical health, habit and lifestyle optimization, history and philosophy, psychology, self-education practices, entrepreneurship, and \ncommunication/negotiation strategies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur content is ideal for frustrated high school and college students, home-educating parents, and adults who are interested in independently furthering their education and achieving self-actualization.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe curation and presentation of valuable information requires time and \nresources.
