Ericks\u2019 own voice carries\nechoes of Carpenter\u2019s alto, without the tragic undertones.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShane Ericks was born in the Philippines, but she\u2019s spent\nabout half of her life in Greenville, South Carolina. It was in Greenville that\nshe entered the Global Pinoy Singing Idol Contest, and it was in Greenville\nthat she casually recorded a video of herself singing a Carpenters song.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Global Pinoy Singing Idol Contest, also known as\nPhilippine Idol, brought Ericks worldwide attention after she triumphed over\nfellow Filipino singers from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia and the United States\nto take first prize. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nEven more attention came her way after that impromptu kitchen-table\nvideo, a cover of the Carpenters\u2019 \u201cYou,\u201d went viral. She followed it up with\nanother Carpenters\u2019 cover, \u201cLove Me For What I Am,\u201d which has generated more\nthan 5.6 million Facebook views and hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShe has performed in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Las\nVegas, and in 2017, Ericks played a show at the Cutting Room in New York City.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlso in 2017, Ericks performed at a pre-game for the Harlem\nGlobetrotters at Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEricks never guessed that her love for the Carpenters, as\nwell as other pop-rock bands from the 1970s such as Bread and the Bee Gees,\nwould make such a splash. Her songs have caught the attention of musicians who\nworked with Karen Carpenter, and when folks who had such a close connection\nwith Carpenter say that you sound like the late singer, you know they\u2019re\nspeaking from the heart.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDrummer Liberty DeVitto, who worked on Carpenter\u2019s solo\nalbum, made a point of meeting Ericks and telling her how much her music means\nto him, and songwriter Donnie Demers said Ericks\u2019 voice is \u201cas close to the\nvoice of Karen Carpenter as any I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEricks, who is taking a break from college to pursue a music\ncareer, released her first single, \u201cYour Love is Enough,\u201d on Amazon and iTunes\nin 2016, and she plans to hit the studio later in 2017 to record her first EP.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhile Ericks\u2019 voice is a soulful echo of Karen Carpenter\u2019s,\nthe young singer also finds inspiration in contemporary artists such as Adele,\nNorah Jones and Colbie Caillat.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut the most important influence in Ericks\u2019 life and work is\nher faith in God. Her Christian faith infuses her work, and it keeps her\ngrounded. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nMusic, Ericks says, \u201cis just a bonus for me. It\u2019s a gift\nfrom God, and I have to give it back.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e",
