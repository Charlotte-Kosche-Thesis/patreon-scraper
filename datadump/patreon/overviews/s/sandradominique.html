    "summary": "Theater, holy shit!!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi there! I\u0027m an artist who started studying acting as a real need, not only as an incipient actress but as a person. I really wanted to know the human soul, I guess. In the meantime, I studied music and tried to learn to play jazz guitar. My acting career was on its way, and I used to perform as a singer too. Later, I graduated in Playwriting and Directing, and I started to create my own plays, and directing them. As a matter of fact, I barely can separate all my disciplines when I\u0027m creating, and I try not to, because I consider that\u0027s exactly my personal style. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNowadays, I write, direct, sing and perform (not always in the same show), but I like to direct as an actress, and act as a director. Writing is a special connection with something else I can\u0027t explain. And theater is something sacred for me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create plays that speak about life, vividly and clear. Plays that resound loudly inside people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy obsessive issues to speak of \u2013or the subjects that gain my interest\u2013 involve otherness, family and relationships as a revolutionary act, gender and feminism, and inequality. And despite of all these tragedy and drama plots, one of my strongest is comedy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have spent my whole life studying and growing better in my crafts. And I can\u0027t deny it. It\u0027s a need. I need to create the plays I write, because in some way I need to answer some questions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI graduated in Playwriting and then I won a scholarship to \u00a0study a Master Degree in Modern Languages with an specialization in Women Studies and my Master Thesis won XVIII Leonor de Guzm\u00e1n Prize in Women Studies. Now, I\u0027m a Phd student, while I create a new play and try to stay alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really need your support to be able to do my work in a full-time basis. You don\u0027t need to be a king to be my patron. You can do it for a very little amount, and you\u0027ll be contributing to change my whole career. \u003cstrong\u003eYou can make it count.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d really love to share my work with you, so you can be as excited as I am to keep going and create more! Because, we always need that exact time that we don\u0027t own to be better. To go through that difficult and impossible path that waits with more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease, walk with me!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
