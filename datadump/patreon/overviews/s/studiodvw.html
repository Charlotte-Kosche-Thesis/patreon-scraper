I aim to use art - the great communicator that penetrates people\u0027s hearts and minds - to provide a glimpse into nature that is out of balance. I invite my audience to pause, think, learn, and maybe fall in love and take action. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe species portrayed within \u003cem\u003eBrink\u003c/em\u003e are all \u201cprotected\u201d on some level, whether it be local, national, or international designations. A few of the paintings share circumstances of human impact, representing that there are no hard lines in nature and impact is not linear. Habitat loss and contamination, invasive species, and economic development are often rapid and catastrophic.

Instead, I elect to use animal expression and beauty to create a place of solace within the painting - much like the solace I find when playing out in nature. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProfits from \u003cem\u003eBrink\u003c/em\u003e will be sent to local, grassroots organizations that are working to conserve the animals portrayed within the paintings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*The \u003cem\u003eBrink Stories\u003c/em\u003e are now posted on by \u003ca href=\"http://www.studiodvw.com/blog/\"\u003eBlog\u003c/a\u003e and will be updated with the creation of new paintings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnjoy,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDiana V.

     "about": "Diana Viacheslavovna Walsworth\u2019s inspiration for her artwork comes from her love of the wild outdoors, where she frequently has unique encounters with animals. She has been chased by sea lions, circled by a great white shark, gobbled with turkeys, and strolled in the forest next to a rattlesnake. Diana seeks to share her experiences, love for life, and appreciation for nature through her artwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDiana has invented her own painting process, where she dabs acrylic paint onto her canvases using a sewing needle. The result of this patient approach is a beautiful textured representation that brings depth to her art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDiana was born in Moscow, Russia, and moved to California at the age of six. Within this new life, she became a horse trainer, barefoot skateboarder and surfer. The surf culture and University pulled her to settle in Santa Cruz, where she worked with local start-ups and in Silicon Valley. Diana became a full-time artist in 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContact/Follow:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"mailto:diana@studiodvw.com\"\u003ediana@studiodvw.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewww.studiodvw.com\u003cbr\u003eFacebook.com/StudioDVW\u003cbr\u003eInstagram.com/StudioDVW\u003cbr\u003e",
