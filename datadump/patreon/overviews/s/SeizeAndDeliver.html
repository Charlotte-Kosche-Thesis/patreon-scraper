Back in college I played an online role playing game about Bounty Hunters in the Star Wars universe. I failed a bunch of times to create something cool to star in. One day while praying, I said I need some kind of new inspiration. I kept thin king about the BHG, and that SOMEONE should make a bounty hunter story. In the middle of that prayer, I suddenly knew I\u0027m supposed to be that someone. In September 2017, I reached out on facebook to see who, if anyone, might be interested in joining me to create a series about Bounty Hunters. Overnight more than 200 people responded and this project became bigger than me, bigger than anything I could have imagined and bigger than just my character. There\u0027s just no other way to say it, this project is one miracle happening after another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeized \u0026amp; Deliver is a story of a handful of Bounty Hunters (each one featured in a different episode) and the Marks they pursue. We\u0027re on the outer rim of the galaxy; the dangerous parts of space. You haven\u0027t heard of these hunters yet, because they don\u0027t care about the political struggle between Empire and Jedi. They live by the BHG code.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/27858143_10156225332134664_8593580856326122553_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0\u0026amp;oh=7680cc90a08aa22ab7692c1a2a9ba25b\u0026amp;oe=5B861184\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE WE\u0027RE AT NOW\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, we have some amazing writers: Zak Klapperich, Stephanie Arapian, Jonathan Levey, and Morgan Shnell to name a few who have written some amazing things. We\u0027re already shooting thanks to the support behind our Go-Fund-Me launch, and the talents of Head Make-up and Costume Designer, Paulina Andrea Acebal; Directors of Photography William Hellmuth, Major Latimer, and others. Zak has also done a fantastic job helping with Art Directing and Directing our 3rd Episode. We\u0027ve added more amazing Directors, make-up artists, and combat specialists to the team. And we\u0027re on track to create one amazing episode per month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGOAL\u003c/strong\u003e: EVERY EPISODE MUST BETTER THAN THE LAST\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/31498101_10155601764070875_6832687403317067776_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0\u0026amp;oh=eff2e303c61d2c0db276c78f221cae37\u0026amp;oe=5B9470B0\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY ARE WE ON PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOur goal is to make one episode a month for 2018. That will be a total of 12 episodes by the end of the year. Rather than exhaust everyone we know with monthly crowdfunding campaigns, we\u0027d like to ask everyone who wants to help to pledge $10 a\u00a0month or more. In exchange, we\u0027d like to invite you in to the inner circle and be a part of the madness that we all enjoy so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/29694882_10155538135370875_9004768244168989236_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0\u0026amp;oh=0da766706017f1b1d0d6b02e0dea9dd7\u0026amp;oe=5B929BDE\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY SUPPORT?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHonestly? This is an amazingly diverse group of die-hard Star Wars fans with an extensive comprehension of the SWEU. No pressure at all: But if you want to see more women directing sci-fi (more than half of our directors are women), if you want to support diversity in front of and behind the camera, if you want to see cool Star Wars related stuff that won\u0027t wreck your childhood, then you you should support Seize \u0026amp; Deliver.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/30740804_10155581086090875_1987175724548620288_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0\u0026amp;oh=1577a90c341dd42f6d5da016ca5cefe9\u0026amp;oe=5B8F4D4E\"\u003e"
