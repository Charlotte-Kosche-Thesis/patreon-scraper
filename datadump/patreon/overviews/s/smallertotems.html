Caught between the mystery of a vanished younger brother (Brandon) and the battle to protect the dreams of his troubled older brother (Ian), the small guardians find their old traditions provide precious little help against a seemingly-endless horde of strange, new enemies. Simultaneously, in the daylight waking-world of older-brother Ian, the story follows his struggle to make sense of his little brother\u0027s disappearance while trying to keep a steady grip on the difference between bad dreams and grim reality. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere are a few samples:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://smallertotems.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/installment-0-cover.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://smallertotems.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/installment-2-cover2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://smallertotems.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/15pg4.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://smallertotems.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/installment-20-cover.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://smallertotems.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20p10.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://smallertotems.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/c39.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://smallertotems.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/c3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe comic has been up for just over two years now, and we\u0027re over 50 Installments in.
