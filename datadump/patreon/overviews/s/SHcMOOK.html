    "summary": "Hi. I\u0027m Joe. I run 12 twitter accounts, several Facebook pages, and two YouTube channels. Most of those are all part of a little experiment called the SHcMOOK Network.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSHcMOOK is an experiment in transmedia storytelling. The stories are primarily told through YouTube videos, released on the Network\u0027s channel, but in addition to that, characters and groups that exist in those stories all also exist elsewhere online. Ideally, they are wherever the viewers already are, and can interact with, encourage, and entertain them, without them having to go looking for the entertainment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the idea of the Network is that its more than just one person. I have other actors come in to play different characters. Artists draw logos, banners, backgrounds, etc. Musicians give the channel its own original soundtrack. Through the Network, I hope to promote as many talented people as I can find, and introduce them to as wide of an audience as I can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon mostly exists so that I can support the people I\u0027m collaborating with to make the Network better. It will let be be able to afford to commission them, rather than me pressuring them into it with only vague promises of exposure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I\u0027m able to raise enough, it will also help me to be able to release videos more regularly without worrying about it taking time away from things like school or work, which I would otherwise have to neglect in order to maintain a regular release schedule. But that is very far away. I\u0027d need a much larger audience for that to be something I\u0027d realistically be thinking about.\u00a0"
