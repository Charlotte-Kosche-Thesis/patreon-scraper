    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e\u201cTell me a story,\u201d Susanna asked the tiger on the floor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tiger stretched himself full-length in front of the fireplace, for it was very warm there, and although he would never admit it, he enjoyed the way the glow of the flames flickered and danced across his thick orange fur. It made him feel his youth again, and really there was nothing more an old tiger could ask for than that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYou are too old for stories,\u201d the tiger said. \u201cBesides, you\u2019ve already heard them all by now.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI\u2019m not too old,\u201d Susanna said. \u201cI\u2019m only six years old.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cWhen I was six, I was prowling through the jungle and catching hog deer and porcupines for dinner. We had no time for stories back then.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cTell the girl a story,\u201d the orangutan said from his nest atop the oak bookshelf against the far wall. He had built his bed from broom handles and wooden kitchen spoons, and from branches from the tiger\u2019s favorite hickory wattle tree in the garden outside their house, a scavenging which had sent the tiger into a sulk that had lasted a full week. \u201cShe\u2019s only a child, and children need stories. I wouldn\u2019t mind one myself, for that matter. You do tell a good tale, tiger.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cFlatterer,\u201d the tiger growled. \u201cVery well then, girl. What story shall I tell? Perhaps the one about the clockwork whale with a city of sirens in his belly, luring sailors to their doom in the dark depths of the sea?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cNot that one again,\u201d the girl said. \u201cYou\u2019ve told that one a hundred times.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYes, not that one,\u201d the orangutan agreed. \u201cSomething different please.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tiger squinted his yellow eyes at Susanna. \u201cThen perhaps the story of how I ate your parents and carried you here crying in a burlap sack between my jaws?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe little girl shivered. \u201cOh no, not that story. It\u2019s too frightening, and I don\u2019t like it,\u201d she said, although secretly she was very fond of it, and she loved the tiger even more deeply when he would purr it in her ear while he was putting her to bed at night. \u201cTell me something new. Something I haven\u2019t heard before.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYes, tiger,\u201d the orangutan said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been alive for so many years. \u003cbr\u003eSurely you have stories you haven\u2019t told us yet.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cIt\u2019s true, I am very old,\u201d the tiger said. \u201cI turned twenty-six on my last birthday, and not even the eldest great-father of us all lived past thirty-one, praise his stripes.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cOrangutans live longer than tigers,\u201d the orangutan said. \u201cBut if I live to be fifty, I will never know the number of tales you do.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYou\u2019ll never know as many as I\u2019ve forgotten,\u201d said the tiger, and the orangutan did not take offense, for he knew the tiger was correct, and only being truthful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cIf you know so many,\u201d Susanna said, \u201cthen pick one we haven\u2019t heard before and tell it. People live longer than the both of you put together, so perhaps I am the one who needs to hear all that you know. Maybe it\u2019s my job to be the storyteller after you\u2019ve gone.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tiger chuff-chuffed, amused. \u201cI could tell you stories about the green jungles I\u2019ll visit after I\u2019m dead, where my fathers lounge beneath the cham cha trees, and the elephant calves wait alone and unprotected on the banks of every flowing river.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYes, please,\u201d said the girl.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cOr perhaps,\u201d the tiger continued, \u201cthe story of Serhan Kashani, the spike fiddler of Constantinople, who charmed the hungry dead with his music, while he searched amongst them for the lost soul of the woman he loved.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe orangutan blew a wet sound between his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t you know anything without death in it? Something always dies in your stories.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cAs it should,\u201d the tiger said. \u201cDeath is at least as important as life, for one is empty without the other.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cStop philosophizing,\u201d said the orangutan, \u201cand tell us a story.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cOne without death in it,\u201d Susanna added. \u201cJust to see if you can do it.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tiger crossed his forelegs and considered a while, staring into the fire. Finally, he said, \u201cI have one for you. I won\u2019t say if there\u2019s a death in it or not, because I wouldn\u2019t ruin the story by telling the ending before even starting the beginning, so you\u2019ll just have to wait and find out yourselves.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cSneaky,\u201d observed the orangutan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cDo you want to hear it or not?\u201d the tiger asked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cOh yes,\u201d Susanna said. \u201cPlease, tiger, yes.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tiger sat up and put his back to the fire, the yellow-orange light dimly wrapping around his edges like a fog, leaving the center of him in darkness save for the unearthly golden glow of his eyes. It was as though the light were falling into him, being pulled from the edges of the room, leaving the dark corners even more dark, and turning the shadows bottomless. The tiger had always had a sense for the theatrical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThis is going to be good,\u201d the orangutan said. He climbed down from the top of the bookshelf and went to sit on the floor beside Susanna\u2019s chair.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThey\u2019re always good,\u201d Susanna said. \u201cThat\u2019s why he tells the stories.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe orangutan reached his hand up toward the girl, and she took it in hers.\u003cbr\u003eA knot in the fire popped, and the log shifted among the ashes in the fireplace.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd as he knew that the time was now right, the tiger cleared his throat with a growl, and he began to tell his story\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you see this stack of papers on the desk here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere\u0027s a dead giant in there, floating on the ocean\u0027s currents, with a city of tea magicians built upon his back. There\u0027s a boatman made of spiders, whose fare is paid in the breath of children, and sails a ship of hollow bones and empty skins. There\u0027s a clockwork woman with rusted gears and missing parts, and the cabbage farmer\u0027s ghost whose shadowy heart beats in time with her mechanical one. There\u0027s a circus man who cannot die, and the gatherer of the dead who plans on putting him to a peculiar use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tiger\u0027s tales, growing in number, populating the tabletop, gathering words and whispers and strength in the telling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tiger must be fed, however, and as we all know, it\u0027s nearly prohibitively expensive to keep a magnificent beast such as he in the lifestyle to which he is accustomed. Gazelle meat isn\u0027t cheap, and while the tiger has been most patient and understanding, he has grown tired of the dollar store pork rinds and just-slightly-past-their-expiration date cans of sardines. To be honest, he has begun to lick his chops in a most unsettling fashion whenever I walk into the room, and I have the most disturbing feeling that he is picturing me laid out on a silver platter, roasted to a rich golden color, with an apple placed delicately within my mouth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeedless to say, this is putting a definite crimp in our relationship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so we have decided, the tiger and I, to appeal to you, dear friends. We have put together this Patreon account as a way to raise funds for various tiger-related expenses. This goes beyond merely the edible sort that one would expect, but also encompasses grooming costs, veterinary visits, nail salon appointments, spectacles, lottery ticket purchases, and therapist bills not covered by his health insurance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTigers don\u0027t come cheap in this modern world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have two goals, related to this Patreon account: for the tiger to have something to eat, and for that something which is to be eaten, not to be me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider making a pledge to help keep me off the dinner menu.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat the tiger and I have planned for the future is this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere will be stories here, stories of magic and machinery, darkness and light, good triumphing over evil, or perhaps the reverse, depending on the position of the stars in the sky. There will be words to be read which will be available to all who come here, and still other words which will only be for our patrons. There will be something for everyone, and extra somethings for those people who will help with the expense of feeding the tiger.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAh, but for those who do become patrons, there are rewards available, much as public television has been doing for years now. While the tiger and I aren\u0027t offering tote bags at this time, you can see the rewards available for our sponsors, and see which level of patronage would best appeal to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tiger and I both thank you in advance, and we look forward to presenting you with tales to entertain, enlighten, and something else that starts with the letter \"e,\" although I can\u0027t quite think of what it would be at the moment, because the tiger is licking his lips and eyeballing me in a most distressing fashion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading, and please, please, please... keep me off the menu.\u003cbr\u003e"
