    "summary": "Thank you for making it to my patreon page.\u00a0 I have some really big plans for the future, and I want you to be part of it all! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWould you like to see the plastic pollution problem reversed in your lifetime?\u00a0 Would you like to know that your support right here right now made that change possible?\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlastic\u0027s lifecycle is infinite.\u00a0 Lasting solutions to the plastic pollution problem must have a matching desired lifespan.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e My focus is art and architecture.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eInspired by the pinwheel house by Ying chee Chu, the architectural design system I have developed is extensible. Like nature and fractal geometry, the essential form is repeated, expanding outwards to create larger and larger structures.\u00a0 I call this, Evolving Symmetry 1.0.\u00a0 The essential form is a socially beneficial structure, the bus stop.\u00a0 If a community learns to build the bus stop, then they know how to build all the other larger forms: the community garden shed, tiny house, medium house, even entire communities.\u00a0 A prototype of the Evolving Symmetry 1.0 bus stop was built in the fall of 2016 from the post-consumer plastic materials I collected for six years from my family of four.\u00a0 I now know that when a group of twenty-five people with average consumer habits save their post-consumer plastic for one year, they can collectively build one Evolving Symmetry 1.0 bus stop. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eIt is exciting to me to redesign plastic to positively impact its entire lifecycle, a lifecycle some say is infinite. I get excited by doing something infinitely positive that will last forever, do you?\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat gets me so excited about the positive impacts of redesigning plastic is the snowball effect of implementing systematic solutions. The benefits extend far further than the basic functionality of a lifecycle design:\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e- When plastic is removed from the waste stream, what remains is largely compostable, so more of the waste stream can be utilized and zero waste goals become more achievable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- Plastic is a wasted resource polluting the ground and waterways around the world, often present in the poorest areas, where resources are limited.\u00a0 When we develop plastic as a resource, the benefits to the economically disadvantaged\u00a0 can be huge.\u003cbr\u003e- Plastic as waste can create a vector for water-born diseases, so the removal of plastic from the environment can have beneficial health impacts.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e-Plastic when left as waste, continually harms life throughout its lifecycle. When collected and secured for beneficial use for humanity, it has positive impacts for life for its entire lifecycle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIn my travels, I saw many global problems first-hand: \nchild homelessness, pollution, and poverty. I believe that the positive utilization of plastic waste can have beneficial impacts across all these problems. Because of a deep love of life, I care deeply about making this happen. I believe in this very important work. I am looking for patrons who are excited to join me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2010, I began an experiment - to save my family\u0027s non-recyclable \nplastic waste and see if I could figure out a way to utilize it in a \npositive way.  This was a difficult journey.  \u003cbr\u003eI collected, cleaned, and \ndried plastic that would normally go to the landfill and saved it bit by\n bit.  As it piled up, I pushed it under our guest bed.  Ha.  Stay \nthere. A year and a half later, it started poking out, and I pushed it back \nunder, hmmm...what to do next? \u003cbr\u003e It piled up further, but I did not give \nup.  Some boxes here, some more boxes there.  Creativity - it is a messy\n business. Sometimes, you have to be enveloped in it to find your way to\n some inspiration.  I was around plastic, looking at it, seeing, and \ninteracting with it daily.  It changed my perspective, and I began to \nsee plastic in a completely new way.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eNow, if I can transform the plastic that my family generates as \nconsumer waste, it can be done!\u00a0 It is simplified and\n easy, and I can show you a system to positively deal with \nplastic \nwaste.  I know that transformation of \nthe plastic pollution problem into solutions that benefit humanity and \nprotect the environment is truly possible! \u003cbr\u003eTogether, we can start to \ntransform the plastic pollution problem into solutions that provide \nenvironmental remediation and social benefits. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have come this far, but I cannot move forward alone.  I truly need your help to take the next steps, right now.\u00a0  As a patron, you can be with me on the forefront of positive change \nregarding the global plastic pollution problem. \u003cbr\u003eI have a detailed plan to make this happen, and I will share with you, step by step.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eWould you please help me continue this important work?\u00a0 Your patronage can be at any level you choose and is much appreciated.\u00a0 No amount is too small.\u00a0 Please join this community of patrons who support developing solutions to plastic pollution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you receive various patron-only rewards: access to my patron-only posts,\u00a0 videos, discounts on artwork, invitations to shows, and more.\u00a0 I have some very special rewards coming for you.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eThank you for your patronage.\u00a0 I am very grateful for your support!\u00a0 Together we can accomplish great things!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhotography by Jack Rowell, \u003ca href=\"http://www.jackrowell.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.jackrowell.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.jackrowell.com)\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
