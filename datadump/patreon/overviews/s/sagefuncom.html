Our goal is to produce quality tech and gaming content for any audience to enjoy, as well as much more, such as films, animated cartoons, reviews, and documentaries, and entertain and/or educate people via our content on the web.\u00a0We try to keep our content clean and appropriate for a general audience, while putting in some comedy and/or humor into them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow did we start?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe SFC Group began as a website back in October of 2013, under the name \"Sagefun.com\". We began producing video content in early 2014, and have not stopped ever since. Today, we are a rapidly-expanding content-creation organization continuing to explore new heights, as well as maintain our fanbase, and keep people happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhilst we\u0027d love to keep our content for free, running an organization is no easy task; we invest lots of money each year into keeping ourselves going, and making quality content for everyone to enjoy, which usually takes days, if not weeks or months to produce. This is where Patreon comes into play; when you help support our content, you get some neat perks such as early access to our YouTube videos before they get released, and Patreon-exclusive video content, both new and archived.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here for the first time, why not check out our content on YouTube and Twitch today to get an idea of what we do here, and we hope you consider supporting us through Patreon today!\u003cbr\u003e"
