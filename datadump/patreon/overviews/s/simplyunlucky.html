     "about": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Whats Up Guys! My name is Roman Grothaus, born September 24th 1991. I am Creator, Editor, and producer of the internet show SimplyUnlucky. I started SimplyUnlucky (SU) back in December of 2010 at the age of nineteen. At the time a was a full-time college student. I was always a big gamer but I felt I could do so much more to express myself and use the knowledge I had gained to create something Awesome, so I turned to YouTube. I started by watching how other gaming YouTubers created their content. In 2010 YouTube was already booming with gaming content creators. I did not see much success in the Video Game Content, so I went with what I had dedicated a large portion of my life to: TCGs (Trading Card Games). I was always more into Yugioh than any other TCG. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The original show completely changed my life after watching one episode. I would wake up at 7am on Saturday mornings as a ten year old to make sure I got to see all aired Yugioh episodes that day. I would force my parents to let me use the Big TV in the living room and blast the volume during the theme song (which I still enjoy very much). I became obsessed with Yugioh, even more than I was with Pokemon. I was always a Pokemon kid, I remember arguing with groups of my friends on how much better Pokemon was than DBZ, good times. But Pokemon definitely didn\u0027t impact me in the way Yugioh had. Towards the end of 5th Grade I started to attend my Local Card Store weekly. Yes I was ripped off, cheated against, pushed around, but I new if I practiced and worked hard to understand the game I could be one of the best players there. It took some time but after a few years I was winning 50 person tournaments. \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I remember making a constant wish as a Kid using whatever silly superstition was convenient, \"I wish to be the King of Games.\" I truly believed I could be and I think that perseverance is what led to my success with SimplyUnlucky. Hopefully you can continue to enjoy my show SimplyUnlucky. I have literally poured my soul and put everything I have into creating SU and all it stands for. I cannot thank you enough for being a positive part of something that has changed my life forever. You are the reason SU survives as a show, you are the reason I was able to turn something I Loved into a job, and you are the one that SimplyUnlucky depends on to become all it can be. Thank You for your consideration to be a Patron for SimplyUnlucky. Whether it\u0027s actively watching my videos, spreading news of my show through word of mouth, or supporting me through Patreon. Every second, every word, every dollar, helps me survive as a content creator and pushes SimplyUnlucky to the Next Level. You are too awesome to describe with words, OH BABY!!\\\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eRoman\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS\u003cbr\u003eFor those that would like to participate in Mail Opening Videos, I wanted to leave the information for you here.
