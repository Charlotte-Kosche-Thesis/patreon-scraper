    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eScream Scene\u003c/em\u003e is Ben and Sarah Rowe, a husband and wife team who, each and every week, apply their background in Film, Literature, and Communications to a chronological journey through the history of horror cinema. Each episode of the show covers a feature film in the horror genre, introduced with its historical, cultural, and behind-the-scenes context, and then discussed and reviewed by the hosts. Finally, the film is ranked on our \u003ca href=\"https://screamscenepodcast.tumblr.com/the-list\"\u003emaster list\u003c/a\u003e of horror films, from the very best to the very worst.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eScream Scene\u003c/em\u003e is an independent podcast, hosted on \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/screamscenepodcast\"\u003eSoundCloud\u003c/a\u003e and available on \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1215826162\"\u003eiTunes\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Iykxthovua3is263n6h3aoylgte?t=Scream_Scene_Podcast\"\u003eGoogle Play\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s free to stream and download, and updates every Wednesday. We aren\u0027t part of a podcasting network, and we have no sponsors or advertisements on the show. Our loyal audience of Creatures of the Night (hopefully that includes you!) grows through word of mouth. Our subject matter of the horror genre combined with the history of cinema makes us a niche interest, making it unlikely we\u0027ll join a network or gain advertisers in the future. Thanks to potential patrons like yourself we no longer operate the show at a loss, and we hope that our community continues to grow, so we can expand the quality and quantity of content we produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eScream Scene\u003c/em\u003e is a show that\u0027s friendly, funny, comprehensive, and respectful. While we have a good sense of humour about what we do, we aren\u0027t here to do ironic takedowns of bad movies. We heavily research each episode\u0027s topic, providing listeners the context to enjoy these classic films, and we dive into the social and cultural themes raised by the use of horror in each narrative. Our chronological system allows listeners to get a sense of how the genre developed and changed over time, providing a greater meta-narrative to the episodes as they go on. We\u0027re for lovers of horror, lovers of cinema, lovers of history, and lovers of the study of society and culture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will gain access to bonus audio, help us achieve goals towards expanding the show\u0027s content and improving its production quality, and receive our thanks in each weekly episode. \u003cbr\u003e"
