No one likes going over budgets, except for most Americans HEY OH!**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, beautiful, wonderful people. This is \u003cstrong\u003eLee Newton\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eElliott Morgan\u003c/strong\u003e, coming at you live from the Internet!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you probably know by now, we do a weekly podcast called Shooting Stars, during which we discuss pop culture--everything from who wore what to who broke up with who to where the when found a why! I don\u0027t know what that last sentence means either, but it was a real hoot to type!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, you\u0027re probably wondering, why should I support Lee and Elliott and their conversations on \"The Bachelor\"? Where is my hard-earned cash money \u003cstrong\u003egoing\u003c/strong\u003e?! Well, we\u0027ll tell you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor starters, the dream is for us to have a really nice audio set-up, so that when we finally get Marc Maron to come on the show, he doesn\u0027t ridicule us anymore than we deserve. We also want to impress all of the other \u003cstrong\u003eamazing guests\u003c/strong\u003e we\u0027ll have on, so that they accept us as human beings. So, in summation: equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll also be using the support to make the podcast more widely available. We want \u003cstrong\u003eeveryone in the world\u003c/strong\u003e to be able to engage in this podcast\u0027s rampant vapidity, and that costs dough. So, in summation: hosting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, we have been working on several projects, and supporting Shooting Stars helps us pay rent, buy food, get bitches (the canine kind), and generally do life so we can keep \u003cem\u003ecreating stuff.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, this is all entirely optional, and we want everyone in the world to have access to this podcast, as well as food and nourishment, but mostly this podcast. You can tell our priorities are straight."
