Technically I can produce a skeletal reconstruction of just about anything, but my specialty is dinosaurs and their relatives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may have seen my occasional blog writing on my website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.skeletaldrawing.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSkeletalDrawing.com\u003c/a\u003e. My work has been featured in numerous books and TV shows, and in many scientific publications - both my own and by other authors. Those are all fun bragging points, and most of them provided compensation, which is always appreciated. But that is only a small fraction of how my illustrations are used. They are the anatomical basis for innumerable dinosaur illustrations, sculptures, and 3D models, most without any immediate commercial basis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51bf1cd3e4b0a897bf54112b/5748d6b4c2ea517f705ce3fd/5748da31a3360cb23af1e603/1464392245766/Centrosaurus.jpg?format=2500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eLike this: the horned dinosaur/can opener \u003cem\u003eCentrosaurus\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I need your support:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhile my illustrations are copyrighted, I have always encouraged paleoartists to make use of the anatomical information they contain. I intend to always do so, but skeletal reconstructions take a long time to produce - generally 40 hours per skeletal. Of course this isn\u0027t all I do in my life; I teach undergraduates, I am working on several scientific publications, working towards a PhD, and have to support my family. As a result I am often forced to use my time for more profitable projects than producing skeletal illustrations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow your support would help:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, support through Patreon would help change the equation of how much time I can afford to spend producing skeletal reconstructions. In addition to increasing the volume of skeletal reconstructions I can produce, it would also change the selection. Currently I accept skeletals only when commissioned for commercial projects, or for a specific scientific publication I am working on. Patreon support would allow me to start taking on species that are interesting, or new, regardless of immediate commercial need. If this campaign is successful it might even allow me to regularly take on projects based on public interest or pure educational need.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51bf1cd3e4b0a897bf54112b/5748d6b4c2ea517f705ce3fd/5748d6d420c6471e63e69323/1464391383128/Deinocheirus.jpg?format=2500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThe strange, giant, fish-eating ornithomimid \u003cem\u003eDeinocheirus\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat to expect as a supporter:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe time I can spend \"on-task\" varies dramatically during different parts of the year. To avoid oversaturating supporters I will never post more than 4 items a month, and most of the time it will be 1-3 items a month. All supporters will get early access to the images, and I will also write up useful information about each one, and often provide exclusive variations, such as scaled diagrams with other animals in the environment, unique poses, etc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also check out the rewards for higher levels of support. If you are an artist who makes use of my diagrams I hope you would view support as a form of enlightened self interest, but I hope all my supporters feel like producing high-quality anatomy diagrams of extinct life is worthwhile becauase they\u0027re just so gosh-darned fascinating. I know I think so!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
