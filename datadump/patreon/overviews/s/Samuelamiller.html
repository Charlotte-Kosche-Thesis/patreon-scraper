    "summary": "Once upon a time there was a boy who loved stories about good and evil, and always dreamed of writing his own tale. Now that boy is... well, still a little boy, but in a bigger body that has a beard and a deep voice. Spoiler alert: that\u2019s me! All of my artwork is centered around one idea: story telling. Do you like stories? Do you like knights and ninjas and swords and dragons and fights and romance and explosions and... I think you get the idea. If you like these things, well you\u2019re in luck, \u2018cause that\u2019s what goes on here. Welcome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to making fun and fantastic art, I\u2019ve had a dream for years to start my own comic. Comics about average guys saving the day from evil lords and what not. But I\u2019m a college student, so time and $$$ are hard to come by. If you pledge $$$ to me, you\u2019ll be helping me make that dream a reality! Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than money, I really want a community; a place where people can come and we can share ideas and even create artwork and stories together! Check out my Facebook page (link in the top right corner) or check me out on instagram @sam_i_art. Yeah, I know underscores are weird. Sorry. Anyway I\u2019d love to have you as a part of my community. By pledging to my Patreon, you\u2019ll get a look at exclusive artwork and vids, and we\u2019ll get to chat and you guys can share ideas with me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you say, are you ready for an adventure? Because I know I am.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
