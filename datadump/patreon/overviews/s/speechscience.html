     "description": "If you\u0027re choosing this, I\u0027m not sure if you really even care about everything below - although if you want it, you can have it. What you get here is a guarantee from all of us that every single month you will fund either an augmentative communication device, a full swallowing/dysphagia study, or $500 of therapy for a student in need. This level of generosity is rare - in my experience unprecedented - but if you\u0027re that person, know that there\u0027s a special place waiting whenever your own time of need comes. And, of course, you\u0027ll receive a free month\u0027s subscription to \u003ca href=\"http://www.theinformedslpmembers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe Informed SLP\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e",
