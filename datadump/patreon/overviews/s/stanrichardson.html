It\u0027s also why my plays are tragic: people who are half-asleep also step off of rooftops and knock over candles. They call their spouses by their first love\u0027s name; they mistake their own child for an intruder. But they\u2019re also waking up, seething with love and wrestling with self-doubt, looking for the identity that will let them stop feeling like an imposter, a hypocrite. You won\u0027t want to sit back and judge or pity these characters. You\u0027ll want to help them, through your affection and your aggression, so that they finally hit their mark. In the end, you\u0027ll take some of these characters with you and, as they cross the threshold of my imagination into yours, I hope you enjoy their company as much as I did.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*\u00a0 \u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0 *\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy name is Stan and I\u0027m a \u003ca href=\"https://www.stanrichardson.org/stan-bio\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBrooklyn-based theater-maker\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e In the past decade I\u0027ve written more than twenty plays.

Sometimes I\u0027ll be working with designers to translate my play into a new medium.
