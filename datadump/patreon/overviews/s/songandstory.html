I\u0027ll poke and prod and ask about specific lines, phrases, themes, metaphors, production decisions, etc. I fully anticipate each conversation veering off onto backroads and tangents \u2014 an inevitable result of our subjective experiences with art \u2014 though it will always come back around.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSong (again)\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0 //\u00a0 Having digested and discussed the song, we\u0027ll close each show by listening to it again with fresh ears and a new perspective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a songwriter. As such, I\u0027m a storyteller. I know how much time, energy, and thought goes into crafting a song. Some come out quickly, in minutes. Some take days, weeks, months, even years to be fully revealed and refined. I know what each of my songs means. I know the stories behind them. Sometimes I share those stories when I\u0027m performing, though I never quite reveal every detail; I never really tell the \u003cem\u003ewhole\u003c/em\u003e story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been traveling with my music for almost a decade. In that time, I\u0027ve had the privilege of meeting and collaborating with some incredible songwriters. The opportunity to meet an artist I admire and talk with them about their work is something I cherish. Contemplating a song and discussing it \u2014 the thought and intent behind it, the stories around and contained within it \u2014 is essential to valuing music as\u003cem\u003e art\u003c/em\u003e. What a song can reveal about the human condition in all its glory, tragedy, comedy, error, absurdity, and mystery: \u003cem\u003ethat\u0027s \u003c/em\u003ewhat I want to explore.\u003cbr\u003e"
