My work\u0027s been featured in Bitch Magazine, The Establishment, SyFy Wire, Vice, and a host of other sites around the Web--but the life of a freelancer is fraught with financial woes, and right now, I need your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing professionally long enough to realize just how hard it is to make it work, and although this is the only job I\u0027ve ever enjoyed or been particularly good at, paying my bills and keeping my apartment is always an ongoing concern. Since coming out as transgender in 2015, I\u0027ve been increasingly scared of what would happen if I can\u0027t make enough money from writing to support myself--the job market is notoriously lousy, but especially so for a trans woman whose primary skills lie in having Strong Opinions About Popular Culture. Thankfully, in the months when times are toughest, I\u0027ve had my patrons to help me through. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge helps me sustain myself and continue to do the work I love more than anything else. In return, I\u0027m happy to bring you monthly poetry, essays on comics and other pop culture tidbits, and the \"Smut of the Month Club,\" my ongoing collection of trans-positive erotica--all of which you help to shape, through polls and writing prompts. I couldn\u0027t do this without you, and I\u0027m honored to receive your continued support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eSam"
