     "about": "Sarah Parker started her creative internet journey in 2008.\u00a0Over the years she has had numerous different ideas to help people. Social Media became the way to do any form of business. Sarah was self taught. This form of communications has become her way to communicate to others. Oh, the years of changing and growing while learning a new way of life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBehind the scenes Sarah was struggling with anxiety and depression. She kept this to herself. Knowing mental illness wasn\u0027t something you announced to the world. Let alone in Social Media. They\u0027ll think she\u0027s nuts.... Her mind set became addicted to mental illness. She\u0027s doomed....\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Her illness caused chaos in her life. Kept her in unhealthy relationships. She\u0027s doomed for a life of hardship.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNo.\u003cbr\u003eSarah got bored with the stigma on Mental Health. She learned that her mind set was addicted in with mental illness. She learned her patterns, habits, hangups and hurts. Sarah began a new adventure with meditating every morning. She noticed her pain and grief was diminishing. New nutritious foods became a craving through her body. Confidence was restored in believing in herself.\u003cbr\u003eThis was all learned while Sarah created and posted by Teaching Hands a blog, 3StoryTeller her Youtube channel and Believe Ministry a blog hosts \u0027Believe in You\u0027 and internet television. While she was broken or at her worst Sarah managed to help people. Blew her away.\u003cbr\u003eThen came the say Sarah realized that she has recovered from her past mental health issues. Through the arts she has healed from her past. Sarah stepped out of her comfort zone; she is a Warrior with Mental Health. Her intentions are to guide you to a healing healthy lifestyle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome a patron to transform others from this illness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Love and Light.\u003cbr\u003eSarah!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
