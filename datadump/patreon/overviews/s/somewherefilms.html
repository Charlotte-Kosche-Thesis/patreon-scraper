    "summary": "Hello! We are \u003cstrong\u003eSomewhere Films\u003c/strong\u003e, a collective of female filmmakers from London to Los Angeles to Ghana. We\u2019ve made music videos, narrative short films, NGO promotional videos, and documentaries. Our productions explore the flash points at which cultures intersect, both within our national borders and beyond them. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are we making?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach year, we endeavour to produce multiple passion projects, telling stories we feel deserve attention. Our 2018 projects are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\nLocal Alien\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, a documentary feature on refugee repatriation. Though it grapples with distressing subject matter, it does not aim to tell a punishing story. Its objective is to give an audience sustained time with characters who they will want to welcome across their borders and into their lives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(251, 213, 181);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(250, 192, 143);\"\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003eCurrently, the 65 million people displaced globally can expect to be homeless, jobless, and without prospects an average of 10 years. If that person is a child, he or she grows up as a refugee. Refugees now live permanently as outsiders. They are Local Aliens. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhy? We have witnessed mass displacement before. But the causes of past crises, often wars, have had contained geographies and definable endings. What makes the current moment different?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt has no singular cause or timeline\u2014not the Syrian civil war or a particular earthquake or tsunami. In fact, nearly fifteen new conflicts are fuelling the problem, such as the Yemeni civil war, and the Libyan and Ukrainian crises, along with the protracted older ones, like those in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUnlike in the past, people fleeing conflicts today are highly mobile. Global mass transportation is accessible to an unprecedented number of people, as is the technology needed to research travel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is is not just a new crisis. It is our new reality. Indefinitely.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eResources across nations are running dry. Politicians and peacekeepers responsible for containing chaos are losing their ability to do so. The first response to this new era is to turn people away. Send them back. What does \u201cgoing home\u201d mean, if your house has been burned to the ground, your family has been murdered, or your country denies your citizenship?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThough Local Alien grapples with distressing subject matter, it does not aim to tell a punishing story. In our experience, people undergoing traumas and traveling to new places are never who you expect them to be. They are often funny, always unpredictable, and deeply compelling. Above all, they are heroic, facing impossible decisions and taking action.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe follow an Afghan family returning to violence, a former Afghan Military member forging a new life in Lesvos and a Pakistani refugee caught between helping his family in Karachi, a missing brother in Turkey and a new life for himself in Europe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition, we are also filming testimonials from refugees, migrants, aid workers and officials across different regions. These testimonials will be woven throughout the film for context and made available on a special website which will host further material and resources on this expansive subject.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThese are set to film in the following locations:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eKaren refugees in Mae Sot, Thailand - \u003cem\u003eProduction wrapped\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eRohingya refugees in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh - \u003cem\u003ePost Production Stage:\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eFundraising for translations\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAfghan refugees in Peshawar, Pakistan - \u003cem\u003eCurrently in pre-production, waiting for journalist visas to go through\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eSyrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan - \u003cem\u003eResearch phase\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eSudanese refugees in Israel - \u003cem\u003eResearch phase\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eResettlements in Lesvos, Greece - \u003cem\u003e1st Production Stage Wrapped, 2nd in research phase\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\nArt/Work\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a documentary series, each episode around 20 min in length.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nArt is personal expression, political statement, a means of spiritual survival. It is also work, and one of the only occupations which evades the encroaches of technology and automation, remaining human. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSomewhere Films is profiling working artists around the world, considering how they are molded by or rebelling against their environments. Whether an artist upholds tradition or challenges it, their ultimate goal is the same: to continue to work, to survive. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have thus far filmed female artists and DJs in London\u2019s thriving music scene, artists of all mediums in Iran in the wake of the US travel ban and art students of Kala Bhavana in Santiniketan, West Bengal, India.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWho is creating these projects?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnna is a cinematographer and photographer whose work has been published in Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, the New York Times, i-D, Polyester Zine, CRACK Mag, Oyster Mag and more. She is a video contributor at Getty Images. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nShireen is an editor who has created awareness campaigns and promotional pieces for non-profits like The Nature Conservancy and Great Public Schools Now. She also has worked on documentary films about refugees, culture, and film.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nChiara is a screenwriter whose most recent work was featured on the 2017 Black List, and who has previously written screenplays for producer Tanya Seghatchian and director David Fincher. She directs documentaries, as well as short content for nonprofit organizations, including consulting at the United Nations. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOther members of Somewhere Films will be contributing along the way! You can read about them\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.somewherefilms.com/contributors\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhat will your donation go towards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour donations will go towards production and post production costs. Mostly the money will go towards hiring local fixers and translators at reasonable day rates, security if necessary, video transcription, subtitles, scoring and color grading.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn order to continue producing these projects in a manner that does justice to the subjects and ensures the safety of everyone involved, we\u2019re now looking to you, patrons of the arts and humanities, to lend us a helping hand!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAdditionally, we will offer the NGOs with whom we work a promotional/explainer video, using footage we capture as we shoot \u003cem\u003eLocal Alien\u003c/em\u003e. The video will outline that organization\u2019s project, and they will have the ability to place this spot wherever they choose, in order to raise awareness or funds. The Somewhere Films team had great success with this model at \u003cem\u003eMosaik\u003c/em\u003e, a center for refugees and locals on Lesvos."
