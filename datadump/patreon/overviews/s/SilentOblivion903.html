    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho is this guy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey guys SilentOblivion903 here once again and welcome to my Patreon page. I am a Youtuber and streamer and have been creating content and loving every second of it since March 2014.\u003cbr\u003eI am always trying to develop new and exciting things for my channel and one day the thought hit me, I wonder whether I could come up with some insane challenge and actually be able to do.\u003cbr\u003eA few spun around my mind until one stuck, how about trying to complete 52 games in the space of 52 weeks? Not just 52 easy and quick games because there\u0027d be no challenge in that, but 52 of the greatest games of all time, well maybe a few personal favourites too. So that brings me here....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Have I Made A Patreon Page?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell that\u0027s a good question, I never openly ask for donations but through exploring the website and seeing content creators that I love using this platform it\u0027s clear to see this site isn\u0027t about begging for money, it\u0027s about a community of people who love the same things you do, wanting you to succeed and supporting you in your journey to do that.\u003cbr\u003eI get that Patreon isn\u0027t for everyone and if it doesn\u0027t seem like something you can\u0027t commit to, just don\u0027t want to or think \"why should I give him my damn money\" then that\u0027s ok, I am in no way obligating you to become a Patron in order to share this journey with me.\u003cbr\u003eFollow me on Twitch, Subscribe to me on Youtube, Follow me on Twitter etc and you can be as big of a part of this journey as everyone else. But for those of you that are still reading this and have an interest then please carry on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Why Do I Need Patrons?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOnce again a good question, I have set up this page to help support me in this journey. 52 games in 52 weeks might seem like a walk in the park, I actually set the bar at 100 games originally but trust me 52 games = a lot of hours and potentially a lot of money. Although I already own majority of the games I am planning to do, some I don\u0027t own no longer, consoles get lost, games get traded in etc so it could help with sourcing the rest of the games needed, worse comes to worst then emulators are out there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBut like I said above, 52 games = a lot of hours put into this challenge. Now all games are different, some will range from a couple of hours to 60 hours+ but let\u0027s say 10 hours a game so that\u0027s 520 hours which equals 1.42 hours a day, that\u0027s not much right? well no actually when you put it like that it\u0027s not but some games are huge and require a lot of time to be put into them so I will have to do much longer sessions to get through the games (I can\u0027t spend a month playing 1 game an hour a day) so that by pledging you are allowing me to dedicate these hours needed to be able to complete this challenge and it will allow me to be able to do even more challenges and bring you even more content.\u003cbr\u003eWho know\u0027s if I complete 52 in the first 6 months then I might shoot for 100.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo How Much Do I Have To Pledge?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThat is up to you. Like I said you are not obligated to do so, if you choose to do so thank you, you probably don\u0027t understand what it means to me and how much you are helping this challenge happen. But what you pledge is up to you. Pledges will be taken per game completed so if you sign up on Day 1 then it should be 52 pledges in total. However you can set a limit per month that you can afford, your bills are more important than mine. You can opt out at any time as well, you are not obligated to pledge until the end. In theory it should average 1 pledge a week so if you pledge $1 it\u0027ll be $4-$5 a month but like I said you can set a limit. Also with games varying in lengths it could 4 games in a month, 8 games in a month, 1 game in a month, I don\u0027t know how long some will take yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do I Get Out Of This?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you look at the reward section you will see what you will get for each pledge amount, I will try make them as cool as possible and if I can individual to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, if you are still reading this then you are amazing and if you do decide to join this journey with me then thank you, I love you and it means more to me than I can possibly express through keys on this keyboard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Games Are You Actually Playing \u0026amp; How Can I Watch?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou can join my journey by watching me live on Twitch @ \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/SilentOblivion903\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.twitch.tv/SilentOblivion903\u003c/a\u003e and by subscribing to me on Youtube @ \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/SilentOblivion903\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.youtube.com/user/SilentOblivion903\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAlso make sure you follow me on Twitter @ \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/SilentOblivion1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://twitter.com/SilentOblivion1\u003c/a\u003e to keep up to date about when I\u0027m streaming and uploading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a list of what I intend to play: (List and order subject to change at any time)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.
