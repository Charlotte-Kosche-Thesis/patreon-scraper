    "summary": "First a quote!!... \u003cbr\u003e\"I think Patreon is an incredible step in the right direction for all creative industries... I hope the rest of the world catches on that every time you spend a \ndollar, you\u2019re casting a vote for what kind of products, and companies, \nand musicians become successful. Thanks for voting for me!\"\u003cbr\u003e-Julia Nunes-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAloha!\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my page, I am Ashton Robertson and it has been my \ndream since I was a child to be a musician. I first picked up guitar in \nthe 8th grade, joined marching band soon after, and never looked back. \nAfter starting to write my own music in 2010, being in many bands, and \nfinding my own sound, it wasn\u0027t until 2013 that I got into producing \nelectronic music as a solo artist. I \nhave since released a few albums, many remixes and singles and feel I have found my \"one true calling\". \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/spaceshipearthmusix\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/spaceshipearthmusix\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI \nam bringing forth new and dynamic energy into the music scene with an \nuplifting message, live electric guitar, and multi-genre abilities. It \nis my aim to use my music as a platform to bring a message of \nempowerment to the world, and bring people together at the same time. My\n other music project, Cloudz, is an ambient sound healing, \nmeditation world of its own, and is a part of Merkaba Music! I aim to bring more sound healing to the \nworld, through group events where I use singing bowls with the Cloudz \nmusic to have a organic experience and healing journey, as well as personal sessions which include energy work and/or reiki. \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/spaceshipearthmusix\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/cloudzmusic\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have \nother dreams as well, and if you are connected to me on Facebook you \nwill know that I enjoy writing about what ever is on my mind, and maybe \nyou even found it inspiring and it helped your day along, as I have had \nmany people through the years tell me that my feed helps them a lot! \nWell I have always had a more concrete dream to be an author, and to \nwrite about the secrets of the universe and to help empower others \nthrough words, workshops, online seminars and blogs. By helping support me, I can put\n the pen to pad faster, put out more blogs, videos and help more people \nin this way by sharing my all of my knowledge in a more concrete way.\u00a0Every dollar that comes into Patreon will go directly towards any and all things Spaceship Earth! This in the end will help me bring the world way more FREE things, like these webinars on consciousness which you can check out now, and of course... more music! ; ) Thanks for your vote!!~ \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL1AJOOmW04esqcR1h6FkUgF2CWaFX1G1n\u0026amp;v=D4YBHDWkTpA\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL1AJOOmW04esq...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
