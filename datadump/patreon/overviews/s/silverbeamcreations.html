I have been crafting and creating as long as I can remember but my main training and focus would be my 3D printing. I create high quality models and print them at home, or with professional printing services if I need a different kind of printer and material. I love learning and trying new things and tend to be a jack of all trades, so I will likely implement all kinds of materials and techniques to make all the stuffs. I draw, 3d model, play with clay, string, paper, calligraphy/fonts, write stories, occasionally act, sing, sew, etc etc etc. Before making tapletop merchandise I designed and created Ball jointed dolls, doll accessories as well as cosplay and fantasy accessories and props. I rekindled my love of D\u0026amp;D and table top games a couple years ago, and have been looking for an excuse to incorporate it more into my life. I am the DM of my group, and love hosting one shots with random people and teaching others how to play. Being creative is also important to me as it helps with some of my health problems.\u00a0 Of course I can always leave my work speak for itself, feel free to check out my work and follow to see new creations on any of these links: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOFFICIAL FACEBOOK GROUP!

Every month there will be a new theme, (sometimes chosen by patrons) and items are generally created by me, or sponsors, or retail/wholesale when I can\u0027t do it myself as easily. Your box will generally have at least 2-4 items, more or less, but it depends on the value and which box you choose. You\u0027re box value will ALWAYS be MORE then the original box amount (before fees and shipping).\u00a0 Values for boxes are currently as such: The player/gm box= 15-20$, combo box=30-40$, Custom box= 50-60$ in value)\u00a0 Your box Items will also reflect what box you pick. Some items may overlap, but generally items will be aimed toward the player OR the game/dungeon master. I will likely 3D print and create a lot of your items, but I also work in clay, sew, etc. I may also ask or find sponsors, and other creators to make something special for the box. Sponsors always get a shout out for their awesome work. Items can be finished and ready to use, be kits, or DIY projects like paint your own mini. Item value will Always reflect that, and you will get an item value sheet to let you know exactly what you got\u00a0 in your box. Items should also work for a variety of tabletop role play games, but likely a lot of the items and boxes will be geared toward Dungeons and Dragons. Part of the game type for our boxes will be driven by you. Polls and feedback on what you want will always be taken into actual production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/967/41830618351_ff03060586_z.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Shown is the April 2018 box as an example of quantity and type of items you MIGHT receive)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eFAQ:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShipping=\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Shipping international is the cheapest I could find and is ship at your own risk, unless you upgrade to priority shipping. Please make sure to choose th reward with international shipping attached. It\u0027s a general flat fee that should cover shipping costs but I may email you if shipping is outside the norm for you.\u003cbr\u003e For those in the USA, Shipping is usps first class to help keep costs low. If an item or box is lost or broken in the mail, send me any proof with pics etc if possible and as soon as possible and I will send a replacement on your next month\u0027s subscription. You can also ask and pay to upgrade to priority shipping. *Shipping costs also include shipping supplies into the cost plus a little padding for weight fluctuations from month to month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHEN does my box ship?\u003c/strong\u003e Since a lot of this is made by me, and as number of patrons, and unknown variables are included it will vary, But the4 goal is the 24th of each month. Payment is on the first of the month and I will always update you on any delays and important info here. See delays for more info.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDELAYS=\u003c/strong\u003e On the rare occasion delays happen. A lot of these items are new creations so there could be a lot of tweaking and prototyping involved.\u00a0Sometimes my health can cause delays etc, but I have been dealing with \nit and running and online business for over 6 years so I know how to \nkeep my customers informed and work around my issues and always follow \nthrough with fun and quality items. If a delay or things really mess up the schedule, I will ask for more time, but add in some extras if needed to thank you for your patience. It\u0027s rare, but life happens sometimes. You can always follow me on instagram or in the facebook group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/silverbeamcreations/) for more day to day incite into what is going on. I will do a post for official announcements to keep you informed if anything happens ASAP.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eONE SHOTS AND CAMPAIGNS= \u003c/strong\u003eAs extra rewards and in my stretch goals, I may have one shots or mini campaigns available to come and play with me as the DM. These sessions are a great way to branch out and have fun and for me to practice my skills as a DM, While not a newbie, I still have a ways to go before I can call myself a true master. We will discuss what day and time works best for the group, and I have a variety of tools we can use: Discord, DnD beyond, Skype, web cams, Google hangouts, Youtube livestream, twitch, roll20, tabletops simulator etc. We\u0027ll use whatever works for the group that month. Do keep in mind that I am in Florida, and will be using Eastern time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4752/38460022170_74ca5b6f01_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4618/40270070021_a15461d5c0_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4619/40270015981_90b9e7f13c_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4709/40269999701_4e5b8aca39_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Please note that if necessary I may make changes to any part of this patreon site.
