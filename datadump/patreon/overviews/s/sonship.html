    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHi guys, we are Son Ship- a Christian band that is \u003cstrong\u003eshining light in the darkest places through music\u003c/strong\u003e. We like to think that our music is awesome, but it isn\u0027t the primary reason for what we do. The reason is Jesus- we want to point people to Him and to the truly meaningful and vibrant life that he provides.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhile it\u0027s wonderful that God is preparing an eternal heaven for us, and we should look forward to that, sometimes that can make us miss the richness of this life on earth that He desires for us. When some people think of Christians, they may think of stuffy old folks who live very tame and stale lives, but we believe that we should be a culture of believers that lives life more richly, fully, and freely than anyone else on the planet!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSon Ship\u0027s music is about calling out that richness in our everyday lives, accessing it by not being afraid to stare in the face of the hard stuff. We want to call out things like pornography, depression, suicide, alcoholism, prescription drug abuse, teenage pregnancy, marital betrayal, homelessness, incarceration and to say \"I\u0027m not afraid of you! I\u0027m a child of God and I\u0027m called to live freely!\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some tangible ways that Son Ship has already/is spreading this message of hope:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. We are currently touring churches and venues with our message of hope, using our debut album based on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.celebraterecovery.com/index.php/about-us/twelve-steps\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e12 steps\u003c/a\u003e of recovery to inspire people to continue, enhance, and/or begin their journey of healing\u003cbr\u003e2. We released our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/12/id1297566275\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edebut album\u003c/a\u003e, \u002712\u0027, which features 12 songs based on the popular 12 steps of recovery- this has been a huge tool of encouragement for many people\u003cbr\u003e3. We are partnering with churches locally to help promote their in-house recovery ministries, using our shows as a springboard to encourage people to get more involved\u003cbr\u003e4. We are posting spiritually encouraging and engaging content on our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sonship.band/the-voyage\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e periodically, to challenge and inspire people who have struggles\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are just a few of our many goals for the future:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. We want to continue to make music that shines light into the darkest places we have several ideas for future projects and would love the ability to make them a reality- a lasting tool to encourage those of us who feel lost or broken.\u003cbr\u003e2. We want to reach a consistent funding level where we are able to take our message to places and people that have literally nothing to offer in return (prisons, rehab facilities, etc.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e3. We want to be able to purchase our own sound/lighting system, that we might not be as limited on where we can set up and spread our message\u003cbr\u003e4. We want to be able to create more frequent blog/writing content that tells the stories of real people in recovery and brings encouragement and hope to the masses\u003cbr\u003e5. We want to be able to work less and less in our \"real jobs\", giving us more flexibility to go out and do what we feel the Lord has called us to do with excellence\u003cbr\u003e6. We want to hear what YOU- the community- desires from a project like this, and do all we can to help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe would be honored if you would join us on this journey of healing and hope by considering supporting us on a monthly basis. Please only give what you feel led to give, whether it\u0027s $2 or $200 a month,- if there\u0027s one thing our journey has taught us, it\u0027s that we cannot walk this path alone- we need your help to make this vision a reality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo let\u0027s do this- together we can make a real difference in spreading the love and power of Christ to the husband addicted to pornography, to the wife coping with self-harm, to the suicidal teenager, the insecure pastor, the traumatized veteran- no matter where people are coming from, Christ is the answer, and we want to be a powerful tool that reminds people of that reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGod bless,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSon Ship\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
