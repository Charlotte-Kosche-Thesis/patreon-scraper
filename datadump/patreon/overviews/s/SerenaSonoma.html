If there\u0027s three things you should know about me they are:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.\u00a0I am womanist\u003cbr\u003e2. I am agnostic\u003cbr\u003e3. I am an\u00a0avid writer\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always found that the best way to express myself is through words, since the time I was a child I would write stories for my teachers and grandparents. I wrote for my middle school\u0027s weekly newspaper, I attended weekly poetry readings in high school, I went to college and I studied creative writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, I am a freelance journalist, and I thought about it for quite awhile, but it was my gender transition that finally inspired me on October 2016 to become a full time writer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a transgender woman I face the highest form of workplace discrimination, and as a black transgender woman this is doubly so. Although I did not start the hormonal or expressive aspect of my gender transition at the time, I was preparing myself so that I could transition comfortably. And I knew if I were going to have a lack of job opportunities or face harassment from employers, I might as well take my work into my own hands and be my own boss (I\u0027ve never liked working under people anyway).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, I have become a contributing reporter for Everyday Feminism. I\u0027ve written for various magazines including Wear Your Voice, The Bolde, VICE, Bustle and The Daily Dot and I have no intention of stopping yet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you are still reading this, congratulations. I decided to create this page as a representation of my life as an intersectional womanist. People often ask me \u201cwhy womanism? What even is that?\u201d And most of all, \u201cwhy and what does it mean to be intersectional anyway?\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell you will have to find out more by becoming one of my patrons. But I will tell you this - I am both of these things because I have no choice. My life is at the intersection of multiple identities that cross gender, racial and identity lines. It wasn\u0027t a matter of choosing to be an intersectional womanist, rather, I was chosen. Kind of like the sorting hat in Harry Potter (I am a proud Gryffindor according to Pottermore by the way). But intersectional identities are not fictional, or magic. They are real and concrete and sometimes they can hurt, because they lack visibility.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is why I am here. I want my patrons to know that people like me are humans who live, breathe and pump blood, and live ordinary lives just like anybody else.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003ePortfolio\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eAs a freelance journalist you can find all of my publications at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://serenasonoma.contently.com\"\u003eSerenaSonoma.Contently.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003eContent You Will Find Here\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eI want to convey my life as a marginalized person as best I can and therefore the best way to do that is through blogging.
