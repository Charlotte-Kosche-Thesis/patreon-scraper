    "summary": "Hey, my name is Shanichama, and I love to draw anime and manga, I hope to one day become a professional. I want to become a full time manga artist. Eventually, I want to learn about what it takes to work in the anime industry. Those are big big, goals of mine, and has been that way since junior high.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always wanted to test the waters, and try to get my foot in the door! I want to do art requests, and if my old shit computer would run things properly, I want to do Speed paint videos, many many many, other things. I want to go far to reach my goal!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tend to work from my imagination, along with the help of Jane san, I find working from the mind is a good thing, it leaves a great feeling after seeing the final product. However, there are days where I feel down in the dumps, or having stress with life, it could be a range of things. All I ask is that, everyone to be patience with me. I promise it\u0027s worth the wait!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have experience with drawing art requests, \u003cstrong\u003eBUT\u003c/strong\u003e I have \u003cstrong\u003eONE\u003c/strong\u003e rule. I will gender bend male characters, (drawing guys are hard... don judge meee... \u0026gt;3\u0026gt;)\u00a0 That\u0027s it! that\u0027s the only rule!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to open up like a mini art shop, selling digital artwork, adoptable Oc\u0027s,and doing art requests. I need to earn a bit of money to help buy better art tools, to continue to work on my ultimate goal. I am still learning new techniques, and different things to better my skill, so my work may not be perfect, but everyone is still learning am I right?\u00a0 Another thing\u00a0 I know from experience on a virtual store I ran, no one wants to spend a ton of money on art, so I don\u0027t charge much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for stopping by, and checking out what I had to say, I hope you continue to stick around and watch me develop, I couldn\u0027t do much without your help .w.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
