I am a father of a beautiful 4 year little girl named Eve and a Chef by trade. Both myself and my daughter have Autism and while I know this is not information that I really need to share I feel that if I am going to ask people to support me in my endeavors that people should know who I really am.\u00a0 In my spare time I enjoying making videos primarily for Minecraft a game I have been playing since 2012.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am new to making videos and have only really been at it for around 7 months. In that time I have received and immense about of support from my community and growth from my channel and have grown to love making videos and reading peoples comments. It is because of you guys that my channel has blown up like it has and I can only hope it continues to do so in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI create my videos with the intention to be both entertaining and educational in all things Minecraft while making many derps as I do along the way. I create my videos to be a family friendly\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a service where you can pledge to send a regular payment to creators, so they can support themselves and keep making new stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is better for creators than advertising or sponsorship. The content is 100% uncompromised, payment is more predictable, and creators don\u0027t need to stoop to clickbait content or other shady practices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon means that creators serve their viewers, not advertisers or corporate sponsors. And where the viewers choose what deserves to be made and who deserves a voice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will I end up paying?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get to decide how much you pledge, how long you want to support the channel for, and how often you pay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you need the money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am working towards making Youtube my full time job by the end of 2018. To do this I require Patreon supporters as I do not make enough from Youtube alone to be able to do this. The money will be used to upgrade my system, buy streaming gear and pay my daily bills for both me and my little girl. This will ensure I will be able to dedicate 60-80 a week creating content."
