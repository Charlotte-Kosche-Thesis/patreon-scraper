My name is Christian \u0026amp; i otherwise go on YouTube (probs where you know me from) by FeintAttacks! i owe so much to the community for allowing me to do what i love and that is to make videos on YouTube. My YouTube channel focuses mainly on Pokemon, ever since i was little the franchise has being a huge part of my life and YouTube allows me to share my love for the game with everyone. i started my jorney on YouTube in 2015 and i\u0027ve being loving every single moment, our channel as managed to reach over 32,000 AMAZING subscribers that share the same interest as me! its amazing the support they give each video \u0026amp; comment section. One day i hope i could make this my dream job and become a full time content creator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow im pretty sure you have all heard that everyone wants to become a Youtuber right? Today im writing this to tell you that i have a passion for this, ive never wanted anything as much to be part of a community where we share all things together, where people are not worried to post how they feel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen i told people that i record myself playing Pokemon and uploading it to YouTube people laughed, people told me that im wasting my time, that i was childish and should grow up. But once i got into the community they helped and supported my dream and its all because of you guys today where i am and i\u0027m forever grateful for this opportunity and blessing you have gave me. If you feel you\u0027re in the same boat reading this as i once was believe me, just go for it! why should you be scared to show who you are? You love playing Pokemon and want to be a Youtuber then go for it! You like other Nintendo games but scared to think what people will say..? who cares about them, just go for it! The one thing that held me back for so long when doing YouTube was other peoples thoughts and opinions on it but to tell you the truth i couldn\u0027t care less what people thought. You make your own destiny and why not share it with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, i honeslty again cannot thankyou enough for become part of my life in this and i hope you guys can support me on mine! thankyou so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Christian (FeintAttacks)\u003cbr\u003e"
