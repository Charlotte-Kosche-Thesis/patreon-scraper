I\u0027ve been doing this art thing for roughly 10 years now, and hoping to continue that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I could very well do a lot of commissioned work, but I would also like to achieve some goals like getting some artwork out and collecting enough to maybe put out a sketchbook or full on art book. I would also like to start work on developing some games!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I come to you, hopeful patron, to support me in this adventure of art. Your support would help me with paying for any bills, groceries, and get some time to work on my skills in art as well as time to work on other projects and developing games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I don\u0027t just expect you to throw cash at my face, unless you\u0027re buying a commission. You pledging will have some benefits! Whether it\u0027s worth it is obviously up to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledging to me would get you sneak peaks at any pieces of art that I have planned, as well as progress shots of what I currently have on my plate. I can also offer some sort of poll to decide on what to try and work on throughout the month, be it my characters, others, or fanart stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will do my best to make this worth it for you fine folks! If you feel it\u0027s worth it, please, pledge! :) I\u0027d greatly appreciate it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t feel obligated to do so if you don\u0027t want to! I post on other places, so if you want to just see the art that I upload, that is OK.
