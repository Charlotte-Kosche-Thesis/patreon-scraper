After dabbling in the Chicago improv scene and making a few short films, they decided to plunge into the wonderful world of podcasting by asking the question so many of us ask, \u201cCan We Start a Podcast?\u201d Every episode, Julia and Alec try something new, whether it\u2019s a polyamorous relationship advice show or a zombie apocalypse audio drama. And it\u0027s all made possibly by YOUR support! We couldn\u0027t possibly start any kind of podcast if it wasn\u0027t for the help from our amazing patrons! Thank you for pledging on our Patreon page!"
