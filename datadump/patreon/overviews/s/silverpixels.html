    "summary": "Hey there! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make videos of me playing video games on the regular. Those games are usually of the horror variety. It\u0027s really just a hobby, and something I find enjoyable. Other people finding it entertaining was a happy accident. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started by streaming on Twitch when I got a PS4, because it was a built-in feature and... why not, right? Soon I had viewers, and not long after that, those viewers suggested that I make a YouTube channel and make videos on a more official, daily basis. So I did. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really didn\u0027t expect many people to give half of a crap what I was doing on my little corner of YouTube. I mean, there are a lot of extremely talented creators out there doing the same exact thing and not getting noticed at all, and I just scream and run away in reaction to scary things. Big deal, right? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, it actually turned out to be a big deal. For me, anyway. One subscriber lead to three, which lead to 20, which lead to 100... and before long, there were a lot of amazing fans, forming this little mini community. That mini community has been a really big deal, and the support people have shown me has been staggering. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know I\u0027m still a fairly small channel, a pip-squeak if you will, compared to some of the YouTube famous gamers, but it still means more to me than words can adequately express. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny money earned here will mostly be used to go back into the channel, to make it better in some way. Games are expensive, and the money I\u0027ve spent on the amount of them required to make daily videos is adding up. Ad revenue and free games help, but a lot of the really good games cost money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomeone (a few people, actually) have suggested that I make this. A Patreon account. I resisted for a long time, because I didn\u0027t want people to think that I do this for money. But honestly, your support could help a lot, when it comes down to it. So here I am. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what I do and wish to support me, as well as have the means to... Well, you\u0027re freaking amazing and I love you. ...Oh, that\u0027s too much? Fine, I\u0027ll just send virtual hugs your way and say thank you. butalsoyou\u0027reprettyamazing,so.\u003cbr\u003e"
