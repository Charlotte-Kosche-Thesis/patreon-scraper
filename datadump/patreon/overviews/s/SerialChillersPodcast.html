That\u0027s why I am so pleased to bring you this podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery week, I bring the story of a serial killer to share with you and my in studio guests. During the telling of this killers life story, and crimes they have committed, there are multiple questions and challenges for the guests to earn points! We add up the points in the end and crown a winner! What do they win you ask? NOTHING!! Bragging rights are the prize! I would love to have REAL prizes for them but I have to start somewhere!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDid I mention that each guest brings some type of dark tale of their own? That\u0027s right, in addition to the story and game we play each week, the guests will bring a few other stories just to break the monotony of pure serial killer ramblings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a podcast with a slight game show twist, where I look into the lives of some very infamous people with great detail, and bring the story for exactly what it is. My guests bring you some interesting stories to break up my main event and we all laugh quite a bit in between. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo join us if you will and please do enjoy the Serial Chillers Podcast!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Jesse"
