I have a strong belief in authenticity as a lifestyle and strive to mindfully practise love and laughter every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m on Patreon, because I have a dream of living my art. To work from home so that I am able to be with my children when they need me, to have a flexible schedule that grants me the opportunity help others connect with their own hearts and healing when they need to. All of my art comes from my heart and with it I seek to not only create and share beautiful images and creations but also, to cultivate and support creative community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile everyone is welcome to be part of that through liking, sharing, purchasing or otherwise supporting my work, those of you who are able and chose to join me here as a patron will have access to behind the scenes bits and pieces that don\u0027t get shared or shown elsewhere. There are also some special rewards I am developing especially for patrons and becoming one would mean you get input into just how that manifests!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eArt as Method\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIllustrations, both real media and digital, are the foundation of my work. \u0027ve been drawing since I could hold a crayon! Most often these pieces are created at the whim of my muse though I do adore working with others to create illustrations for stories, poetry, games and characters. When someone trusts me with their OC (Original Character) it means a lot. Fantasy and nature themed images are always a pleasure to render; trees, flowers, mountains, lakes, elves, faeries, dragons and anthropomorphic creatures are my sort of thing. They come easily to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith clay, wire, crystals, feathers and more I create sculptures, charms and ornaments. These are made to be displayed, worn or hung in a place where you will see, hear or feel them often and be reminded of their purpose and meaning. For these I try to use as much found, recycled and natural objects as possible including semi-precious stones, feathers, shell and bone. Colour, light, sound and texture are a big part of these creations!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also create Sacred Intuitive images, evocative imagery intended to aid the viewer in connecting consciously with their own heart and spirit. The creation of these sometimes involves meditation/divination as part of the process and always, love. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
