My Patreon first began as merely just an art-based one, but I soon realised that I could combine my passion for writing alongside it. Gaining popularity for my Tales of Zestiria fanfiction helped me come to this realisation, and since then, I have based my Patreon around both my art and my writing!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began writing and artwork around the same time as each other, when I was nine. I started to take both more seriously around fourteen, when I started to draw everyday and began writing fanfiction. Since then, I have improved a huge amount in both, especially in the last 1-2 years. I don\u0027t believe that I would be the same without both of these.\u003cstrong\u003e They are now my whole world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future, I would love to take the step forward into \u003cstrong\u003eproducing more art and begin selling prints, badges, notepads and other products using my designs.\u003c/strong\u003e It is one of my biggest dreams to be able to do this at conventions! \u003cstrong\u003eHowever, I am struggling to build up these funds myself.\u003c/strong\u003e Due to health issues, I have too much pain and exhaustion to create art, go to college \u003cem\u003eand \u003c/em\u003ework part time, as much as I\u0027d love to do all three.
