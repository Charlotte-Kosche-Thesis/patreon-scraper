I am the breath and the heartbeat of Let That Songbird Go Music and Photography. I write songs. It\u0027s what I do and what I do best. I began playing guitar when I was fourteen so I could get famous and marry Daniel Johns, the uber dreamy front man of the Australian rock band silverchair (remember them??). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u0027t know it at the time, but music was my language (and really the only one I speak somewhat fluently). Motivations have changed since those swooning teenage years but my passion to write songs has not. I have traveled all over the country sharing my music, but more importantly I have written songs for birthdays, for weddings,\u00a0for births and deaths, and everything in between. I have had the privilege of writing into song the stories told by people who weren\u0027t able to do it by themselves. What an honor.\u003cem\u003eThis is my thing. \u003c/em\u003eThis is my light in a world that could use more light\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eI have hundreds of songs\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eand I love them\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. And not to be dramatic about it but I have a very real fear of dying without each one of them getting their chance to be heard, without each one getting their small, humble chance at a moment in the spotlight, to reach a heart that just might need it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve just released my fifth studio album, Back to Eden, co-written with Hollywood producer Joss Whedon. It\u0027s still hot off the press and\u00a0I\u0027m already planning out the double album I want to put out in the coming months, plus the ukulele break up album I\u0027ve been ready to record for the last seven years, \u003cem\u003eplus\u003c/em\u003e an album of songs incorporating the poetry of my father who passed away when I was young,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e the next regular ol\u0027 full length album after \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e.

     "about": "Shawnee Kilgore is an Austin, TX singer-songwriter living a crowd-funding fairy tale.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2014, Shawnee launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund her fourth solo album, A Long and Precious Road. In her video message to potential backers, a tribute to Dylan\u0027s Subterranean Homesick Blues, she held up a card that said \"I\u0027m learning to ask for help.\" This vulnerable and honest phrase struck a chord for one particular music fan perusing Kickstarter projects on his rare off time -- Joss Whedon. Whedon, one of Hollywood\u0027s most prominent directors (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, The Avengers) loved Shawnee\u0027s music and her voice, and backed the project, taking the first step towards what would become the unlikeliest of creative partnerships. A few days later he emailed to say he couldn\u0027t get her song out of his head, and wondered if she would be interested in working on a co-write with him. After a mere four months they put out their song \u201cBig Giant Me\" as a single. \u201cIt was so clear that we were speaking the same language,\u201d Joss said, \u201cIt\u0027s been a little bit magical.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn October 2016 they released their long awaited collaboration EP, \u201cBack to Eden.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe record was recorded at Ocean Studios in Burbank, CA, and features an all-star crew of supporting musicians, including Nickel Creek\u0027s Sara Watkins on fiddle and backing vocals. Whedon wrote a large portion of the lyrics, and Kilgore wrote the majority of the music. \u201cThe songs are very personal,\u201d says Whedon, when asked about the process. \u201cIt opened up a lot of stuff. It was actually a kind of painful experience to write some of this stuff down, as simple as it was.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShawnee would be the first to tell you that the boots you just complimented her on cost $3 at a thrift store. She\u0027ll give the real answer when you ask how she\u0027s doing and she\u0027s just had her heart broken. That\u0027s the honesty with which she speaks, writes, and lives. She sings to you about all the things you know\u2014love, life, laughter and loss\u2014but does so with such fiercely personal and poetic truth that you can\u0027t help finding, and understanding, your own world through hers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u201cThis just felt right,\u201d Whedon said. \u201cTo speak in her voice and to find out the things we share and the things that are universal between two people who are at radically different places in both of their lives, and on the map \u2014 it\u2019s really exciting for me.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShawnee moved from her hometown of Bellingham, WA to Austin, TX in 2010. Her most recent solo release, A Long and Precious Road, earned her a place among Texas Music Magazine\u2019s albums of the year, as well as being named their #1 Songwriter of Distinction, an accolade shared by Kacey Musgraves and Leon Bridges.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u201cShawnee Kilgore is that rare breed of songwriter who can lead you through familiarity and somehow always end up with you somewhere surprising,\u201d says longtime Austin songwriter Danny Schmidt. \u201cHer songs are personal and intimate, snapshots of tiny images very close up, of little observations so familiar and yet so keen that they reconnect us to our every day while somehow managing to disconnect us from our everyday enough that we can notice the preciousness of what\u2019s always surrounding us. It\u2019s a hell of a nifty trick! Shawnee\u2019s in my very highest category of songwriter: Those whose next song I can\u2019t wait for them to write.\u201d\u003c/p\u003e",

Every one of my patrons is already invited to choose any song in the world for me to learn and record, but reaching this milestone will make it OFFICIAL (and make the list go faster!). Since I learned guitar by writing my own songs and not by learning other folks\u0027 this has been really fun (and educational) for me. So far I have covered Jonathan Coulton through Eva Cassidy, and on deck are *slightly* terrifying numbers by Ani DiFranco and Richard Thompson. Sure NBD I got this. Yeah no problem. I can do it. It\u0027ll be fine. Yep fine. What else ya got for me??",
