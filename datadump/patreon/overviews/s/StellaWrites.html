I\u2019m Stella Price, and I\u2019m\nan author. I have been writing 10 years, both with my sister and without, and\nwith others on occasion. In that time I have published over 40 pieces of literature, from novels to short stories to flash fiction. I love to write. It\u2019s all I ever wanted to do. Tell\nthe stories that live full time in my brain meats. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd it took a long time to get to this\npoint. So many different things that caught my interest, so many crappy jobs\nand false starts on things that didn\u2019t really matter. In my life, before\nsticking with writing for the long haul, I was a model, retail jockey, a tour\nmanager, club promoter, jewelry designer\u2026 none of it stuck. Till I started\nwriting. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWriting is the only thing I have cared\nabout long enough to keep going with it. As a Gemini, I\u2019m often interested in a\nlot, but rarely stick with it. Writing, producing stories, publishing, is the\nonly thing I love to do. Through the triumphs and the disappointments. I have\nseen other writers come and go, but after ten years, I am still here. And believe me, its been a hard road.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThough I have been luckier than some, having a\nspouse that supports and accepts the crazy person he married (even before he\nmarried me), someone that understands me on a fundamental level. And that has\nallowed me to write, and publish a back list I am extremely proud of, one I am planning to add to. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI never found fame, never found glory, and\ntoo often my sales were underwhelming. I was never published with a publisher\nthat pushed my work (other than the publisher I personally started) and I have never\nbeen a list hitter or celebrated by my peers for being the next big thing. But that didn\u2019t stop me, because I didn\u2019t get\ninto this to be a household name, or peer popularity or fame and fortune. I got into this to tell stories people wanted\nto read, and connect with the people that read them. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIts simple. I want to keep writing.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI don\u2019t want a career where my work is all\nthere is. I just want to be able to create for the people that love my work,\nwho support it, and who want more of it. You, my amazing fans, can help make\nthat a reality\u2026 because my career is all in thanks to you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou have given me the ability to go\nforward, keep writing because someone, other than me, wants to read what I write. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith your support I can keep going on this\npath, keep producing my work, keep telling stories, keep making you happy with\nmore words and worlds to read. Patreon will allow me to produce more work by ensuring I\u0027m not worrying about \u003cem\u003eHOW\u003c/em\u003e I\u0027m going to have enough $ to put the work out (because Putting out books costs a LOT of money that I rarely see a 1/3 of after release.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTruth is I haven\u0027t made more than a 400$ profit in all my years. and that\u0027s Okay.. because I didn\u0027t get into this to be a money maker. Yes, it would be nice, but to make money these days, you need to compromise your art in the publishing arena, writing to trend, and not the stories that i ultimately wanna tell. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to keep putting out QUALITY WORK, filled with well crafted stories, memorable characters and ideas that push the envelope of whats popular and accepted in publishing today. Basically I want to keep putting out what you have come to expect from me, not cut the quality to put out cookie cutter crap that will get me the quantity (but really, 35 cents off a 99 cent book is not really helping any author either). And that\u0027s not me talking smack about anyone else. I just will not compromise for the sake of being a \u0027best seller\". Not when the reality of that word has become so skewed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to produce more audio. I want to branch out into different languages, and other storytelling mediums, like graphic novels, and video. I want all these things. the books deserve these things. Sadly because the way the industry is so much quality work gets thrown by the wayside, and those of us producing for the joy of producing and the sake of our art are largely having to make their own way... with the help of our supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd Patreon is a great way to support your favorite authors, without having to do things you might not have time to do, like online promotion, street teaming, and reviews. (Don\u0027t get me wrong, all those things are amazing and we all love them SO MUCH but.. dedication for us should be reserved for the words we write, the stories we tell. not taking more time from you to push us. Not when there are other options.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO YOU GET OUT OF IT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn short: More work.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout the stress of wondering how the hell I\u0027m going to produce something new because Amazon and other outlets constantly are screwing me (and all authors really) out of fair royalties, and visibility, I can work and produce. So not stressing over making enough money to cover more work means I can WRITE more work and put out more work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will also allow me to finish series quicker, allowing for books to go into a bunch of mediums, including Audio, and full series bundles in e book. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(PS: so I was told to put this but.. all physical rewards will be sent out to patrons that have successful billing.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo consider this. Help me keep you in words and stories. Help me achieve a very achievable dream. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are awesome. I am awesome. The books are awesome. Let\u0027s all be awesome together. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
