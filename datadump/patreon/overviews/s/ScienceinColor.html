    "summary": "Representation matters. \u00a0Seeing people who look like us or identify like us doing things that we aspire to do is an experience that everyone deserves and that we all should deem worthwhile. \u00a0Of course, as you may know, this experience is often hard to come by for women, people of color, the LGTBQ community, and other marginalized groups. \u00a0Often this lack of representation is exacerbated in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields. \u00a0We plan to help fix that. \u00a0Science in Color is about building a platform to give voice to the voiceless in STEM. \u00a0We\u0027re a multimedia group (podcasts, written content, website, etc.) aimed at telling the stories of underrepresented groups and highlighting the issues unique to them. \u00a0And we\u0027ll definitely be telling it like it is; no pulled punches or sugar-coating here. \u00a0The stories we share and the issues we confront are sometimes sad, sometimes, painful, sometimes joyous, sometimes funny, but they\u0027re all important and necessary. \u00a0The world of STEM is an amazing and dynamic place filled with people and experiences that have. for too long, been in the dark. \u00a0We\u0027re here to bring the color.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Why pledge a monthly subscription to us?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love us and you love what we do, a monthly subscription is one way to show it. \u00a0These donations would help us keep our content coming more consistently by helping us to update our equipment when necessary, keep the site running, focus more time on Science in Color, and to continue to make consistent, high-quality content that is both impactful and informative. \u00a0Plus you\u0027re gonna get some dope rewards! \u00a0We all win!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy are we asking for a subscription or donations?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goals of \u00a0Science in Color are important to us and are, honestly, important to STEM as a whole. \u00a0We want the work of the organization to be meaningful and we want to have a positive impact on the lives of people who may feel that they\u0027ve been left out because of their identities. \u00a0If you\u0027re anything like us and support social justice, you\u0027ll understand the necessity of centering those who have been relegated to the background for too long. \u00a0These donations will help us pursue that goal in earnest and with passion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe thank all of our supporters for helping us spread these important stories!"
