    "summary": "Starship VI is a free education platform in its infancy, with a mission to level the playing field for underserved populations in all manner of academic curricula.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/3269c95ef34b325f0b6c7fd27f86b9f4/tumblr_inline_p4y3bwv5sZ1vcje6d_540.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt began when I experienced first-hand, through my modest private tutoring business, the reality of the dramatic and well-researched achievement gap between students from affluent families and students whose families simply don\u0027t have the resources to get extra help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn providing some assistance to a family friend, I was inspired by the drive and desire of a student who was incredibly grateful to get whatever help she could as she prepared for college entrance exams. I was faced with the realization that many young people with great natural ability want to get into the best colleges--or simply want to be the first in their families to get a university education--but just can\u0027t afford the extra guidance and help that will push them into the best selection pools. I decided to build a platform that would provide such students with the same in-depth education and exploration that I give the clients who are able to pay for my one-on-one time. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI knew immediately that it could be engaging and funny, visual and animated, while still being comprehensive and detailed. Having always been a space nerd, I knew I wanted to work with a cosmic theme and write a story for the platform that surrounded a student\u0027s ongoing progress toward their true potential. I discovered that it was a metaphor for my own life\u0027s contribution as well.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/ae9ef2d11ce9235bc9435db312db2892/tumblr_inline_p4y345AUdN1vcje6d_540.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause there\u0027s a great deal of free SAT material available and comparably little high-quality ACT material, I decided that the first focus of Starship VI would be the latter test. I\u0027ve beta-tested the first few videos as early prototypes with dozens of high school students who are excited about its value, and the positive reviews from teachers have been nothing less than sustaining, simply.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince I have a day job helping students I love, two things are possible: I\u0027m able to give my free time to this work without needing wage-level compensation, and every dollar of patronage is able to go directly into supporting the project. From hard drives to website design and growth, from marketing materials to in-school presentations, from graphic assets to commissioning electronic soundtracks, the value of your support in creating an outstanding experience cannot be overstated.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, friends, if you\u0027re socially conscious and value lifting up often-ignored students who just need that extra boost in order to reach entirely new avenues of life, your patronage here will make a direct difference in the life of one of those kids...perhaps many. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you understand the college game, and know how hard it is for young people to set themselves apart, then you know how much of an influence that family dollars can play in preparing them for that whole set of hoops. I want to remove those dollar-based obstacles and, in my small way, perhaps give new opportunities to young people who may not otherwise have the chance.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd so, I just want to offer my thanks so much for considering a contribution to better education for all. In the time that I have, I\u0027m averaging about 3 videos per month; they are detailed and labor-intensive. The overall procedure for a single problem involves creating the instructional outline, developing the visual presentation, filming and re-filming in my green-screen studio, editing instruction to match timely animations, and, at last, producing the final video. The data are not refined yet, and I only have a few videos in final form, but I\u0027m averaging about 36 man-hours per video...accomplished during free time. This varies by the difficulty of the content, or the length of the conceptual outline, so some videos are slightly more, and some are much less.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/31103c4d90989f4fcb1c649a809dee2e/tumblr_inline_p4y3geBr5x1vcje6d_540.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve started the tier system at just four early Starfleet ranks, and future ranks will only become available as squads and platoons fill up with ground forces. Higher-tiered troops will receive the first opportunity to advance their tier, if a spot opens and if they are interested in advancing their pledge. Please read tier descriptions for an understanding of this rank development and the humble perks!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve designated the support method as payable per creation, so that you can be sure that your contributions directly motivate and sustain new help for young people, until there\u0027s so much content, they couldn\u0027t get through it all. With patience and dedication, we can build an extraordinary body of work that helps kids achieve amazing results in their lives. Humanity needs their good work, and they\u0027ll be able to do it because of your direct investment in them. Let\u0027s leave a legacy together!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBest wishes, my friends, and I look forward to seeing you soon in a future mission.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
