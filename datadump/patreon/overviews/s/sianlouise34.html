    "summary": "Thank you for all the support I have had over the years in local and national organising and activism. Many will know me through my writing on gender and class, though writing has previously been only a small part of my work. I have arranged community events to support women and children, created online and offline feminist spaces which are women only for our development, empowerment and advancement. Everything I work on has solidarity at the heart as I oppose charity personally and politically. Patreon is an opportunity for those further from me geographically to show solidarity by supporting the change I create in my world for women and for children, especially for working class families in my community.\u00a0This is my personal patreon to enable me to continue this work and reduce the hours I spend in paid employment."

The strike and media campaign led by Mary MacArthur, Julia Varley, Thomas Sitch and Charles Sitch with prominent interviews given by oldest chainmaker Patience Round, ultimately won women and all workers the right to an enforceable minimum wage.

In 1940 it was agreed by the engineering federation that women should receive the same wage as men after 32 weeks in post, but Rolls Royce evaded equal pay until challenged in 1943 by the Amalgamated Engineering Union who agreed a new grading system. It would still leave around 80% of women workers underpaid so 16, 000 women and some men went on strike.

     "description": "Increased migrantion in the post war years meant more workers from Black and Asian heritage in the UK. Regardless of experience and education many job skills were barred to these workers. In 1963 the Bristol Omnibus Company colluding with with the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) operated a colour bar, allowing only white workers in the higher paid positions on bus crews. West Indians Roy Hackett, Owen Henry, Audley Evans and Prince Brown with their chosen spokesperson Paul Stephenson who was west African challenged the bar using test cases, media attention and a bus boycott. Their work led to Raghbir Singh, a Sikh man, becoming Bristol\u0027s first bus conductor who was a person of colour, 17 September 1963. A few days later he was joined by two Jamaicans and two Pakistani men. This work contributed to the passing of the Race Relations Act 1965 and the Race Relations Act 1968.\n\u003cp\u003eYour solidarity takes their name.\u003c/p\u003e",
