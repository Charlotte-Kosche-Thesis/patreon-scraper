    "summary": "Hello, my name is Alex Milton. Or, known otherwise as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/smellmyfingergunz\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSmellMyFingerGunz\u003c/a\u003e - and I am here to tell you why you should pledge to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Streaming adventure went into overdrive early December, 2017. While I had tried several times before, it never felt quite right. So, I had to spend some time sitting back, and taking the time to figure out exactly what direction I wanted to move my channel in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat kind of community did I want to build? What kind of games do I want to play? What sort of attitude do I want to bring to the table?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I discovered in my year-long journey was how important it is to just be yourself. Play what you want to play. Be who you are. After all, no one wants to follow someone who doesn\u0027t seem genuine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s when I got back to streaming, and kicked it into high gear. This time, I wasn\u0027t flying by the seat of my pants. I had a plan. I had intention. I had ambition. And it paid off. In a matter of two weeks, my Follower count nearly tripled, and I reached Affiliate status on Twitch. I also experience steady view growth every day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that\u0027s not where the story ends. Now, we have to look to the future. We have to take what this little community has done, and push forward. There\u0027s still a long road to travel before I can accomplish my goal of streaming full time, as a carer, and none of it is possible without people to support me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePeople like you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI say Thank You, though I feel that is an understatement. I don\u0027t there are words enough in the English Language to convey my deepest, sincerest gratitude for those who give their time, and money, so I can dream my dreams.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter all, without your support, I\u0027m just a man with an internet page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledging will not only allow me to stream regularly, but it will also help shape the path we walk forward. Better equipment. Better technology. A larger game library.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd most importantly, the capacity to survive, while doing something that I love. Something that defines a part of who I am.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey say it\u0027s dangerous to go alone, so I won\u0027t. Because the path I walk is full of friends, and open arms to help me along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, I ask you one question: Will you walk with me?\u003c/strong\u003e"
