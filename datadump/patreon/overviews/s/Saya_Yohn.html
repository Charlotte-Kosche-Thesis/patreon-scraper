I fulfill my nerdy desires with hardcore gaming, DMing my own campaign, and you guessed it, cosplaying. \u00a0One of the very first cons I had ever attended was San Diego Comic Con, about 5 years ago, \u00a0and I fell in love!!! This was the first time I had been exposed to such intricate detailed, larger than life cosplays. I was hooked. I knew this is what I wanted to do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI absolutely love dressing up as my favorite characters and bringing them to life, not only for myself but for others who love them too. I know I haven\u0027t been doing this for a long time but I assure you I am full of passion and excitement for what it is I am doing. I design and sew many on my costumes and have even hammered and sanded my own brass and stainless steel pieces to give costumes something extra special. I would be willing to take suggestion on what it is people want to see cosplayed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to be able to do more. That\u0027s where you come in. With your help I will be able to create more stuff, reach out to more people and share what it is I love to do with fellow comic book lovers, gamers, and just fans of it all. \u00a0And it return you guys get some special stuff... exclusive photos and selfies, prints, behind the scenes costume pictures.... you know just fun, cool, super awesome stuff just for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the end, your support would be crazy awesome and I promise I will do my best to make sure you will love all the behind the scenes... patron only.... fun prints and gifts stuff!!!"
