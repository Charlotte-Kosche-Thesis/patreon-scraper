My name is Sarah, and I\u0027ve been interested in pretty much all types and forms of art since I was little.\u003cbr\u003eI love to draw, I consider myself better with visual media than writing it all down. \u003cstrong\u003eand so\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve been experimenting and making comics as a way to get my stories out to everyone else. I\u0027ve made it a personal goal to keep on improving at whatever it is I do, whether it be art, writing, or even who I am as a person. After all, everything\u0027s a learning experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut not everything\u0027s a smooth ride. I can\u0027t do this alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy parents are in a very tough spot, they work hard every day and are rarely ever home. yet they are still\u00a0basically living by the paycheck. I\u0027m the oldest sibling in the house hold, helping taking care of two younger ones.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been diagnosed with depression and my physical health isn\u0027t the best, but we don\u0027t have the money or time to go to pick up medicine or anything. I\u0027ve been working on getting my driver\u0027s license, but we don\u0027t even have time for \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve considered finding a job, however my parents are urging me to not just get \u003cem\u003eANY\u003c/em\u003e job. Only what they want and approve of, and art\u0027s not related to any of it. Their high standards are pretty restricting, but I know they just want the best for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the patreon money, I can get some income to ease my parents\u0027 life a bit by doing what I love. And that\u0027s writing stories, drawing, and then mashing them up together into comics pages!\u003cbr\u003eI also play video games, both casually and sometimes competitively. I may offer tips and tricks videos for the ones I\u0027m good at, or just post gameplay videos for you to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e (But let\u0027s not lose focus here, the main promise is comics.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince it will be my main source of income, I can focus on producing content full time.\u003cbr\u003eMy stuff will go back and forth from Original works to Fan works!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore rewards will added later on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time!"
