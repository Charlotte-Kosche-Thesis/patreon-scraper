In a pinch, you can write on yourself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe pay scale for short stories spans a wide, strange scale: anywhere from a contributor\u0027s copy (sweet, but not terribly practical in the long-term, unless you want a convenient way to wave your ego in your friend\u0027s faces) to a flat $10/story, to the (best case), per-word reward of around .10/word. Long before you reap any of the rewards, you can expect an average of three months of suspenseful silence waiting for someone to unearth your labor of love from their e-mail inbox, often followed by polite no-thank-yous. Simultaneous submissions are frequently frowned upon, meaning one story might take a year to rehome... all for the previously mentioned $10, and the relief of hearing \"yes\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut this project specifically is even more challenging: in order to maintain my publication rights, \u003cstrong\u003ethese stories will need to remain\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u00a0unpublished\u003c/b\u003e until I am prepared to publish them \u003cem\u003etogether\u003c/em\u003e.

In the fanciest cases, you will be affording me the ability to upgrade my tools, attend writing workshops and conventions, and pursue all my options for publishing/promotion. Because I\u0027m a realist, I\u0027ll also be candid and thank you for the fact that other months, you\u0027ll be affording me the luxury of liquid fabric softener. In both cases, I\u0027ll be sharing what the team made happen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong-term, I am hoping to bridge the gap between hobby writing and building (dare I say it) a career, and can\u0027t imagine a better way than with such an interactive platform.
