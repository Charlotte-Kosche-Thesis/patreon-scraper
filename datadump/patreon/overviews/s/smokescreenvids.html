I would like to keep upping the production value of my videos to start. My short term goals include new equipment, (first a decent external mic), full version editing software, and lighting so that I can produce better quality videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven short videos take a lot of time and work, especially\u00a0working fulltime, my daughter and her activities (mainly travel softball). YouTube is yet another full-time job. But I\u00a0really enjoy\u00a0running my channel and will continue no matter what to release (hopefully) good content on a regular basis, so please don\u0027t feel obligated to give, but again even the smallest amount will be greatly appreciated!
