Yet there could be more and better comics/pop-culture criticism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSequart Organization has been fighting this battle for almost two decades, and we intend on winning it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough a website with daily content, over 25 books in print, and 7 documentary films, Sequart Organization wants everything it does to educate, stir thought, and be accessible to a general audience. Yes, we\u0027re scholars, but we\u0027re not snooty about it. We want you to be able to show us to your friends and say, \"Here\u0027s a place where comics and popular culture are taken seriously. This organization shows that comics, TV, and film can be every bit as deep as Shakespeare or anything else.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning a website and a book line and a movie line takes a huge amount of time and money. Google ads don\u0027t pay the bills, and 1500-word articles on comics (that take hours or even days to write) can\u0027t compete for impressions with 200-word reports of movie gossip or celebrity wardrobe malfunctions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need to pay editors if we\u0027re going to grow, and we\u00a0want to pay more writers too.\u00a0Your contribution will help keep us independent. It will help free us to focus on growing Sequart. It will allow us to expand our offerings online. And it will also help compensate our regular website writers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you SO much for your kind consideration!"
