    "summary": "Scott (the little guy) and Bart (the big guy) are the Scotch Test Dummies. Buddies for 22+ years we fell in love with Scotch and whisk(e)y. We have always entertained with good comedic banter and decided to make a whisk(e)y review show with a little chuckle on the side. We hope to entertain and educate (both you and us) in the least pretentious way possible. Heck we\u0027re just a couple Scotch Test Dummies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatron support will go toward new video equipment and future road shows along the Bourbon Trail and Scotland. \u00a0Funds also assist in the purchase of review bottles for the show. On occasion we receive a bottle from a fan or a distillery for review, but we never accept bottles with review restrictions. On occasion one of us won\u0027t like a particular bottle; we will tell you why. We also often compare one bottle to another in a versus or shootout episode. \u00a0The Dummies always retain full editorial control of our show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0We have 450+ videos on YouTube releasing three a week on average. One Wednesday, one Saturday and almost always one LIVE show on Sunday. Come hang out for a while. \u00a0JOIN the Whisky Fabric, I swear it feels like you\u0027re in the room with us, we\u0027ll all have a good time and a chuckle as we make sure whisk(e)y stays fun. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\"Scotch it you scotch gods. \u00a0 \u00a0 Slainte...Dummies!\"\u003c/strong\u003e"
