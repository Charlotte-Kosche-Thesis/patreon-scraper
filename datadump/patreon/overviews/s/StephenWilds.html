I have been doing freelance writing for five years now for many\ndifferent websites and publications. I have worked voluntarily for wonderful\nsites like Gaming Rebellion and Blank Man Inc. as well as being paid for my\nwork on Playboy, Paste, Zam, VP Daily, and have even been published in\nUnwinnable\u2019s monthly magazine. I love video games, movies, comic books, and\nresearching about new things within those genres, and I am here to try and\nexpand on that. I want to write more and do what I love as much as possible. To\ndo this, I am seeking backing from those of you who enjoy my work or simply\nwant a different perspective, with everything from reviews and Top 10s to\nperspectives and opinion pieces. All of the money earned here will go towards\ngames and equipment I need to make this happen, not to mention allowing me to\nfree up even more time to play, write, and produce content for my readers. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhether you want to support me with a dollar, a hundred, or\njust some encouragement, I appreciate all of the support from my patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo see my work and get a taste of what I do, check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://scwilds.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy portfolio\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e"

Whether it is the top ten SNES\ngames of a certain genre, or just a casual list that excludes that one title\nthat always gets number one, I can make that happen. This would be a\nwell-researched list with ten entries at the suggestions of the patron for a\nonetime fee, each with 100-200 words saying why it is important or made it on\nthe list. Whether it is a list of the best, the worst, or the unknown, this\nwill be a collection of entries worth reading. The piece can be sent to you to\ngo up on your personal site or I\u2019ll post it on mine, depending on what the\npatron wants.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n*Allow six weeks to be finished\u003cbr\u003e",

If this level of funding\nis met I can officially focus on writing about games, movies, and everything\nunder those banners full-time. For me though, it\u2019ll be living a dream and give\nme time to work on so much that I think my patrons and readers will love here,\nas well as crafting pieces for a few publications to get my writing out. I\u2019ll\nhave more time to do research, study mediums, and overall improve my work to\nmake it better for the audience. I\u2019d be doing this thanks to all of you, and\nwould make sure my patrons saw where their support was going and how much it\nmeans to me. \u003cbr\u003e",
