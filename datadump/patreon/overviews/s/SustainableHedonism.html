    "summary": "Hi, thanks for visiting our Patreon page. Your contributions to this project enables us to invest more time in this community. And that is really exciting.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSustainable Hedonism is a community project focused on finding and sharing both ethical and sustainable ways to embody a life lead by pleasure.  Pleasure is a very big word that can cover a lot of ground.  Many folks find pleasure in their daily cup of tea, their pet, their family and community. Some explore altered states of consciousness. A substantial number of people find gratification in sensuality, art, and nature. The possibilities of finding pleasure in your life are endless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe methods of travel toward the things we desire and how we move through the challenges we inevitably face are also endless.  It\u2019s our hope that we can, as a community, share our experiences and resources. That we can collectively shine some light on how to move through our lives in a way that is at once hedonistic and reduced in harm.  It\u0027s our belief that we can all lay claim to more pleasure in our lives in an anti-oppressive and consensual way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo one has all the answers for you.  You are welcome to come and discover what resources are relevant to you.  You are equally welcome to cast aside or challenge the tools and resources you find irrelevant or problematic for you.  There is no perfect answer. We are all flawed humans working toward a common goal: A life lead by pleasure, not dictated by fear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe founder of Sustainable Hedonism, Ruby Rogers, has been teaching workshops and facilitating experiences for many years.  Her practice applies anti-oppressive values (with a foundation of consent) into all elements of our lives and culture.  From parent education fostering the bodily autonomy of children to creating spaces for participants to learn and practice consensual flirting.  Ruby believes strongly in education through play and support. She facilitates a combination of play centered learning environments, discussion groups, and platforms for people to share their own writing, videos, and other media relating to Sustainable Hedonism.  It\u2019s her hope that through cooperative education and learning opportunities, each participant (including herself) will become better equipped to navigate themselves through a hedonistic life  while avoiding unintentional oppression and doing harm to themselves or others."
