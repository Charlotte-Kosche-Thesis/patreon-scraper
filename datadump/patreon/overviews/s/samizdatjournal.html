    "summary": "THE MANIFESTO\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll art is political.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn some cultures and in some circumstances, this is more apparent. Writers in China and Saudi Arabia have been imprisoned for their words and, in many cases, for the very act of writing something not approved by the government. In the United States, for example, the McCarthy era destroyed careers for artists who spoke out against the Communist witch hunt of the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it\u0027s possible that we are heading towards such a crisis again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the USSR, during the long totalitarian rule of that country, people were born into oppression and died in repression. Anything a citizen said could be and would be used against them. Typewriters were registered and marked each with an individual fingerprint so that the authorities could discover who had written any seditious material. In this climate, writing anything was a risk, and a political act.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRussian writers and philosophers and critics who wanted to flout government censorship wrote their pieces in secret and passed what they\u0027d written to others in secret. Those others took on the obligation of retyping what they\u0027d received or copying it out by hand and sending their new copies onward to other readers. Reading these secretly-shared, non-government-approved, and therefore subversive texts was dangerous. Being in possession of them was a crime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the spirit I\u0027m trying to recreate with The Samizdat, writing and publishing and distributing political poetry that talks to and around and within what is going on in the world today. Poetry is not just food for the soul, it is fuel for revolution. It is a lens that changes the way you perceive the world and your place in it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE ACTION PLAN\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Samizdat promises to deliver political poems directly to you, up to four times a month. The first poem of every month will be mine--the other three will be guest poets. The line up so far includes Sasha West and Joshua Gottlieb-Miller.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause politics is not just about words but also about actions, half of your pledge will go towards a charity of the contributing poet\u0027s choice (the pledge being the total minus Patreon\u0027s fees), the possible charities listed in that poet\u0027s bio. Afterwards, I will post how much money was raised and where it went. My goal here is to be as transparent as possible in supporting poetry and those causes we, as a community, believe in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Samizdat has two baselines of support. The first is a one-dollar pledge that gets you the poem and access to any extras posted through the Patreon. The second is a twenty-dollar pledge which will get you a poem directly mailed to you. Because of the way Patreon works, you can change your pledge level at any time so that if you want mailed copies of only those poets you prefer, that will be easy to arrange.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are entering a world where art and dissent are under attack. Here is your chance to support both.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEXAMPLES OF THE WORK\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003ca href=\"http://poetsbridge.org/front/sharedpage/1529\"\u003eListening\u003c/a\u003e\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003ca href=\"http://www.juxtaprosemagazine.org/perishable-goods-andrew-kozma/\"\u003ePerishable Goods\u003c/a\u003e\"\u003cbr\u003e"
