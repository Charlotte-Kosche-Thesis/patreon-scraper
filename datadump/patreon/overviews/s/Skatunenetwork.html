    "summary": "Hello, world\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I have been given this gift and love for music, and i\u0027ve chosen to do the most important thing I can possibly think of with it, and that\u0027s to create ska covers of various songs.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 This entire journey began on christmas of 2016, when I jokingly posted on facebook saying I should make a bad ska cover of a christmas song, and everyone encouraged me to actually do it, so I did it and people loved it, so since then I\u0027ve been using my resourses to record myself playing guitar, bass, trumpet, trombone, saxophone, keyboard, and sometimes unconventional instruments like viola, ukulele, euphonium, and honestly anything I can get my hands on to create covers of songs I find interesting or songs other people tell me I should do!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 For years now I have performed with several different groups, from large organizations like the Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps, to not so large bands like We are the Union. I\u0027ve shared the stage with dozens of different bands, and I can honestly say I love performing for people and entertaining people, and that\u0027s exactly what I do with my youtube channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Finding the time to create these videos isn\u0027t always easy, however. Working multiple jobs and being a full time student takes up a lot of my time, so at this point it\u0027s more of just a hobby, rather than something I can truly commit to, but this Patreon could completely change that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Patreon allows artists and musicians like myself to sustain themselves off their art by having supporters like you pledge to donate however amount you want. Think of it like a tip jar if I was out on the street performing this music live, except on Patreon there are cool rewards you can get back depending on how much you choose to donate for every time I upload.\u00a0I plan on uploading one cover every 2 weeks come 2018 (because that\u0027s all I have time for), but I shouldn\u0027t upload anymore than 4 times a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I have lots of plans I want to do with this channel beyond just ska covers. I wanna make actual videos that consist more of just me playing in front of a camera, I have skit ideas for punk (and non punk) related comedies, I have ideas for making merchandise, ideas for arranging songs for marching bands, ideas for composing and covering music in different genres aside from ska. All these ideas take time, however and as of now all my time is going into work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 It would be greatly appreciated if you choose to support this. Maintenance on 7 instruments as well as recording equipment isn\u0027t cheap, and I have been trying to upgrade all of my equipment so the product you all hear can always be as great as possible, but it\u0027s really hard when you\u0027re a student living on your own paying bills.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 But remember ya\u0027ll, you don\u0027t have to pledge to support my channel. The fact that you\u0027re checking out my videos is support enough and times are tough! I understand that! Thank you so much for checking out my Patreon, though.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePickitup\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
