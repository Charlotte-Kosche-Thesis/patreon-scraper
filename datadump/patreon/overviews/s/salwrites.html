    "summary": "Once upon a time, in 1985, I was asked to complete a writing assignment on where I saw myself in the unthinkably futuristic 2001! Even then, my 5-year-old self knew exactly where she wanted to be by then. Alongside a wobbly picture of a white-washed, stone cottage, complete with thatched roof and climbing red roses*, was a detailed description of how by then, I would be a successful novelist and living with at least a dozen cats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt 35-years-old (\u201ca wizard is never late, nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means to\u201d), I am ready to embark upon this chapter (get it?) of my life. When your favourite author in the world hears your plot and tells you write it, you\u2019re out of excuses and procrastinations! In the run-up to submitting my proposal to a publisher, I am taking the approach of write, \u003cem\u003ewrite\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWRITE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, in order to fully prepare myself. If there\u0027s one thing I\u0027m sure of, it\u0027s that the more I write, the better and more prolific I become.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, I journal-led my way through an experience which wasn\u0027t only extremely important to me, but which also gave me the motivation and courage to embark upon this journey with you. If you\u0027d like to see something I\u0027ve written recently, please head on over to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://mystayatmaytree.weebly.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy Stay at Maytree\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting a Patreon for my work gives me all the reasons in the world to sit down at my keyboard and hammer it until wonders come out. I will be producing personal progress journals, public blogs, short stories, articles, and if you\u0027re really unlucky, poetry and fanfic. Some of this work will be publicly available, and some will be created solely for my loyal backers (take a look at the \"Rewards\" section of my page). I fully intend to use this experience, and the support of my Patrons to stay on the writing train, produce more, hone my voice and skills, and have a whole lot of fun in the process, whilst entertaining the masses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as inspiration and motivation, my Patrons will help with with the all-important logistical aspect of Being Able To Afford To Live Whilst I Do This. It will also pay for software such as the writing platform, Ulysses, creative writing courses at The Faber Academy, and a research field trip to the Highlands, where my novel is set. Check out the \u201cGoals\u201d section of my page to see which ones I\u2019m working towards right now! The confidence boost of knowing that people are willing to pay even a little for my words won\u0027t go amiss either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for joining me on this journey...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e*I swear, that assignment is still somewhere in my parent\u0027s attic, and if I can find it, I\u0027ll share it with you.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
