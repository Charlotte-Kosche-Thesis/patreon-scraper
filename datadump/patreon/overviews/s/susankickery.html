This will be billed via credit card once a \nmonth.\u00a0 At different levels of pledges, starting as low as $1 per post, you will receive small rewards from me; scroll to the bottom of the page to see the specifics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn general, I will keep writing blog posts, furthering my research, and doing dance reconstructions, and will share my weird little insights, strange bits of dance \nhistorian humor, and personal thoughts with you here via my Patreon feed.\u00a0 If my monthly totals pass certain stretch goals (shown at left), I will start to add bonus material with special access and input from my Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I have never yet managed more than eight posts in one month, but if \nyou are concerned that I will suddenly \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003erun mad and churn out a hundred \nposts\u003cstrong\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e you can set a monthly maximum.\u00a0 And this is not a lifetime commitment.
