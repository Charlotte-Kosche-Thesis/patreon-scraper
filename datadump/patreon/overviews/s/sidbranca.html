    "summary": "Hi friends! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Sid Branca, and I\u0027m a multimedia artist, writer, performer, educator, and all-around dilettante.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I mostly make videos, or live performances that incorporate video in some capacity, but I also do some straight-up performance art, spoken word, and book arts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make music as one half of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://palmsunday.bandcamp.com/releases\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePalm Sunday\u003c/a\u003e, and I am very slowly developing a solo music project called JET OF BLOOD.\u00a0I also co-host\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://americanvampirepodcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmerican Vampire\u003c/a\u003e, a podcast about the Twilight franchise. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI originally set up this Patreon account in 2015\u00a0to support my MFA thesis project,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.sidbranca.com/elektra-day-last-nights/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eElektra Day - Last Nights\u003c/a\u003e. Thanks to my patrons help, I was able to complete that project and it was exhibited in an installation in Chicago in May 2015. After that, I stepped away from Patreon for a while as I figured out my post-MFA plans.\u00a0In 2016, I did an artist residency at\u00a0the Arteles Creative Center in\u00a0Haukij\u00e4rvi, Finland, and shot a ton of footage for a video series/featurette with the working title \u003cem\u003eenter body into field\u003c/em\u003e. It\u0027s a sort of science fiction meets musical theater meets youtube diary exploration of identity and memory and dysphoria and getting very lost in the woods.\u00a0Editing that project\u00a0has taken longer than I expected it to, but I am now almost (!) done with it! I\u0027m hoping to schedule some screening events for it in April 2018.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy plan is to return to using this Patreon page after I finish\u00a0\u003cem\u003eenter body into field\u003c/em\u003e (or whatever I ultimately call that project), to support creating projects and pieces I continue to release online for free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s really important to me that my work be accessible online for free, and support from patrons is a way for me to stay true to that while being able to afford to keep making things. Give a small amount of money per month through Patreon, and get access to exclusive and early-release content, participate in the artistic process, and help me put a bunch of art out into the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can always adjust the amount from month to month, in case you need to take it down to zero, or want to give a little extra when you\u0027re feeling flush. $1 a month gets you access to my feed here, but higher amounts yield my intense gratitude and work that is both higher quality and can be made faster (since I can spend a little less time running around town earning money doing unrelated things).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does my support go toward?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe biggest cost of my artistic projects is always time; time I don\u0027t spend doing work for a paycheck. But here are some things I am likely to actively spend money on to make work:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Camera/lighting/sound equipment: I have a little bit of gear of my own, and sometimes have access to equipment through institutions, but owning a couple of lights, a tripod, a decent mic, and a better camera lens or two\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Hosting for my website/pro Vimeo account/pro Soundcloud account/Libsyn account/etc - the costs of actually keeping my content accessible online for free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Travel for location-specific filming - a lot of my work involves site-specific performance, inspired by the character of a particular location. Being able to get on a bus or a train or a cheap flight somewhere means being able to make work in more places!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Costume/makeup/prop/set dressing - turns out wigs and clown makeup and backdrops and paint are not *always* things I can track down out of other people\u0027s discard piles, just *sometimes*.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I would love to be able to actually pay people who work on projects with me, so I can hire sound engineers, camera operators, actors, etc and actually compensate them appropriately with ye olde fiat currenseye.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Honestly though, this Patreon is mostly to help me eat food and pay rent so I can stay alive while not having to constantly hustle instead of making art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003etl;dr\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically come take a look at this space in March/April 2018 for information about the release of my new project and my return to being active on Patreon!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for being here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
