Some are simple and down to earth, others are way out there, fantastical universes, filled with all sorts of mysteries and adventure! I\u0027ve always had a very broad spectrum of interests, which range from anime(guilty as charged!) to science fiction and fantasy, as well as even mysteries and romance. Having that broad of a mindset, tends to make for some interesting ideas and even blending some of them together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are always a great deal of ideas tumbling around in my head and I hold onto each idea I have. I never know when I\u0027ll be inspired to craft a good story out of it, as inspiration tends to strike me whenever it feels like it. As I go along this path, one thing I do promise to my readers is this; That anything you read from what I have written, will not be boring.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Author:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello there! I\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eam an aspiring writer, who only recently, has rediscovered his passion of creating stories. Ever since I was a kid, I\u0027ve always been drawn to the fictional worlds of J.R.R. Tolkien, George Lucas(Star Wars), Frank Herbert and yes, Gene Roddenberry(Star Trek) as well! There was always such adventure and mystery to them, which drew me in every time I picked up a book or saw an episode. I hoped to one day, be able to create such wondrous tales and immersive and immense universes and well, here I am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always had a hyper active imagination as a kid, as I could always envision vast worlds and stories that often tumbled about in my head. Though, growing up, I couldn\u0027t always articulate these ideas that I had, or was ridiculed for them. Eventually, I grew up, shelved these ideas and got into how things were in the real world. Got into an industry that was fun at first, but now, I realize that it was a mistake and that I should have been chasing what I wanted much sooner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInterestingly enough, I was actually inspired by a fellow writer, to start creating these ideas. You see, I had crafted an idea for him to use in his story, which I have been following since his first chapter. After a few emails back and forth, he told me this; To take what I had initially offered to him and make it into my own story. He stated that he would be excited to see what I could create with what I had made. Since that day, I have been diligently writing down every idea that pops into my head and finally, making these universes that reside within my mind, into reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was when I started doing this, that I realized, that this is what I want to do with my life, that being a writer was what I was truly meant to do. Though I wish that I could write more often, I am a working man with bills to pay, who is also a husband and a father. That is why I created this site here, on Patreon, to hopefully realize my dream and become a writer full time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI pour much of myself into what I write(and a few personal experiences), that it feels as though I am actually living these adventures. To feel that, with every chapter of every story that I create, is beyond amazing. I can only hope that anyone who reads them, will somehow feel the same way. \u003cbr\u003e"
