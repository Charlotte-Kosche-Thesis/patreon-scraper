    "summary": "WHO I AM/ WHAT I MAKE\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Shoog McDaniel, a southern, queer, non-binary, fat photographer and artist living in Gainesville, florida. I have been taking photos since high school, when a friend of mine dumpster dove 200 disposable cameras from behind a Walgreens. I became obsessed, and began documenting everything. I now shoot with a canon 6D, and have yet to take a break from capturing intimate moments and beautiful people in my everyday life. My work is about highlighting bodies and lives that are often overlooked by popular society. I enjoy photographing fat bodies, trans bodies, and queer bodies. People`with gap-toothed smiles and missing buttons. I capture images of my friends. With little exceptions, I have a connection with the humans in my photos and I intend to show that through the intimacy of my portraits. I strive to connect the viewer of each photo to beauty within themselves, through understanding the brilliancy of diversity, by showing them that there are many ways to be beautiful. \u00a0I also focus my lens on the wildlife that Florida has to offer, and I live to expose the majestic nature of Florida\u0027s fresh water springs that hold me up when thin.cis.het.patriarchy gets me down. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my photography, I also create artwork using ink and watercolor that is reminiscent of a world I would like to see. Underwater dreamscapes hold fat mer-people, with genders unknown embracing and multi-colored gopher tortoises hunker down in their sandy nests. I really enjoy using vivid color and imagination.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY I NEED YOU\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need you because I would like to be able to not have to struggle to make ends meet every month concerning my bills, and accessing healthcare when Obamacare is removed. If I were to get a day-job that could cover my costs, I would not be able to create the work I do right now because it takes a lot of energy and time. I would also like to repair my car so that I can drive to photograph queer/fat/trans beauties that do not live nearby. I would like to not always wonder if what Im doing is important enough to be considered WORK. I also dream of a more secure and user friendly underwater camera case to document unique bodies in our beautiful Florida springs, and a new zoom lens for my camera so that I can produce memorable photos of Florida\u0027s extensive wildlife. In a dream world, I would like to pay the people who model for me a small amount because the folks who I photograph are usually on the hustle too, and it makes sense to pay them for their time. \u00a0Lastly, I would really like to make enough money so that I can volunteer my time and skills to assist social justice organizations in documenting their various actions and campaigns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEdited To Add: I was called out for starting a patreon as an artist with white privilege and social capital. I listened to multiple suggestions and have decided to keep this patreon, while splitting half of my earnings with a different QTPOC artist monthly. \u00a0This is a way I am leveraging my privilege while continuing to ask for support. Message me if you would like to discuss my reasons further.\u003cbr\u003e"
