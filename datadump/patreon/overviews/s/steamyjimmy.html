As a child, I spent much of my free time gaming on NES, SNES, and Genesis and have followed the Nintendo consoles since then. I was drawn in to the stories, the worlds and the lore of these games. It slowly inspired me and fed an urge to share that passion over time until finally, I realized the tools of YouTube. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the time I\u0027ve been creating videos, I have done the very thing I\u0027ve wanted to do for a large chunk of my life: share that passion with others. When I see my work resonate with someone it is one of the greatest feelings in the world. This is something I want to be able to do for the rest of my life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a quick breakdown of my content:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnbb6NNT9hUZgP81DpEeghqGq3MdpCe8c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStory Mode\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e - I do an in-depth analysis of a video game\u0027s story.

     "about": "Hello Internet and welcome to my Patreon, Steamy Jimmy! For over a year \nnow I have been making Youtube videos. I have a few regular series but \nmy two biggest ones would be Story Mode and eShop Adventures. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn\n Story Mode I take a close look at retro video games (NES, SNES, and \nGenesis mostly) and analyze their stories, bosses, and whatever \ninformation I can dig up on them. Most of the time I read the story \nstraight from the manual and even compare with the Japanese manual on \noccasion to really flesh out the worlds for these games. These videos \naverage around 20 to 30 minutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith eShop Adventures I review \ngames on the Wii U eShop (the digital store.) I talk about how the game \nis played and the controls, then list pros and cons to each game. I make\n sure to complete a game (or be close to it) by the time I give a review\n so it\u0027s more thorough. Then I give it a score based out of 5 stars and \nwrap up. Often times these games can be found on other digital platforms\n such as Steam so it can be valuable to even non Wii U owners. These \nvideos average 4 to 10 minutes. In the future I plan on migrating to the\n NX for more recent coverage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn some occasions, I have gotten in\n touch with developers and had \ninterviews with them over Skype which I also share on my channel. These \ninterviews are much longer and can last around 30 to 60 minutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYoutube\n has been an interesting path and once I had ideas for these series in \nmind, I knew it was something I wanted to pursue. In the time I have \nbeen creating videos, I finally feel like I have some sort of calling in\n life, something I could see myself doing for the rest of my days. I\u0027d \nlove to be able to do this full time and branch out into more varied \ntypes of content in the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to help make that \npossible then we have a platform here to do so but if not, just being \ngiven your consideration is enough. Feel free to leave feedback for me \nand I\u0027ll be sure to look at it when I can. Until next time, stay Steamy \nmy friends and we\u0027ll be back soon!",
