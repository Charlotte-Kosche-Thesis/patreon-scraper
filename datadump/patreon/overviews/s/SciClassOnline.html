    "summary": "I teach junior high chemistry, physics, and astronomy, and have been producing instructional videos as an online extension of my physical science classroom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I have two goals with educational content creation:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI. \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e For the Global Community of students\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 Most importantly, I\u0027d really like to\u00a0share\u00a0what I\u0027ve learned about teaching science to middle school students with the rest of the world, with kids in the global community who might not have access to a qualified science teacher but who do have an internet portal. I\u0027m thinking about students in rural areas, poor areas, places where highly trained teachers with 20+ years of experience explaining scientific concepts to young people may be hard to find. \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Already, I notice on my YouTube channel that I get subscriptions from kids in India, Malaysia, Kenya... and it\u0027s so rewarding to me to feel like what I\u0027m doing might be interesting or make a difference for a young person!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eII. \u00a0For Teachers \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 My\u00a0instructional videos supplement the Next Generation Science Standards for Middle School. I envision creating an entire series that gives the foundational knowledge in chemistry, physics, and astronomy that combines the Disciplinary Core Ideas from NGSS with the traditional 1998 Science Framework.  This allows teachers to focus on students\u0027 inquiry experiences in the classroom and the development of scientific thinking, while still having a robust content source to support the lessons. Since many school districts in the U.S.A. have decided not to purchase textbooks, and the curriculum available for teaching NGSS is not yet completely developed, my videos can potentially fill a need.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would I do with Patreon support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI plan to have the videos that explain foundational knowledge in scientific methods, chemistry, astronomy and physics translated into Spanish and French. I figure with English, Spanish, and French we can reach almost everyone in the world.\u003cbr\u003e    With Patron\u0027s support, I will create interactive lessons that show young people how they can do simple experiments and demonstrations at home using common materials (sticks, dirt, water...) to demonstrate or discover important concepts. I can use the software Articulate Storyline to create dynamically interactive lessons like this \u003ca href=\"http://sciclassonline.com/lessons/build_an_atom/story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBuild_An_Atom_Interactive\u003c/a\u003e  in which students answer questions and get video feedback related to their answer. I plan to create these HTML files for my website \u003ca href=\"http://sciclassonline.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esciclassonline.com\u003c/a\u003e so that all students can have access to the dynamic lessons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I qualified for your support? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eAfter a B.S. in biology from Stanford University, I earned a\u00a0Professional Clear Teaching Credential in Mathematics, Life Science and English from the University of\u00a0California and have been teaching math and science in the\u00a0Santa Barbara schools for 26 years.
