These are stories of people who use their gifts, channel their sacred rage in profound, provocative ways that instigate substantial action, who are the leaders next door. The Defenders.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e...the entire American West, property of all Americans, home of the wild things, last strong hold of the Ghost Dancers - lies under massive assault by the industrial armies of Government and Greed.
