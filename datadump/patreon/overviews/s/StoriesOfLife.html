For the past decade or so I\u0027ve been running my company, Worldwide Salon Marketing, and while that\u0027s been rewarding, I\u0027ve missed the pure \u0027writing for achievement\u0027 part of life.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy wife Michelle and I recently moved out of the city, to a seaside town called Dunsborough, in the far south west of Western Australia. A sea-change, if you like. Maybe it was the move, maybe it was just about getting older, but I found myself hitting the keyboard more often, writing observations on life, our environment, the people we meet, and how ordinary people - like you, and me - are trying to make sense of the massive, sometimes bewildering upheavals throwing curve balls our way in the modern world.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs I wrote, sometimes on Facebook, other times in blog posts, people would tell me \"You should publish this stuff!\"\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut where, I asked. Newspapers? They\u0027re a dying breed. Good writers are being fired by the horde. Magazines? They\u0027re closing in droves. Somebody suggested Patreon. So here I am. I don\u0027t expect it\u0027ll make me rich.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWriting, for those who don\u0027t, might appear to be a simple task of putting one word after another. On the face of it, that\u0027s true enough. But the job of turning thoughts and ideas into a coherent, entertaining, informative and \n\u003cem\u003ereadable\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0creation is - as any serious writer will know - \u003cem\u003ebloody hard work.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe best stories have a beginning, a middle and an end. If you don\u0027t win the reader with a headline, they won\u0027t read your first paragraph. If your first paragraph doesn\u0027t compel them to read the second paragraph, you\u0027re dead in the water. So I tend to do a lot of procrastinating - walking around the house, fiddling with the computer, checking stock prices, almost anything to avoid committing to that first paragraph until I\u0027ve got something that\u0027ll intrigue, or at least mildly interest someone enough to keep reading.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter that, it\u0027s a slog...moving one word here, another there, re-writing whole sentences, swapping paragraphs. Or, deleting the whole lot and starting again. The eventual outcome is almost always 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAside from my observations on life, I\u0027ll also be uploading helpful tips, strategies and information for those patrons in small business who want answers to the biggest question ALL business owners are always asking - \n\u003cstrong\u003eHow to Find More Customers.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt might seem a strange mix - random stories about Life and \u0027hard\u0027 information about business. But I\u0027ve found more often than not, that business and life aren\u0027t mutually exclusive:-)\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a patron, you\u0027ll get instant access every time I pen a new piece - at least once a month, usually more - every time I upload a new video report, or create a new business \u0026amp; marketing strategy."
