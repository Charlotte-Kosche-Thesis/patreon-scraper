    "summary": "Welcome, cool person who has taken the time to actually read my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Xander, and I am a mostly self-taught illustrator operating out of Denver, Colorado. Art has been my passion ever since I was a young teenager, and I strive to better myself as a creator every single day of my life. I love creating and sharing my works with other people. I love seeing their faces light up and how much emotion an image can make a person experience. It is my goal to continue with the contribution of my art to society for as long as I possibly can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo then, why am I asking for your help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eWell, the biggest problem I currently face is that due to the amount of time paintings take me, I am currently unable to do enough to make ends meet. I work every single day, somewhere between 8 and 12 hours, or just to the point of physical exhaustion. I truly believe that this is what i am meant to do, and I am willing to pursue it even if it is detrimental to my health or not financially viable. Supporting me on patreon gives you an opportunity to make art more of a realistic option for me, and hopefully would mean I wouldn\u0027t have to work to the point of physical detriment anymore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlright, so what\u0027s in it for you? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn order to compensate you for your support of me pursuing my craft, you can get access to a bunch of sweet stuff that nobody else ever gets to see. Traditional drawings and paintings which will ONLY be released here and higher resolution downloads of my digital paintings are the two new ways in which you will be able to experience my illustrations. In addition, should you feel totally radical and amazing, if you choose to donate more money, you will get opportunities to have in-depth art critiques and reviews, or even just simple conversations about whatever topic you see fit. As a bonus, you can also get commission priority! If I open up a certain amount of slots, and you manage to snag one,t hen I do yours first, just because you\u0027re amazing and have chosen to support my further artistic growth!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess that about sums it up! If you have any questions or need to contact me, shoot me an a-mail at spectshift(at)gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to read this, and supporting if you do! I look forward to sharing my art journey and the artwork that comes out of it with all of you!\u003cbr\u003e"
