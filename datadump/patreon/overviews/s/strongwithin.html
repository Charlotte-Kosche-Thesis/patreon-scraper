Since the creation of the Strong Within Daily Affirmation Podcast in January of 2017, I\u2019ve been honored to bring you a daily podcast. When I started this journey I wasn\u2019t sure the exact time and effort involved, I just knew I wanted to bring value into the world no matter what. And so I set to the task of bringing you a podcast every day. I first wanted to do a 3-5 minute quick podcast to get you going in a flash\u2026but over my time of creating I\u2019ve extended the podcasts hopefully to make them even more thought-provoking.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy what I do, I enjoy the Strong Within Friends I\u2019ve made as I consider you my family, and I enjoy challenging myself daily. With that being said, creating this podcast takes a lot of work and time. And since I do everything myself I am spending at least a few hours a day on each podcast. It takes effort to think of new ideas daily; it takes effort to write out my script, so I have a direction to go so I\u2019m as concise as possible for you\u2026as I don\u2019t want too many repeating words or ideas or any useless words like ummm and uhhhhhs, and it takes money paying for my editing software, my server fees, and any other costs that come with producing this show (besides my time).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd I am grateful for every one of you who tunes in daily, or here and there when you can. With that being said, I work two other positions with my life coaching and personal training business. And along with the podcast, I am working anywhere from 50-90+ hours a week at least. So consider working 2 full-time jobs, with overtime, for over a year now with no end in sight. I have spent the last 414 days creating a podcast because the biggest reason is\u2026you are important to me. I am hoping to add more benefits to my listeners such as creating a daily planner and action plan to help you become more effective in your life, and I would love to give you more access to me as a creator.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt can be very taxing creating something every day mentally and physically, and it costs money and time to do these. So I\u2019m grateful to My Strong Within Friends who can help any way that you can so I can not only make this podcast better, but so I can make things that will help you live a better life every day. My heart is in this project of helping you all speak, think, and live a Strong Within Life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd so any support you can give in helping me continue my mission in bringing value into the world, and helping you live a better more purposeful life\u2026I am grateful for. Thank you for being on this journey with me. I couldn\u2019t have done it without you, and I am looking forward to doing more with you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAny way that you can help me along on this journey is much appreciated.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you for blessing my life. I am looking to blessing yours more and more,\u003cbr\u003eChris\u003cbr\u003e"
