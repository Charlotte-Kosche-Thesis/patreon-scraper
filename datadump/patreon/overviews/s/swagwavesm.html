    "summary": "Hello, for the past 3 years I have been producing stop motion videos on my YouTube channel based on popular characters from comics, cartoons and movies. \u00a0I\u0027ve written several ongoing series where I take existing storylines and give them my own twist, or even an original continuation from where the story may have ended. \u00a0Over the years I\u0027ve met some great people through my channel, fellow animators, voice actors, and more. \u00a0Many have contributed their skills to help improve my videos over time. \u00a0And now, I want to improve that quality even more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0The Dream\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy desire is to entertain. \u00a0I love telling stories with action figures, the same way I used to envision them moving on their own when I was little. \u00a0So I want to present the highest quality stop motion videos I can, in all aspects. \u00a0To make the videos as entertaining as possible. \u00a0I\u0027ve gathered a core team to assist me with this, and together we are going to ensure that the videos are released both frequently and with ever improving quality. \u00a0This means we will constantly strive to provide the best stories, animation, and voice acting within our abilities. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e With a little help ..and a lot of luck\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s where you come in! \u00a0Because most of the improvements we want to make involve a lot of time and work, as well as getting some new equipment, the production costs are definitely increasing. \u00a0With your help we can make the improvements we want to make and deliver better content to our audience. \u00a0We plan to release a new video on the channel each Friday, and that will happen whether you donate or not. \u00a0We don\u0027t want to hold any content back. \u00a0We simply want to give our fans the chance to support us if they want, and can afford to. \u00a0Our ultimate goal is entertainment. \u00a0Your donation will help us produce the highest quality entertainment we possibly can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eNow onto the Rewards! \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re unlocking everything at just $1 a month. \u00a0Our standards for the quality we want in our videos aren\u0027t going anywhere! \u00a0We are going to work towards constant improvements no matter what. \u00a0We want you to fund us because you enjoy our content and \u003cem\u003eyou want to fund us\u003c/em\u003e. \u00a0So for a minimum pledge of $1 or more, you\u0027ll gain access to our Patron Exclusive Message Board. There the crew and I will interact and engage with you on a regular basis! \u00a0We\u0027ll post preview clips of upcoming videos, hold Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s, and take polls on which characters should show up in an upcoming video. \u00a0Plus whatever other fun stuff we come up with!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNow we do have something special to offer those who want to pledge a little extra. \u00a0Imagine choosing the fighters for a stop motion Death Match! \u00a0Those who sign up for this limited Reward will get to pick two characters. \u00a0Those characters must have existing action figures (no customs) from recent times (old toys are expensive and don\u0027t move well). \u00a0We will then create a short stop motion Death Match video between the two figures, and you can even determine the winner!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e Thanks to Everyone for the Support!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really can\u0027t thank everyone enough who has been subscribed and supported me over the years! \u00a0I hope you have enjoyed the content, and I hope you will absolutely love what we have in store!\u003cbr\u003eThank you!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u00a0"
