Maybe I should just say I support\nALL the arts?  Yeah.  Much better. \nI support ALL the arts!  Perfect.  What else? \nOh, I am married to my best friend which I highly recommend and have far\ntoo many cats.

Currently I\u0027m focused on Jewelry, Masks, \u0026amp; Ornaments.\u00a0I have been creating all sorts of things as I\u0027ve grown from a young girl to an adult. Everything you see on my page here, on facebook, instagram, and in my etsy shop is personally made by me. I do consider myself more an artisan than a crafter because I do not simply manufacture, I design and create. \u00a0As such, many of my items are either one of a kind or replicated in very small batches. Think of it as items produced in collections. I design a piece, make a prototype, then if I like it and it was fun to make I do variations on colors. I love taking pieces I\u0027ve been inspired by, working out new techniques, and figuring out how to use the concepts I\u0027ve learned to make something unique. \u00a0Sometimes I may return back to a previous concept and re-imagine it, but unless I receive a special order I find simply replicating an idea more than a few times to often be quite boring. I currently sell my work in person at conventions, fairs, and street walks throughout the Central Florida area.",
