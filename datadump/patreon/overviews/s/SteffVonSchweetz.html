    "summary": "Hi there! I\u0027m Steff and I\u0027m here to share my costuming adventures with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making costumes since 2003 and am completely self-taught in all things cosplay-related. I\u0027m here because I want to give back to the community and also add bonus content for my supporters. That means having perks directly catered towards cosplayers such as WIP shots, costumes construction details, and tutorials and content for other supporters who want a more personal experience than what I give on standard social media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease check out the perks below if you are at all interested in contributing. I think I have something for everyone down there. And don\u0027t worry, I will still be posting on other social media sites! Never feel bad about not contributing! I appreciate each like, comment and share you guys send my way. Thank you guys for all your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome FAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are your \"intimate\" shoots only available as print?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve noticed a lot of cosplayers have a problem with their higher level content being leaked. To try and limit that and keep the integrity of the rewards, I don\u0027t offer any high res photos of the more sexualized content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often do you stream?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to inactivity during streams, I no longer stream regularly. One-on-one streams are available to those who want them at higher tiers. I may do Patreon streams occasionally, but they are no longer a monthly reward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen can I expect physical rewards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI send out rewards at the beginning of the following month. So January physical rewards will go out at the beginning of February. In the chance something happens where I am unable to send it out, I do keep my pledgers notified and try to throw in a bonus as an apology.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I suggest costumes/characters for the monthly shoots?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYup! I put out polls on the first of the month that go through the 10th. Everyone in the appropriate tiers can vote and even suggest characters, ideas, and concepts for shoots.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere do your Patreon funds go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of it goes right back into Patreon, actually: the shipping of prints (envelopes, stamps, return labels, prints themselves), the bonus monthly prize, items needed for the two monthly shoots, cute lingerie for the selfies, film for the Polaroids (I do about 40 a month!), things that help me shoot (backdrops, lights, props, lenses), and a large chunk is set aside for taxes. After that, this helps pay for bills (depending on the month and the amount of outside work I get as a seamstress) and the more elaborate costumes I do. Once I reach my next goal of $2000 per month, a portion of that will be put aside for traveling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are your cosplay-centered rewards cheaper than your sexual content?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimple, the craftsmanship aspect of this page is more important to me than putting out sexual content. That isn\u0027t to say that I don\u0027t put effort into those shoots; but the reason I started a Patreon was to be able to teach people how I craft. I want the learning content to be accessible to everyone at a much lower cost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can I expect with \"sexy selfies\"?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are just as I said, they are sexualized selfies. I don\u0027t do nudes, mostly lingerie-type shoots. I have done implied nudes for the intimate shoots but those are rare with the sexy selfies. If I post preview photos on IG or FB, it\u0027s not because of nudity but because I want to keep the integrity of the rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat are the products you speak of in tier 7?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m in the process of starting fun little products for when I have a table at conventions. These include but are not limited to: stickers, keychains, and charms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor your collaboration rewards, what can we expect?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe collaborations change month-to-month but I will post who I am collaborating with and what type of rewards I will include every month publicly; so you can see before you pledge. As of now, these rewards are exclusive prints and Polaroids that you can\u0027t find anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is a \"sponsored costume\"?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA sponsored costume is just that, a costume you can sponsor. I have an Amazon list of costumes available to purchase. If you sponsor a costume, you will receive an exclusive photoshoot/prints of that costume. Being at the five dollar tier simply subsidizes the cost of shipping for the prints. If you sponsor a costume, please message me so we can talk about the kind of shoot you\u0027d like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do the photoshoots in Tier 10 and 11 entail?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor Tier 10, I want to work with pledgers to do a specific shoot they\u0027d like to see! This tier is reserved for characters/costumes I have already done. If I can easily buy/make a casual or boudoir outfit for said character, it belongs in this tier. However, if this is a brand new costume/character this requests is reserved for Tier 11 to subsidize the cost of a brand new costume and wig.\u00a0There will be one shoot a month per pledger with 5 total prints sent out to them. For both tier, wardrobe needs to be discussed with me beforehand as I only have a month to organize the shoot on top of my other responsibilities to Patreon, conventions, and outside work. Realistically, large armor or prop builds won\u0027t work, neither will overly detailed costumes or big ballgown type dresses. If you are in Tier 11 and wish to request a large scale project, please note, this might not happen in the month you pledge. I will finish and shoot as soon as possible- you don\u0027t need to continuously sign up while you wait for the prints. On that note, the shoot for the costume can either be more like my cosplay shoots or intimate sets; but the rules on nudity and over sexualization remain the same. I plan to try as best as I can to accommodate these tier but please also be open to realistic requests.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
