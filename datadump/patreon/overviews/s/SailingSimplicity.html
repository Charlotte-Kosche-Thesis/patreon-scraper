She sailed solo and created the website sailingsimplicity.com, which garnered a large following, and eventually led to magazine articles, a TEDx talk, keynote speaking engagements at the National Women\u2019s Sailing Association, Sail Havasu, Mystic Seaport and Maritime Gloucester. She is currently working on her first book titled Sailing Simplicity \u0026amp; The Pursuit of Happiness. Teresa is the co-founder of Morse Alpha Studios, and currently co-producing her first feature film, One Simple Question, which is an official selection of the BLUE Ocean Film Festival 2014. Her passion for the ocean, education, and the arts, in addition to her infectious smile, make her a perfect front-woman for Ocean Courier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBenjamin Carey\u003cbr\u003eAssistant Director, Ocean Courier\u003cbr\u003eAs a teen, Ben spent his days clamming commercially.
