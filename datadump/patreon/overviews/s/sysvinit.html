    "summary": "Hello Fellow Patreons,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jesse Smith and, if you\u0027re involved in the open source community you may have seen some of my existing projects. I helped port the Lumina desktop environment to Linux, made a Linux and FreeBSD port of the \"doas\" command, currently maintain the Bftpd simple FTP server and worked on the Atomic Tanks arcade game. Alternatively you might have stumbled across my reviews and tutorials on DistroWatch.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current project is to take over maintenance of the venerable and widely used SysV init software. SysV init has been around for decades and is the software used to boot millions of Linux-powered computers around the world. SysV is lightweight, stable and flexible and is used by such popular Linux distributions as PCLinuxOS, Slackware, antiX, Linux Mint Debian Edition, Devuan and MX Linux.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, SysV init has been left unmaintained for several years and there have been no new releases in over three years. This has placed an undue burden on the packagers of the distributions which still use SysV as they are left to patch and workaround issues on their own. Over the years, many bug reports have been filed against init and there are dozens of fixes scattered around various bug trackers, but no one has been addressing them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have made a start. I have started work on fixing known bugs and I am in touch with packagers from various Linux distributions. We are coordinating getting their issues addressed and their patches incorporated upstream so everyone will benefit. Of course this effort takes time and this is where you can help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am looking for funding from people who use or still value SysV init to help with my work. Combing through patches, responding to bugs and polishing software takes time. This is a critical piece of software which sits at the heart of many Linux distributions and I\u0027m hoping to set aside a significant portion of my work time to improve SysV init - it should not be left unmaintained.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far people have been very positive about getting work done on SysV init and I would like to thank you all. Whether you can help support my work financially or by submitting bug reports or by sending positive feedback, your efforts are appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
