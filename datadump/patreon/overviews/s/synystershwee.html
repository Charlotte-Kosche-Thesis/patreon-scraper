    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon :D The names SynysterShwee (Sinister Shhh-wee) or Ashley Croft. Whatever you prefer ^_^ Now I\u2019m not particularly fond of asking for help; which makes this very hard for me to write, but you see I have this addiction with documenting my life and It tends to get out of control. I have over 8 terabytes of memories to go threw but right now but I\u2019m focusing on my cosplay. I would love to make youtube videos of all my adventures but I am completely out of space on all my devices. Everyday I\u0027m working on something new or sorting threw the thousands of photos and videos to try and bring you the best content :D If you would like a\u00a0preview of everything I\u2019ve been up to in the past couple years; you can search SynysterShwee on most any social media site. The main ones will be listed at the end and honestly now would be the time to skip to the rest if you don\u0027t want to hear my life story ;p\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, every donation received will go into my cosplay adventure fund which would be supporting me on my path on becoming a professional\u00a0photographer,\u00a0cosplayer, comic-con-goer, youtuber, gamer\u2026honestly a little of everything ;D I really tried to do it on my own but I just can\u0027t keep up with the cost anymore. I literally could cosplay all day everyday XD \u00a0I already spend all my free time working on past, present and future content... which\u00a0is starting to get extremely time consuming O_o Im in an endless circle cycle of taking, sorting and posting everything on my many social media outlets. It feels weird asking you to invest in my life but thats exactly what I\u2019m asking you to do haha =}\u0026lt;3\u00a0Butt with every little bit donated; you would be giving me a better chance at documenting my life and the opportunity to show all of you :D I seriously am soooooooooo grateful for any kinda support you guys give me \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3 Even if its just a like ;] \u00a0I promise I will always do my best to help give back and I want you to feel free to message me anytime; even if you just want to say Hi \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I guess is where I talk about how It all started... Once upon a day, my cousin gave me a bag of her old clothes and she had the legit PERFECT Tomb Raider\u0027s Lara Croft tank tops and I just so happened to find a super great pair of brown shorts at Plato\u0027s Closet days before that O_o Thus my first cosplay WAS BORN! \u00a0And who better to start with then my all time favorite Heroine Lara Croft! She was always and will forever be my Hero \u0026lt;3 She was just badass in every way and inspired me to be the thrill seeker I am today \u0026gt;=] You can pretty much guess what my answer to the age old question \"What do you want to be when you grow up\",\u00a0So the moment when I realized I could at least dress up like her; a whole new world was created!!! I never thought I would actually get to live that dream of becoming Lara Croft; but even just pretending makes me feel like that dream has come true XD Soon after creating the outfit, I learned how easy it was taking pictures of myself by taking a screenshot off a video. Thus my obsession with recording my life was created lol Unfortunately the internet shopping addiction formed soon after and drained my all my extra funds quickly with all fun outfits, wigs, contacts, makeup, props ..etc ..etc... etc.. I was hoping making my own props would help cut back the cost but honestly it makes it even worse. You constantly need endless material of things like poster board, paint, clay, cloth, craft foam, glue bla bla bla\u2026 and I would LOVE to get the chance to try out worbla ( a cosplayers best friend ) \u00a0but it\u0027s MAAAD expensive!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-__- \u00a0Hence why I need help...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eSpeaking of Best Friends... I have seriously have the most perfect group of cosplay buddies I could ever ask for! They are all sooo supportive, inspiring and funny as hell XD I am so blessed to have them in my life and I can\u2019t wait to see what we all accomplish over the years \u0026lt;3 We try to get together at least once a week for a craft night and would like to eventually live stream them buuuut pleeeeasse beee warned... We are not a group for overly sensitive people or KIDS. Also please cut us some slack when being live. It is extremely nerve wrecking and the feeling of not knowing who\u0027s watching or listening makes the pressure that much worse \u00a0O_o  I personally have been recording my self for a while now and I still get nervous playing games on twitch. Im hoping to shake these stupid nerves soon but I have a tendency to put my foot in my mouth or have something taking out of context and I would never want to offend anyone. I would like to think were rated Pg 13 but we are defiantly rated R\u2026 So now you have been warned \u0026gt;=]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly I want so say how extremely blessed that every day is a new adventure and I get to get up and enjoy life with as many adventures from start to finish and can\u0027t wait to show you my world =D I can\u0027t thank\u00a0everyone enough for any type of support you have given me =} Whether you are liking my posts or donating into the adventure fund; it all means a lot more then you know \u0026lt;3 My main goal in life is to live it to the fullest and never stop learning / making myself a better person. So I\u0027m always up for suggestions and criticism and I promise won\u0027t take it personally so plz don\u0027t hold back ^_^ And I will finally end all this with a thank you for even taking the time to read all this nonsense! *Deuces*\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0SynysterShwee\u00a0(My personal one)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Synystershwee\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/Synystershwee\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0The Watch Tower Cosplay( Group Cosplays and Cons)\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/The-Watchtower-Cosplay-1167837383228933/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/The-Watchtower-Cosplay-11...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eYoutube\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Ashley Croft (Faimly Friendly Twitch Storage)\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkcNSDAydeJyFsOTfPuxsYw\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkcNSDAydeJyFsOTf...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0SynysterShwee (Random Adventure / Cosplay Videos)\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2IieFCU7rdADsNqMouhFTw\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2IieFCU7rdADsNqM...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eInstagram ( First look)\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0SynysterShwee ( Live / Selfies )\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/synystershwee/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/synystershwee/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0SynystersAdventures ( My Adventure Friends )\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/synystersadventures/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/synystersadventures/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwitch ( Live Gaming)\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/synystershwee/profile\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.twitch.tv/synystershwee/profile\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVine ( Died )\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://vine.co/search/synystershwee\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://vine.co/search/synystershwee\u003c/a\u003e ( Hep Me Get Back My Vids Plz )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSnapChat ( Kinda Dead ) you guess the name ;p\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDevientArt ( Art still in progress ) Will have my cosplay sketches and any commission work I receive\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
