Fronting the group is Joshua Flores (Invisible Target), his brother Caleb on drums, Chris Fraga on lead guitar, Jeremy Boyum on bass guitar, and JD Vazquez on keys/glockenspiel. What makes this band truly unique is the experience that all of them have had in aggressively seeking careers in music with their previous bands. They are all songwriters, they all love music, and more importantly, they all love people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShadow of Whales made their debut appearance at the Austin Convention Center in front of thousands of people for DellWorld; this act brought them to appear on TV only weeks later on KTBC - FOX 7 and garner praise from people like the \u003ca href=\"http://indiebandguru.com/shadow-of-whales-new-austin-band-ready-to-explode-on-the-scene/\"\u003eIndie Band Guru \u003c/a\u003ewith statements such as, \"Shadow Of Whales has the tunes and the drive to make a big impact on the strong local Austin scene and beyond\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLess than a year later, SoW released their debut self-titled EP and saw an explosion of support from both their quickly growing fan base and the web. \"[Shadow of Whales has] dropped one of the sassiest and catchiest records in recent memory\" claims \u003ca href=\"http://www.underthegunreview.net/2014/08/26/drop-everything-jam-shadow-of-whales-new-ep-is-the-best-thing-youll-spin-today/\"\u003eUnder The Gun Review.\u003c/a\u003e The debut EP charted on CMJ\u0027s Top 200 and has seen regular rotation at Starbucks Coffee across the United States and Canada.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShadow of Whales have shared the stage with names such as Courage My Love, Mayday Parade, Circa Survive, Jonny Craig and performed at several festivals such as the Vans Warped Tour, (San Antonio) RedGorilla Music Festival, Heart of Texas Rockfest, South By So What?!
