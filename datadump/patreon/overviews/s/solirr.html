    "summary": "I\u0027m not somebody you\u0027ve heard of. My name is Sydney Jean Haugen and I\u0027m from Gilbert, Arizona. I studied (and fell in love with) theater in college there, learning acting for the stage and for the screen, directing techniques, lighting design, set and prop construction, and playwriting. When I got my associate degree in the summer of 2017, I stuck around for one more semester and made the crazy decision to uproot my entire life and move to Hamburg, Germany to pursue my dreams in theater. Since I moved here in January, I\u0027ve been exploring the city, taking pictures, meeting new people, experiencing new cultures, writing, and drinking lots and lots of coffee. My original plan was to live here for six months, but I\u0027ve decided I want to stay.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the problem: writing scripts doesn\u0027t make you any money unless you sell them. In my case, I actually lose money, since my method of writing requires me to wake up really early, head to a cafe, order a coffee, and start writing, free-hand. Like I said, I drink lots and lots of coffee.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been looking for jobs in theaters and I\u0027ve had a few interviews, but so far, no luck. I recently looked into an apprenticeship so I can study theater and work at the same time, but that would only cover the cost of my rent, food, and monthly bus/train ticket. To earn money for fun things, I\u0027d probably have to get a second job on the side, which wouldn\u0027t leave much time or energy for writing plays, which is what I love to do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then I heard of Patreon. I figure it\u0027ll take a while to get some fans, but at least I\u0027ll be writing in the meantime. What I plan on doing is writing a random four to five page scene every two weeks and uploading it here for just a couple dollars, enough to pay for the coffee I drink during the time it takes to write it. I love to use my writing to make people feel and think about things they either aren\u0027t used to or don\u0027t want to think or feel. I think good theater can really change an audience, and that\u0027s what I strive to do with my writing: engage the reader and draw them in to a life-like situation that maybe they have never experienced before, and see how they react.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to eventually write a full-length play, publish it, and see it be produced and performed, but until then, this is how I\u0027m going to share my work and improve upon it with YOUR feedback.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really appreciate all the help I can get, and I\u0027ll try to work on some longer scripts as well for you guys. I\u0027m looking forward to sharing my creations with you! If there\u0027s something you\u0027d like to know more about or have offered as a reward, let me know and I\u0027ll definitely consider it! I\u0027m here to let YOU be involved in my writing, whether it\u0027s just reading it, giving me ideas, or talking to me about my process and where you can draw inspiration from for your own writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

I wanted to pursue my career in theater here in Germany, and I have! I\u0027ve been writing scripts for short scenes and one acts since I moved here, and I\u0027ve even been working on a full length play. Unfortunately, I had no way of earning an income from this, until I discovered Patreon. I\u0027m hoping to make a little bit of money sharing my scripts with you so that I can afford to keep writing them. I hope you\u0027ll support my passion!",
