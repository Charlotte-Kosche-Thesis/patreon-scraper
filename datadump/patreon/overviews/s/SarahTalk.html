Already our awesome Patrons have allowed us to improve our production quality with better equipment. \u00a0We just started taking the show on the road and hope to do much more of this - conventions, rallies, etc and we hope to launch a video edition of the show one day as well! \u00a0That time and equipment come at a cost, and you can be right here with us, from the beginning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur episodes will always be free - on our website \u003ca href=\"http://www.sarahtalk.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.SarahTalk.com\u003c/a\u003e and available to subscribe via iTunes and other podcast apps. \u00a0When you become a Patron, you\u0027re getting access to special versions of each episode, at minimum you get access to the shows at least a day before they post publicly, which are ad-free for Patrons, plus Exclusive Patron-Only content ranging from extended segments and bloopers to complete full-length episodes! \u00a0And of course we give you lots of love on-air.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for being a major part of our journey!\u003cbr\u003e"
