    "summary": "In August of 2015 my Youtube channel was terminated with no warning or explanation given by Google, even after many dozens of stressful hours of sending emails and filling forms. \u003cbr\u003e When my channel was terminated,\u00a0I lost several years of hard work and a crucial source of income. I recovered only 16 of my 140 videos, some of my best work was lost forever. Hundreds or thousands of hours of work perished.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0My motivation to continue was hit hard, and it was also quite impossible to continue to invest time in my passion the same way I was used to. The money I got from Youtube was used to pay for college, and also for new games and hardware. It devastated the self-sustaining routine I had developed that allowed me to work on my channel for these years. I had to completely restructure my life and work longer hours to fill that hole. My new channel is still a tiny fraction of the size and help of what my old one was.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0You can find it here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb2PTdRGKwLjOJQtSW2YF_A\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb2PTdRGKwLjOJQtS...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eI\u0027m doing my best to start again, but without the money that I was getting from Youtube and relying on, my hands are tied. I\u0027m doing my very best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e If you like my work and really want to help me, now would be a great time. I would very much appreciate your donations. Please help me to continue to make videos and get my new channel off the ground. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for everything and all the best!"
