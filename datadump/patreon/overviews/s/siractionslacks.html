Content creation for me has never been about the money, it\u2019s been about the passion and the love for what I made and get to show off. But recently, things changed.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThere came a point to where \u003cstrong\u003emaking content ended up costing me money\u003c/strong\u003e. Youtube pays like garbage and if I wanted to support myself I needed to go to events or stream on twitch. Those things are great but I love to make videos, and doing those things meant that I had no time to dedicate to making videos due to opportunity costs of not working. In the end, my videos went from daily to monthly to almost every 3-4 months. And that made me sad.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eSo, I decided to hire an editor so I could still make content but not have to worry about some of the more time consuming parts of the videos. THIS WAS AMAZING! Weekly content, good shit. But I needed to pay this person directly, and since I was making no money off Youtube anyway, my hypothetical losses turned into real monetary losses. I was in the red FOR REAL.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eSo that\u0027s the reason for this Patreon. \u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019m not looking to make a profit, I don\u2019t need you to save my life, you have already done that by supporting me in the first place. I just want to cover costs for producing the content and pay this guy so I can continue making the things I love for you\u003c/strong\u003e.
