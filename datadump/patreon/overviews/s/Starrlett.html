All of these feed into the various bits and pieces I do on the internet- if you want more info, you can watch my channel trailer above :) I am a new graduate from university, and fresh into the world of adulthood. Although YouTube is a hobby for me, content creation is something I\u0027m really passionate about, and strive to improve every day. I am still a small channel, so all of the \u0027profit\u0027 I make comes primarily from donations and this Patreon page, so the support I get through both of those is crucial and absolutely touching to me. For what you guys give, I try to return the kindness, whether it\u0027s goofiness to give a smile, creations and writing to make you think, or personal letters of thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eSo, why support me? How does it help, and what do you get?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, the money goes towards my creative content, whether it\u0027s improving software and hardware, getting ahold of new games to play for you guys, attending conventions, maintaining servers, buying merchandise and giveaway goodies, and helping me day-to-day\u00a0feel a lot more content and stable with having\u00a0content creating as a part-time job.\u00a0Many of the goals you see give back content and love to the community in some way, as you deserve all the thanks for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eBut what do *I* get out of it?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn terms of what you get, you can see the Patreon rewards include regular and exclusive content, access to early drafts and edits of some of the work I do, and personal messages and postcards. I value everyone who supports me, whether it\u0027s monetary, sharing content, or simply watching and interacting, but I love being able to give Patreons a little extra love for their support :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to support me, even as little as $1 means the world, and only adds up to $12 a year.\u00a0If five people did that, that\u0027d be $60 a year! It all adds up, and it\u00a0all goes back into\u00a0improving the content I make. YouTube, Twitch, writing, all of it is my creative outlet, and a way to share my thoughts with you, and I love that you value them enough to support.\u00a0Thank you for reading and considering being a patron, have a swell day! :)"
