    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHiya everyone! My name is Sarah Hall, and I\u0027m a photographer, cosplayer, and all around huge nerd from Newfoundland, Canada.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/gyjM59q.png\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had an interest in photography since I was 5 years old and would use a disposable film camera to take blurry photos of bugs in my backyard! Over the past five years, I\u0027ve been doing photography professionally as a career, shooting portraits, cosplay, weddings, and everything in between. Cosplay photography and fashion photography are my biggest passions as they allow me to get truly creative and express myself through my work. As an avid gamer and sci-fi/fantasy geek, cosplay photography just combines all of my favourite things into one! I\u0027ve been lucky to work with so many amazingly talented people over the years, and I hope to continue to do so for a very long time.\u003cbr\u003ePhotography is my passion and a way that lets me express my endless creativity. I truly couldn\u0027t imagine doing anything else with my life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/xFgzu1Z.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been cosplaying since 2011, but have recently gotten into it a lot more, and I combine this with my love of photography! I make almost all of my own cosplays, and photograph and edit them all myself, as well! Patreon will not only help with my photography, but will also help me produce better costumes and get materials to make awesome things! You can check out my past cosplays on Facebook over at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/villanarei\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eVillanarei Cosplay\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/xn2c9xI.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also a Twitch streamer! I don\u0027t have a current schedule for Twitch, but I stream usually at least once a week. I stream a combination of video games (mostly Overwatch, FFXIV, and Dragon Age), as well as creative streams for photography or cosplay crafting! With Patreon, I will be offering Patron-only streams where you can watch me shoot, edit photos, or work on my newest cosplays! You can click\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/villanarei\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e to follow my Twitch channel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why become a Patron, you may ask? Well, I\u0027ve always wanted to help out those who are just getting into photography, whether it be cosplay photography, fashion photography, or something completely different! I get asked a lot of questions about my shooting and editing techniques, as well as how I make my cosplays, and I thought this would be a wonderful way to do that for all of my supporters! :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eEvery month you\u0027ll receive new content from me, and content just for you, whether it be high quality wallpapers or prints, thank you cards, photo editing time-lapses, cosplay tutorials, behind the scenes photos and videos, tutorials, and more!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe support I get from Patreon helps me fund upgraded photography gear, cosplay supplies, and helps me to travel to more awesome places to photograph more amazing people!\u003cbr\u003eSo there\u0027s something for me and for you! What\u0027s better than that?! :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAny suggestions for Patreon rewards will definitely be noted and considered for the future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all so much for visiting my page and reading this! To all my Patrons out there, you\u0027re literally angels! Your support means the world to me, and I can\u0027t thank you enough.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my love,\u003cbr\u003eSarah"
