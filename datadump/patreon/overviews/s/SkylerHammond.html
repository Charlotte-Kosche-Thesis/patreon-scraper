I mean, I assume you\u2019re human. If not, I\u2019ve got some questions. Like a lot of questions. Otherwise, go on and give yourself a little hug for me. I\u2019ll wait. Just the fact you were willing to click on my ugly mug warms my normally rather dreary heart. Truth is, I appreciate it, more than I could ever formulate into words in fact. But enough with sentiment, down to the patronage! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eSo Why The Patronage?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nThere are few things in this world I love more than writing, but sharing my work with readers happens to be one of them. I\u2019ll never stop writing, no amount of future ramen noodle dinners could stop me, but truth is, I want to be able to write more often. And also maintain a basic level of nutrition I suppose, but that comes solidly second. I want to be able to continue my work as well as the online writing community I\u2019ve built, without the need for more silly advertisements, and provide my readers with good stories. As frivolous as it sounds, I\u2019ve never wanted anything more than I want to provide people with stories. My promise to you is that I\u2019ll work day and night to do so for you here. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBasically: you can become my patron for all things written, and I can afford to go on scribbling the night away! Truth is, I will keep writing regardless, but this way you get to read my work, be a part of it, influence it, say thank you, and let me go on doing what I do with some peace! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u2019s In It For Me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\nMy tired and smiling heart!
