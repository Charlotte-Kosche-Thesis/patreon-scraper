    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for dropping by\u003c/strong\u003e - it\u0027s great to have you here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me introduce myself and my awesome podcast. Im Dr Sarb Johal, and I\u0027m based in Wellington, New Zealand. I\u0027ve been been producing my podcast - \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWho cares? What\u0027s the point?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e - since December 2016.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat\u0027s \"Who cares? What\u0027s the point?\" all about?\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGreat question - glad you asked.\u00a0I\u0027ve been tracking down cutting edge psychology researchers from around the world who\u0027ve been working on amazing research about why we behave the way we do. But, because of the way the science system works we have ended up with a gigantic amount of untapped knowledge that sits in dusty journals on library shelves - because very few people read them. And, why would you bother when you more than likely have to pay - a lot.\u003cbr\u003eThis podcasts changes that. When I was a PhD student, one of the slides I included in every presentation I did said this; \"\u003cem\u003eWho cares? What\u0027s the point?\u003c/em\u003e\" Why anyone should care about the research I was doing. This podcast does the same thing. I invite researchers from around the world to talk about their research, and then I will prompt them to answer those two questions. This way, you get to hear stories about how the brain works, without putting your mind to sleep.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Break Down\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore audio content:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0If you join my exclusive community, I can take the podcast back to a weekly schedule. I produced the podcast weekly for the first 5 months, but that became just too much - it takes a lot of time, effort and coordination to do this. So, I had to step it down to a show every two weeks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExtra content:\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve got a TON of ideas as to how to grow the podcast. As well as getting back up to a weekly schedule, I\u0027d love to add visuals for you - my Patreon tribe - infographics summarising the main points of the science, and extra exclusive Patreon audio content too. I even want to publish e-books of curated transcripts from this show - but that\u0027ll take funds. Hello, you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew topics:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027ve been thinking about this for a while now, and I think it\u0027s time to take this podcast to the next level. This isn\u0027t just going to be about psychology any more. It\u0027s going to be about all kinds of SCIENCE and technology. Yes, we\u0027re going to talk about all-the-things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDid I mention the e-book?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Yes! I want to publish curated e-books of the transcribed content of the show. It\u0027ll be awesome, and yes, my Patreon tribe, I think I should be able to arrange a sweet discount for you too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo that\u0027s my offer.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the very beginning, \u003cem\u003eWho cares? What\u0027s the point?\u003c/em\u003e has been listener-driven . First and foremost I do the show every week for you, the listener. Without you folks, there\u0027s no reason to even do a show in the first place. But time is moving on, and I\u0027ve realised that if I\u0027m going to turn this great podcast into something even greater, now is the moment to do so!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy paying for my podcast you will be a part of my exclusive community, supporting creativity in science communication, and my drive to make this something even greater (plus, you help me pay the bills too! BONUS). Remember, when you\u0027re supporting me, you\u0027re supporting me by the amount you click, per month. I really appreciate it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClick on that orange button and let me know that you\u0027re part of my tribe. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for being there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSarb\u003cbr\u003eProducer and host of \u003cem\u003eWho cares?
