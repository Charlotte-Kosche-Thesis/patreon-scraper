    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Darian, or scitydreamer, and I am a queer amateur indie dev and a student in journalism and media studies. I believe in games and I believe in writing and with their powers combined, I create nonsense stories in games and write about games!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlright, what do you do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to work on games and writing. I primarily work on a blog called Indie Hell Zone, dedicated to stuff that I find on itch.io, with posts ranging from \"hey look at this thing\" and actual reviews. I aim to update it twice a week, with various stuff I\u0027m interested in. Why do I do this? I think talking about games is fun! Like, stuff like Hardcore Gaming 101, VGJunk and Boss Fight Books fascinates me, talking about these things. I want to talk about games too, but with a bigger indie focus, because I want to give more attention to the small stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the games side, I made a bunch of things of varying quality. I mainly prefer to work in RPG Maker, because I like RPGs and it\u0027s an accessible tool. I just sort of want to put together a world and tell a story and I\u0027m not necessarily aiming for mechanical depth and really that\u0027s what a lot of people seem to prefer it as. However, I also dabble a bit in GameMaker and I want to learn how to use it some more so that I can make non-RPGs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI kinda jump around when I\u0027m working on things, unless it\u0027s a game jam thing that I feel pressured to finish. So, a lot of the things I\u0027ll put out are versions and demos, slowly building up to a final release, unless I feel that it\u0027d be best to keep . My current projects are:\u00a0\u003cem\u003eTreasure Quest!!\u003c/em\u003e, an RPG about a treasure hunter named Quiddity and \u003cem\u003eNASU Plus\u003c/em\u003e, a shooter based on Yume Nikki; progress on my stuff in general can be found on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://scitydreamer.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy tumblr\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://scitydreamer.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Blog\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://scitydreamer.itch.io\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe itch.io\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy have you made a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made this Patreon for two reasons. One is that I worry about the future and job climate a lot, so it wouldn\u0027t hurt to have some kind of income. Secondly, I feel motivated to stay focused on my work if people give me money, because taking people\u0027s money without doing any work for it would make me feel really bad and I want ya\u0027ll to feel that you\u0027re putting your money in good hands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso hey, I want to help support other Patreons! Please, check out who I\u0027m supporting and please do the same!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis page is looking a bit sparse, eh?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just sort of testing the waters so far. I\u0027m already kinda open about things I make, so there won\u0027t be development progress on stuff hidden behind paywalls. Maybe I\u0027ll add tiers based on services people would want? Like I\u0027m not super amazing at art but I could be down to be like \"hey at $X I\u0027ll make you a drawing of your choice as long as it\u0027s not porn\" if people would want it. I honestly only added the third tier because I was suggested to, but heck I\u0027d be down for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the goals, they\u0027re just dedicated to covering the costs of blog upgrades for now. It\u0027d be rad to surpass it, but no pressure!\u003cbr\u003e"
