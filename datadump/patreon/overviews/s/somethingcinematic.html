    "summary": "Greetings! \u00a0My name is Tim Dunn; otherwise known as the Film Adventurer: \u00a0Timdiana. Over the years I have created a reputation of being a film critic, journalist, blogger, checker and personality. All of my work deals with one passion: movies. \u00a0For sometime now, I have been creating a brand called\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSomething Cinematic\u003c/strong\u003e. My goal is create a place that features a variety of content; such as web series like Cinematic Adventures, The Cinematic Experience, Cinematic Casting and much more. All of this is in the name to not just bringing something different to the entertainment world, but something that captures a love for the movies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently I have been contemplating Something Cinematic\u0027s future and where I want this brand to go. Making the likes of videos is all well and good, but I feel that there has been little to no direction for SC itself. However, recently, I managed to narrow down my goals and I wish to make Something Cinematic a full multimedia company. There will be two parts that make up Something Cinematic: entertainment and production. The entertainment side will include content such as video reviews, podcasts and blogs. The other side of the company will deal with aiding creators with the likes of editing videos, helping theatre productions and even lessons in action and creating videos. The idea is to be able to give back to viewers and fans both creatively and constructively. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make this idea a reality is where this patreon campaign comes in. \u00a0By making a pledge, you will help Something Cinematic obtain new features that will help it become a ongoing business. Not only that but your contribution will help to improve all SC content; from giving videos advanced production or establishing the brand on social media. By donating patreon campaign I promise not let your pledge go to waste as you will receive special content that can only be seen on Patreon; such as exclusive podcast going behind the scenes on Something Cinematic content, the vlog series Cinematic Unscripted where I go in depth on particular film or subject and exclusive Film Ventures on the major releases hitting theaters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you cannot make a pledge, that is perfectly fine. There are other ways for you can to contribute. You can subscribe to Something Cinematic on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoahCKO0krGR43nVMTkzgRg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e or follow SC\u0027s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://somethingcinematic.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eofficial site\u003c/a\u003e. How you choose to contribute is entirely up to you. Any help would appreciated as it would aid in making Something Cinematic a place for not just moviegoer, but for creators as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
