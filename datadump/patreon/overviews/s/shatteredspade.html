Also at the age of 4 or 5, perhaps slightly younger, my grandfather and I (mostly him) started making wooden animals on the scroll saw. Combined these two things complete two of my three core interests, making things and taking photos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I here?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI like to destroy things in the pursuit of art. I am also going to be losing my YouTube revenue due to their changed policy. The combination of those two things have me looking for ways to offset the costs, I think Patreon is the perfect solution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2018\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have several goals in 2018, the first is to complete a 365 Day Photo Project. I\u0027ve been defeated 3 times by a 365 day project. In 2018 I am determined to complete it. I am approaching it from a completely different angle. My objective is to throw myself into an extremely uncomfortable set of constraints each day and force myself to create something interesting to get out of it. I have compiled a list of concepts and ideas and will execute all of them to the best of my abilities. Along with this I want to deepen my knowledge and understanding of off camera lighting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second is to consistently upload project videos on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I post on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBecoming a Patron gets you a look at behind the scenes stuff. A lot of times with the 365 day project it\u0027s really tough to pick just one photo, I often times share the rejects here on Patreon. I also give a bit of backstory about the images and occasionally share the camera settings. I also post my YouTube videos here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt would be an honor to have you come along for the ride.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
