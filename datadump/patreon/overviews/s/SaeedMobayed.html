    "summary": "What\u0027s going on wolves, it\u0027s your boooy SAAAEEED!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started making YouTube videos consistently in September 2015. I started making videos to help people improve their lives physically and mentally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mission has expanded further since then. I realize there are millions of people worldwide suffering from depression, anxiety, fear, low self-esteem, illness, negative thinking and loneliness. I also realize that we are all one big family and there are no boundaries separating us except for the negative mental brainwashing of society.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think of each and every one of you as family. I keep my videos as real and authentic as I can and I want to keep it that way. The truth is, I can make money, lots of money, by doing things like online coaching, mass marketing and all the other business stuff. But I don\u0027t want to do that. I want to focus all my time and energy on creating meaningful raw authentic content that can help millions of people live happy fulfilling lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to meet as many of you as possible. My vision is international. I want to travel and meet people in person. I want to host seminars, events and bootcamps where we can freely express ourselves in an environment of like-minded people who transcend the current limiting beliefs of modern societies worldwide. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a lifelong mission for me. That\u0027s what this wolf pack is all about. Your support means the world to me. It means we can carry out this mission collectivley, as one big community of loving and caring human beings. THANK YOU!!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne Love, One Family, One Heart \u0026lt;3"
