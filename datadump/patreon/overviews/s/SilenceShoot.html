In the shoot, people get their photographs taken to show their stance against bullying and suicide. We also offer resources for those who might be considering suicide, trying to get them the help they need.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re still very much an underground movement, but we are gaining traction and quickly becoming more and more known throughout Michigan. We wanna expand that from Michigan to the surrounding states and maybe even the entire nation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money raised from this helps insure that the shoot can continue uninterrupted. Every penny raised will go toward expenses such as gas, equipment, and we will use 25% of the proceeds to add to our donation to the Trevor Project- a suicide prevention hotline.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf we raise enough money, we are planning on being able to make this an official non-profit of itself, so then we can continue making this into more of a business and we can start bringing in counselors and staff to help those in need.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, we will be adding your name to our website on the list of Patreon Supporters to show an additional thanks to you!"
