    "summary": "As many of my faithful and very affirming blog readers know, I\u0027m a full-time Catholic volunteer who has an insatiable desire to pour out her thoughts, opinions, hilarious happenings and moving moments on my blog. I write what I feel like writing and so far that\u0027s worked for most of you people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, even Saint Paul had a tent-making business, and many people who do what I do have some kind of side line (Catholic volunteers don\u0027t MAKE any money, they have enough to live on, and give away the rest). My only marketable skill is writing.. so do I abandon my little blog to write other people\u0027s content? Noooo! On the contrary, I seek out Patrons who love what I write, have been inspired or had ah-ha moments through reading my blog over the past five years, and want me to not just keep creating content, but create MORE content! That\u0027s what patrons of previous centuries did- they funded artists of all kinds so they were freed up to create more beautiful art. This patron could be you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow do you do it? I\u0027m looking for at least 20 Patrons who are willing to donate anything from Rs 100 or $2 upward per month, as a recurring donation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you get out of it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, a fresh new awesome blog post every week! I know, I know, I often neglect my blog for months at a time. But Patreon is going to make me disciplined, productive and hopefully still fun to read! I hate it when I find a good blogger, and then I hardly see any new content, or just reposts from years before. I don\u0027t want to be that blogger. Also, I\u0027ll create some exclusive content just for my patrons! Excited yet?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo come on in and join the Patreon party!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSue Zanna\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
