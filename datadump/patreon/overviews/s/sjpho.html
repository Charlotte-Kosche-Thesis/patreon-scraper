    "summary": "Hi everyone! I\u0027m Scott Jones, a freelance motor sports photographer. Each season it gets more difficult to make expenses - I\u0027m not on contract and have to earn back all my travel, insurance, equipment, etc. costs by selling photos. So I\u0027ve been looking for new opportunities to entertain and educate fans of motor sports and photography.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2008, when I started living my dream of being a motor sports photographer, I\u0027ve learned loads of things to share with aspiring photographers. And some crazy, funny stuff has happened to me while working in MotoGP, WSBK, and other motor sports series - stuff that racing fans enjoy hearing about in my live presentations. Patreon is a way for me to bring these things to you as a new stream of video, audio, and written content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nIf you\u0027re looking at a Patreon page for the first time, here\u0027s the deal\u003c/strong\u003e: Patreon allows people to be come patrons of the artists whose work they appreciate by contributing on a monthly basis rather than making a one-time donation or purchase. So I\u0027ve joined Patreon with some new ideas for ways to reach my two groups of followers, the Photography Fans and the Race Fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m making all of the photography-related video content I produce available to all supporters, even at the $2/month level. I\u0027m really excited to share the things I\u0027ve learned about photographing motor sports with everyone who offers even the first level of support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor those who want more of what I have to offer, the higher support tiers come with rewards such as:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOn The Road Diaries\u003c/strong\u003e: As I travel around, I\u0027ll be recording stories of my adventures - amusing things that happen on the road, in the paddock and so on. I\u0027m not permitted to record video inside the circuits I visit, but I can tell you, podcast-style, about what happened in these audio diary entires. I think you\u0027ll enjoying hearing behind the scenes tales about my time in MotoGP, WSBK, BSB and more.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSwag Bag Lottery\u003c/strong\u003e: Over the years I\u0027ve collected all sorts of swag items and each month I\u2019ll do a lottery for all my Patreon supporters. The more you chip in to keep me going, the more chances you have to win and pick an item from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://photo.gp/photo-gp-grab-bag/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSwag Bag\u003c/a\u003e. If you\u0027re in the US\u00a0I\u2019ll ship it to you for free, or if you\u0027re outside the US I\u0027ll ship at my cost via the courier you prefer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor the PhotoGP website I do a free \u003cstrong\u003edesktop calendar\u003c/strong\u003e that looks like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://photo.gp/category/06desktops/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e. At the $15/month level you get to pick the image you want from the PhotoGP online archive and I will create that month\u0027s desktop calendar specifically for you. (You may pick any image that has \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e been used for a PhotoGP Limited Edition.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor all tiers of $15/month and higher, after the first month of support I\u0027ll send you some PhotoGP stickers, and after the second month a MotoMatters calendar, year of your choice (free shipping for US delivery, my cost for International delivery).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nSpecial Access to Me!\u003c/strong\u003e This access takes several possible forms. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGoogle hangouts with a photo topic where you can ask questions among the group\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 on 1 Skype calls about photography or racing, your choice\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eJoin.me screen share sessions where you send me one of your photos, then watch my screen as I process it in Lightroom\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA monthly review of your photography work\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the money go?\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m glad you asked! Patreon contributions go straight into my travel fund so that I can attend more races and bring you more content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n2015\u0027s travel expenses averaged $1,855 per MotoGP race (flights from SFO, rental cars, meals, hotels or house shares, plus various expenses such as Media Center Internet fees at Spanish and Italian rounds, road tolls, fuel (around $8/gallon in Europe!!!) and so on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m not looking to get rich - wanting to make money is simply \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e why you get into motorcycle racing photography. Rather, I\u0027m looking to \u003cem\u003ekeep doing something I love\u003c/em\u003e. Creating the photographs themselves is only part of what I enjoy about this work. Sharing it with people who like what I do is the other part, and I\u0027m extremely grateful to everyone who has helped me in the past and who continues to help me in the present.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf Patreon isn\u0027t for you, no worries. As long as I\u0027m able to stay in MotoGP my photos will be appearing everywhere I can place them for you to enjoy. And if you\u0027d like to do something supportive that doesn\u0027t involve your wallet, please visit the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://photo.gp/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePhotoGP website\u003c/a\u003e, subscribe to the YouTube channel and like and share those shorter videos so that other people can discover what I\u0027m up to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks again for looking at my Patreon page. I hope to be sharing my unique content with you soon!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nScott\u003cbr\u003e"
