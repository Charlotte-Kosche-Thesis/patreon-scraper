StacheBros makes family friendly content that features beloved characters from the Mario Bros franchise. Join Super Mario and Luigi on their plush adventures, as they bring Nintendo video games to life! StacheBros was one of the original Mario Plush channels to help pioneer the genre back in the early 2000s, and offers top notch production quality with professional screenwriting, cinematography, special effects, and musical numbers. With your help, this channel can grow like a mustache to become the most popular Mario Plush channel on the internet!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eIt is becoming less financially feasible to rely on YouTube income alone to keep StacheBros up and running. YouTube\u0027s recent algorithm changes have drastically decreased the amount of revenue the channel receives. Patreon allows you to help secure a future for StacheBros through different tiered pledges.\u00a0And there\u0027s perks! Each pledge mark offers different exclusive rewards starting at as little as $1.00 per month. Check out the \"FREE\" section under \"Featured Tags\" to get a taste of what kind of rewards patrons receive, and determine for yourself if its worth it to pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eNavigating Rewards\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eIf you\u0027ve become a patron and are having trouble finding your rewards, use the featured tags section to claim your goods.
