It\u0027s existence is owed to my getting laid off from my full time job in 2008. Since then, things have slowly started looking up at the print shop, I am now part time essentially, but my position with TAMD \u0026amp; my dream of being my own boss still exists. After carrying TAMD \u0026amp; its financial costs by myself since 2010 I reached a breaking point mid-2016. Not only was it draining me, the audience I worked to build was slowly taken away by Facebook\u0027s new algorithm.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve come to Patreon to keep TAMD alive, but also as a way to get in direct contact with the fan base that social media is taking from me (and pretty much everyone with a fan page these days). Supporting TAMD here doesn\u0027t just keep our website up or allow me to pay creatives for new content, but also helps me reach our fans directly!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal for this Patreon is to be a springboard for self-reliance, so that I can finally be my own boss. I\u0027m awaiting the day when I\u0027m well off enough to switch this account to a patron \u0026amp; start supporting those like me, with big dreams \u0026amp; a small wallet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith Patreon, I want to:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRelaunch TAMD\u0027s website, perhaps even pay someone for a social network/Model Mayhem style website. Rebrand it as just TAMD, so that I can include a list of photographers, designers, etc on site. I want to create exclusive content for the website \u0026amp; Patreon, that you won\u0027t see anywhere else. I want to buy software to design a magazine solely for those associated with TAMD, AND be able to pay them for the content.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor TAMD\u0027s blog, I\u0027d love to get a better equipment for making videos \u0026amp; taking product photos. I currently have my eye one a Phantom 4K Camera, but will settle for any quality camera at this point. Pay models to do reviews, tutorials, \u0026amp; do both myself.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAfter TAMD\u0027s needs are met, I have a few personal goals. For my woodworking, better wood, better tools! Perhaps a bigger space to create. (Again a two-for, as a large enough area could be used as a studio)\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cb style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhat do I get for pledging?\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThis is best answered by checking out the reward tiers.

What I feel to tell people right away is that I\u0027m a very opinionated person, who has a love/hate relationship with mankind, but a love for all animals and that if you find swearing and blasphemy offensive, we won\u0027t get along.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always been an artistic person, and come from a family of creative people. Most recently (okay as of 4 years ago) I decided to share the art of modeling through my website, The Alternative Model Directory. With TAMD I\u0027ve taken on a mission to share impressive works of photographic art from all model regardless of their level of fame and experience, while creating a safe environment for models.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides my website I also sometimes have the itch to design clothing and accessories. Truth be told I have a lot of projects going on and many more in my idea book - this is the reason behind me created this account here on Patreon. I am hoping to catch the attention of like minded individuals, even businesses, to bring these projects to life.",
