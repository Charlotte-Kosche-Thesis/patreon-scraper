I make art and stories, hence I\u0027m hanging out in the comics category. Not everything will be a comic, sometimes it will be a story, sometimes an illustration, and sometimes sequential art.

Feel free to ask me questions in the comments!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of this chatter is in the form of patreon posts. Some of it is in my streams, some in Telegram on my phone as I\u0027m working, because my RAM can only take so much. Art + upload + download of media is a bit much to ask all at once.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you want to chat while I\u0027m making stuff? Want to see more pinups? More comics?
