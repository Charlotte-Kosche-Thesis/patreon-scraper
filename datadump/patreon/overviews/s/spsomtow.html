    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my Patreon page!\u00a0 If you have been reading my books since the 1980s, you will see that S.P. Somtow, world fantasy award-winning author of \u003cem\u003eMallworld, Vampire Junction,\u003c/em\u003e and the \u003cem\u003eInquestor Tetralogy\u003c/em\u003e hasn\u0027t gone away!\u00a0 If you have been following my operas and my music career, you will get to see all the latest performances plus archival ones as well!\u00a0 The world has changed a lot since the era of \"big publishing.\"\u00a0 I hope to be able to reach out to readers and supporters in a whole new way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout two decades ago, pursuing the muse, I started an opera company in Thailand and gradually drifted away from writing novels.\u00a0 My life is very different now; in L.A., I used to write or compose all night long and sleep all day.\u00a0 Now, I still write or compose all night long, but the administrative work of running the opera company, two symphony orchestras, a whole educational program, and the constant fundraising meetings mean that I\u0027ve been suffering a fair amount of sleep deprivation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAcquiring a Patreon base would allow me the luxury of delegating much more of the administrative work of the opera company to executive-level staff.\u00a0 I\u0027m 65 now, and I want to survive to write all the novels, operas, and other works that are still in my head.\u00a0 But I can\u0027t abandon all the things I am doing for the cultural life of this country and for artistic development of young people here.\u00a0 If I can slowly ease myself into spending a larger percentage of my life on creativity matters, and delegating more administration matters, I will manage to get it all done before ascending to the great podium in the sky.\u00a0 For my readers who have waited so long for more science fiction, fantasy and horror, this is a chance to return to this work.\u00a0 For those who love my operas, they\u0027ll get written and produced in a timelier fashion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will soon start posting special content for Patrons, including a serialization of my upcoming fifth \u003cem\u003eInquestor \u003c/em\u003enovel, the opening of \u003cem\u003eThe Dragonstones, \u003c/em\u003ea new fantasy trilogy, and a couple of interesting nonfiction books including \u003cem\u003eNirvana Express, \u003c/em\u003ea diary of my brief sojourn as a Buddhist monk.\u00a0 Special patrons will be able to delve deeper as well, as I share my secret notes and videotaped readings.\u00a0 There will be archival postings of rarer out-of-print stories as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic lovers will have access to new performances of my works as well as archival videos of complete operas and large-scale works I have created.\u00a0 They will journey with me on the different stages of the compositional process, and be able to hear computer-generated performances of works in progress \u003cem\u003ebefore \u003c/em\u003etheir world premieres with live performers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNew content every week!"
