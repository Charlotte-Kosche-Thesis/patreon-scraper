It\u0027s because now I have over $24k in loans owed, and I\u0027m lost as to what sort of a non-writing career I should follow to help pay for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn Patreon, I am releasing \u003cem\u003ePatreon-only\u003c/em\u003e romance stories of my original characters (OCs) in hopes of earning a little side income for my loans. My OCs can be found on my Toyhouse (linked above) and they have much love and art. These stories will be geared towards \u003cstrong\u003ehetero and homosexual romance\u003c/strong\u003e (mainly between two males, but occasionally two females). Some stories may have a mixed focus of both heterosexual and homosexual couples, while the majority focus on only one couple at a time.
