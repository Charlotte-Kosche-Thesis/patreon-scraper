    "summary": "Hey, everyone!\u003cbr\u003eThis is Leslie Rice, host of both the web series Terror Obscura, AND the exciting new horror podcast, The Signal.\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who are familiar with my shows, thanks for watching and listening, and thanks for taking the time to have a look at my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who aren\u0027t - Please take a minute to check out the video above, or some of my personal favorite episodes, which I\u0027ll be linking below! Careful though, as they might be considered a bit NSFW.\u003cbr\u003eIf you actually ARE at work, then\u00a0A: Shame on you! Those spreadsheets won\u0027t do themselves! I\u0027m telling Mr. Johnston! And B: Terror Obscura is a comedy review web series that takes a look at some of the most amazing and some of the most awful horror movies ever made. Good or bad, new, or old, high budget or low, classic or obscure gem, it doesn\u0027t matter- we love horror of all stripes here, so each episode is always something fresh and new!\u003cbr\u003eGenerally, episodes of Terror Obscura, start with a bit of background, telling the audience whatever interesting factors led to the movie\u0027s creation, or at least a bit of background on the specific TYPE of horror it is.\u003cbr\u003eFrom there, we move on to the meat of the episode, an overview of the plot in which our target of choice receives a good slapping about. No sacred cow is safe from this barbecue, and nothing will be spared.\u003cbr\u003eFinally, we\u0027ll take a look at if the movie sucked, why it did or didn\u0027t suck, and what the impact of its suckitude or lack thereof was.\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that, we\u0027ve got shorter Fright Bites episodes, and serious, editorial-style videos in the form of our State of Fear videos.\u003cbr\u003eLooking for something a little more serious?\u003cbr\u003eThen look no further than my more recent venture, The Signal!\u003cbr\u003eThe Signal is a horror fiction podcast like no other which combines elements of radio drama, audio fiction reading, nonfiction paranormal exploration, and a contest each episode for the fans!\u003cbr\u003eEach episode contains several horror stories courtesy of the authors on our very own subreddit, \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SignalHorrorFiction/\"\u003eSignal Horror Fiction.\u003c/a\u003e We screen for quality and originality to ensure that you get the best stories, and the podcast definitely contains the cream of the crop!\u003cbr\u003eEach episode also contains a cypher that, once deciphered by a lucky fan, will determine the content of our next \u0027Local Broadcast\u0027 segment, where we explore horror legends from their very own hometown!\u003cbr\u003eWrapping around all of this is a frame story following Dr. Miles Teagan, a hapless researcher who discovers that this seemingly harmless broadcast, The Signal, isn\u0027t all that it seems...\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been growing by leaps and bounds over the years, and with our pickups by Channel Awesome, the Agony Booth, and other top reviewing sites, it\u0027s clear that we\u0027re still moving up the ranks. That said, this kind of growth won\u0027t be possible without the support of you, the fans.\u003cbr\u003eCheck out our great milestones and rewards, and don\u0027t forget to take a peek at some of our full episodes and our show page, listed below!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEpisodes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://blip.tv/terror-obscura/terror-obscura-friday-the-13th-the-final-chapter-7022431\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFriday the 13th: The Final Chapter\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://blip.tv/terror-obscura/terror-obscura-blair-witch-2-book-of-shadows-6996410\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBlair Witch 2: Book of Shadows\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://blip.tv/terror-obscura/terror-obscura-trick-r-treat-6864873\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTrick r\u0027 Treat\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://blip.tv/terror-obscura/terror-obscura-wolfen-6715068\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWolfen\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://blip.tv/terror-obscura/terror-obscura-house-of-the-dead-6614374\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHouse of the Dead\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eShow Page:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://blip.tv/terror-obscura\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTerror Obscura\u003c/a\u003e"

Every 5th episode of Terror Obscura will be a \u0027You Asked for It episode based on a fan vote, and I\u0027ll re-release some of our paid bonus episodes of The Signal as free every Christmas. Still considering whether to make this patrons only or not, so best to donate while you can...\u003cbr\u003e",
