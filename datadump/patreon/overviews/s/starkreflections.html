I thrive in that place where innovation and technology intersect with creativity and storytelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started the \u003ca href=\"https://www.starkreflections.ca\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStark Reflections on Writing \u0026amp; Publishing podcast\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eas a way to continue to provide insights and perspective to authors and other publishing professionals. I have always felt that it was important to provide a perspective that balances the understanding and respect for both the \"self-publishing\" and the \"traditional publishing\" communities; and my desire is for my weekly podcast to reflect that, drawn from both my twenty-five plus years as a writer and industry professional as well as the fact that I first embraced self-publishing in 2004 when I released my first book ONE HAND SCREAMING, a collection of my previously published short stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy primary goal is to help writers and other creative people with understanding \u003cstrong\u003ethe basics of the business of publishing\u003c/strong\u003e as well as to explore ideas and opportunities that exist so that they can make the most informed decisions and determine, for themselves, their own unique pathway to success.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is no \"magic bullet\" nor is any one path or one option the best thing for everyone. I truly believe that writers and other industry professionals need to continue to inform and educate themselves in order to discover and forge their own unique paths and careers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love hosting this podcast, love sharing ideas and adore bringing insights and though-provoking concepts to writers. And \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m hoping to engage with your Patreon support\u003c/strong\u003e to help fund the ongoing maintenance costs as well as compensate for the 4 to 6 hours per week that I dedicate to making this podcast happen.\u003cbr\u003e"
