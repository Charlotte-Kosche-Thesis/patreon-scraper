    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho is STLYoungblood?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey guys, I\u0027m STLYoungblood, and I\u0027d like to think at this point I\u0027m one of the leading content creators for the massively anticipated Space Sim Star Citizen on YouTube. I do make videos for other games, but those are normally filler content or to show something off that is either entertaining or the community may have interest in. I\u0027ve been making YouTube videos for about 4 years now, but it hasn\u0027t really been until Planetside 2 when I got the boost in population based on flight guides, and the channel has exploded in size and popularity with Star Citizen moving through development. If you found me through Patreon, you can explore the channel \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/blood60ft6in\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat sort of videos do you make?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExcellent question. To this point, my two most common video genres have been ship buying guides and system videos. The guides are focused into two categories; if a concept sale is worth your money and who they may be right for, and taking a goal in the game and helping to point people to the right ships. The system videos are designed to show off different places in the universe to help people find the right places to visit. I also do guides, tips, and tricks to help new players. Ultimately, my goal is to provide content that helps, entertains, and informs anyone and everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are your long term goals?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to see the channel continue to grow. Making videos that entertain and help has become a real passion of mine and seeing the appreciation of the community is something I thrive on. I\u0027m not planning on making this my full time job, as nice as that sounds, mainly because I love what I do in real life and if this became less of a hobby and more of a job, who knows if that passion would remain. Either way, I remain committed to providing the best content I can, even if that means I\u0027m never the \"biggest\" channel out there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis was something that I\u0027ve debated on for quite a while, primarily because I prefer to give to the community and not ask anything in return. That being said, I ultimately came to the realization that by running a Patreon page, I can provide better content through things like being able to afford new hardware for higher quality videos, getting more ships to review for you all, being able to run a second account where reputation doesn\u0027t impact my primary character, and many more. Wanting to bring the best quality of content can be an expensive proposition, and your help here is sincerely appreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo those of you who choose to donate, know that you\u0027re making a very real and direct impact towards the quality of the videos that come out. You\u0027ll always have a special place in my heart for helping the community to grow and develop through donations of your hard earned money. It\u0027s my commitment to give the best every time, and I see no reason that won\u0027t continue going forward. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely, STLYoungblood\u003cbr\u003e"
