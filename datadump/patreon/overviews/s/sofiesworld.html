    "summary": "Ciao friends- I\u0027m so happy you stopped by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Let me tell you a little story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all started when I was in my 3rd job out of college- I was doing phone sales for a travel company in Boston, USA. Day in and day out, I would walk to work, sit at my desk and begin dialing. 2 years of the same routine, I started to feel like a robot. Don\u0027t get me wrong- I was content with my life. I had an amazing group of friends, a good paying job, a cozy apartment, amazing vacation time. But was I really, truly \u003cem\u003ehappy?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI\u0027ve always been one to seek adventure, to seek the unknown. So, what did I do? I quit my job and decided to move to Rome. Yes, there was a boy involved that sparked the decision (and now we\u0027re getting married!) but I\u0027ve \u003cstrong\u003ealways\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0had a special pull to Italy. I left for Rome with 4 suitcases, no savings, and no job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was probably the most scariest moment in my life. But I can now tell you, it was the best decision I\u0027ve ever made. I started creating videos on my channel as a way to keep friends and family close to me and my adventures here in Italy. But then I realized that this is a true passion of mine!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have found a passion in opening not only my comfort zone, but the comfort zones of others to follow their dreams and see the world as it\u0027s supposed to be seen!\u00a0If I can inspire at least one person in my life, then I know my purpose is just this. And to think you are considering being a part of my little internet family that I\u0027ve created is so heart warming and makes me keep on doing what I do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith you as a part of my Patreon family, I will be able to focus much \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0on creating inspiring content for you to enjoy. With your support, I hope to save enough to be able to move into content creation full-time and pursue my dream career! Let\u0027s do this together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarmest regards,\u003cbr\u003eSofie\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
