In 1982, he received his performing break when he was given an opportunity to do the audience warm-up at the popular situation comedy, \"Diff\u0027rent Strokes\".  He did so well that he was assigned regular warm-up duties the following season on the Ricky Schroder sitcom, \"Silver Spoons\", a position he held for two years.  Stu has also done warm-ups for \"The Jeffersons\", \"Mama\u0027s Family\", \"Amen\", and many others.  Behind the scenes, he\u0027s been the owner/operator of Shokus Video, a company dedicated to the preservation of 1950s TV shows on DVD and video tape, since 1979.  He was also the producer and director of \"The Jack La Lanne Show Commemorative Special\" home video, as well as Lucille Ball\u0027s personal film archivist for the last ten years of her life.  He produced, wrote, and directed a bonus featurette for Shout! Factory\u0027s \"Leave it to Beaver - The Complete Series\" DVD box set that starred the series\u0027 Ken Osmond and Frank Bank (Eddie and Lumpy), along with supplying a generous amount of vintage archival footage and several \"Stu\u0027s Show\" interviews for the release.  He most recently hosted an on-camera bonus video and co-produced Shout! Factory\u0027s \"Dennis the Menace Season One\" DVD set.  He also worked as a consultant on all three subsequent seasons of the series.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
