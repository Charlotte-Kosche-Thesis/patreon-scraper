    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Sarah Martin, Certified Sex Coach and budding sociologist. Welcome to the beginning of this journey, and thank you so much for being here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may have heard me talking about \u003ca href=\"http://podcast.askdrvaleria.com/e57-dating-advice-that-will-ruin-your-sex-life/\"\u003ehow bad dating advice can ruin your sex life\u003c/a\u003e, or about the extraordinary tech involved in \u003ca href=\"http://podcast.askdrvaleria.com/e21-sex-robots-are-they-the-future/\"\u003ethe development of sex robots\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://getsexsmart.com/\"\u003ehttp://getsexsmart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://sexcoachsarah.com/\"\u003ehttps://sexcoachsarah.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@SexCoachSarah\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/@SexCoachSarah\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am absolutely facinated (and often horrified) by Pick Up Artists. If you\u0027re here, too, I suspect you may feel the same. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy theory is that how we experience the social realms of dating, sex, and relationships is eerily similar to how we experience the social consequences of capitalism. I suspect that we live out much of our understanding of sex, love, and gender dynamics in the same way we live out our economic reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u0027m doing Master\u0027s degree level research, specifically a Marxian analysis of Pick Up Artist practices from some of the biggest PUA names out there. What does the dating, sex, and relationship economy look like to Roosh V, Neil Strauss, and Rollo Tomassi? Come with me on this adventure and find out! I\u0027ll tell all and save you the time involved in reading and coding their fine literary works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, let\u0027s be honest - there\u0027s something really compelling and emotionally evocative in Pick Up Artistry. Love it or hate it, you\u0027ve probably heard of it and it\u0027s probably influenced you in one way or another. So let\u0027s shed some light together on what\u0027s really going on, and come to understand not only the world of PUA celebrities, but also the ideas they put forward that influence legions of men. There\u0027s a reason they have hundreds of thousands of followers - they\u0027ve cornered the market on teaching social skills to men who struggle with them. And if it\u0027s possible to remove the more unsavory elements of what they teach, then maybe there\u0027s lessons to be learned about teaching men confidence. If we have better, happier men, we\u0027ll have a better, happier world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe support of my patrons enables me to write about this research. And, my patrons have the statisfaction of knowing that they are part of something big from the start. Thank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e"
