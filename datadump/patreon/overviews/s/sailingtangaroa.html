    "summary": "We live on our little sail boat, its a pretty basic one at that! We like the minimalistic lifestyle, being in nature and having 360 degree water frontage! (wow blessed!) Living off the ocean (we only take what we need) has become a necessity when we are sailing remote areas, basically all we need to survive is some positive vibes from our fellow patrons and to buy some seasonal vegetables and fruit, oh and maybe a beer for those magical sunsets! \u003cbr\u003ePatreon is like a tip jar, if you like our videos and you want to shout us a beer (or an apple) we would be totally grateful and stoked! You can donate how ever much per video and would help us out incredibly to keep us sailing to some of the most incredible places in Australia, and hopefully beyond.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMuch love to our fellow nomadic pirates.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHanski, \u00a0James \u0026amp; Tangaroa. \u00a0x"
