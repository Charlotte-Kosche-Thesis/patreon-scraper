    "summary": "My name is Sithu Aye and I am a guitarist and songwriter based in Scotland. My music can be broadly be described as instrumental progressive metal, but in all honestly the \u0027progressive\u0027 label just means I write whatever music I feel like. To date, I have released 3 full length albums and 5 EPs, and I am currently working on a new album. Two of those EPs may or may not be inspired by anime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast year, I took the step of going full time with my music and have lived out a long standing dream of mine to be a professional musician, continuing to write music and to go on tour. Thanks to all of your support, I have been able to do that. However, I want to take the next step and expand on what I already do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdding to the music I already create, I am going to release one to two videos per month on my YouTube channel, discussing topics ranging from music, theory, creativity and whatever ramblings I can come up with. This will be in addition to the video content that I already post on my channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor you guys, I also want to provide the opportunity to interact more closely with you all and provide you with a deeper look into how I create my music and how I work. Patrons will be able to speak with me on a monthly basis, have a deeper insight into my creative process as well even get sneak peaks of upcoming material.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny and all of your support is appreciated. Everything you guys have done so far has gotten me to this point and I\u0027m looking forward to continuing this journey will all of you alongside me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy music:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://sithuayemusic.bandcamp.com/\"\u003ehttps://sithuayemusic.bandcamp.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTabs: \u003ca href=\"http://www.sheethappenspublishing.com/catalogue/artist/Sithu-Aye\"\u003ehttp://www.sheethappenspublishing.com/catalogue/ar...\u003c/a\u003e"
