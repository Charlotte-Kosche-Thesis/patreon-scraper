I use music as a form of chaplaincy, a practice to\nhonor and transform our sacred world, and a means of sharing wisdom, healing and soul connection.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m a full-time professional musician and minister, as well as an\nindependent singer-songwriter, and I\u2019m currently juggling four music and\nministry jobs to make ends meet.  I spend\nmany hours a week with a guitar in hand \u2013 leading worship services for several\ngroups, sharing musical chaplaincy in nursing homes, care facilities and\nhospice, working with youth, or in individual rites of passage.  That doesn\u2019t leave much time for me to be\nwith my own music, to work and weave in the magical space where the songs come\nto life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon \u2013\nPatron Support\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy hope is\nthat Patreon will become a dynamic, interactive way for me to share more with\nmy supporters and fans \u2013 and for my patrons to directly support my music. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a\npatron, you\u2019ll sign up for a monthly subscription of just $5 or more.  I\u2019ll receive 95% of your subscription cost, and in return\nyou\u2019ll get unlimited access to everything I share on my Patreon platform.\u00a0You\u2019ll get to hear brand new music as I\ncreate it, hear snippets of my musical projects as they unfold, and access or download unique recordings that aren\u2019t available anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI cannot find\nwords to explain how humbling it is to play for someone who\u2019s dying, or how\nastonishing it is to hear hundreds of people singing my songs back to me, knowing\nthat my music is helping to weave our separate lives into community.  These\nmoments are only possible because of the generous financial support of a few\ndedicated souls who believed in my music \u2013 and I am so very grateful to you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy goal is\nto make the Patreon platform a way I can connect with and give back to my fans\nand supporters, as well as a way I can build financial support for my music and\nministry.
