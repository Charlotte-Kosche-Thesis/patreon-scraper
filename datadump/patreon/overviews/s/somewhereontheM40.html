Despite their efforts I lived, but I was never quite the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe kites moved into my head, at first just two of them, then more and more. I have had to write down their stories to allow space for basic speech functions, eating, sleeping, and so-on. So far their tales have been available only to a small audience of friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSomewhere on the M40\u003c/em\u003e follows the kites through arguments, adventures, and rabbit korma. Oh, and boredom; sometimes it is very boring sitting on a motorway gantry waiting for road kill to happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoving the kites onto Patreon will give me the time to do what I really want - start from the beginning again and add pictures. I see them clearly in my head, but I am a very slow and unskilled illustrator.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be able to join the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.hawk-conservancy.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHawk Conservancy\u003c/a\u003e and support their research into raptor conservation. While the resurgence in red kite numbers has been a rare conservation success story; there are still many misunderstandings about these amazing birds, and other birds of prey. They need your support too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also means that I can spend time working on telling their stories on a regular basis, rather than a rush of episodes then nothing for six months. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I can feed the cat (reader feedback has requested assurance that the cat will be fed on neither road-kill or kites, I can confirm this). So if you have read this far down, thank you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you want to act as a patron to a bunch of bickering birds, that would be awesome. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey will be dead chuffed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd in the words of one of the kites closest followers: \u0027Will it make sense now?\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, it will. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore or less.\u003cbr\u003e"

I am hoping that people will pay me to weed so that I can do the other stuff that lives in my head. There is a lot of stuff living in my head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago, I was returning from a particularly difficult meeting. I was driving down the M40 towards London, and I saw some birds. The birds were doing their level best to kill me by being more interesting than the motorway. At this point the kites were born. Or rather the birds I saw took up a roost in my head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd since then, there they have lived, in ever more complicated profusion. And if I don\u0027t write down what they do, they keep on doing it, regardless of what I want.\u00a0",
