Welcome to my Patreon Page!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis all started with a bartender/filmmaker who brought his camera to work when he started a Game of Thrones night that ended up going viral world wide! This started as a hobby. And while we\u0027re really good at drinking and watching TV, we also found out that we love creating new content to the channel as well with Watchers in the Bar and List of the Drunk Man!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I and my House Burlington homies want to take this thing to the next level. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGetting out our reactions for Game Of Thrones faster, going back and reviewing every GoT episode, creating new videos and expanding our review series, Watchers in the Bar and List of the Drunk Man, and get our Patron\u0027s in on our exclusive content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the things that struck me from doing these videos has been the profound emotional response to my regulars; insanely dedicated fans, who have since become dear friends of mine. In expanding our content and introducing them to our YouTube community, our audience has seen what I see all the time: my friends are incredibly funny, intelligent and great to hang and nerd out with. We want to continue providing this and expand special content exclusives to our Patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT YOU GET BY BEING A PATRON\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou get expanded versions of our content: exclusive behind the scenes pictures and videos of tapings and live streams at GoT Night\u0027s inside the Burlington, expanded commentary tracks from Watcher in the Bar shoots, uncut full episode reactions, and chances to hang with House Burlington online as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to bring more quality content to our fans and to do that we need capital to invest in post-production staff, equipment and helping us keep the lights on so we can start doing this full time! Your contributions will give you access to helping decide what shows to cover and where to take our original review shows and skits going into the future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWatch a terrible movie with Sam and the Gang. Request an impression from Sean. Hang and talk fashion and geekdom with Morgan and Amelia. There\u0027s a ton of opportunity that we will be opening up to give our fans access to us. The outpouring of love and support was absolutely flooring for us and we can\u0027t thank you enough for any and all contributions to the channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarm Regards,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSean Tanktop and The House Burlington Crew"
