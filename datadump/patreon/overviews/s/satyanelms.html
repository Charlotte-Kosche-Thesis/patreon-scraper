    "summary": "It has always been my dream to be a writer. I started writing before I knew how to create words, filling pages with wavy lines, and making up the stories as I went along. The characters I create and the stories I tell reflect my life\u0027s journey. I write about women, mothers, sisters, and children. I write about subtle traumas and catastrophic ones. I write about relationships and love, both the ones that hurt and the ones that heal. I write about intricacies and politics of identity and I write myself into places and spaces where I and others like me can belong.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting has been a friend, a confidante, and an outlet, but I did not always trust that I could make my dream come true. I grew up believing that living my dream of being a writer was a luxury I could not afford. I was told to trade in my creativity for practicality, and for a long time I listened. I thought myself arrogant to believe that out of all the people in the world who shared my dream, that I would somehow be among the few to actually make a life of it, but the stories inside of me wouldn\u2019t go away. So, I began to weave writing into the nooks and crannies of my life - finding spaces for writing in the midst of \u201cpracticality,\u201d but that no longer feels like enough. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to devote my days to my words, to telling stories that need to be told, and your help would allow me to do that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "In the Summer of 2014 I chose to leave my 9 to 5 and split my days between my family (with a huge chunk of that going to my toddler) and my writing. In the Fall of 2014, I went on to publish a novella, \u003cem\u003eHello Morning\u003c/em\u003e, that I\u0027d been working on the previous year. I have spent the last year and a half weaving stories into verse and prose, and it has been an amazing journey. I have learned so much, and most of the time I am proud that I made this choice for my life, but I\u0027d be lying if I said I never second guess that choice. That second guessing usually happens when I\u0027m trying to figure out how to pay a bill, or wondering how I will scrape together the funds to self-publish another book. Every donation made allows me to write with a little bit more peace of mind and I am grateful for it.\u00a0",
