    "summary": "I originally set up my You Tube channel to share motorcycle trip videos between friends and family. The channel gradually grew and i made the decision to devote most of my spare time to the channel with amazing results!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a long term motorcyclist (37yrs) with a passion for anything motorcycle related. The aim of the channels has always been to share my knowledge and experiences of this splendid pastime.\u003cbr\u003eI spend many long hours every week researching products which i believe are worthy of exposure, to assist bikers in their decisions when purchasing new equipment and accessories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs time has gone on however i have found that the channel has become a financial burden, purchasing tools and camera equipment initially didn\u0027t seem too bad but as demands for more involved videos have risen so have the costs of running the channel.\u003cbr\u003eThe last thing i want to do is stop publishing videos. I love the whole process and i value the community that has grown up around my channel. It is reaching the stage now where it is becoming a very expensive hobby, and I\u0027m not sure how much longer i can sustain the costs!\u003cbr\u003eI was advised to join Patreon in order to perhaps attract donations to assist in preserving and pushing the channel forward!\u003cbr\u003eWhether my channel attracts Patrons or not, i will continue to publish videos for as long as i can because I enjoys doing it!\u003cbr\u003eI prefer to think of Patreon as a sort of tip jar! If you appreciate my work and you want to, and can afford to do so. please leave a tip, and the money will go towards future video productions, whether to upgrade and maintain camera and video editing equipment, or to assist with other production costs.\u003cbr\u003eIf you dont want to, or are not in a position to leave tip, then dont, there is no pressure. The channel will still be there for as long as i can sustain it and everyone is welcome to watch.\u003cbr\u003eYour views are greatly appreciated either way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
