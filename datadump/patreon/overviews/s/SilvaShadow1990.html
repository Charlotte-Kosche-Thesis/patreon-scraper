    "summary": "Hello! This is actually my second time trying to explain what I currently do and what I want to continue doing in the long term portion of life! (Simply because I\u0027ve already typed all this and then my computer didn\u0027t save any of the message I tried to deliver to everybody lol) I simply create video gaming content whether that may be;\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eVideo game playthroughs, in depth or non in depth, also commonly know as let\u0027s plays;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStreams of either Speed Runs of my favorite retro games such as Kirby Super Star for SNES, or Streams involving the friends/family gaming community that I grew up with and continue to grow with as a whole, just to show everyone that I want everybody to have fun with doing what they love doing;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRandom unboxings of Gaming related things (That may pertain to better gaming equipment to carry out this task easier, or something small like an Amiibo or \u00a0a video game!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eIn short I have only a few goals in life I want to achieve (though they aren\u0027t small time goals I might add) That is to say, firstly, I want to show my mother that her oldest of 4 boys (26 at the time of typing this and soon to be 27!) simply wants to have fun with doing something I\u0027ve been doing since I was 3 and picked up my first controller and started playing Super Mario World, my very first video game, (to which I still own to this day as well as the system itself!!) and can help manage paying bills such as\u00a0utilities\u00a0and\u00a0rent by simply having fun\u00a0fulfilling\u00a0my passion as a gamer with other gamers that feel the same as I do. The second of my dreams/goals in life is to first, gain 10k Subscribers (At 5600+ subs at the moment of this super long passage lol), or followers on YouTube where most of the content I create with others takes place, and \u00a0ultimately gain 100k Subscribers! With anybody and/or everybody\u0027s help, I can do these things and more such as upgrade the equipment to record and/or stream, as well as continuing to live with a roof over my head. The third and possibly last dream/goal of mine, is simply to just travel to go see those that I have fun with or take my friends/family places and simply enjoy whatever time we me have on this rock we call Earth. (Keywords being possibly last dream/goal since you never know what the future holds, hint hint ;) Out of all my friends and family, I seem to be the only one that can take on this blessing as well an amazing \u0027curse\u0027 as I can and will never stop gaming and simply just want to have fun with the new and old people out there to meet in the world, as best as I possibly can! (If you\u0027ve read this far, I hugely thank you as sometimes I do not know how to convey my words with people, not to mention commend myself for 1; typing such a description that almost seems like an old high school research paper lol, and 2; for reading along with you, the viewer/contributor/supporter/friend/etc as again this is very, very long LOL) In due time, this should and would be updated to not be as long and make better meaning of what I\u0027m trying to convey to whoever may read this. Contributors will not go unnoticed and get a very huge thanks from my family as well as yours truly, and get special mentions, and will be able to perform in certain projects that I may/could be working on. (This doesn\u0027t mean to just simply donate/contribute as I\u0027m not forcing or ENforcing anybody to do this, this is just to explain that if anyone does contribute, it\u0027s greatly appreciated and my family and I forever be in your debt for your good cause and\u00a0assistance\u00a0to help with a good\u00a0cause) d(\u0027u \u0027d)"
