    "summary": "I began to scuba dive at age 11, and by the time I was 14 years old, the sharks I knew and loved and grew up with since the age of 12 had been stripped from the Great Barrier Reef and reduced to a mere few at the hands of unjustified harvesting inside the marine park by commercial gill net vessels approved by the Australian government. I learnt very quickly how easily change can occur, and how conservation was not an option for me, but a necessity, and an obligation to the creatures and the oceans I love\u2026 but to be a child who wants to make a difference is not easy, and I needed a way to be heard, this is when I started to make films.\u003cbr\u003eMy films are the medium is use, to spark that desire in people, and rid the fear for creatures like sharks that prevents them form doing so, to shed light on injustice and to share what I love with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "My life is anything but ordinary, it is based on the beliefs I have held since I was a child, the belief that the natural world is the real world, and when injustice becomes law, law destroying our oceans and our future, then resistance becomes duty.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Madison Stewart, to my friends \u2018pip\u2019 (dads a pirate, mums a hippy, and so I became \u2018pippy\u2019) but probably now known better as \u2018shark girl\u2019. I began scuba diving at age 12, left school at age 14 to begin home schooling and picked up an underwater camera for the first time. I have always grown up in the oceans, living on a yacht form the age of two and then growing up on the water in Australia\u2019s Gold Coast. At 12 years old I was a certified open water diver. \u003cbr\u003eI left school to start home schooling at age 14 and in an agreement with my father I traded my school fees for an underwater video system, a simple tape camera in a housing. From that point on, the sharks, the Great Barrier Reef, and the oceans worldwide became my normality, my classroom and my home.\u003cbr\u003eI left school with the intension shared with my father to travel the world and dive its oceans, I had no idea at the time that I would be changing my priorities. I can pinpoint the moment of change in my life to one dive. I had entered the water on a night dive with only two years in-between my last visit. This was a place in the past I had the closest encounter with sharks, they would hunt in the floodlights from the boats, and it was often just my father and myself surrounded by up to 40 sharks. This was the stuff dreams were made of, this was my place, to this day I have never felt safer or more at home than in those waters surrounded by sharks. When I returned to this reef only a year later, I saw one shark, too scared to come close to the boat. They were gone. This was my call to action, the most significant dive of my life, the moment that created the transition from spectator to participant.\u003cbr\u003eMy video camera then took on a whole new meaning, I was no longer filming for myself and family, I was now filming for my future. My underwater camera is my medium in the movement for my generations claim over the natural world and rebellion against its destruction. I use films as a way of lighting the darkness surrounding the injustices occurring in our waters, and at a young age with a burning passion for sharks, I fell into the world of filmmaking. In a time I would have otherwise remained silent, filmmaking gave me a voice. \u003cbr\u003eI am not just trying to raise awareness, but I am also facing the task of sparking respect and love for a creature demonized since it was first depicted in the media. I need people to feel the same way about sharks that I do, so they can feel the same pain I do in the face of their destruction. \u003cbr\u003e",
