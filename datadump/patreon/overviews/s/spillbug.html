I\u0027m Spillbug. You can call me Logan if you want. I make fine art, usually on Masonite using latex paints mixed with plaster or glue. I\u0027m 22 years old; based in New York City where I graduated the School of Visual Arts last year with a BFA in Illustration. Found out I hate illustration (I can do it though, check out my tumblr if you want to check out my horror fan-art and other more illustrative stuff!) but I found out I love painting and met some cool people that inspired me to start taking it seriously. I\u0027ve shown in group shows at various galleries while I was in school and after I graduated, including the Van Der Plas gallery in the Lower East Side and the CreativeBloch Gallery in DUMBO, and I became a part of the CreativeBloch Artists Collective.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve made incredible progress this year creatively and in terms of career growth. Ive met incredible people and gained confidence and experience selling my work, getting shows, and keeping a consistent output of artwork.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Paintings:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s nothing I can say about the paintings. I feel like if you look at it, and you like looking at it, you probably understand it enough. When I paint there\u0027s nothing except what\u0027s happening when I look at the thing where the paint goes. I have a vague idea of what I want, I sketch it out for 30 minutes or so and then start the thing. I\u0027m one of those artists that paint that way. For inspiration\u00a0 I mainly look at Philip Guston, Francis Bacon, and Andy Warhol; all those guys right on the edge of where the modern became the postmodern. But they really just tell you not to listen to anybody, so when I paint I let my mind go blank, and their influence just kinda works through me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Other Stuff\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe fan-art and other horror stuff that I put on my tumblr is also very important to me. My ambition with this work to try and make illustration and comic art that is so flippin\u0027 scary that if you see it as\u00a0 a kid it will give you nightmares and you\u0027ll flash back to it as an adult and wonder if it was real and then see it and get scared all over again. I don\u0027t have a ton of time to work on this ambition because I\u0027m so gosh darn busy right now, but that\u0027s the idea. I think I wanna be the next Junji Ito or Stephen Gammell. Or Scott Cawthon. Might as well aim high! Eventually I want to make scary comics and graphic novels as well! (If you check out my main website, www.spillbug.net, you can check out my embryonic not-graphic novel What:2:Do! It\u0027s bad. Not to mention really ambitious. It\u0027s project that I have to put on hold until I can get stabilized in life.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMain Goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eProduce a series of paintings(5-12 paintings) every other month\u003cbr\u003eProduce several horror illustrations a month (2-10 posted to my Tumblr)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eConsistently show paintings in Manhattan/Brooklyn/Queens\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d also like to eat food and pay rent.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUm.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHEY! If you like my art, and you want to support me and help to keep me going, I like, can\u0027t even express how much that would mean to me. Right now I can\u0027t afford frames, and that\u0027s kinda stressful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just try\u0027na make it work!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading! ^.^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
