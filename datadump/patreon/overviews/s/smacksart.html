I\u0027m Smack, and I\u0027m a 19 years old digital artist.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eDigital artist huh? That\u0027s a bit vague, isn\u0027t it? Well here\u0027s what I do.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI mostly draw characters and scenes from iconic movies or video games, but I try to expand my boundaries as an artist as much as I can by trying different art styles and subjects. I\u0027m a big science-fiction lover, but I also really like historic stuff as well as space itself. To sum it up, I\u0027m basically a really geeky artist!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m also studying to become a graphic designer, so I love working on the more \u0027\u0027technical\u0027\u0027 side of art. I especially love to do album illustrations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLast, I also love to write and draw comics. Some can be totally crude, ridiculous and relatable, while other projects can be more serious and based on adventures and stuff like that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSo after all this, you might still wonder why I\u0027m creating a Patreon. \u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell it\u0027s simple! I\u0027m a student right now, and I have to work to pay my bills and other adult stuff. If my art could help me buy my groceries and Wi-Fi, I\u0027d be eternally grateful. That\u0027s why I have a Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo if you like my work and have a little extra money to waste, why not waste it on me? I draw stuff. That\u0027s cool right?!\u003cbr\u003e"
