    "summary": "We at Superstars S.E.G. are a group of three coworkers who are quite fond of our jobs, all the interesting people we get to interact with, and the fun experiences we get from our work. But the truth is we\u0027re not really all that sane. And frankly, as anyone who\u0027s worked retail can attest, neither is our work environment! But rather than just embracing all this insanity, we decided to actually share it! We pooled our imaginations, skills, knowledge, and decades of aggregate customer service experience to create our web comic, \u003ca href=\"http://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/superstar-inc/list?title_no=126301\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSUPERSTAR! Inc\u003c/a\u003e, which we are making available for free on Line Webtoon. Honestly, we\u0027re quite fond of our work for several reasons and on several levels, and would love to give it the time and resources we feel it so richly deserves. Alas, we all have bills to pay, real jobs we have to work to pay them, and your usual assortment of other commitments. That leaves us precious little time to work on our comic, and limits what we can put out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s where you come in! By supporting us here on Patreon, you provide monthly pledges that will help us make our dreams a reality by allowing us to devote time and money we otherwise wouldn\u0027t have towards making this comic the best it can be. The more support we get, the more things we can do and the more time we can spend developing and editing content rather than earning our pay the easy way. Again, our work means we have a near-endless supply of ideas here, but we really can\u0027t do what we want with them without your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you\u0027re interested in helping us (or just want us to crank out more material), feel free to select an amount you\u0027d like to provide us each month. We\u0027ll show our thanks by giving you access to our official Patron-only feed through this page. This will provide early postings, news, opinions, and an assortment of other goodies based on the tier you choose. As we grow, the benefits and content will improve as well. So come on in and join us in this awesome new adventure!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks in advance!\u003cbr\u003e"
