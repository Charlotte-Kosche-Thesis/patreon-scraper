Beginning with a scene that was inspired by a few words from the lyrics of a sappy J-pop song, we quickly went from creating something that was just awesome fun, to something so amazingly important to us. As these guys stepped forward to reveal themselves and their stories, we began to love each one of them fiercely. Their world is our world now, and we \u003cem\u003eneed\u003c/em\u003e to tell their stories. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell over 275,000 words have been written so far! Years worth of pages... It\u0027s exciting to think about, and yet, it only makes us want to get deeper into their stories - sooner. So much work goes into keeping CRUSH! updating, and we could really use your help. And it would make us so amazingly happy to be updating three pages a week once again.

We\u0027d like to reward our loyal readers by rubbing off the window glass a bit, giving  a little wider view into their lives. Because, hey, we\u0027ve got YEARS worth of little secrets!
