Compounded the hurdle is 80% of the world\u2019s 70 million deaf people do not have access to a quality education - which impacts their literacy skills - and it creates a culture of isolation for many; and this is what I seek to change. Imagine if your travel brand could reach out to the 70 million strong Deaf consumers - imagine if you could make them lifelong customers, by making online contents accessible to them in a language they can appreciate - sign language. This is where I can help you increase your brand awareness within the Deaf community by providing that very online contents in their native sign language! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI showcase all contents in both visual and written formats - this is to make certain all information is readily accessible to everyone, regardless of whether they are Deaf or hearing! Captions and transcripts are provided to those who wish to read, instead of hear, and all contents are signed visually by me. This creates a positive culture of complete accessibility for all the followers of Seek the World!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAdditionally, I also aim to empower and inspire our present and future Deaf generations that they can truly do anything they aspire to; by educating them about the world through our visual contents! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nBut I cannot do this alone. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need YOUR help. I am starting this Patreon page to help us achieve a small amount of financial stability and to expand our team to include other creative talent as well as provide them with better equipment so that I can produce more free high-quality contents on a more consistent basis for you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support will enable me to hire talented creatives as well as upgrade and expand our equipment, and to offset the costs of travel to deliver you, the viewer, quality information and resources from around the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSeek the World - Exclusive Access (Facebook Secret Group) Benefits:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWatch extreme videos that won\u2019t be posted on public Facebook Page\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAsk questions in group posts and get answers from Calvin and other members\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFew extra sign language videos all year.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAn opportunity to question some Deaf locals via live video sometimes\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
