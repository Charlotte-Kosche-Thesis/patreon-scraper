This is\nwhere you can help support me in doing just that.  Every week I create\ninstructional videos that help people bring a little more country life to their\ncity lot by teaching them how to grow their own livestock and vegetables.\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreaon is a little new to me but basically how\nit works is that it is a way for you to financially support me for each piece\nof valuable content I produce.  That would be my weekly videos on how to\ngrow quail, rabbits, and vegetables.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo me it sounds like a win win situation.\n I already provide a ton of valuable content every week and interact with\nviewers on my Facebook page but it is getting to a point now that it is\ndifficult to keep up with.  By supporting me financially you are helping\nto make this possible (I have to pay the bills to keep it all going).  And\nyou get to determine how valuable you think my content is (or how much you can\nafford to support it).  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u0026#8217;s the bottom\nline?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.slightlyrednecked.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Bottom-Line.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI publish about 8 instructional videos a month\n(4 quail related videos and 4 rabbit related videos).  When I post those\nvideos on the SlightlyRednecked YouTube page I will also share them here as\nsupportable content and that determines what your total support for the month\nwill be.  It\u0026#8217;s pretty simple really.  If you pledge $1 per\ninstructional video and I posted 8 videos that month it would be a total of $8\nto support me for that month.\u0026lt;/h5\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if finances are tough and you just can\u0027t spend that much?\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eI know how that feels and that\u0027s perfectly fine.\n You can still pledge $1 per video but set a cap at a total of $4 for the\nmonth.

If you are\nstruggling financially please don\u0027t contribute.  My goal is to help my\nviewers to do for themselves and save money doing it.  I believe that I\nprovide a valuable service but it wouldn\u0027t make sense for me to put a financial\nstrain on any of my viewers.  And don\u0027t worry, you will still have access\nto all of my great YouTube content and can start supporting when you are in a\nbetter position financially.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e \u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I asking for money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.slightlyrednecked.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asking-for-Money.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust like everyone else, I have bills to\npay.
