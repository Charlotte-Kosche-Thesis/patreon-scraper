I work at a local organic vegetable farm \nas their photographer and create various other types of images including abstract, travel, and nature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love art and podcasts as much as I do you will appreciate what I am attempting to do. And if you are an artist trying to navigate the balance between creative fulfillment, self promotion, and making a living, the knowledge I am pursuing might be of help to you. My hunger to learn and connect also drives the motivation behind the Austin Art Talk Podcast. The goal is to interview as many artists and gallery owners as possible. I\u0027ll dig into what they have figured out, what they are all about, and what we can learn from their journey in the world of art and creativity. The podcast was launched in Oct. 2017 and there will be at least one interview posted every week on Saturday morning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehttp://www.austinarttalk.com/\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2018 my plans are to launch another podcast, The Texas Naturalist, following my recent graduation from the Texas Master Naturalist program. I\u0027ve got a keen interest in natural history, regenerative agriculture, herbalism, primitive skills, sustainable living, and homesteading, all of which I have been studying in recent years. As with the art podcast, what makes sense to me is to seek out the experts and those with knowledge and experience in order to see what I can learn from them and share that information with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support to help me make and create a life of humble curiosity and life long learning and skill building would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
