I went to college for about a year and while I showed strong potential in my field of study (animation) I had a lot of issues affording it. I ended up having to drop out unfortunately and I am trying to get back into college. All I need is a little help with the cost which is why I am making this page. I have a pretty good grasp at the human form and coloring however there are areas I still need work on such as backgrounds but I am going to give it my all. I know I have what it takes to make it in the art world I just need a little push to get me there. I don\u0027t have a lot I can offer regarding rewards right now but I\u0027m trying to figure out what I can produce.\u003cbr\u003e"

I have a fairly decent grasp of how the human form works however I do still need a lot of work. I want to be able to advance my skills but I don\u0027t live around many artists to work off of and learn from and I am unfortunately not in school at the moment. I dream of being able to express stories through multiple mediums such as animation, illustration, and video games but that does take education. My goal is to get back into school soon and be able to afford to stay in there until I can graduate instead of having to drop out due to financial issues again. I am pretty skilled and I did do very well in school it\u0027s just the cost. I love what I do and I hope you do too!\u003cbr\u003e",
