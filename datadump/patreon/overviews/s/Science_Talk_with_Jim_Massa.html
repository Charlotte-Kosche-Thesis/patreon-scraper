    "summary": "Hello, and thank you for coming to my page. My name is Jim Massa. I am a trained scientist with a background in oceanography. I worked in climate change research in the arctic for a number of years. I am also an educator with experience teaching science and math from middle school to undergraduate levels.\u003cbr\u003eI created this page called Science Talk with Jim Massa to discuss the latest in scientific research. My goal is to present the findings of the latest research in a way that is understandable to the general public. I will also discuss what the implications of the findings may be. Whenever necessary, I will take time to explain any underlying concepts pertinent to the topic being discussed. There will be topics that I will continually discuss with you. Topics such as climate change, evolution, astronomy, astrophysics, oceanography, ecology, environmental science, paleontology and many other topics.\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, from time to time, I will talk about a prominent scientist and their contributions to our understanding of the natural world. I will also discuss topics explaining the concepts and principles for it has been my observation that there are many misconceptions out there about certain scientific principles.\u003cbr\u003eIt is my hope that by combining my experiences as a scientist and an educator, that you will find my videos enjoyable, interesting, informative and understandable. As I get up to speed, I anticipate making several videos a week. If there is a topic that you would like to see me talk about, please feel free to tell me.\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting my page. Let\u0027\u0027s now talk science!\u003cbr\u003eKind regards,\u003cbr\u003eJim\u003cbr\u003eScience Talk with Jim Massa\u003cbr\u003e"
