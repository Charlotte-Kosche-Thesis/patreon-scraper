    "summary": "SIFTD is a gaming website from veteran games journalist Shane Satterfield. He used to work at GameSpot, TechTV, G4, and most recently, he was the Editor in Chief and Supervising Producer of GameTrailers for seven years. Shane has been one of the pioneers in video content creation for games for almost two decades and he\u0027s been hard at work on SIFTD for the past two years where the content mantra is, \"If we can\u0027t do it differently, we won\u0027t do it.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome a patron to SIFTD to get early access to bleeding edge content and join its community of adult gamers who are extremely passionate about games, but it express it without being toxic. As a bonus, SIFTD also gathers the best gaming content from websites, YouTubers, and streams and then delivers you a custom content feed based on your tastes that\u0027s sortable by over 60 different categories. It\u0027s a huge time-saver.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSIFTD has been in operation since June 2015 and had previously operated with a rigid subscription model. With this move to Patreon we have a rock bottom Goal to meet to remain operational and higher Goals after that to create new shows and produce more of the ones we currently have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaintain Operations:\u003c/strong\u003e $6000 Per Month\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideo Game Evals:\u003c/strong\u003e $10,000 Per Month\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Studio:\u003c/strong\u003e $14,000 Per Month\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStand Up Up Down Down:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0$16,000 Per Month\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFull Time Staffer:\u003c/strong\u003e $25,000 Per Month\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some examples of the shows we\u0027re currently producing. With your generous pledge we\u0027d like to create these more frequently in addition to adding any new shows listed in our Goals.

GameFace tackles all the big news and games from each week and doesn\u0027t shy away from controversial topics or heated discussion. It\u0027s also full of gameplay/B-roll and professional camera cuts, which is something most gaming podcasts today lack. With your pledge we hope to transform the show into something even better. Patrons have access to an MP3/podcast version to take on the go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GeIeqj_TL5c\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePachter Factor\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re an old fan of GameTrailers, or just follow video games closely, then you likely know Michael Pachter. He\u0027s one of the industry\u0027s most prominent financial analysts and every week he answers your questions related to the business of video games. Patrons get the show a weekly early, have priority in asking questions for the show, and have access to an MP3/podcast version.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fNa_EBHAYJc\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGIFE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s no other gaming show quite like GIFE. A convergence of gaming and culture, it\u0027s a personal editorial outlet for site founder Shane Satterfield that tackles more granular topics. It\u0027s also a strange trip through the weird and wacky and a way to discover under-the-radar games that have unique concepts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O7n5dTDWHoE\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShane\u0027s Addiction\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIgnore the play on words, this show is not about indie bands from the \u002790s.

Most importantly, using a simple interface you tell us which categories you care most about and the site delivers you a one-of-a-kind, customized Game Eval score based upon your tastes. When SIFTD first launched we created video Evals, but we lacked the revenue to continue doing them. So currently, we only create text-based Evals. If we hit the Goal we\u0027d love to start producing video versions again with a new graphics package.
