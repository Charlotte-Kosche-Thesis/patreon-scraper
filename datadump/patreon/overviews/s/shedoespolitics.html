    "summary": "Hello! Welcome to my Patreon!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m Tahmyrah Lytle, and I\u0027m a passionate grassroots community organizer and freelance graphic designer located in Mason City, Iowa. I\u0027ve always felt strongly about social justice, but after seeing the results of the 2016 Presidential race I could no longer sit quietly. Less than 2 weeks after the election I founded progressive community action group \u0027\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Where-Do-We-Go-From-Here-207628189680452/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhere Do We Go From Here?\u003c/a\u003e\u0027 We hold biweekly meetings, organize local town halls and gubernatorial candidate forums, phone bank, rally and protest, and host fundraisers to advocate progressive values. In addition to this, I\u00a0also serve as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CGyouthDEMS/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyouth coordinator\u003c/a\u003e and social media manager for the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CGDCommittee/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCerro Gordo County Democrats\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0and run a regional events page called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mcmillennial/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe MC Millennial\u003c/a\u003e. I also do graphic design for free or cheap to benefit nonprofits, fundraisers, political campaigns/initiatives, and other causes I believe in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy passion in life is grassroots activism (and gardening...but that\u0027s beside the point!). I hope to create a movement geared towards empowering people with the knowledge and skills necessary to fight and win against selfish political agendas, as well as promote sustainability through community improvement projects. However, I have found in my organizing that effective outreach requires a full-time commitment and things like a capable laptop, graphic design software, a quality camera, an excessive budget for travel, money for printing costs and postage, a snack budget (because any good organizer knows folks come when there is food) etc. That\u0027s why I\u0027m trying Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe ultimate goal is to be able to organize full-time, with enough money to cover those essentials and be able to comfortably pay my bills! This Patreon will allow me to focus on and prioritize non-profit work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJoin me in making a difference by supporting my grassroots work. Every pledge is important!\u003cbr\u003e"
