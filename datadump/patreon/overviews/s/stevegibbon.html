    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello, Planet Earth. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Steve Gibbon, and my favorite thing to do is think about fictional people and imagine them in their weird little made up lives. Some people do\n this and get their brains electrocuted, but when I do it, a lot of people call it art and give me high-fives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis art usually \ntakes one of two forms: writing or game-making. But at a certain point,\n I hit a crossroads and had to choose--do I go to school for writing, or\n do I go to school for game-making? I chose the former and obtained \nmy MFA in fiction and poetry, and I don\u0027t regret it for a second, but the \nconsequence is that I am one house-sized loan in the negative and have \nvirtually no capacity for programming, which is, as it turns out, how video games are made. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it also happens, \ngetting an MFA doesn\u0027t lead to lucrative tech jobs in Silicon valley, so\n I got a job at a library halfway across the state (where I can\u0027t afford to live) and have been busying\n myself with the task of living a life and paying the bills, and the \nyearning to create has been stifled (as it so often is) by the \nnecessities of everyday living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what does it matter to you? Well, the reason many of you are probably here is because you have either read my stories or heard me read, or you\u0027ve played \u003ca href=\"http://drunkenpaladin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTales of the Drunken Paladin\u003c/a\u003e, a game I developed in college and gave away for free. Or, maybe you\u0027ve played the tabletop games I\u0027ve made. And hopefully you\u0027ve thought, \u003cem\u003ethis is a pretty good thing. I could do with more of this thing\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd\n I\u0027m trying to make more of that thing for you! I\u0027m quite far along in a\n new game project, and I\u0027m \ntrying to write a novel--I \u003cem\u003eam\u003c/em\u003e writing a novel, nearly 60,000 \nslow, grueling words of it so far--and I\u0027m trying to do so many more things, create \nmore characters, all of whom require worlds to inhabit, and the worlds \nwon\u0027t build themselves. I am working to make it all happen, but with a job and a demanding little dog and a marriage and everything I own needing \u003cem\u003ejust a little bit of work\u003c/em\u003e, the going is slow and occasionally halted altogether.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s important to stress that it will all happen either way. I\u0027ll \u003cem\u003edo it\u003c/em\u003e.\n I will make the games and write the novels because I need to, but what I gain from having a\n Patreon will make trying to create so, so much less painful. Even if I fail to reach any goals and never make enough to feasibly change my lifestyle, just knowing that someone out there wants to help me keep creating can make a big difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want a concrete list of my creative goals in the near future, have a gander at this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Finish my new game\u003cbr\u003e2. Finish my novel\u003cbr\u003e3. Publish a collection of my short stories\u003cbr\u003e4. Publish a collection of my poetry\u003cbr\u003e5. Publish the tabletop games I\u0027ve been working on for over ten years\u003cbr\u003e6. Continue doing all of the things on this list until I die\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a patron means getting first looks at what I\u0027m working on, who I\u0027m working with, and how far along I am. I\u0027ll be sharing my work in all its different forms. There will be demos, trials or manuscript samples as they come together. I\u0027m looking forward to showing off all the stuff I\u0027ve been working on!\u003cbr\u003e"
