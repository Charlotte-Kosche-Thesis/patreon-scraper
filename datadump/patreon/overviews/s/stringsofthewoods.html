My name is Justin Woods and I hope that I can share my hopes and dreams with all those who take part in my music and art!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eLet me give you a bit of my background! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI came from the deserts of Palm Springs with big dreams of writing music and being a part of the video game industry. I received my degree in music from the Claremont Colleges with a focus on composition. I studied music theory and composition as well as piano and classical/flamenco guitar. Post graduation, I became a music teacher at a charter school in Los Angeles. You can actually see a few examples of my students\u0027 work on my youtube page! After spending three years in Japan, I\u0027m back in Los Angeles and taking my music career head-on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eNow, for my goals! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe big one: I want to become a composer for the video game industry. It has been a dream of mine to be able to contribute to such an evolving art form. I want to use my education and passion to create music that will hold a place in the hearts of players for years to come. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhat do I do? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently write original (usually orchestral) music in order to fill my portfolio with impressionable examples of my musical style. I also love to make video game arrangements for guitar and display them on my YouTube page. If you are a fan of older video games, you may find some of your favorite tunes on my channel! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support the Woods?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides being a tangible supporter of my artistic growth, becoming a supporter would help give me a leg up on producing quality content. The financial backing will allow for higher quality equipment, programs and faster rates of production. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBetter microphones = better sound.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eBetter editing software = more interesting videos! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eSeeing the names of those who truly love my music enough to become a supporter will make my heart swell with excitement and fuel my drive to constantly create art! I want to make you a part of the process and feel like you, too, are creating music with me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I have to offer?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing quite new to Patreon, I am unsure of the type of feedback that supporters would like. I can send personalized audio files, take special requests, commissions, or anything else I can think of! I can also offer insight to my compositional process and the progress of each of my works. Feel free to help me out by letting me know what you would like to receive in return for supporting my musical production!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy current portfolio!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProfessional Site: \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.stringsofthewoods.com\"\u003ewww.stringsofthewoods.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube Channel:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/StringsoftheWoods\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/StringsoftheWoods\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSoundcloud Original Compositions:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/justin-woods-1/sets/original-compositions-1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/justin-woods-1/sets/origina...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSoundcloud Video Game Arrangements:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/justin-woods-1/sets/video-game-arrangements\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/justin-woods-1/sets/video-g...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoundcloud Voice Acting:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/justin-woods-1/sets/voice-acting\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/justin-woods-1/sets/voice-a...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
