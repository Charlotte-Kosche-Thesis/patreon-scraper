    "summary": "I\u0027m so excited to finally roll this out. Let me introduce myself, My name is Anthony Thogmartin. I\u0027ve spent over a decade performing with Ableton Live on stage and after all that time I realized I have so much to share with my community! Playing with my band \u003cstrong\u003ePapadosio\u003c/strong\u003e or my solo project \u003cstrong\u003eEarthCry\u003c/strong\u003e presented me with many hurdles and problems to solve. I\u0027ve found that most people give up and simply press play on stage. It doesn\u0027t have to be that way! \u003cstrong\u003ePerforming live on stage is potentially the greatest joy I\u0027ve experienced.\u003c/strong\u003e I want everyone to share in the fun and excitement. I created a Youtube Channel called \u003cstrong\u003eSeed to Stage \u003c/strong\u003eto pass on what I have learned in the hopes that more and more musicians can create innovative, dynamic, and engaging live shows without the frustration and ages spent trying to figure it all out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is your dream setup?\u003c/strong\u003e Are you a producer who wants to add performance elements to your show? Are you in a band and want to synchronize Ableton Live with your bandmates? Are you a live looping artist who wants a more accurate and reliable timing system with better effects? Perhaps you don\u0027t even use software but you would like music \"industry\" advice that will eventually lead to getting you on stage. Whatever the need, I am offering direct help for you and your craft! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have many pursuits pulling me in different directions but my heart tells me that I should be helping here. I am very busy and It would be more financially lucrative for me to be doing other things, and that Is why this\u003cstrong\u003e Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e page exists. I can spend more and more of my time here as this thing grows. Thanks for the consideration and blessings on your musical journey!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
