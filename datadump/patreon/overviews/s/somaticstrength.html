    "summary": "I have been blogging for about four years now, and my writing deals with the intersections of being a survivor of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse and growing up in a fundamentalist, conservative Christian family. I am also the moderator behind You Know You are a Survivor When, a tumblr where survivors can vent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have also spent the better part of two years now working on a survivor book (currently tentatively titled \u003cem\u003eThe Improper Survivor Guide\u003c/em\u003e) a book told in short episodic pieces, about my own experiences as a survivor, and my personal ways of dealing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe support of others would help me be able to continue to generate content, as these things are massively time-consuming and emotionally taxing. Sometimes it is a struggle to find the means to keep producing content, and others\u0027 support would be invaluable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt would also help fund the costs of a survivor zine I am looking to create. This zine will be about and from survivors -- a place for all survivors of sexual, physical, emotional and mental abuse to submit articles about their own experiences and perspective. I want to provide a place for \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0survivors of abuse to communicate. I want to help facilitate a community where there is not a one-size-fits all attitude towards trauma, coping, healing, and recovery, but rather a place where the diversity of our experiences and perspectives are validated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven the smallest amount could help make producing all my content for survivors that much easier. You get to set the denomination per month -- as low as a dollar -- to help contribute to my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSurvivors of abuse are important to me. I know patreon allows creators to provide rewards to their patrons, but since I am personally aware of how poverty is a big part of many survivors lives, any reward I could possibly offer to my readership simply feels like restricting content to others who might need it. My hope is that those who have the means and desire to support would help my ability to make all content available to survivors who may be restricted financially.\u003cbr\u003e"
