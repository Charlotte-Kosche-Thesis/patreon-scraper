Here\u0027s a little bit about me and my focus.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/15369726\"\u003eStart here\u003c/a\u003e if you want to get straight to the reading.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a writer with a passion for psychological and supernatural thrillers.\u00a0When I am not writing, I am working, reading, and working out. I love adventure and believe I was born to be a real-life GM (game-master for those of you new to the acronym). However, since I am not wealthy enough to run games on willing yet unsuspecting participants, I resort to writing exciting stories full of intrigue, politics, and dark psychological twists.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to write a five book supernatural thriller series that explores the question of: What if this world really is four-dimensional chess for the souls of mankind?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, So Why Supernatural Thrillers?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreat question\u003cstrong\u003e. \u003c/strong\u003eI love exploring spiritual realism in stories.\u00a0For me, spiritual realism is \u003cem\u003eincorporating fantastical spiritual and faith elements into otherwise realistic fiction\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy series deals with faith, God and Satan, spiritual gifts, and elements of demonic oppression and possession. However, this is not a series that will end up on a religious shelf somewhere. It is not sanitized. My characters swear and have sex and celebrate victories over other humans in raw and selfish ways. Though my story favors Christian elements, I am not promoting a particular faith or religious agenda. However, I always feel like faith (or lack thereof) is part of the fabric that defines most humans and their outlook on life, how they handle conflict, relationships, politics, guilt, fear, and how they justify actions, good and bad.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love for you to join me as I examine these characteristics through the narrative of a religious-political war that spans generations and asks what would happen if Satan could edit human history by using a servant of God not entirely bound by time.
