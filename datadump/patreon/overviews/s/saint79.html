    "summary": "Hi everyone. Saint here. Thanks for coming to my Patreon page. I had a commenter on a story I wrote on Literotica suggest that I start up a Patreon page for my story that\u0027s currently publishing on the site. It\u0027s called \u003cu\u003eMaster and the Maid\u003c/u\u003e\u00a0if you haven\u0027t read it yet. With help from patrons, like yourself, I can spend more time on writing and get quicker edits on the chapters for quicker postings. Also, contributors will get access to the chapters before they are published on Literotica (takes about 3-4 from submission for them to publish on the site). I have plans on adding other goodies as time allows and, if all goes well, I\u0027ll be able to start having live streams of ideas/suggestions as well as an artist to do sketches of characters and concepts for patrons as well. Thanks again!"
