     "about": "\u003cstrong\u003eIf you ask me...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am beginning to believe that we are all born asleep and that the rest of our lives are spent trying to awaken. Some of us may be born awake... some awaken in stages, falling back into slumber between moments of absolute lucidity... while some remain comfortably dozing all their lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShould we even want to be awakened? Or should we remain comfortably snoozing and not even bother asking why? I don\u0027t know the answer to that. Nor do I know if we have a choice in the matter. What I do suspect is that some of the answers might be found within something called \"intuition.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Intuition is a combination of historical (empirical) data, deep and heightened observation, and an ability to cut through the thickness of surface reality. Intuition is like a slow motion machine that captures data instantaneously and hits you like a ton of bricks. Intuition is a knowing, a sensing that is beyond the conscious understanding -- a gut feeling. Intuition is not pseudo-science.\" -- Abella Arthur\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I bring up intuition is that from an early age I gravitated to whatever mysteriously resonated for me. Creating things, playing with sound, doodling, etc. Always compelled to make something that wasn\u0027t there before... or giving in to a simple creative yearning I suppose. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day, my mother brought home a 35mm camera. I looked at it and had this feeling at my core that I can\u0027t explain, but I feel like that was likely my first strong encounter that has become a lifelong dance with intuition. I just held the camera and knew I must learn how to use it. It was an instantaneous knowing of sorts. From then on I was intently focussed on examining the perceived world from every angle I could find. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe further I explored in distance and or detail, the more I discovered how utterly enchanting our shared universe is. From every difference in color, texture, and line, I began to understand more fully the infinite possibilities of form. Intuition has led me through 17 countries thus far, and counting. The further I explore, the more I realize how much of this incredible beauty is perpetually unfolding around us and also simultaneously within. When I share these images with others and learn they\u0027ve also resonated with them in some mysterious way as well, it proves my suspicion that all is indeed one and everything is defined by a difference in sacred frequency vibration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSkip Hunt, born on the wind-swept plains of Oklahoma, is a professional photographer in Austin, Texas. He picked up a 35mm camera in the mid-1970\u0027s and has never stopped sharing his unique vision via photographic images. Many moons ago, he was bitten hard by the wanderlust beast and has been canvassing the globe ever since. Visionary artists such as Pete Turner, David Lynch, Cindy Sherman, and Andre Kertesz set Skip\u0027s sight on a fine-art horizon early on. His insatiable thirst for rich color and even richer cultural exploration keeps him on the road most of the time. When he\u0027s recharging his batteries, he calls Austin, Texas home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Image making reminds me to awaken from the slumber and to celebrate life\u0027s rich pageantry parading all around us.\" \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-- Skip Hunt",
