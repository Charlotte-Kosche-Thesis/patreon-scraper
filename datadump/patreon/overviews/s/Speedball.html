Mystery, comedy, drama, science fiction, \u003cem\u003ecopious\u003c/em\u003e transformations, imaginative solutions to unusual problems, it\u0027s all there. My comic has it all! It\u0027s the ultimate package!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe protagonists encounter all sorts of situations. Some are esoterically weird, like a man who cannot pronounce or write any word with the letter \"e\" in it without feeling pain. Some are emotional and existential, like being trapped in a body different than what you\u0027re used to--how much of it defines who and what you are? Some are more combat-related, like Goro fending off an army of thieves assaulting a hospital. \u00a0And some are the kinds of problems that just can\u0027t be solved instantly, but can still be treated on a day-to-day basis, like lycanthropy or reforming from a violent past. The Dragon Doctors do it all, so my comic deals with it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost fantasy stories are set in the past--they deal with medieval castles and kings with tarted-up versions of medieval problems, like succession crises or \"evil man runs evil kingdom, go kill him.\" The Dragon Doctors comic is more like a fantastic extension of the modern day into the future--where it\u0027s an interconnected world of wildly different people both clashing and meshing (and bringing their weird modern problems with them, into their personal lives and into society).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus, there\u0027s plenty of funny stuff and cool dialogue along the way. One main character makes people\u0027s clothing disintegrate regularly, for example. She\u0027s a total magical badass.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you need Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s currently pretty difficult for me to even find regular advertisers due to some finicky content requirements, but even more than that this is a good way to gauge how much of a future the Dragon Doctors could possibly have, by seeing how much support I can get for it. The more support I get, directly, the better my morale improves and the better and more comics I can create. If I became entirely fan-supported I\u0027d give everything back to the fans tenfold.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you want to do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith support I\u0027d be able to make the site more professional, offer merchandise to the fans, be able to justify regular updates and not starve, of course. I\u0027m always trying to tell stories that haven\u0027t been told much before, or at least not in the way I tell them, so supporting The Dragon Doctors would continue to provide you with entertainment, amazement and heart-touching moments for years to come!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for patrons?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLots! The more support I get, the more I can give back. I\u0027d be able to justify spending \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0my time on the comic and giving everyone extremely common, regular updates for years to come. Little side benefits like extra stories, cameos for patrons, merchandise and more fun extra stuff would start happening too. We\u0027d make it a GOOD comic site.\u003cbr\u003e"
