    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThank you everyone in the Pokemon community!!!!\u003c/strong\u003e It is because of you for the past 3 years I\u0027ve been able to follow my dreams of turning my love for Pokemon and the community into a career.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of you know me as the owner of Squeaks Game World, but for those that don\u0027t, \"hi!\". I am Shaun the owner of Squeaks Game World, a self-made online hobby store that started in 2015. In three years with a lot of hard work and help from this community I\u0027ve managed to build up a store that has bought and sold over $1,000,000 worth of trading card games, video games, and other hobby merchandise. While I\u0027ll never step away from my passion of running a store with low costs and a wide variety, I do want to eventually take the store to the next step and add a whole level of service and content creation to better aid the community I love and give future entrepreneurs an even better chance to succeed than what I had!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I am ready to take this to the next step I need you! I\u0027m looking to start creating more content catered towards people who love video games, Pokemon, collecting, investing, and more. Starting with a Twitch stream that will go live daily I want to branch into multiple videos each week, a monthly newsletter for Patreons, studies of the Pokemon collectible market, AND SO MUCH MOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny Patreon support will go directly into improving the content, the analysis, the studies, and every other crazy idea I can come up with to do. I want to go so much deeper into the analysis of this collectible market than anyone ever has before, including not just analysis of past, current, and future trends, but also studies of market sentiment, correlation to traditional markets, growth, relations between card games, etc. My hope is that everyone who participates will not only find their collections growing, but for a fraction of the cost.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollow me along the journey and hopefully we can dive even deeper into the financial side of collecting and teach each other something along the way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDisclaimer:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe information provided in Patreon articles and newsletters and any other accompanying material on this Patreon is for informational purposes only.

Each time someone\u0027s wants/haves get added I\u0027ll put them in contact with anyone who is already listed on the opposite side.
