If you support me, I\u0027ll be able to do more comics to show people, and maybe start doing things like selling my own books worldwide, new illustrations and even experimenting in different kinds of stories and project ideas. I want to make comics, so I hope you will read them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith PATREON, my goal is to support making chapters and comics for RELIC HUNTER: RIVEN, but at the same time, I want to get back to ideas to DUKE AND TAMARA and create new isles for them to fly to and discover, as well as maybe creating more stories for the world of ELEMENT 5. (I\u0027m actually happy that the 50 paged one-shot came out well.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn Patreon, for $1+, you\u0027ll see all post, plus the exclusive ones that will show development sketches, planning, drawing videos, and more. The goal is that if pledges are hit, I\u0027ll compile pages together and produce PDF versions for supporters HERE ONLY! So I produce as much as I can, and those who want it, can get it here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings will be constantly changing, but as of now, \u0027\u0027\u0027RELIC HUNTER: RIVEN\u0027\u0027\u0027 is in development, and I\u0027ll post more information for the other stories too!
