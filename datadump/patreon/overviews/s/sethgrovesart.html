By becoming one of my Patrons, I will welcome you to my art family with open arms! I cannot express how much all the support means to me!\u00a0I know not everyone has the ability to get one of those two $100 reward spots every month, but even your $1, $5, $15, etc.. contribution helps me to buy my supplies and to pay for my art booths at cons. Sharing my Instagram, Facebook, and Patreon page with all of your friends, family and acquaintances is one way that every single person can help me MAKE MY DREAM COME TRUE! Thank you all so much!"

I dream of becoming a full-time artist and I am determined to be the best that\u00a0I possibly\u00a0can.\u00a0I pride myself in the detail that I put into my art and the \"true to character\" accuracy that I achieve. My true passions are Star Wars and \u003cbr\u003eBatman, but I DO NOT discriminate against any character, no matter how small. I have a keen eye for cool and original ideas and I love brainstorming them\u00a0with people. I would love to talk about your favorite character with you!",
