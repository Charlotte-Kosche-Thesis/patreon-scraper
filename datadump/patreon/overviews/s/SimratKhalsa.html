Nature abounds here with wildlife\noutside my door, tall trees, deer, birds, and yes, horses. These things make their way\ninto much of my work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve wrapped up a project this fall,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/simratk/albums/72157658343849225\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eA Painting a Day for Thirty Days\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0It is a series of 8x10 canvases averaging one painting per day for 30 days. I mostly painted outside with oil paints.\nHand ground oils\u00a0are my\nfavorite, as they are made from luscious natural pigments for mellow tones that\nfit with the nature around me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs I reach the next few milestones, I\u2019ll draw a name\nfrom the current patrons. That person can have their choice of the remaining paintings from\nthe series. In the meantime, they are also for sale.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you like what I do, and want me to do more of\nit, please\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eBecome\na Patron\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e Click the button at the left.
