Spawning out of this is a community that is active, engaging and growing on a daily basis. This mainly centres around our dedicated server SASHA, which we use to host our public game servers. Examples of which are our Minecraft, Teamspeak 3, Team Fortress 2 and Counter Strike Global Offensive servers.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo take things to the next level and to build on our success so far, your help would be very much appreciated. \u003cstrong\u003eOur objectives are\u003c/strong\u003e:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eDevelop a social gaming experience\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHost multiple public game servers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eRelease a website to support the social gaming experience\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eExpand our range of public game servers for the world to enjoy (as well as private ones for our patreons).\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eProduce open source software and mods for the world to enjoy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eBe a source of gaming news, media and entertainment by our website, Youtube, Twitch and social media.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nYour support will:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSupport the funding of our servers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSupport the development of our website and software.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGive you a stake in the direction of travel.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf all goes well, shares in Sector Alpha.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nI am working on a gaming community website.
