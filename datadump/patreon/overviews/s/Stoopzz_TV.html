    "summary": "My name is Stoopzz, and I am 23 year-old college student born and raised in California. I\u0027ve been playing World of Warcraft since Vanilla, and took a break during Cata \u0026amp; MoP. I reached Vengeful Gladiator during Burning Crusade and Relentless Gladiator during WotLK. I decided to pick back up during the end of WoD, as I simply missed the feeling of pwning noobs too much. I mainly PvP; however, I enjoy doing raids, dungeons, and world quests with friends and viewers. I like to talk about class updates, balance changes, and more, so please do not be afraid to engage (\u0026gt;\u0027-\u0027)\u0026gt; \u0026lt;(\u0027-\u0027\u0026lt;) ^(\u0027 - \u0027)^ \u0026lt;(\u0027-\u0027\u0026lt;)\u003cbr\u003eI created this twitch page to share my insight in effort to help others increase their playing ability. I also created this page to learn from you ! :) I\u0027m going to be dedicating a lot of my time to this channel during the next year by hosting giveaways, group activities, and instructional videos. By doing all of this, I hope to expand this channel and create a fun community for all players. Thank you for watching, and most importantly, thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll donations received will be used towards Prizes/Giveaways as well as purchasing better stream equipment!. Thank you so much!"
