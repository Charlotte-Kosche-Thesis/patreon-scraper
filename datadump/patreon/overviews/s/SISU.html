First off I want to thank you for visiting this page because if you\u0027re looking at this it means that you have probably at least thought about supporting me in some form or fashion. I\u0027m sure I speak for alot of independent working artists when saying that contributions towards the work I do (be it a pat on the back or even an \"atta boy\") means the world. So regardless of what your intentions are: thank you, thank you, thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work in inks and watercolors and focus on drawing fun and exciting Illustrations that come from anywhere I can grab inspiration from.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sisuillo.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCheck out my website for merch\u003c/a\u003e.I have been working for quite some time making and creating drawings for people in need of editorial, commercial, or personal needs. I absolutely love creating art. I wake up thinking about it, I do it all day, and I even go to sleep and dream about it most nights.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy entire life I have been creating. One of my earlier memories is sitting on my bed as a kid and tracing figures out of comics. In my teenage years I took art lessons from private teachers and school teachers. In my early 20\u0027s I went back to school for art and from that moment forward there was no looking back. I knew exactly what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. It is at this point where the biggest leap comes for me take.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I am working full time at one job and coming home and working on artwork, as well as promoting myself. I realize that at no point and time will I ever be able to feel 100% comfortable jumping off of a cliff but I am gearing up to make my escape. My plans are to continue down the path I have started for myself and build on top of what has come to fruition thus far.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
