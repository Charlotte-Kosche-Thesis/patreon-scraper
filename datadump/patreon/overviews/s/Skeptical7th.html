I\u0027m humbled that you even came here to have a look.\u00a0If you enjoy my work chucking me a couple dollars is absolutely the best way to support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Skeptical7th and I\u00a0created, write for, and manage the blog\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://theseventhdegree.com/.\"\u003ehttp://theseventhdegree.com/.\u003c/a\u003e The blog covers a range of subjects but I come from a skeptical and open-minded position. In the past, I have written posts exploring the techniques mediums use to fool us, reviewed magic shows and protests, and defended some rather unexpected people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m sure some of you think it\u0027s crazy for a blogger to ask for money - what do I even need it for right? The simple answer is hosting fees, domain name registration and related costs. All in all the bare minimum overheads for the blog are \u00a3235 per year. Anything over that amount would allow me to dedicate more time to the blog to\u00a0write more and better posts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI totally get if you can\u0027t afford to chip in but if you do have something to spare\u00a0I would be eternally grateful for any money thrown my way. Thanks for reading this. Without you, none of this would be possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
