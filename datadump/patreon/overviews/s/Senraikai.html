I\u0027ve been watching them for years and it always looked like fun. Being able to talk about things, or play games, that interest you and build up a following of people that like to listen to you talk about things and play games. My channel is primarily about doing live reactions to anime. In the future I plan to do more stuff, Let\u0027s Plays being one of them. Those will be mostly (if not entirely) anime style games. Anime is a \u003cstrong\u003ebig\u003c/strong\u003e hobby of mine, so pretty much anything I do on my youtube channel will relate to anime in some way. With your support I can get better equipment like a proper microphone, a better camera, and even dedicate more time to making videos. Any support is appreciated. Especially since it means that you \u003cstrong\u003ereally\u003c/strong\u003e like what I do, which means a lot to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Senraikai\"\u003eMyAnimeList\u003c/a\u003e profile. \u003cbr\u003eThis should let you know what I have already seen, so please check to see if a series is already on it before you request a series as an Imouto or Yandere tier patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost rewards will be given \u003cstrong\u003eafter \u003c/strong\u003epayment is received to avoid abuse of the system. Currently, the Tsundere tier and Stalker tier reward is an exception to this, but if you \u003cstrong\u003edo\u003c/strong\u003e try to abuse the system, to get rewards without paying, you will be blocked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEdit: I\u0027ve decided some stuff In regards to my Patreon Powered reactions. I will do a maximum of four Patreon Powered reactions at once. Two 2 cour anime and two 1 cour anime. If I currently have four Patreon Powered reactions active on the channel, that means any future requests will go on a waiting list until a slot is open for it. Here is the current four Patreon Powered reactions that are active on the channel followed by the waiting list if there is one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eActive Patreon Powered Reactions:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLove Hina\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e(2 cour)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eBlack Lagoon \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e(2 cour)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKuromukuro\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (2 cour)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eAbenobashi Mahou\u2606Shoutengai\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e(1 cour)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWaiting List:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e1: Shirobako\u003cbr\u003e2:\u00a0Daily Lives of High School Boys\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
