I just combined all the things I like \u003cstrong\u003e(programming, art/design, games, fantasy, porn)\u003c/strong\u003e and tried to find an activity I could do which combines all of them, and this is the result. I am probably quite lucky that all my interests can be combined into one thing (couldnt really imagine a football/musician/diver guy doing the same).\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eSo\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eI might as well try to see if patreon works for me, to atleast tell myself that I tried. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0027t think I could get bored working on it, because if I temporarily get bored with programming I just draw etc.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eI think I\u0027m quite fast at everything I do (sacrificing some quality), so I will make progress quickly, when I have the time to work on it.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGenerally the more money i earn the more time I can work on the game.\u003cbr\u003eSo the dream would be to work on it fulltime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game will always be free\u003c/strong\u003e, because I find it quite weird not to. It feels like if something isnt free, patrons dont really pay to get something, but instead pay so others dont get it, which is quite a weird concept. \u003cbr\u003eInstead, if its free, basically everone who pledges does something good, not only for the creator but also potential other users, which seems like a nicer thing to do.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003epatrons will get access to polls and stuff to decide the direction of the game and priorities etc. So the early phase will be where patrons can influence the most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDevelopment Goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI play quite a lot of games but there are almost no porn games that i really like, so I try to make a game that I would like to play, hoping that there are people with the same interests.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ethe main goal of development is to create a game with \u003cstrong\u003ehigh replayability,\u003c/strong\u003e without feeling repetitive after beating the game once.\u003cbr\u003e So most things will be \u003cstrong\u003erandomly generated\u003c/strong\u003e and there will be a lot of \u003cstrong\u003edifferent valid playstyles\u003c/strong\u003e and ways to win the game and a lot of stuff to \u003cstrong\u003eunlock for future plays\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e(Also the starting traits will have a huge impact on how you play the game, not only stuff like 0.5% more X, etc., so that the choice actually matters)\u003cbr\u003eBecause of that I won\u0027t have a linear story that leads the player, which would just be skipped after one time playing (or even the first time), but instead only have a starting setting and a goal. Everything inbetween is based on how you play/ your characters interactions with each other and rng.\u003cbr\u003eAlso I think story driven games scale terribly, because every update of the same size adds the same amount of content as the previous one, so that effectively every update changes less and less of the whole game. \u003cbr\u003eInstead, focussing on non-story stuff, every update adds more based on everything that already exists.\u003cbr\u003eAlso quite nice when planning to post updates, while the game isnt finished.\u003cbr\u003e( I wouldnt want to play a story based game from the start with every new update).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso for me\u003cstrong\u003e efficiency \u003c/strong\u003eis more important than polishing stuff. So if it takes like an hour to do something 90% it would probably take another hour to get it to 99%, another to 99,9%,.. so I will always rather do 2 things 90% than one 99% (180 \u0026gt; 99). So the game will probably always have a very loose feeling to it, but update really quickly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ebasically Quantity \u0026gt; Quality , effectively also increasing the quality of the game as a whole.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother thing is that I try to \u003cstrong\u003enot have tedious chores\u003c/strong\u003e in the game, which just get boring really quickly but are needed to progress. Basically I dont want to reward the player for doing really boring stuff (like in some games youre rewarded for keeping one enemy alive and just heal your team to full, while skipping all none-healers turns. At this point I would just have the game fully heal all characters at the end of every combat. Or stuff you always need to do, so it might as well be automated).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso I try to \u003cstrong\u003eminimize clicks and mouse-movements \u003c/strong\u003eneeded to do a specific thing/ go somewhere etc. (partially at the cost of how good the UI looks visually). Generally the look of the UI has quite a low priority for me, as long as it plays well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharacters:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMaincharacter is a female human who got the ability to shapeShift by learning/absorbing different genetic attributes through dna, letting you adjust your skills/looks etc.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eThere will be a lot of \u003cstrong\u003ebase species\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e(currently only 9 \u003cstrong\u003e(Centaur, Harpy, Succubus, Mermaid, Plant,Insect, Lavagirl,Lizard and a Light Creature)\u003c/strong\u003e) \u003cbr\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eALL possible combinations\u003c/strong\u003e as \u003cstrong\u003ehybrids \u003c/strong\u003eas your characterpool to recruit from/ breed.\u003cbr\u003eNpcs will mostly be variants of those species or completely unique ones.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExploration:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGo through randomly generated Portals, discovering/ recruiting new Species, finding interesting items/ events etc. and bring your rewards back home.\u003cbr\u003eSome portals may need flying characters etc. to access.\u003cbr\u003eThe overworld map is also tile based.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCombat:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTurn based on a tile map with permadeath. Characters have a lot of unique abilities, passives based on species.First all your characters act then all enemy characters. To make permadeath in this system not too frustrating, ranged abilities are very limited so enemies couldnt just focus all their attacks on one of your characters, instantly killing it. Instead characters are able to seduce others from far away, increasing their lust. While their lust is above 50% they get a lot worse (take double dmg, deal half etc.), so \"ranged\" characters still have a big influence on the game while not feeling too unfair. At 100% lust characters cant do anything except masturbate/fuck, effectively stunning them for a round. \u003cbr\u003emana and hp never regen naturally and the gametime passes during combat, making every single battle important, forcing you to think about how you want to prioritize your ressources (hp, mana, time, characters, etc.). (I always hate completely meaningless filler battles in games).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBreeding:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBreed your characters\u0027 traits/stats to create a team specially tailored to your playstyle and/or portal environments or to prepare for certain fights/fullfill requests etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTown:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003efight in arenas\u003cbr\u003etrain your characters/your sexSkills and put them to use in the brothel\u003cbr\u003ebuild upgrades etc.\u003cbr\u003edo quests/ interact with npcs\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSexScenes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThey will mostly be Image slideshows with descriptions etc. (maybe sometimes animated)\u003cbr\u003eThere will be a lot of random events that occur based on your party/ biome/ rng etc.\u003cbr\u003eNpcs will have more complex scenes where you have a lot of choices.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI try to have everything porn related to also have gameplay consequences, so seeing sexScenes etc. is not the reward in itself, otherwise it would feel weird to be punished for it gameplay-wise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlanned:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTournaments: Compete in special tournaments with certain breeding restrictions etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCompetitions: Minigames based on certain species, where certain ways of breeding give bonuses etc. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eComplex structures: colonize portals for mining/ farming/recruitment purposes etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eShops/Crafting\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNpc homeworlds: unique worlds related to certain npcs with small stories\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRelations between characters based on personality, preferences, working together etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA lot more of everything (Characters, Events, Items, ...)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFactions\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMorale\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePossible Problems:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIm not used to writing porn (and english is not my main language), so it may take some time getting comfortable with it (though writing isnt really the focus of the game anyway).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI dont care a lot about a pretty UI, but some people apparently do\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ei may overestimate the players skills and make stuff too complex/ hard (should be fine with different difficulties and player feedback)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
