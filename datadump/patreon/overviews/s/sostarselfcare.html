And I do other self-care stuff, like processing shame, healing trauma, taking gentle care of my fibromyalgia-enhanced body, and sitting in the dark with my anxiety and depression.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also coach other people in how to do both kinds of self-care. The sustainable and complex self-care that is both candlelit baths \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e dragging your monsters around. The big self-care and the little self-care. Emergency self-care. Daily self-care. Crisis self-care. Ongoing self-care. Deep self-care.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s my thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create self-care resources that are more easily accessible and available to a broader range of people. Unlike my coaching, which is a business, and my facebook page, which is personal, I want to start generating content that is easily accessed by anyone who needs it, when they need it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis content will be in the form of a regularly updated blog, a website with resources on a wide range of self-care topics, and self-care tools that can be downloaded or accessed online.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I have some bonuses for patrons, too!"
