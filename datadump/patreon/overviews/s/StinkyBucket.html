Maybe once a month, or every two weeks, once I start posting. No, definitely once a month, but with more pledges, I\u0027ll have more time, and thanks to math that means more pages per month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will any of your print comics be released?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nJust as soon as a publisher recognizes our collective brilliance. We are currently working on rewriting our debut title, \u003cem\u003eThe Devil\u0027s Corner\u003c/em\u003e, and redesigning the characters. We will first launch a \"pilot\" issue on Comixology, then use that as a proof of concept when pitching the ongoing series later this year (2018). You can read about our different projects in more detail at our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.stinkybucket.com\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow much money do you guys want, anyway?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nAll of the moneys. But seriously, we would love to garner enough support here that we can cut down on or eliminate our day jobs, which...again, thanks to math, will equal more time to create.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of people are you? I mean, are you like weirdos or something?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nYes. We are weirdos. We are weirdos who have great stories to tell (according to family, friends, and some amazing beta readers). We\u0027re two family guys, married, kids, dogs, cats, beer-bellies and all that. We\u0027re actual virtual real-life remakes of \u003cem\u003eMarried With Children\u003c/em\u003e. We do have day jobs, but we were meant to make comics, not those other things. Ask us about how this all came together sometime and we\u0027ll tell you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow did this all come together? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSeriously? We didn\u0027t think you were going to ask so soon... We know we promised to tell you but this thing is getting long, and we\u0027re getting tired, so how about some other time? We could get a beer and maybe some cheese fries. How\u0027s that sound?\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThat sounds okay, I guess... But can you at least tell me why I should believe your comics will not be pure garbage that will make me puke, shoot myself, or otherwise regret I read them, much less donating my hard-earned money so they could be made?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, when it comes down to it, a certain measure of trust will be required. That said, Craig is an accomplished graphic designer and a gifted painter who has sold many pieces and is the co-founder of a prominent San Diego-based art collective called \n\u003cem\u003eAesthetigeist\u003c/em\u003e. He loves art more than most other things, including his dogs and his cats (and his kids?), but let\u0027s face it, his dogs are pretty freaking irritating... What? It\u0027s not like we\u0027re kicking them or anything, buddy, so just lay off. Anyway, trust me, his art will fix anything the writing messes up. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSpeaking of writing, James is the next great undiscovered writer, the likes of which the world has never seen, nor will it ever see again once he is gone. Not really, but he can tell a story, and make you laugh along the way. He\u0027s had articles on gaming and pop culture published, as well as some not-as-interesting topics. His personal blog (which he has no time for) was getting tens of views per week! His writing has made at least 3 people laugh out loud (yes, he excluded himself).\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf we do it right, and we think we are, then the mixture of great influence and imagination will emerge as compelling, entertaining, and sometimes terrifying storytelling. We believe that comic books are the greatest form of storytelling and our desire is to join the ranks of the industry greats who are already out there providing the world with great stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, alright...but do you guys have ANY credentials? Have you done, like, anything yet to prove you aren\u0027t cash-grabbing degenerates?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy yes, yes we have. We have adapted a best-selling novel as a graphic novel. \u003cem\u003eForsaken \u003c/em\u003e(which almost won a Bram Stoker award) was the debut novel from J.D. Barker, who recently penned the official prequel to Bram Stoker\u0027s \u003cem\u003eDracula \u003c/em\u003e(which is being made into a major motion picture, directed by\u00a0Andy Muschietti, who recently directed Stephen King\u0027s \u003cem\u003eIt\u003c/em\u003e). Craig also did illustrations for the aforementioned \u003cem\u003eDracula \u003c/em\u003eprequel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNone of this has been released yet, but we assure you, adapting a novel as a graphic novel, 100% in-house (just the two of us) was on-the-job training rivaling what we could have learned taking courses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSay, what\u0027s with those old web-comic posts?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re so glad you asked. Before we got the \u003cem\u003eForsaken \u003c/em\u003egig, we were planning to build our brand the new-fashioned way, through painfully slow and heartrendingly disappointing web-comic entries. \u003cem\u003eThe Inherotors\u003c/em\u003e was our first foray into that realm...our proto-Witch Beaters stuff. Well, \u003cem\u003eForsaken\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0isn\u0027t out yet, and we\u0027re back to an augmented version of that plan. We have since converted \u003cem\u003eInheritors \u003c/em\u003einto a television pilot, but we\u0027re leaving the short story in our post section for posterity. Check it out! It\u0027s not half bad. It\u0027s like 3/8ths bad.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s it for now. If you submit more questions, maybe we\u0027ll answer them here! You\u0027ll be famous..."
