    "summary": "Over the past few years I\u0027ve been able to start a website, and self produce my first all original EP. \u00a0I\u0027ve begun making videos for a youtube channel and been able to help a few others with projects of their own.  To this point the amount of support I\u0027ve gotten has been tremendous!  So many people have told me they really enjoy the work I do and it grows every time I release a new project.  I\u0027ve grown as a writer and learned so \u00a0much more than I would have imagined about media production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past 5 years, my life has change drastically a few times. \u00a0I graduated from Full Sail, I\u0027ve moved halfway across the country, twice! \u00a0I\u0027ve worked several jobs from theme parks, to fast food, to tech support for a multinational electronics company. And with all that change one thing has remained constant. \u00a0I LOVE MAKING MUSIC! Everything I\u0027ve done has always been in the pursuit of starting my own production company. \u00a0Its the only thing I\u0027ve ever been 100% sure of. \u00a0So with that in mind, i\u0027m following the example of a few of my favorite content producers and starting a Patreon. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page will hopefully help grow my brand and eventually get me to the ultimate goal of being a self sustaining production company. \u00a0Working with clients and other content makers so that we can have fun with the music and other projects. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. \u00a0Patreon allows folks who enjoy my work to donate every month in order to keep the projects coming. \u00a0So many people have moved to getting their entertainment from the internet but fail to realize that producing that content does require funding. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSo if you\u0027ve enjoyed my music to this point and would like to get more of it, and see the quality improve I need your help!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 By donating $1 dollar a month you can directly fund my projects and keep the music going. \u00a0Of course if you feel you\u0027d like to donate more than that I certainly wont stop you. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, from this moment, I wont be charging for any of my music. \u00a0I want the artistic side of what I do to be free. So as of right now the EP is officially free. \u00a0I want people to enjoy the work and be able to share it with others. \u00a0I don\u0027t do music for the money and will never ask you to directly pay for it ever again. \u00a0All I ask is if you can afford it, pledge $1 a month to help keep it the dream alive. \u00a0Thank you very much for all the support and we\u0027ll see you soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eONE LOVE\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0"
