    "summary": "Thanks for supporting supporting the videos, podcast, and publishing. Slow Boat Sailing is making a podcast and vlog about sailing around the world part-time.The podcast interviews the most interesting cruising sailors in the world, including the crew of SV Delos, White Spot Pirates, Chase the Story, Sailing Miss Lone Star, Wicked Salty, SV Prism, and many more. This costs time and money and we love our supporters who subscribe on iTunes, Stitcher, and YouTube as well as those who support us on Patreon. We also produce audiobooks about long-distance sailboat cruising.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will be running contest where our most loyal Patreon supporters can become part of our crew literally as we explore the paradise islands of the South Pacific. Patrons of the round the world vlog and podcast get bonus podcast episodes and free audiobooks of How To Sail Around the World Part-Time and Slow Boat to Cuba. They get never before released audiobook chapters of Slow Boat to the Bahamas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy books are on Amazon.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.

We bought a $500+ DJI Phantom 3 Standard drone and spent over $600 to buy and equip a DJI Spark drone to take aerial videos of anchorages and marinas for the vlog. Podcasts must pay hosting fees. My old computer had to be upgraded because it was not fast enough to edit videos with hundreds of clips. We have incurred high internet access fees in foreign countries to put out a regular podcast and to upload videos. We spent hundreds of dollars to upload monthly podcasts from Tahiti during the filming of Season 2 and similar amounts on local cellular data to put out weekly podcasts in Panama and Ecuador during the season 1 filming. For every hour of podcast or minute of video many hours of work must go into them to produce them. We only produce highly edited podcasts and videos because we believe our listeners and viewers time is so valuable. Supporting us on Patreon is about supporting the content creation (vlogs and podcasts). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy wife and I\u00a0have always and will always pay for our sailing and boating expenses. Both my wife and I have full time jobs unrelated to our sailing. We are asking our viewers and listeners to help support the expenses of creating the videos and the podcast. Sailing channels that don\u0027t ask for support on Patreon produce less than 2 videos per year. Channels that do ask for Patreon support average 8 videos per year. Patreon is about having the beneficiaries of entertainment (creative content) support those creations. We are currently promising 12 round the world videos and 12 podcasts per year. If we don\u0027t have viewer and listener support, we may greatly curtail or halt that production schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe make content that is for all audiences and will not sacrifice safety or our relationship with our loved ones to create suggestive thumbnails. Our crew wears life jackets and harnesses in all weather. We don\u0027t cut corners on crew safety to get exciting video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe vlog is also a video cruising guide of the places we visit focused on the seamanship necessary to visit the exotic foreign ports that we visit. The vlogs recount the adventures of the \u003cem\u003eSlow Boat\u003c/em\u003e crew.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe host of the podcast and the captain of the Slow Boat is Linus Wilson who holds a \"six pack\" captain\u0027s licenses issued by the United States Coast Guard.\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eSlow Boat\u003c/em\u003e is an Island Packet 31\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are 14 episodes in season 1, and 18 episodes planned for season 2. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully, we will have the support to film many more seasons of our round the world voyage. Season 1 goes from New Orleans, to Florida, to Cuba, stops at Providencia, though the Panama Canal,  and across the equator into the South Pacific. Season 2 will be in the Marquesas islands, Fakarava, Tahiti, and Moorea. It is my hope that a lucky patron of the podcast and possibly his or her significant other will join the boat in season 3 for 1 to 2 weeks or more. If we hit our current goal before the end of season 3, we will be contacting the lucky patron about joining the Slow Boat in the most beautiful islands in the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t want to wait for the drawing, check out our star and executive producer level of support. The star and executive producer gift is the best value. Only one person can sign up for that level. Anyone who has ever paid for a captained charter will know that $99 per creation or month is a small fraction of what a captained charter would cost anywhere in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have a business that our listeners or viewers would appreciate, check out the limited corporate sponsor and title sponsor tiers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/slowboatsailing?sub_confirmation=1\"\u003eSubscribe to the YouTube channel for free.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSubscribe to the podcast at \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/slow-boat-sailing-podcast/id1084423845?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/slow-boat-sail...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/slow-boat-sailing-podcast\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.stitcher.com/podcast/slow-boat-sailing-...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
