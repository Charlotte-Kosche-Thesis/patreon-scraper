I started in 2003 with a comic about six 20 somethings called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.arustylife.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Rusty Life\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e In 2012 my love of comic strips led to the development of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.stairwellonline.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStairwell\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. Stairwell is about a guy named Norman who not only talks to himself, but sees and communicates with a manifestation of his brain. Stairwell is a full color strip and was updated daily for three years before I took a vacation from it and updated occasionally in 2016. After the well-received Stairwell Volume 4 Kickstarter, I returned daily in 2017 as one of the stretch goals. However,\u00a0with a full-time job and a lengthy commute, creating a daily comic has always been a labor of love. A daily schedule often means I have to work through vacations and holidays to stay up to date. The end result is that I get to deliver a comic strip in the same tradition of daily comics that I have always admired and loved!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is where you come in:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA contribution of even a few dollars a month supports Stairwell\u0027s costs, and allows me to continue manning a booth at local, west coast, comic conventions.
