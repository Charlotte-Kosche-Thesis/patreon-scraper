If you did, save yourself while you have the chance. This way lies the path to lifelong sexual deviance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fenoxo.com/play/CoC2/release/\"\u003eYou can play the most up-to-date public version of the game here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCorruption of Champions II (or CoC2 for short) is a text-based adventure game in which you contend with an invasion of perverse demons into your home realm, all the while romancing hot monstergirls and furries (and orcs, elves, demons, and all sorts of other cuties) and transforming yourself into your ideal physical form. CoC2 is a game about customization, letting you play whatever kind of character you want: whether you\u0027re a busty bimbo bandit or a chiseled lupine barbarian; a hermaphroditic cowgirl sorceress specialized in milk-magic, or a burly orc warpriest who intimidates his companions back into the fight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what you choose to transform yourself into you, you\u0027ll be accompanied on your perverse adventures by a group of eclectic companions, from catgirl clerics and kitsune sorceresses, to chastity-caged elf traps and domineering orc amazons. You can lead two of these companions at a time against a world full of lustful enemies and corrupted magics, building up your party and your own Champion\u0027s talents to bring to bear countless combinations of strengths and weaknesses against your demonic foes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should I Support You? What Do I Get Out of It?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood question. At least once a month, CoC2 will release a publicly-playable build full of enticing new content, but if you become a backer, you\u0027ll get access to more frequent updates (though all the same content will eventually become public in the next month or so). The main reason to support us, though, is because you like what we\u0027re doing and are willing to shell out some cash to help make CoC2 the best game it can be. The more support you guys give us, the more art and writing we can commission; eventually, we\u0027ll be able to start hiring on people full time to make awesome content for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*PLEASE NOTE* that Corruption of Champions II and Trials in Tainted Space, while they have a lot of people and design-space in common, are made by two different teams with different budgets. Supporting one does NOT help the other. That\u0027s why we have two different Patreons. Can\u0027t cross the streams, you know? If you support CoC2, you\u0027ll get access to all the CoC2 rewards and backer updates, but it won\u0027t give you access to anything TiTS-related (and vice versa).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Do I Get My Cool Stuff?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFenoxo.com is still the ultimate home for adult interactive fiction. Once you back us here, create an account over there, go through the process described there for linking up your Patreon and Fenoxo accounts, and you\u0027ll start seeing a \"Backer Builds\" tab on the top of the site. You can find all the sweet, sweet early access content your genitalia desires right in there.\u003cbr\u003e"
