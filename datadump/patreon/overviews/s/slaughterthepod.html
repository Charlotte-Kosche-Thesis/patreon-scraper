We also didn\u0027t realise how much hard work it would be to keep up alongside working full-time... !\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are so grateful that anyone is willing to listen to our vile chat in a podcast that is basically a replacement for therapy. We both love researching and creating content, but it\u0027s also pretty time consuming. We are hoping to spend your contributions on setting up some merchandise, upgrading our sound equipment and getting a PO Box so you can send us creepy shit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the rewards to see what\u0027s in it for you. Thank you for any support that you give us - even if it\u0027s just a review.\u003cbr\u003eEmma \u0026amp; Lucy x\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Our podcast mostly features discussion of murderers and the reasons behind the horrible acts they committed, but we couldn\u0027t do it without making a few jokes along the way. If you don\u0027t have at least a slightly sick sense of humour they you probably aren\u0027t going to like this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe decided to set up this podcast for some fun, and we\u0027re really enjoying it, but we also weren\u0027t prepared for how amazing and supportive our listeners would be.\u00a0We really want to do more for you, and to build the podcast in so many different ways. We want to raise money for some merchandise, improve our sound equipment, and have more time for research. The podcast is way more time-consuming than we ever thought, it\u0027s almost like a second job, and god only knows how I\u0027ll keep it up when Ofsted is in, so we really appreciate your support both financially and through telling other people.\u00a0",
