Youtube isn\u0027t the most stable career choice, but it is something I take pride in and strive to do well. \u00a0This is where you can help make my Youtube adventures a bit more stable, and ease my mind from pondering the next ADpocalypse.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWho is ScrapMan?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eI am just a man who was suddenly a Youtuber. \u00a0I started making videos shortly before uprooting my life and moving out of a place a familiarity, diving into the scary unknown. \u00a0Fortunately, my videos started to unexpectedly pick up traction and I realized I might be able to make something out of this. \u00a0So I took a chance and devoted all my time and resources into making the channel what it is now. \u00a0Honestly, if it wasn\u0027t for people like you finding my channel and watching my videos, this transition would have gone a lot worse. \u00a0I stumbled into the dark, not knowing what to expected, and was greeted warmly by so many amazing viewers! \u00a0This just motivates me to keep on going harder!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eAs many of you know, Youtube ad revenue can be extremely unreliable. \u00a0It fluctuates with school times, seasons, holidays, and even news drama. \u00a0This can make it a very stressful thing to rely on. \u00a0Patreon is something that is much more concrete and consistent month to month. \u00a0It provides extra piece of mind and a bit more of a personal connection between my channel and my more dedicated fans. \u00a0Even the smallest of donations can offset a huge amount of views on Youtube. \u00a0So that is why my supporters here get access to rewards that the average viewer won\u0027t get. \u00a0You are making a bigger difference to my channel than I could ever ask for, so that deserve a little something in return!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eThank you!\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003eEven if you can\u0027t afford to support me directly on Patreon, the fact that you checked this page out and read this far means you have invested more time into me as a person than a vast majority of my viewers. \u00a0I am more than just a Youtube channel to you, I am a person. \u00a0So thank you for recognizing that and coming to learn a bit more about ScrapMan!\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e"
