    "summary": "Hi, ScarlettFoxx here.I have recently gotten into cosplay, going to cons and doing photo shoots. I am hoping to add many more costumes to my collection and attend many more Cons in the future. So far I have Harley Quinn, Black Mary Marvel and Lara Croft. I have recently been trying to put together a Harley Quinn/Sith Mashup but I am struggling to get all the pieces together. Cosplay is costly as i\u0027m sure most of you \u00a0are well aware. Since I was a little girl I wanted to model and I loved to dress up...makes sense why Halloween was always my favorite holiday so Cosplay has been the perfect outlet for both of said loves.. With a little help I am looking to add many more cosplays to my collection such as Poison Ivy, Ariel, Red Sonja, Fairchild, Spider Gwen, Bloodrayne...just to name a few ;)"
