    "summary": "I\u0027m an Oregon photographer drawn to natural landscapes with water, reflections, motion, and strong patterns.  I also enjoy shooting events, pets, macro fine art nudes and self portraits.  As a retired engineer I celebrate every moment I\u0027m not trapped in a cubicle by getting outside and shooting photos until I\u0027m cold, wet, dirty, tired, and hungry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI often create panoramic images from multiple individual photos I shoot.  Perhaps I\u0027m drawn to the combination of technical and artistic skills required to create them, as well as the element of surprise I get during my \"developing\" process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy landscape images draw viewers in to experience the scene as if they were there themselves.  I do this by incorporating elements of both foreground and background, which might include different elements and textures.\u00a0 I enjoy adding an Earthling to my landscapes on occasion, usually myself.\u00a0 With these images I try to become an accessory to the scene, rather than steal the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of my medical conditions my ability to travel is limited.  Throughout 2016, I focused on macro and fine art nude photography without leaving my home on 7 acres.  In January, 2017, I sold my home and moved into a travel trailer.  As a gypsy of sorts I\u0027ve lived in one Oregon location for several months at a time then moved on.  My portfolio will give you an idea of the places I\u0027ve lived and photographed.\u00a0 I do hope to stay put for a little while now, though!\u003cbr\u003e"
