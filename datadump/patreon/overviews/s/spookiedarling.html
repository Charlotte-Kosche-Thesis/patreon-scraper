    "summary": "Hello, my sweet friends! My name is Spookie Darling, and I am a multi-media artist currently based in Oakland, California. My main passions in art are music(piano and songwriting), photography, and modelling! I created this Patreon earlier in 2017 to attempt to gain financial support for my various arts, mostly focusing on photography and modelling, when I was located in Denver, but now that I am out in California, I am more focusing on my music, as I no longer have a studio space or clients(working on rebuilding!). I began making music when I in about 2007, when I was about 12 years old, but I wrote my first song when I was 10. I have grown to fall in love with piano and one day I would love to create albums based on the music I have floating in my head. I\u0027m hoping this platform, and gaining more fans, patrons, and supporters, will guide me in the direction to stabilise and get actual recording equipment, so I can create more complex pieces and begin recording my music in a more professional manner!\u003cbr\u003eEventually, I would really like to return to modelling and photography as well, however - due to the amount of moving around in recent months, as well as lack of funds and general lack of stability in my life, which is slowly but surely clearing up - for now, this will probably mostly support musical creation videos. I will begin streaming my live process on Twitch.tv soon as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT TO EXPECT . . .\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon has been created in an attempt to turn my trades into stability. In order to make as much content as I would like, and as often, as well as up-to-standards in quality, I need to be able to dedicate as much time as possible to my arts. This platform is intended to help me reach the point of taking it on as a full - time opportunity! Of course, my end goal is to be able provide as much content as possible. Pledging to my Patreon really assists me in reaching this goal, and it means the world to me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003elive streams of music-making and freestyling piano\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003enew music videos released more consistently\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003epiano covers that you may or may not recognise\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eoccasional singing and guitar videos\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003emore to come as I learn and grow!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
