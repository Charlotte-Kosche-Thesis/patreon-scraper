And why Patreon?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nShades of Vengeance is a small company that creates Tabletop Roleplaying Games and Card Games. We love gaming and want to bring you fun, immersive and expansive worlds that will give you years of enjoyment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe always have more ideas and projects in the works because we believe that there are no limits to what can be achieved, even for an indie studio.\u00a0We also believe that a game doesn\u0027t stop needing work when the rulebook is completed - there are always new materials that can be included to improve the experience, from expansions to premade sessions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe that rules should enhance the role-playing experience, supporting whatever the players want to attempt, while giving them a real chance of failure. Based on the criticially-acclaimed Era d10 Rule Set, the games are easy to learn for novices while still provide a challenge, even for the most experienced gamers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe bring the best writers and artists and combine their skills with the extensive experience of our creative team and expert project management to make sure that the products you receive from us are AAA quality, as well as being delivered on time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have run 17 Kickstarters so far, with an excellent record for delivering on time. We have also been running this Patreon for 3 years with similar results. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.shadesofvengeance.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cocoon-research.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe often hear from people that they\u0027d like to see more pre-made adventures to play! We totally understand - not everyone has the time to build a campaign plan which has intricately-woven details and cinematic sequences that will leave your players speechless!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve decided to help you with that \u2013 the campaigns that we\u2019re creating for this Patreon are unique and inspiring. In Era: The Consortium\u2019s Time Travel Campaign, you travel back to the start of the Consortium to rebuild the society as you see fit. In the Era: Survival Campaign we\u2019re planning, you create and defend a town of your own. We have loads of ideas, which will keep you with new sessions for years to come!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are about to introduce a brand new set of content as well: every month, we will give you a science fiction creature and adventure seeds that relate to it. We find that there are loads of entries for Fantasy creatures, but few people seem to regularly create the same for science fiction! These creatures are setting-neutral, so you can use them in any game, not just Era: The Consortium.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe in what we are creating and want to see it continue to grow. Patreon is giving us the chance to offer you new content for all of our games, as well as Beta Test copies, previews of our upcoming work and much more!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.shadesofvengeance.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Lyres-Sliders.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat games do you offer?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEra: The Consortium - Time Travel Campaign\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PEpoS7wIiag\" width=\"854\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEra: The Consortium offers 500 years of playable history in an ever-changing Sci-Fi Universe.

Each of these expansions has allowed us to add a new type of gameplay, from \"Aliens\"-inspired \"Revival\", where you fight with Survival Horror rules, to A New Dawn, with which you can gain Psionic abilities to fight your enemies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a long way to go with this campaign - we haven\u0027t even got to halfway through the history yet! Thanks to the Kickstarter, we were able to put the sessions we had into printed books (and we also took the opportunity fix and rewrite a few sessions!). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of those changes were made available to Patrons of this page for free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWould you like to know more?
