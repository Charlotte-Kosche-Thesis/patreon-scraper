    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://seananmcguire.com/galleries/page_images/patreon_who2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Seanan McGuire, John W. Campbell Award winner, New York Times Bestseller, and owner of ridiculously oversized cats (seriously, they\u0027re the size of corgis).  I release an average of five books per year, and have since 2009, including the October Daye series, the InCryptid series, and more, all under my own name.  As Mira Grant, I am the author of the Newsflesh and Parasitology series, mixing fringe science with hard science fiction.  I don\u0027t sleep very much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is entirely possible to spend a year\u0027s book budget on me already, especially if you\u0027re someone who wants to collect all the anthologies and essay collections that I am a part of.  I realize and fully understand this, because hoo, boy, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d be able to keep up with me if I weren\u0027t me.\u00a0 Which is part of why I haven\u0027t set up a Patreon before now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://seananmcguire.com/galleries/page_images/patreon_why_.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp until very recently, I lived in a crumbling farmhouse in Northern California with my mother, sister, housemate, and the aforementioned gigantic cats.  We purchased the house in 1998, before the real estate boom.  Sadly, it was not in particularly good shape then, and wasn\u0027t in particularly good shape when circumstances aligned to shift me up the coast toward Seattle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoving is expensive, and in this case, it was not a wholly expected expense.  Also, well.  I had been living with my housemate for twenty years, between the apartment we were in before the house and the house itself, and it\u0027s a little surprising how many things I don\u0027t own.  This is essentially a divorce, after all: somebody gets the cat and somebody gets the couch.  (We were not romantically involved, but a twenty year co-habitation is a common law marriage in many states.)  Since I was not going to give up my cats, I am down a lot of couches.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo many couches.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd thus...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://seananmcguire.com/galleries/page_images/patreon_project_.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a Patreon with a purpose: to buy me a new toaster, where \"toaster\" is a way of saying \"thing I need for the house.\"  (Amusingly, an actual toaster is on the list of things I need to get.)  Some months, the toaster will be painting a room or buying a bookshelf, or a scanner, or a new desk that actually gives me room to work.  Other months, the toaster will be that actual toaster I mentioned.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause this is a Patreon with a purpose, I\u0027m not planning to keep it running forever.  The current intent is one year from start to finish: twelve toasters, whatever shape those toasters may assume.  Each month, I intend to post a short video or blog article to introduce the newest toaster, because it appeals to my sense of whimsy.  I understand that Patreon doesn\u0027t come with accountability, and I don\u0027t feel like I need to provide toaster receipts or anything like that, but this is how I can get myself to do this thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I need to do this thing.  I really, really need to do this thing.  Did I mention that moving is expensive?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://seananmcguire.com/galleries/page_images/patreon_what.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon means patronage, in the old, \"I pay people to create for me\" sense of the word.  So what you are going to get from supporting this Patreon is exactly what it says on the tin.  You\u0027re going to get fiction.  Most of it will be virtual, delivered electronically.  If you back at the higher levels, some of it will be physical.  (I have kept these levels extremely limited, because fulfillment is not one of my great strengths, and I need to be able to actually write the things I\u0027m promising.  Also, the point here is to buy toasters, not to spend all my toaster money on mailing things around the world.  That gets spendy fast.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting this Patreon, you will be effectively doing what my ad hoc tip jar has done for the last several years: you will be allowing me to prioritize stories that otherwise might not have been able to rise to the top of the priority list.  Unlike the tip jar, however, there is not a pre-existing list of which stories will be prioritized: supporters of the Patreon will be able to have a say on what I work on.  Which is not something I usually do, so that\u0027s exciting!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBackers will receive digital copies of all of the work made possible by this Patreon, plus additional \u201cper Thing\u201d rewards at various backer and milestone levels.  There\u0027s a possibility that some of those short stories will reappear elsewhere, either sold to magazines or anthologies as reprints, or (in the case of things set in one of my ongoing universes) as free downloads on my website.  But the backers of this Patreon will get to read and enjoy them long before anyone else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping to produce one thing a month for the length of the Toaster Project, giving you twelve new stories of varying lengths and giving me a little breathing room as I fight my way through this huge and unexpected expense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve met me.  Many of these stories will happen anyway.  But you can make them happen sooner, and you can help me make a house a home by giving me the ability to buy a toaster.\u003cbr\u003e"

If you do this, in addition to all of the above (including postcards and chapbooks), I\u0027ll send  you paper copies of everything I traditionally publish during the twelve months following your initial patronage, along with a thank-you note, anthologies not included (I don\u0027t get copies of many of those).  You will also get to choose the characters and universe you\u0027d like me to write about for one story.  You can\u0027t choose the plot, but you can give me an existing setting (from any of my published novels or short stories) and two of the characters featured, within reason (no Oberon and October, for example, as he\u0027s not currently an active part of the setting).  Want to see Jan and Li Qin again?  Want to know what happened when Jeff joined the ATI?  I can make that happen.  It\u0027s up to you.",
