    "summary": "Thank you for being a part of this endeavor. I consider you a business partner so I want to be transparent about my reasons for adding a podcast to the Sexplanations YouTube show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e1. Some of our fans are blind and the while I do my best now to give clear descriptions on the YouTube show about what is happening visually, in the past this was not always the case. This podcast provides a space for me to revisit a lot of those episodes and do so with consideration for those who can hear but can\u0027t see.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e2. Time is one of the most valuable things we have and a lot of it is spent doing mundane tasks like commuting to work and sorting through emails. Podcasts reach people while they\u0027re doing the mundane so they take very little extra time. I want sex education to reach people where they are, and if more people will consume sex education if I make a audible version than I\u0027m going to give the extra time and energy to this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e3. When I polled our Sexplanations YouTube audience about what they\u0027d like us to take on next the leading response was a podcast. Doing a podcast beat out a second video of Sexplanations a week, a book, and a song! When I ask what you want, and you tell me something reasonable, I\u0027m going to listen and follow through.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e4. Sexplanations is becoming increasingly more successful and it seems like we shouldn\u0027t just stop with one media outlet. I am going to write Sexplanations the book and I\u0027m going to make sex education songs but in the meantime here\u0027s Sexplanations the podcast. The more the merrier, right?"
