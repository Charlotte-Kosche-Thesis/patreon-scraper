    "summary": "Hello current and future patreons! My name is not important and I am a Games Development post graduate, with a love for story writing and game development. For a long time, I\u0027ve admired creators in the Furry community, and have long since wanted to join their ranks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, for the first time in my life, I\u0027m ready to put my abilities to the test, and get paid while doing it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon is meant to provide you, the player a direct influence on how the game develops over time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game project has 2 stages. Stage one is the proof of concept stage, that has 2 phases. Phase 1 is a test on simple mechanics that you would expect to find in an interactive, choose your own adventure game. Phase 1 has been completed and has a fully working character creation system, as well as requirements needing to be met to progress in the game, and having character choices effect certain scenes. Phase 2 has just begun and will be more centered around story/character development, sex, influence on characters and a very simple combat system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell now that the first stage has been explained, you probably want to know what happens in stage 2. Stage 2 is the actual game that I am currently building a proof of concept for. The game is set in my very own Netherworld, with you playing as a recently displaced, high society cub from the overworld. Lost in the Netherworld, you must overcome your adversaries, beat them into submission, and eventually uncover the truth of why your family was butchered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe point of the game is provide the player with a complete package of locations, all with diverse enemies, interactions and kinks. Yes, that includes the dark stuff as well (but you can disable that once they are added to the game). All of this comes with a cast of characters, based on my own designs, as well Patreon suggestions from some of the higher tier supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll links to the game can be found on the discord, here:\u00a0https://discord.gg/ukQtAT7\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that the game has been explained, let me talk you through the pledge tiers and how they work.\u003cbr\u003eTier 1 - $1 a month. The very basic entry level. I appreciate anyone who commits this money to my project, as even the smallest pledge can amount to something massive in bulk. This tier immediately makes you a VIP in my discord, where you can get instant access to updates to the game, as well as influence how the game progresses by giving you access to any poll that is related to general locations in the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTier 2 - $5 a month. This is where the love really starts to show. This pledge tier will give you everything Tier 1 provides, but also gives you the added bonus of deciding what enemies and characters you would like to see put in the game project next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTier 3 - $15 a month. Oh baby, this makes me so moist. This pledge tier includes all of the previous tier rewards, but also give you the ability to actually pitch ideas for new locations. You want to see an abandoned castle with a specific kink theme? Then you can suggest it to me for it to be added to the poll!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTier 4 - $25 a month. Holy shit wow, now this is not what I was expecting. At this point, every month, you will get to choose what enemy you want to be added into an already established location. No polling will be done on this like other enemies, you will simply get to decide on an enemy you want added in every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTier 5 - $50 a month. GGFDDFHDFGDAG. No way you decided to become a master pledger. This tier Will get you everything from tier 1-3, but will also give you two options. The first option allows you to choose 2 enemies that you want to be added to the game, each separate from each other of course. Or, you decide on a character of your choosing that you want to be added to the monthly character poll.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTier 6 - $100 a month. You are a very special Patreon. Not only do you every reward from Tier 1-3, but you will also get to have a character of your choosing added to the game every month. This will be limited to ONE pledger at a time. This character will be available in your desired location, and will be designed on YOUR request!"
