In joining you not only can study these videos, but you are supporting the continuing process of finding, filming and detailing these masters of technique. The suggested pledge is $5.

Without this change my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://8limbs.us/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e8limbs.us\u003c/a\u003e writing would have likely come to an end. I\u0027ve needed to start writing for my readers. The response has been pretty incredible, and sponsors have stepped up in support - and at this point 8limbs.us, all of my writing, filming and fighting has become sustainable through my patron pledges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost know me already because you\u0027ve been following me for a while now. For those that don\u0027t, I began blogging about 9 years ago, around the same time I started putting up videos of my training\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/MasterKMuayThai\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon YouTube\u003c/a\u003e. My hope has always been to just share with others what I\u0027m experiencing, and to pass on the contact I was having with my teachers. But the YouTube channel grew, as did my blogging, and I eventually saved up enough money to move to Thailand to train and fight full time. And I started a small website as a home for my blogging and shares:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://8limbs.us/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e8limbs.us\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://8limbs.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Accomplishments-in-Thailand-since-2012-e1498114682511.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hit the ground running since I came to Thailand, and as you can see above I\u0027ve pushed everything to the limit. I\u0027ve fought 190+ times in that period (updated),\u003ca href=\"http://8limbs.us/muay-thai-thailand/the-foreigner-who-has-fought-the-most-times-in-thailand-is-a-woman\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e more in Thailand than any other westerner in history\u003c/a\u003e, man or woman. The entire time I\u0027ve pushed myself to write and video share as much as I possibility could to help make things more clear, more imaginable for those back home. I know that before I came to Thailand there was very little I could find about what it is like to train and fight full time here, especially for women - I wanted to change that. And it may be fair to say that I\u0027ve shared more in English on Muay Thai and Thai Muay Thai culture than anyone previously has, and hopefully I have inspired others to write and video share as well. The hope is that each fighter, each person, will put their story out there, create more ripples in the pond.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do I Create?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to write about the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://8limbs.us/muay-thai-thailand/modernization-muay-thai-timeline\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehistory of Muay Thai\u003c/a\u003e, and cover the female Muay Thai fighting scene in Thailand closely.

This is all in the dream of becoming \u003cem\u003efluent\u003c/em\u003e in Muay Thai as a sport and art, and I record every bit of it that I think will help inspire others to follow their own Muay Thai dream. You have to be able to see, to imagine where you want to be in order to pursue it, so I try to open a window for others, across the world here in Thailand. Monthly pledges not only enable all this content, but make my training and constant fighting across the country possible. You are sponsoring not only a journalist, but also Thailand\u0027s most active fighter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmong all else I\u0027ve also, with my fellow female fighter friend\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://undertheropes.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEmma Thomas\u003c/a\u003e, established a Muay Thai internet forum: The\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://8limbs.us/muay-thai-forum/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMuay Thai Roundtable\u003c/a\u003e. This is a one of a kind internet space, designed for the sharing of knowledge, far from the argument-driven sites that are more common in the fighting arts. In fact, the forum also has a Women Only section where women can find fellow female athletes to turn to for support or as knowledge sources, as women often can find themselves isolated in gym spaces. And\u00a0I produce a monthly podcast with my fellow fight-friend Emma Thomas, \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/two-ladies-in-kingdom-woman/id1083107907\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwo Ladies in the Kingdom\u003c/a\u003e, covering female Muay Thai in Thailand, and other aspects of the Thailand life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd Last But Not Least\u003c/strong\u003e, you are supporting the filming of my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/muay-thai-uncut-7058199\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMuay Thai Library documentary project\u003c/a\u003e. This is the most comprehensive long form documentation of Muay Thai technique effort in history. The aim is to film at least 100 krus and ex-fighters, as they teach their Muay, each completed with audio commentary to make explicit many subtle things that might be hidden from viewers. Unlike many documentary projects this one allows you to see the Library in progress, as each session is published. Patron pledges make this project possible as I search out legends and lessor known krus across Thailand, hopefully preserving not only their techniques, many of them at the edge of being lost, but also the energies of these men who have given themselves to Muay Thai.\u003cem\u003e 5% of all pledges go into my\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://8limbs.us/muay-thai-thailand/starting-the-kru-fund\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKru Fund\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Book in the Works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChoosing to support my content here through Patreon means not only choosing to help me produce the writing and videos that I already have been creating, and maintaining the Roundtable forum, but also to support the writing of a book. I often have been told that I need to write a book about my experience here, but first I have another book in mind. Emma Thomas and I have been planning to co-author a \u003cem\u003eFemale Guide to Training and Fighting in Thailand\u003c/em\u003e. \u00a0We feel that this is a really important book, and it will cover everything from the social hurdles that western women in face in Thai gym settings, how to identify a female supportive gym, body, health/hygiene concerns, different training regimens, and how to beat Thai female opponents - to name a few. It will be comprehensive and is really exciting project. Supporting my content through Patreon will help make this book possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the writing of the Female Fighter\u0027s Guide, I\u0027d like to sit down and write my own story as a book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Support My Content?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis answer is simple. Support it because you value it. I have made it for the last several years free of charge, really just for the joy of it. \u00a0And I have benefited immensely from the connections to people I\u0027ve made around the world through the sharing. I\u0027ve come upon rough times, and the reality is that without support I very well may have to stop producing what I write and film. If it is meaningful to you to help give me a leg up to help make sure it continues, I appreciate the aid to no end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut there is another reason as well. I\u0027m now producing regular content only for Patreon supporters: personal journey video blogs, technical videos and long form training sessions with top trainers with audio commentary. When you join Patreon you receive the benefit of all that. And, you are able to join the Facebook Group\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1615087202117246/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon Supporters of Sylvie\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e which is open only to Patreon supporters.
