And it seems like I\u0027m always trying to come up with ideas they can improve the quality of life for humanity. Would it be trying to put a smile on your face or help someone change a tire, or just say something positive. But, I also have a bit of a dark side and I believe that there should be a sense of equality with morals top-off with the righteousness of God. And in justice and/or tearing down on morals sometimes brings out the dark side in me. So, I may not be politically correct and I may not have an Orthodox view of what the modern world believes are now days to be right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you cannot understand what I just said just tried reading between the lines, Oh by the way I love making and saying funny things too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest regards\u003cbr\u003e",

In return it would help me to put out more weekly video and possibly multiple daily videos and help to continue to shared the truth of what really is happening around the world. The goals is to provide many with a different perspective on today\u0027s global news they may have impact or effects in your daily life and provide you with the perspective usually not found in YouTube videos that will allow many to think out-of-the-box. Become a supporter of this great project today join the winning pleasure warrior team, and let us all fight the war against lies, globalism, injustice, and manipulation of fake media that is spreading throughout the world like look a menacing cancer.\u003cbr\u003e\nGod bless you all and please support this project todaty.\u003cbr\u003e\nJames\u003cbr\u003e",
