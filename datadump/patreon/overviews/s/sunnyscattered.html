    "summary": "I love to write. I absolutely love it. It started as a\ntherapeutic exercise almost four years ago, when I began\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sunnyspellsandscatteredshowers.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eblogging\u003c/a\u003e as a means of\ncoping with depression, but has become so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve come to realise how important writing\nis to me, as well as how much I can contribute to the field of mental health.\nI\u2019m not a professional, I certainly don\u2019t have all the answers, but I\u2019ve\nlearned a lot along the way. The blog has allowed me to share that learning,\nboth with professionals and those struggling with similar issues. It has opened\ndoors that I never dreamed of \u2013 I now write for an Irish national news outlet,\nNewstalk, and have had articles published by the two leading broadsheets in the country.\nI\u2019m a regular contributor to the Huffington Post and the Mighty, and have\nbeen recognised both\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sunnyspellsandscatteredshowers.org/testimonials_awards/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enationally and internationally\u003c/a\u003e for the work I\u2019ve done with\nmy blog. I\u2019ve taken part in television documentaries on the\nsubject of mental health, and have spoken at public events promoting emotional\nwell-being. Full details of all publications and interviews to date are available\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sunnyspellsandscatteredshowers.org/media/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI want to keep doing all of this, and if possible, to take\nit further. I want to keep writing, to keep sharing what I\u0027m learning, to engage more with both my readers and\nthose working in the field. I believe I have a book in me. I hope that over\ntime I can make a real and lasting contribution to the change that is coming\nabout in attitudes to mental health in Ireland. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo why am I asking for pledges? I\u2019m currently struggling\nwith my mental health to such an extent that I cannot hold down a \u0027real\u0027 job. But what\nI can do is write, about what I\u2019ve learned, about what works, and about what\ndoesn\u2019t. I hope that in doing so more people will feel able to seek the help\nthey need, but also know that they are far from alone in their difficulties. There\nis no shame in needing help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s not entirely altruistic either. This blog is\nall my own, something that I\u2019ve created, and I get a huge sense of satisfaction\nfrom that. I love hearing that what I\u2019ve written has helped in some way, and\nwhen people can identify with my experience, that validation works both ways. Therapy has given me so much insight into how our minds actually work, I\u0027ve lost count of the number of light bulb moments I\u0027ve had. Chances are if something makes sense to me, it will to at least one other person too. Writing allows me to share that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting also gives me a sense of meaning and value that I don\u0027t get anywhere else. The average human life span is about 80 years, so statistically, I\u0027m already half way there. The first half of my life has been spent struggling, trying to do the \u0027right\u0027 thing, trying to do what I believe other people expect of me, and ultimately failing, because I\u0027m not being true to myself. The second half? I want the second half to be different. I\u0027ve learned so much about my values, about what I feel is important, and what isn\u0027t. I don\u0027t want to merely survive the next 40 years, I want to thrive. We get one shot at this. I want to look back and see that I\u0027ve done everything I can to uphold and live by those values. Dedicating my time to writing will allow me to do that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy best case scenario is that I can make a career of writing\nand advocacy. Anything that you can see fit to donate, even just $1 a month,\nwill help get me there. My pledge to you is that I will continue to learn and to share as much as I possibly can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
