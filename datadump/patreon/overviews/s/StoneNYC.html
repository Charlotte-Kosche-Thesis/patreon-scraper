    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello, welcome to my Patreon, \u003c/strong\u003ea place where you can be part of the conception of new art by becoming a Patron. In return for your support you receive back art, photography, and the stories that you\u0027ve helped foster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get in return? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this Patreon as a way to share more of my art. You may know me from places like \u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/stonenycfoto\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/stonenycphoto\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://stonenyc.tumblr.com/\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/stonenycfoto\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, and Zivity where I share snippets of my art for free. When you become a \u003cstrong\u003ePatron\u003c/strong\u003e you get full digital access to the art I create; modeling photosets, the art I\u0027m making in school, and behind the scenes stories every month. Additionally ALL tiers include physical art that I send out to you in the mail. So as Patrons you have the opportunity to collect my work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut why become a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cost of creating art is high. Collectors buy most great art and hide it away in storage or hang it on their walls in fancy mansions for only their friends to see. A few pieces hang in museums that are inaccessible for many. \u003cstrong\u003eI believe that art should be accessible to everyone. \u003c/strong\u003e I love making physical art, I\u0027ve been making silver gelatin prints for years. And now I\u2019m learning how to make Cyanotypes, Platinum/Palladium, Salt, and Color Chemical Prints in school. However, by the time a final print is created, mounted and framed, that print will need to be sold for $300 to $4,000+ to recuperate the cost of its creation. That\u0027s not a reasonable purchase for most people. Here, starting at just \u003cstrong\u003e$2 per month\u003c/strong\u003e you get to see \u003cstrong\u003eand physically own\u003c/strong\u003e my work. With your support I will reach my goal of being a sustainable artist, grow, and be able to focus entirely on the creation of new work to share with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you in advance for any of your support. I hope you choose to become a Patron, and welcome to my journey!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(191, 191, 191);\"\u003eLegal: All images and content posted here are copyrighted henceforth and not for distribution.
