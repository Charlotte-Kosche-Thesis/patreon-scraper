    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, my name is Aaron (you may know me as Sugarpill) and I have been creating covers on YouTube for quite a while now. I decided to start this Patreon page as a way for any of my fans, or for those of you who are able to afford it, to donate money to the channel, which will then help to improve the content that I produce for you all to watch. As I\u0027m sure you have heard, the amount of money that you earn on YouTube these days is really very little, especially when you\u0027re a small channel like mine, and the money that I do make from Adsense earnings is pretty poor at best. I\u0027d really love to be able to dedicate more time to improving my channel, and this is where you come in. I am currently holding down a part-time job, alongside my YouTube and tab commitments, so your pledges would really help to make my YouTube content become my main priority.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow\u00a0Your Pledge Will Help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany people may have the assumption that making covers on YouTube doesn\u0027t cost a thing - and in theory, they are correct - however, if you want to continuously upgrade your equipment (with better audio / visual equipment, new instruments, etc) and dedicate hours of time to creating content on YouTube, then this certainly costs a lot of money and takes up a great deal of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the money I make from pledges will be invested back into the channel, one way or another. That may be in obvious things like new equipment, instruments, and so on, or, it may even just be simple things like me not having to work so much overtime at my job, so that I can spend more time creating the content that I like to make - and which I hope you all enjoy to watch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, please know that if you can\u0027t afford to pledge anything, then it really doesn\u0027t matter, just watching my videos or subscribing to my channel helps, and I appreciate every bit of support that I get, so I really don\u0027t want anyone to feel obliged to donate. As long as you know you\u0027ll be able to without any issues, then I\u0027m happy, but otherwise, just keep watching the content that I post and know that every bit of support you throw my way helps!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow It Works\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt the start of each month, your Patreon pledge - whether that is $1, $3 etc - will be taken and invested back into the channel. I will use the money to purchase better audio hardware, new camera equipment and lighting set up, and just general improvements to my videos. Obviously I won\u0027t be buying new equipment every month, but just know that your money is always going to be used to help better the channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor pledging to my channel, you will receive a whole host of different rewards, depending on the amount that you\u0027ve chosen to pledge. Be sure to take a good look at all the different rewards that are on offer, and if you\u0027ve got any cool little ideas for things that you think I could be offering as Patreon rewards, then be sure to let me know!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummery\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo.. with your help, I\u0027d love to be able to dedicate even more time to improving my channel / content, and who knows, maybe even one day I\u0027ll be able to do this thing full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn summation, any amount that you are able to pledge (big or small) will really help, and allow me to continuously improve the content that I make, for you all to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e"
