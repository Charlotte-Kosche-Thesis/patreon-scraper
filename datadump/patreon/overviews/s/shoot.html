Its stories are crafted by world-class photographers, people keen to bring the story back to the music photography they produce. In the stories, we see struggle, fear, triumph. We see real people, identify with real characters. We know that music is in here, somewhere. We want to know the stories about the culture, uncensored, unfiltered, with no bullshit. We know that if we want to possess the works, we could. But we hesitate because we would want the whole story. Not just that band. Not just that shot. We want the immersion into that experience that lights a fire in us and makes us breathe out in anticipation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is our vision for \u003cstrong\u003eShoot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s no bullshit in \u003cstrong\u003eShoot.\u003c/strong\u003e Even in the works of fiction, there is no bullshit.
