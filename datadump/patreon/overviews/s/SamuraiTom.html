My real name is Thomas and I\u0027m\u00a0a YouTuber from Hephzibah Georgia and I am 19 years old and I love anime and gaming and I\u0027m just a loveable nerd/geek/otaku so i\u0027ve been told. My YouTube channel is heavily inspired by my very own favorite YouTubers Coryxkenshin and 8-Bit Ryan so like any small timer like me I hope one day I can just meet them and say \"Thank You\" and I hope one day I inspire someone like me or anyone for that fact to start a channel or to just be the best person they can be and do what they love to do like how Cory and Ryan have in inspired me because this right here..... \"YouTube\" is what I love to do...\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eInitially, I didn\u0027t want to create a patreon I don\u0027t know why it\u0027s likely somehow connected to my feelings and how I think people view me as individual and because of this I was always usually antisocial and missed a lot of opportunities\u00a0but I eventually got over that bad habit and now I\u0027m\u00a0more social and able to actually communicate. You all watched my videos until we reached the first milestone which was 10,000 views and truthfully I was thinking maybe it was too soon to create a patreon but you all actually wanted me to which was a surprise to me because I was thinking why would someone donate \"anything\" I\u0027m not special... but you all showed me that I am special and that you love and care and actually enjoy my content and I thank you for all your love and kindness it means so much to me.\u003c/div\u003e"

     "about": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eI am 19 years old and I am from Hephzibah, Georgia\u00a0a small city outside of Augusta. So I have basically been watching anime my whole life with the first anime I watched being InuYasha then Dragon Ball and so on. As for gaming, I\u0027ve\u00a0been gaming since I was 5 maybe and the first system I played on was the Game Boy Advanced and I had Mario and that was it then a year later my uncle gave me his Nintendo64.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eSo as you can see I\u0027m quite the familiar geek/otaku, even tho that seems spectacular, just like a lot of people I haven\u0027t really had it easy, you see my mom raised me and my 3 siblings on her own and my father was rarely there and I\u0027m talking about after he got out of jail. I don\u0027t really communicate with him because he\u0027s nothing close to what I was told a father should be like so I ended up pushing myself away from him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn high school, i was really shy and didn\u0027t really communicate with many people but I did, however,\u00a0have friends which kinda sets me apart from most kids who have been in similar situations, Although, some friends left and that hurt but new ones came to take their place Anthony, Miguel, Angel, Quondrell, Ariel, Falise +more. Now I have more \"close\" friends than I could possibly imagine and they are always there for me and help me through my troubles. \"Thank you, friends, I love you guys\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s more\u00a0I\u0027d like to tell you but a lot\u00a0of it is hazy but or I just don\u0027t feel comfortable enough to talk about it but I have been bullied more than once and that made my middle school years kinda sucky but thanks to those same friends I mentioned before I became more confident and stern with my personality and I never really got bullied or picked on anymore. long story short don\u0027t\u00a0bully people that makes\u00a0you a coward because in actuality your only doing it because your too insecure to face your own problems or fears, and for those of you being bullied or know someone being bullied or even if you have suicidal thoughts speak up it\u0027ll make you feel a lot better kiddo and put an end to your misery and trust me I know how it feels. like I said you bullies STOP because that\u0027s one of the main causes of teen suicide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
