She also writes fantasy, sci-fi, and speculative fiction, and is currently working on editing her most recent story Hunting Blackbirds, for publication. Her works of fiction are made available to Patrons, both completed stories and chapters from\u00a0new works as they are being written.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnia lives in Ottawa with her two dogs: Tsuki and CJ. She recently split up from her partner of 7 years and is taking a break from relationships to explore single life for a while.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of her greatest desires is to create a community of disabled artists of different types who all live together and support each other. Jokingly referring to it as her techno-hippie commune, she envisions a space where she and several like-minded friends each have their own spaces, but also share resources like energy, skills, money, etc. to make life easier for all of them. In addition they could share studio space and help keep each other motivated. For her own part, she is also excited about being able to build her own smoke house, green house, and maybe even a bakehouse, where she could really expand her various culinary creations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently Ania lives on Ontario Disability Support, which is not enough to live on, and most especially not enough to guarantee regular access to her medication. She supplements her income (with full knowledge of the disability\u00a0program) with her writing, selling her art, as well as teaching on skillshare and youtube, taking on odd jobs here and there. In addition, she usually finds herself having to crowdfund to cover incidental costs as well as the pain medication that is not covered by disability. She dreams of a time when she will no longer have to beg for money online.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fykz1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/20840735_10102006783812166_2276883809798375215_n.jpg?oh=1587b2aa84081c2d61c349b9624db698\u0026amp;oe=5A20FC8F\" style=\"width: 344px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eIn addition to writing, blogging, and painting, Ania is also a member of her local Community Garden and\u00a0Oven.\u00a0She helps with their many events, as well as organizing and managing their social media, and volunteering with their regular bakes. She has also participated in community kitchens where she teachers different fun cooking techniques to anyone who is interested. Most recently she demonstrated how to smoke meat on a regular charcoal BBQ.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fykz1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/21034610_10102016096274916_7756964431399787571_n.jpg?oh=ce5d5442e820666fac4042185d8b6a15\u0026amp;oe=5A57A486\" style=\"width: 330px; text-align: start; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Community Oven has also recently created a startup called the\u00a0Street Foods Collective, which features 13 women, with some supporting men, who get together to make street foods from different cultures. They select a theme and once a month they feature foods related to that theme at a local farmers market. The current collective includes women from many different cultures, many of whom are recent additions to Canada\u0027s population tapestry, all of whom get a chance to get the certifications they need to be involved in the food industry, as well as an introduction to being involved in a new start up as well as running a business. Most recently, Ania was selling her pierogi as part of the Kitchen\u0027s of Europe theme, which was very well received. Along with the other main volunteers, she is working on helping to develop a plan to both continue empowering the current collective members, as well as opening up the same opportunity to new members next year.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e"
