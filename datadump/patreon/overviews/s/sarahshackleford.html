My very first story was about a brown-haired girl with a pet duckling. (Hint: It was me.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I got a little older, I wrote to express myself- a tough school day, my first kiss, a fight with mom; it was my soul on paper.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an adult, writing keeps my life tumbling forward, constantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have learned to love the process of writing. I have written several books, but my debut novel is set to be published by Wordwraith Books on May 2nd! And, let me tell you, writing and publishing a book costs some money. Because Wordwraith Books is an independent, small publisher, I\u0027ve had to put a lot of my own money (along with my blood, sweat, tears, and endless strings of curse words) into making my dream a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here. I may not be the next great American novelist, but writing is my purpose, and behind every great writer is a sea of supporters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#SupportIndieAuthors"
