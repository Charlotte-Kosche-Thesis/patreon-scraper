    "summary": "Hi! and thank you for checking out Skull Karak Studios Patreon page! My name is Ricky Hammack, founder of Skull Karak Studios, and I would like to tell you why I decided to make Skull Karak Studios and the future goals of this business start up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSkull Karak studios is my attempt at making a community driven business. Originally it was planned to just be a video game company, but that changed for the better!  It is now planned to be a community driven business, and what I mean by that is I want to try and give Artists like 3D designers, 2D animators, YouTuber start up\u0027s, new Twitch streamer, singer, drummer, whatever type of artist you may be, a job. Currently we are trying to raise money to get the business started, and doing side projects while we do so, such as the first book idea, The Last Dragon\u2019s Breath. The money we make from this Patreon will be mostly used to get that book published, after that however it\u2019s time to play ball! All money made after the book is published, as well as the sales from the book,  will go to creating the business. I hope this helps give an idea, and if not, don\u0027t be afraid to send an email, I\u0027ll get back to you as quick as possible to answer any questions! Thank you again for reading!"
