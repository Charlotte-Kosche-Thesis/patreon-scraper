My wife \u0026amp; I moved to Lethbridge in July, and since then I have been documenting our experiences and adventures in Southern Alberta.  I use my webcomic to share about the people that I meet, the stories that I hear and as a means of learning more about the history and context of Southern Alberta.  \u003cbr\u003e\nHow often is Slaughterhouse Slough updated?\u003cbr\u003e\nSlaughterhouse Slough updates every week on Mondays.  This means there would be 4 updates in a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nHow will I be charged? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nPatreon.com has created the means of micro-patronage through subscription donations.  Comic fans can sign up, decide on a patronage amount and eagerly await new content. Patreon.com also allows you to put a cap on how much you\u2019re willing to be charged each month so you won\u2019t be charged beyond your maximum amount.  You are in control of your pledges, and you can modify or cancel your patronage at any time before you are charged. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt the end of the month, Patreon adds up the number of comics I posted during that time.  If I updated 4 times, that means you will see 4 charges ($1 per comic X 4= $4). \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq?ftyp=patrons\"\u003e You can find more info in the FAQ.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy are you on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nI am very lucky to get so much supportive feedback from the people of Lethbridge, telling me they love what I am doing and that there isn\u0027t really anyone else doing what I do here. I\u0027m often asked about how the good people of Lethbridge can support Slaughterhouse Slough.  T-shirts and Mini-book sales help to keep this comic going, but not everyone is a \"t-shirt person\" (I hear that a lot.).  I provide this comic FREE on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Slaughterhouseslough.com and that will not change.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat happens if you are sick and miss a post?\u003cbr\u003e\nIf I am unable to post a comic because I am ill, away or otherwise indisposed, there would be no charge that week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhat do I get for pledging?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI do not have a hierarchical rewards program, but that isn\u0027t really what micro-patronage is all about anyways.  This is your opportunity to directly support a LOCAL comic-strip, to help facilitate internet content that you actually like, and to know that you are a part of the sharing of the stories and people celebrated by Slaughterhouse Slough. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nPledge $1+ per comic: \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I will be very grateful. \u00a0You will also receive a download of the entire run of comic strips I created while living in Moncton, New Brunswick.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nPledge $5+ per comic: \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0 I will be really, really, really grateful.  I mean...wow! \u00a0You will also receive a download of the entire run of comic strips I created while living in Moncton, New Brunswick.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nPledge $10+ per comic: \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 I will be super grateful and will probably even give you a hug if I get to meet you. \u00a0You will also receive a download of the entire run of comic strips I created while living in Moncton, New Brunswick.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank so much, and I look forward to seeing you soon in Slaughterhouse Slough!\u003cbr\u003e"
