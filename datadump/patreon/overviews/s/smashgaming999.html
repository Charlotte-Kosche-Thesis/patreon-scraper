In A Nutshell\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuite some time ago I, Frazzz, started\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SmashGaming999\"\u003eSmash GaminG!!\u003c/a\u003e as a way to express myself through games, either doing playthroughs, collaborations with great friends and eventually extending this into first impression videos (Smash Looks!). It has grown to the extent I never thought possible, I\u0027m able to bring new and unreleased games through Smash Looks, play some of my favourite games as Let\u0027s Plays and even discover some new ones. Content on the channel varies across the board from RTS, FPS, Survival and a bunch of others in there too.\u00a0I couldn\u0027t be more thankful to people that show Smash GaminG!! support and enjoy the content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eSo Why Here?\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve taking to Patreon for a few reasons, I\u0027ve thought about this a thousand times and put it to the viewers and fans themselves and its been a resounding honest yes to putting this together. With a little extra support I can potentially grow Smash Gaming to be bigger, better and more consistent. I do my best to provide a regular and consistent timing of my content, but even sometimes I find it difficult. I\u0027d love for YouTube and Streaming to turn into a full-time thing. I could do so much that way and I hope the rewards reflect this to those that choose to support me in my en-devour. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContent?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs mentioned above the content varies quite a bit, I take pride in everything I put on my channel. Smash Looks which is a first impressions series has grown into it\u0027s own prominent show that allows viewers to get a great in-depth look at new and unreleased titles. As for Playthroughs well they even range themselves from big triple A titles to little indies, it is based on games I love, have fun with and get alot of enjoyment from. If am not having fun the viewer isn\u0027t, therefore I strive to find titles I enjoy playing that way it comes across to whoever has taken the time out of their day to watch my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s In It For Those That Pledge?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is most certainly odd putting this together in hopes people like the content enough to support here, any that do are awesome and those that even just watch are as well! So rewards, goals and all that good stuff? I hope that my rewards reflect the aim of things, I want this to grow I want to give back in my own way too and bring more great content to the channel. Hopefully you do like the ideas I have put together as I\u0027ve never managed to put something of this scale together so take a gander and see what you think. More so the big milestones, these are in place to allow for those that pledge to see what we\u0027re aiming for, there is some small ones and big ones. I have thought for quite some time on them and hope they show well enough for what is being aimed at. They could alter slightly, but am sure they are pretty good ground work for now.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome Last Thank Words\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyone who chooses to pledge even a little to this will have my eternal gratitude. This is simply here to help things along a little. If you decide to jump in here, thank you! Even if you don\u0027t thank you for taking the time to check this out and enjoy the content on the channel. I will never subtract anything from the channel and hopefully with this I can do that little bit more, so from the bottom of my heart, thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I work full-time outside of YouTube and this takes time away from Smash Gaming and sometimes it can affect actual upload times. I\u0027ve had many times where things can go wrong and have no time to fix them till later, I really do hate not managing to get the content up for those waiting patiently for the next episode or Smash Look at something new and exciting. Thus this was calculated on what the national minimum wage would be full time.
