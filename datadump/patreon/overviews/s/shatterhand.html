    "summary": "Dear fans/followers/listeners...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic has been my biggest passion in life since as long as I can remember. My whole life has revolved around creating music and writing songs. Few things in my life is as rewarding as sharing my art with other people and to hear, read and see their reactions. I\u0027ve been lucky enough to gather quite a large following, at least more than I could ever have dreamed of. And I\u0027ve been blessed with the fact that people seem to appreciate what I do, so I keep doing it and I work and struggle hard. Between the year 2009 until 2013 I released a crazy amount of music. All in all about 10 albums, which is more than some artists release their whole careers. I live and breathe music. New songs are constantly popping up in my head and I can\u0027t wait to record them. In 2013 I started a project called \"Dookiefied\" which was my way of adding some 90\u0027s touch to the newer Green Day songs. Again, people seemed to appreciate it and I gathered an even larger following. This made me work harder and harder and I released a new cover almost every week for a year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut with a full time job, two kids and a whole other bunch of must do\u0027s my health started to decline. In 2014 I was diagnosed with burn out syndrome and I haven\u0027t really fully recovered since. I wanted to make music so badly that it took me over completely. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still dream of one day doing this for a living. I\u0027m not talking about making loads of money or being famous. That is not of interest to me whatsoever. I just want to be able to have time to share more music with you guys. I have so many ideas, so many songs still unwritten and so many covers I want to record...but, I also have a job to attened to and I somehow have to earn my living. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy my music and feel like supporting me and my art, I guess this is one way to do it. Any contribution will mean the world to me. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love\u003cbr\u003eDaniel Shatterhand\u003cbr\u003e"
