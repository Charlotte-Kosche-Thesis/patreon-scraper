So I figured I should put all of it in a blender and do some videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/l378mJtpZGSMnRdza/giphy.gif\" style=\"width: 646px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuper Political compass is one of those tasty YouTube channels about the stuff we love: fiction. The twist is that we try to explore the sociopolitics\u00a0behind our heroes and where they land in the political compass.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to use Iron Man and Professor Xavier to talk about philanthropy,\u00a0 Captain America to talk about freedom, Leonidas to draw some insights about nationalism and discover how the Lion King is a coming of age movie with some heavy political self-discovery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBear in mind, this is not a channel about conspiracies or propaganda. I do this because I believe we humans are used to see the world in black and white, good and evil, as if we all belong in different cages in a menagerie. But the world isn\u0027t like that. It\u0027s not a zoo, it\u0027s a jungle. Albeit we might try to hide it, we are all different and we think different. We live in interlinked and complicated environments. Our luck depends on each other.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this project my hope is that while exploring the heroes we love and look up to we can understand how sociopolitical and economical views shape society and our character. And with Patreon I want to fuel Super Political Compass with the help of its own community, to make it bigger and better that I could ever make it on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--Cris.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWill you only make videos about superheroes?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/em\u003eNope, fictional characters.
