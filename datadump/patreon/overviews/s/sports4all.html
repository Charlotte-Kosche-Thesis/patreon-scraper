Regardless of how well a child performs academically, these skills cannot be\u00a0acquired in the classroom (theoretical learning), but through experiential learning,\u00a0where the\u00a0safest method is through organised sports. Where most sports coaching organisations focus only on skill acquisition (which forms a false\u00a0belief in many children that they will because elite athletes),\u00a0Sports Intelligence UK Mentoring\u00a0addresses the skills that a child will depend on in adult life. \u003cbr\u003eVery few schools can afford us to attend their schools in person, so if you share our passion,\u00a0please support the podcast by making a monthly pledge (of your choice), where we can continue bring this service virtually to everyone."

     "about": "www.patreon.com/sports4all\u003cbr\u003eThe sports coaching for children industry has boomed over the last 15 years. A gap in the market has opened up to be exploited and that is \u0027using sport as a means to entertain children\u0027. As long as children are active it is always a good thing - as long as they can afford it. But what about the children who cannot? Well they simply have to go without. Ironically, I have found time and time again that these children are the real talent, whilst the more affluent children are just being entertained by their coach, the less privileged use 2 coats as goal-posts and push themselves against real competition. the problem is they are not developing the most important life skill -teamwork. Sports Intelligence UK is an new initiative created to serve the community. By raising money from the public, we aim to provide tournaments, school coaching mentoring at either a subsidised rate or even free for those children who really need it.\u003cbr\u003e",
