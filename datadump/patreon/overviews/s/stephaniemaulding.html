    "summary": "Photo retouching is my profession and it is my passion, but over the years, it\u0027s gotten a bad reputation as a social ill that must be remedied. Ultimately, I don\u0027t buy into the narrative that retouching is inherently bad. I believe in something I call ethical retouching and body positive retouching. I believe that through dialog and education, we can change the digital photography and commercial imaging fields to create a healthier media landscape.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m a full time freelance retoucher, formerly trained as a photographer. I\u0027ve been working freelance in the field of photographic imaging for about 10 years and have held prominent positions at a number of companies doing photography, post production, and fashion logistics. I have always had a lot of love and passion for my field but have also always had concerns about the ethics involved in digital imaging enhancement and mass media, so over the years I\u0027ve developed a strong code of conduct when it comes to my work and have passionately researched many subjects connected to the ethics of digital photography and retouching. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past year, I\u0027ve launched my blog, \u003ca href=\"http://www.imperfectedblog.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eImperfected\u003c/a\u003e, to explore these ethics in a more public way that is accessible to both image creators and to the general media-consuming public. I want to appeal to both and really start a dialog between the two. My overarching goal is to change the retouching and photography industries through education about ethical, body positive retouching. I also want to educate media consumers about retouching and other media matters so that they can have a better relationship with their bodies in an environment full of sometimes unrealistic ideals. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI primarily explore issues related to body image, but also touch on other aspects of commercial image ethics. I go into both philosophy and technique and I exhibit both work I\u0027ve done on other artists\u0027 images and photographic work of my own.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spend a lot of my time writing and a lot of my time creating demo images to use with my articles. I\u0027m also beginning to create video content. As you can imagine, this takes a lot of time and resources. So far, I\u0027ve been going it alone, but I could really use your help if you believe in my message and my mission! Your support will help me produce higher quality content with more frequency.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of my regular expenses include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Producing photoshoots so I have raw content to work with (expenses: props, disposables, makeup, stylists, facilities, transportation, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e-Web Hosting fees\u003cbr\u003e-Software Subscriptions\u003cbr\u003e-Equipment and Repairs\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I manage to get to a certain funding goal, I\u0027d also like to embark on an ambitious fashion-portrait photo project adjacent to Imperfected to enhance the blog\u0027s message. (\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/all-bodies-are-4146250\"\u003eRead More\u003c/a\u003e) To do this, I need upgraded gear, printing materials or services, and framing supplies. If I manage to start this project, I will make a special edition print only for my Patreon sponsors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know it\u0027s a lofty goal to change an entire industry, but every revolution starts with the smallest of efforts. I do believe that digital imaging will take its place in the greater narrative of art history. But first, we need to have a conversation contextualizing these new tools and putting them into an ethical perspective.\u003cbr\u003e"

When it comes to retouching, I \nbelieve in staying as loyal to the original image as possible and I \nbelieve in natural and realistic retouching on people. My style is \ndistinctive but refined.
