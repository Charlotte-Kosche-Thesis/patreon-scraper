Together with my partner and conspirator, Winter, we tour several months out of the year, and seek to create a feeling of enchantment for our listeners.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past few years this Patreon has helped ensure that we carve out time each month to actually create, instead of getting bogged down in all the business details involved in keeping an independent music career afloat. So thank you for that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow we are taking time off the road, and dedicating this Patreon to a new venture - an album and art book based on the myths of the sea! With your support, we will have the time to really dig into this, researching different legends, fine tuning the music and art until it brings spine-tingling chills, and then releasing it to the world, dedicating 20% of the proceeds to an organization committed to restoring our oceans. (Haven\u0027t chosen one yet).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will post once or twice monthly on the progress, and you\u0027ll get each iteration of the art and songs. We\u0027ll also make video as we can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow you are not only helping us continue to put beauty into the world, you are helping to restore the health of our oceans! So hooray for that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMake art! Revere beauty! Save the world! (Or at least help it out a little). \u00a0:+)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are new to Winter\u0027s and my music, you can learn more here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sharonknight.net.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.sharonknight.net.\u003c/a\u003e"
