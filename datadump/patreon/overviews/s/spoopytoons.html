Fair enough. While any and everything we make is available to everyone, certain things, extra things, are awarded and made available to Patrons. No, its not access to secret blogs or ahead of schedule releases. In a sense, you\u0027re donations would go towards being more active in the creation process of these things. Offering up ideas, contributing voices, joining the group and actively getting inside knowledge on what we plan. You would also be helping us to improve out equipment in order to bring the best quality to our projects. In addition to that, your support will also go a long way towards helping out the our artist and editor of the entire project, Spirit Shift as he makes the transition to a full on from his Regular old Colleg to a brand spanking new ART COLLEG!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main thing to remember here is that we aren\u0027t trying to become a full on business. We just want to have fun with what we do, and your support will make that much easier. Videos will come out faster, and we can be more carefree if we know that people are behind us when we spend excessive, almost obsessive time on some projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love what we do, and we want it to reach as many people as possible. Not to mention we love giving people what they want. That\u0027s why we made this Patreon in the first place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally the meaning behind \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePer main Episode\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003emeans that the Patreon donation will only activate whenever a main numbered episode comes out. Not for Flowey Vines, Not for Bloops, and not for Songs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I think this is just long enough so I\u0027ll end it here. The basic point is that we all love what we do, we want people to feel as involved as possible, and to have a hand in our choices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
