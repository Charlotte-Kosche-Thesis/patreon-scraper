    "summary": "First I would like to thank all my readers and patrons who have followed me here and continue to support my work. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Chiamaka Umeasiegbu Kennedy, and I spend a lot of time writing. On this platform, I curate them using the \"Salute to Jollof\" brand. I am a mid thirties Nigerian woman, now living in England. Although my day job is management, writing is my first love and I have written for as long as I can remember. I started out writing a literary review column pro bono for\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://leadership.ng/\"\u003eLeadership Newspaper Nigeria\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003eand left after about six months to start my journey into international development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor 7 years, I treated writing as a hobby while working in international development, an area that I am passionate about, particularly the protection of vulnerable groups and the reduction of disease burden. In\u00a0Togo, I was a language assimilation volunteer on a community radio show,\u00a0in Scotland I provided support to women affected by domestic violence and abuse, and in Nigeria, I worked for the United Nations Development Program in pre-amnesty Niger Delta. I also worked for other donor funded partners to prevent HIV/AIDS and reduce the resulting stigma, and to prevent and control Malaria.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis exposure to social and international development informs a lot of my writing which you can find on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://annechia.com/2015/04/20/ghana-must-go-nigerias-expulsion-of-immigrants/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efreedom square\u003c/a\u003e where I have a variety of free content. You can find one of my earlier\u003ca href=\"https://www.africanwriter.com/my-maidenhead-a-short-story-by-chiamaka-umeasiegbu/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e short stories\u00a0here\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eand latest\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dangerouswomenproject.org/2016/05/24/triumphant-non-conformist-daughter/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esocial commentary here\u003c/a\u003e as well. This space will allow me to to carry\u00a0on writing, because I enjoy storytelling. I intend to explore three areas of interest within my creative space:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) Short fiction-\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eMy genre of preference is the short story, but I also write poetry and plays. I will publish one short story here every 4 weeks at the minimum, and I am currently working on a potential podcast play series. The end goal is to have a short story collection to be published by December 2018, and thereafter to produce and direct a podcast play series once I reach 1000 patrons. Occasionally, I will write a piece of poetry which will most likely be a Haiku.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) Research Pieces: History 101- \u003c/strong\u003eI will publish essays on varied content once a month. These pieces will vary; from contemporary politics, to the history of the world\u0027s institutions, evolution of political systems, movement of people and present day economics.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) Podcasts-\u003c/strong\u003e I will post a weekly podcast of life really. This could be areas of personal interest or trending topics, or contemporary issues taking place on the African continent and elsewhere in the world. Additionally, I plan to share experiences and my journey as an immigrant living in England. I will also share ghost stories if it is fitting, from week to week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) Weekly Series-\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI am currently working on the writing of the weekly series which is a political satire. Episodes are published as often as I can. The goal eventually is to begin to finalise, then produce and direct these for podcast and radio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I have written a blog since February 2013 which I call my \u003ca href=\"https://annechia.com/2015/04/20/ghana-must-go-nigerias-expulsion-of-immigrants/\"\u003efreedom square\u003c/a\u003e, where I publish articles for free; some \"serious\", others \"light\", I treated it as a serious hobby. More\u00a0recently, I have committed to moving my writing to more regular creations, as I am currently looking after my little sprog full time. All writers, or patrons of writers, know that submission of manuscripts to established magazines, journals and publishers can be quite a tedious process with very lengthy turnaround time; the waiting and the rejections can take their toll and income from writing can be sporadic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter Patreon; this platform is a brilliant idea, and I jumped at the opportunity of putting my work directly out there to interested and paying patrons. These are very exciting times, the internet provides an incredible opportunity to writers like myself, to keep pushing and plodding along. The whole point of writing is to have someone read your work, thus publishing my work on patreon is an excellent way to keep me going, the subscription angle makes\u00a0 it a sustainable way to keep the research and fiction writing going\u2014and that\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA reader can contribute whatever amount they wish to, per month and the contribution or subscription fee is recurring each month. You will find below my list of subscription fees; anything from $1 per month and above, are very dearly appreciated. The most poignant way to describe it is to\u00a0 view it like your Netflix subscription, the only difference is that the content is practically free and you are rewarded\u00a0for your level of subscription.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
