    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\n*** Official intro video full of information and Scinder Scythe sultriness will be up as soon as I\u0027m happy with it, which could be a while. In the meantime, please enjoy this short sample of my work.\u00a0Dawn Time-Lapse 1: over 40 minutes condensed into under 30 seconds. It is lit entirely with natural light and is completely unedited. The fade-in effect is caused by the sunrise coming in through my studio windows. NSFW: nudity. By entering the password you certify that you are over 18. Password: beastlove ***\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tHello, my Beasties.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am so excited to welcome you to the beginnings of Scinder Scythe\u2019s House of Vexation. Scinder Scythe started as a fantasy and grows more real every day. She is sexy, sinister, and strange; a personification of my dark side. One might say she\u2019s my evil twin. She\u2019s also very photogenic.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nScinder Scythe. Scinder: like cinder, like smoldering fire, like Cinderella, but with an \u201cS\u201d like sin, sin-der (and like scythe). Scythe: like death, like harvest, like bleak autumn, a tool, a weapon, sharp, bloody. Scinder Scythe looks deep into taboos, darkness, mysteries. Scinder Scythe indefatigably digs for the most twisted, shriveled, vulnerable, hated, repressed, fearful and feared parts of the human soul and she loves them as if they were shining angels. I do my best to translate the results into images.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eScinder Scythe focuses on self-portrait photography and videography. Scinder Scythe germinated on Instagram (see feed \u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/scinderscythe\"\u003e@scinderscythe\u003c/a\u003e), is growing to the next level here on Patreon, and will soon (hopefully) be a stand-alone website/web magazine. In the future, Scinder Scythe may expand into the world of live performance, and the House of Vexation may host live events.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor those of you who are new to Patreon, here\u2019s a little bit about how it works. Patreon is an ongoing, crowd-funded platform. If you like my work and think it deserves to survive and perhaps thrive, you can pledge any amount of money from $3 a month, to, well, the sky is the limit. A minimum pledge of $3/month gets you access to exclusive Patreon content for as long as you continue to support. The minimum pledge is $3, but you are free to give any amount you wish. \u00a0Your pledge amount will be automatically charged to your credit card once a month. You can cancel anytime without penalty. There are more details about the rewards that come with your pledge, as well as how to edit your pledge amount, in the rewards section on the right hand side of this page.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll of the money raised on Patreon will go directly into my work as Scinder Scythe. I am a solo artist. I work for tips part-time to pay for food and rent. I live in my studio. I do not employ any assistants. I do all my own work: sets, costumes, hair, makeup, filming, photography, sound, editing, touch-up, color correction; pre-production, production, and post-production. I live frugally and am very passionate about my work. I will make your dollars go far.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eEvery single dollar and word of support means the world to me. Thank you so so much for all you do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove your beasties. Fuck your monsters. Vex your lovers. #houseofvexation\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
