Or women\u2019s history? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOur history books only gives us selected parts of what has been accomplished throughout time. I\u2019m on my soapbox here!\u003cbr\u003e\nLet me give you a few examples:\u003cbr\u003e\n* The first african american pilot with an international license was a woman!\u003cbr\u003e\n* The first woman to run for president in USA did so already in 1872!\u003cbr\u003e\nOr gay people...\u003cbr\u003e\n* One of the most influential people, ever, of theatre arts was a gay man. He completely transformed the stage into the multi-arts-form we know today, and no one knows his name.\u003cbr\u003e\n* And the person organizing The Washington march of the civil rights movement, gathering 200 000 people in mere 2 months was also a gay man. Why is he erased from history books?\u003cbr\u003e\n* Eleanor Roosevelt and Loren Hicock had a passionate relationship, lasting for decades. Liking it or not, it\u2019s a fact!\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m out to create a movement and change all this. \u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m out to create The Hub of information where people go to find the facts that have been denied to all of us due to gender and lgbtq prejudice. \u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m out to change the story we have been fed for centuries, because it is a FALSE story!\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I can\u2019t do this all alone. I need help. I need you! And you know what? I think you need me to, or at least the information I\u2019m here to provide.\u003cbr\u003e\nSo \u003cbr\u003e\nIf you identifying yourself as LGBTQ, in any shape or form \u003cbr\u003e\nIf you are parent, child, close friend to an LGBTQ person\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you have youngsters around you, kids, grandchildren in search of powerful role models\u003cbr\u003e\nIf any of this applies to you, then my mission is your mission.\u003cbr\u003e\nLet\u2019s put the historic records straight.
