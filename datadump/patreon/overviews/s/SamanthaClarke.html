My poetry is my art; my craft. It\u0027s what I\u0027d be doing anyway even if there were no jobs, no revolution to fight for, and no worries.

I spend a shit ton of\nmy time organizing, rallying, reading, meeting and protesting.

Whatevs. Thing is, if\nyou\u2019re helping support me, you\u2019re helping support everything I do. I don\u2019t get\npaid for most of the actually useful stuff I do for the world, so if I\u2019m gonna\nkeep doing it, I have to rely on your support and generosity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eHow it works:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is pretty sweet, TBH. It\u2019s kinda like Kickstarter or GoFundMe except it\u2019s monthly instead of for one project at a time, and I get to keep any pledges I get even if the total doesn\u2019t meet my \u201cgoal.\u201d The goal is just there to give you a sense of what the money you share is being used for (popsicles and blow, duh).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor real though, I work only part-time outside of this stuff, and it\u0027s not entirely stable, so the money you share with me is actually helping me eat, have shelter, feed my cats, and buy books (you know, the basics). I rely on your support for survival, otherwise I would have to work full-time and I wouldn\u0027t be able to do all the things I outlined above.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo you \u201cpledge\u201d at whichever tier offers the rewards you want, and it automatically comes out every month like your Netflix subscription, so you get to support me and get sweet shit for it without having to go through the motions every time! And I get to eat! Yay!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out my rewards section and if you\u2019re looking for something particular that you don\u2019t see, hit me up and let me know. I\u2019m always taking suggestions! That\u2019s actually part of the beauty of this site; it provides a more direct way for you to let me know what my supporters want more or less of from me, and lets me gather valuable feedback.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time out of your day to read this self-important article about why you should give me your hard-earned money!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease help, I am so very poor!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;3"
