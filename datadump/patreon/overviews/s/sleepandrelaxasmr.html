It\u0027s a passion project I won\u0027t give up on, but it does require plenty of time and money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, Sleep and Relax ASMR can create more episodes, improve it\u0027s hardware and software, as well as hire staff to help produce more content without sacrificing quality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, we can create unique Sleep and Relax ASMR merch and products to help fulfill the show\u0027s mission of helping thousands of people around the world sleep and relax!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration, and don\u0027t be shy to send the show a message if you have any questions :).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGeorge\u003cbr\u003eCreator of Sleep and Relax ASMR\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ewww.SleepandRelaxASMR\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eiTunes:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/sleep-and-relax-asmr/id1133320064?mt=2\"\u003ehttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/sleep-and-rela...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStitcher: \u003ca href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/sleep-and-relax-asmr\"\u003ehttps://www.stitcher.com/podcast/sleep-and-relax-a...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
