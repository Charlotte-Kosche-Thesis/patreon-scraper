    "summary": "I am a lifelong martial artist, having trained and been involved for most of my life. \u00a0I know more than anyone how difficult it is to be (a) really great at martial arts and (b) make a career out of teaching martial arts/running events. I have always been into photography , film making and art in general! \u00a0I am also a huge lover of travel, meeting new people and seeing new places. \u00a0One day, I decided that it would be a really great idea if I could combine all that into one thing! \u00a0Thus, the Warrior Collective was born!! \u00a0Essentially, I visit martial arts instructors across the UK and Europe (although with more support, I hope to expand this to all across the globe!) and film them teaching tutorials and/or any other cool video content from their martial art(s). \u00a0I do this so that (a) more people get to see how good these instructors are and promote them to as big an audience as possible and (b) help create an ever expanding FREE online resource filled with the absolute best martial arts based tutorials and videos available on the web! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not just about one particular martial art, I love them all, I literally want to film and document as many different instructors and systems as I possibly can for YOU (ok, ok, it also so that I can get to meet them as well, being the ultimate fan boy that I am ha ha)!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere do you come in I hear you ask? \u00a0Well, essentially, the more support I get from people interested in seeing more of what I do, the further afield I can travel to film, the better quality the videos and most importantly the more great instructors, schools and events get seen and in doing so help further grow/develop both the Martial Arts and the Warrior Collective!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
