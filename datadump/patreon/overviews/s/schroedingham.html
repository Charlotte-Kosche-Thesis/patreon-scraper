Distance, dysentery, and disco have all taken their toll, but you\u0027ve survived and let us be the first to welcome you to Schroedingham! Schroedingham is a place where dreams come true...well, at least if you dream about harmonicas and slide guitars being recorded on videos and songs! 2016 was a great year for your Sheriffs; we released about a dozen high production value videos as well as a critically acclaimed full length instrumental record, \u003cem\u003eGoing to the Sun\u003c/em\u003e. We couldn\u0027t have possibly done it without the fine Patrons of our cherished Schroedingham---nothing gets done around here without ya\u0027ll and we can\u0027t thank you enough for your generous support! But this is just the beginning, and we have bigger, better, and bluesier conquests to undertake...and we\u0027re gonna need a few more hardy settlers to come along and help us get \u0027er done. First up, a series of videos with the notorious Nataly Dawn (of Pomplamoose)...join us, won\u0027t you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
