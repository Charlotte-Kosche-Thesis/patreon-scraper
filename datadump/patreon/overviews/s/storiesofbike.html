This limits what we can shoot, when and where we can shoot and how regularly we can put out an episode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, as travel and accommodation can get costly, we\u0027re pretty much limited to shooting around my home in Sydney, Australia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, with your support we can invest in more equipment and travel to and shoot in more hard to access locations and even shoot in countries outside of Australia!. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut most importantly, we can spend more time on crafting high quality episodes that you\u0027ve come to expect and release them more often.
