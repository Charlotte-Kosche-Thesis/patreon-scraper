    "summary": "The Secret Life of Weddings is a new comedy podcast co-hosted by professional wedding photographers Lisa Mark \u0026amp; Rebecca Lozer. We feature true wedding stories sent in by listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey guys! Here\u0027s a little about us and why we\u0027re starting a Patreon account:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Situation: We are Rebecca Lozer \u0026amp; Lisa Mark - 2 Canadian female podcasters who also happen to be professional wedding photographers. We are also best friends! We were having dinner one night, chatting about all the crazy shit we have seen over the years, and the idea for The Secret Life of\u00a0Weddings Podcast was born! We would tell the craziest weird, wild or just plain funny wedding stories all around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are both small business owners and married with children (not to each other...not that there\u0027s anything wrong with that! *Insert Seinfeld gif here*.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the first few months of hosting this podcast we have learned a few things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) We fucking LOVE hearing ourselves talk. Probably more than we\u0027d like to admit...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) We love telling your wedding stories and getting amazing guests to join us for some laughs!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) Planning a wedding is stressful AF. People planing (let\u0027s be honest - mostly Brides) have been listening and laughing instead of stressing over candle heights. That\u0027s pretty great.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4)\u00a0Our listeners are the coolest\u00a0people on the planet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe both support our families and since this podcast IS a lot of fun but still takes up a great deal of time, we feel the need to somewhat\u00a0contribute to our mortgages / bills / boring\u00a0grownup stuff. Also when we\u0027re working late on the podcast our husband\u0027s can\u0027t ever go \"but you don\u0027t\u00a0make any money on this!\" They are supportive, we kid...kinda... ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy choosing to support our show with a monthly Patreon donation, even $1 a month times as many listeners as we have\u00a0will go one heck of a long way to keeping our husbands quiet so we can record more amazing\u00a0hilarious wedding stories for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We\u0027ll Use the Money For:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Keeping our husbands quiet.\u003cbr\u003e2) Real things that we currently pay for out of our pockets like our\u00a0web hosting, upgrading our mics / software / etc. You know, stuff real podcasters do.\u003cbr\u003e3)\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOccasional Starbucks\u00a0because it fuels Lisa.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur initial goal is $100/month. Please help us smash that goal and become a patron of The Secret Life of Weddings! By\u00a0saying YES I\u0027ll be a patron, you\u0027ll get the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusive Patreon-only episodes with stories we don\u0027t tell in our podcast or on our YouTube channel!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA wall to post questions for us and have us reply ASAP to you directly.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe happiness in knowing we won\u0027t eat cat food for dinner that month.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t worry though guys, even if you can\u0027t afford to support us right now, we\u0027ll always provide free \u0026amp; cringeworthy true wedding stories for you to\u00a0laugh at both on our podcast and YouTube channel!
