Here at the Canon Library, I keep all of the new Star Wars canon material in chronological order and keep everyone up to date on all of the upcoming comics, novels, films, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of working full-time, my days are filled with reading all of the new canon, writing articles, shooting videos, editing, uploading, updating the website, and trying to stay active on Facebook. It is extremely time consuming, but something that I love doing. Star Wars is my passion, and I love sharing that passion with you every time I hit that record button.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, anyone would love to sit and make videos for YouTube full-time. As great as that future would be, right now I\u0027m creating this patreon account to help fund the Canon Library: Whether that\u0027s new equipment, canon material, paying artists for interviews, upkeep of the website, advertising, or maybe (someday) making this a full-time endeavor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting September 1st, 2018, we will be launching the \"STAR WARS CANON PODCAST\", our weekly audio-only podcast where we discuss new canon, upcoming canon, Star Wars news, interviews, and a couple of questions sent in by our supporters. This will be EXCLUSIVE to our patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you would like to help support this endeavor or not, you still have my gratitude for being a follower. Without you guys, this brand would be nothing. It\u0027s already more than I ever could have dreamed it would be, and that is thanks to each and every one of you who have clicked on one of my videos or visited the website. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who would like to help support us, please know it is appreciated more than words can say. I am thankful for each and every one of you guys and gals, and I cannot wait to see where the Canon Library ends up in the future!"
