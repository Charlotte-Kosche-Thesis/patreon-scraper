Despite its seemingly limited focus, the show immediately attracted listeners regardless of sexual orientation. Even non-horror fans fell in love with the show\u0027s fresh perspective and unique humor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.screamqueenz.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScreamQueenz\u003c/a\u003e made Rue Morgue Magazine\u0027s list of one of the top 25 genre podcasts and has received multiple nominations for the People Choice Best LGBT Podcast Awards. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT ME:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up gay and a horror fan was a curious combination. \u00a0I tended to see aspects of my favorite scary movies in a different way than my friends did. \u00a0I appreciated them for very different reasons. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen podcasting became a thing, I devoured all the horror podcasts that were available. \u00a0While I enjoyed hearing other genre geeks discuss these movies, I heard the same opinions and ideas over and over again, and they usually differed greatly from mine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal with the show has always been to offer a fresh way to look at the genre in a light, off-beat and campy manner. The\u003cstrong\u003e Friday the 13th Spectacular\u003c/strong\u003e for example is my most popular segment, because I don\u0027t just talk about the movie. I recount personal stories of seeing the films first run and how I became \"The Weird Kid\" as a result. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I do cover the classics and new releases, I\u0027ve made it a point in special segments like \u003cstrong\u003eThe Nightmare Closet \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eMade-For-TV Mayhem\u003c/strong\u003e to cover the lesser known movies that scarred my childhood and made me into the horror-hungry homo I am today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also driven to be the first find the Next Big Thing. \u003cstrong\u003eThe Crapshoot\u003c/strong\u003e segment randomly picks a movie out of the vast sea of independent direct-to-video films in search of a \"diamond in the shit pile.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE PITCH:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eScreamQueenz has always been a solo effort as well as a labor of love. Bring only one man, there was only so much I could do. \u00a0However, your patronage will allow me the time and resources to produce a more frequent show, a better produced show and even create new material.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the technical front, your support will help provide new recording equipment and editing software and create a better sounding show that\u0027s easier to produce. \u00a0A show that\u0027s easier to produce is more likely to get produced more often with new episodes every week instead of just twice a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy donating to the show, you will provide the means to bring you more episodes covering new movie releases while they are still in the theaters. \u00a0I will also be able to discuss more non-movie related events like haunted attractions, horror-based plays and similar offbeat live events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will increase our advertising budget and create show-related merchandise. Not only will you bring in new listeners, but you can also finally get a cool ScreamQueenz t-shirt!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will provide the resources for me to create new features to the podcast like movie commentary tracks, original radio-style scripts and a live show to be streamed for a venue in New York City.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
