    "summary": "Hi! My name is Stacy Sadistic, and I make trans-positive videos for adult audiences. As you may or may not know, this industry is controlled by white cis men that exploit trans women. Not only do they take financial advantage of marginalized folx who are just struggling to pay rent, they portray trans women in a way that creates unfair and unrealistic stereotypes. Historically, this has created a society that sees trans women as \"freaks,\" and has led to a high rate of violence against us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work frames trans women in a more positive light. It shows that we are regular people, just like everyone else. I believe that an industry led by cis white men and their patriarchal views is outdated, and the market demands more progressive options. Competing with the \"big guys\" is difficult considering they have an almost endless budget for marketing and distribution. However, I believe that the demand for this change is so high, that a grass-roots campaign of supporters can make it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe predominant businesses pay models a small one time fee for their time, but control ownership of the content, and refuse to pay royalties to the actual creators. When I film a video, all models keep ownership of the content, to sell however they see fit. As a model, I sell my own work through\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://stacysadistic.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStacySadistic.Com\u003c/a\u003e (which I own), and a number of other 3rd party video-sales sites. I\u0027m working on creating a new website, not just for myself, but for all trans models. The goal is to share profits from the site equally with all models featured, without exorbitant administrative fees. I\u0027m in this to help trans women, not to make a buck.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore the new website can go live, we need new high quality content. I have over five years of experience as a producer, model, and web developer. I know how to make amazing content on a low budget. I\u0027m going to be filming with 6 beautiful models located in the Pacific Northwest. I\u0027m asking for your help to pay for some of the bare essentials, and I\u0027ve got some great incentives in store for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere is what your donations will pay for:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 $700 flights for me and my personal assistant\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 $200 hotel for 2 nights in Seattle (staying with friends the rest of the time)\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 $150 train fare back and forth from Portland to Seattle\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 $50\u00a0 Lyft fare to and from sets\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 $500\u00a0MUA/Stylist for the whole week\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 $200 health \u0026amp; safety related costs\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e+$200 food\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e=$2,000 total cost\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI already have the filming equipment, lights, and I will do all editing myself. I\u0027m taking time off of work for this trip, which means I will be losing some of my regular income. I\u0027m volunteering my own time for this project, as well as my own money to cover any extraneous costs. If actual expenses are under budget, or if we exceed the specified goal, the remainder of donations will go directly to the other models. I know these videos are going to turn out great, and I\u0027m really excited to work with all of the models:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.manyvids.com/Profile/1000837534/TeganToxik/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTegan Toxic\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Lucy_Sioux\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLucy Sioux\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://iwantclips.com/store/178237/LunaLabia\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLuna Labia\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Maya_Mayhem/media\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMaya Mayhem\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.manyvids.com/Profile/1000239065/DirtyLara/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDirty Lara\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.manyvids.com/Profile/90815/OpheliaBlack/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOphelia Black\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause your investment is needed to pay for expenses beforehand, this Patreon is set up as \"pay-per-creation.\" I am fundraising throughout December, so if you donate, the payment will go through on January 1st. This is not a subscription, all payments are one-time-only donations. The trip to Seattle/Portland is scheduled for January 7th through the 14th. I will be editing and uploading all videos the following week. Rewards will be sent at that time, unless they can be sent sooner (like my Snapchat for example). If you have any questions about rewards, feel free to send me an email: StacySadistic@gmail.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
