    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003eGreetings! I\u0027m Rudy. Some call me a Sierra super fan, others call me nuts. Both are true - and required - to create the ultimate Sierra On-Line fan site: the Sierra Chest. \u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eA few words about Sierra On-Line\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\nTo \"older\" gamers, Sierra is mostly known for games such as King\u0027s Quest, Space Quest, Gabriel Knight, Leisure Suit Larry and others. They basically invented the adventure game genre and were technologically way ahead of the curve. Sierra also owned other studios such as Dynamix (Tribes, Red Baron,...), Coktel Vision (Gobliiins,...) , Impressions (Lords of the Realm, Caesar,...), Papyrus Group (Nascar Racing,...) and others, offering a vast variety of award-winning games and other software for all ages and tastes. Yes, in their glory days, Sierra was the undisputed leader of the computer gaming industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://sierrachest.com/gfx/games/SQ4/ssfloppy/001.JPG\" style=\"width: 689px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSadly, after founders Ken and Roberta Williams retired and a number of corporate missteps (some more questionable than others), Sierra met its untimely demise as a developer in 1999, ending up in the hands of Vivendi as a brand name for games who\u0027s development was mostly outsourced. Younger gamers may therefore recognize the Sierra name from games like F.E.A.R.,\u00a0 Chronicles of Riddick, World In Conflict or Crash Bandicoot. Eventually, after the merger of Vivendi with Activision in 2009, also Sierra\u0027s name was tucked away in the proverbial basement.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIn September 2014 however, following a string of fan remakes, indie games and crowdfunding projects by former Sierra employees and fans, Activision brought Sierra BACK, and is developing new titles as we speak!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eIntroducing the Sierra Chest\u003c/h3\u003e\nMany Sierra fan sites have popped up and faded away over the years. Those that are still active to this day all have some kind of niche, such as a particular game or\ngame series or developer. One fan site however has committed itself to\npreserve the Sierra legacy in its entirety: \u003ca href=\"http://sierrachest.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Sierra Chest\u003c/a\u003e, created by yours truly in 2008. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sierrachest.com/gfx/chest_header.jpg\" style=\"float: left; width: 732px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is the scope of this thing, really? The Chest covers everything from Mystery House (1980) to the upcoming King\u0027s Quest (expected fall 2015), as well as everything beyond and in between.\u00a0 That would roughly be around 1,000 Sierra products of all genres, spanning over 3 decades! Does Sierra even have that many products?! Yes, it does, and too many have been under-appreciated or forgotten, so the Chest finally gives them the attention they deserve, and I\u0027m not talking about a few lines of text and one screenshot per product here - I mean detail! Recording \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/ruudje1976\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evideo walkthroughs\u003c/a\u003e only scratches the surface.\nThere are screenshots, text walkthroughs, point lists, game credits, game play\ninstructions, sound tracks, demos, wall papers, Easter eggs, cheats (for those\nwho need them), trailers, tech support, box arts, game maps and\nmore. But hey, talk is cheap, so have a look at some examples:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://sierrachest.com/index.php?a=g\u0026amp;id=38\u0026amp;fld=s\u0026amp;gconf=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGabriel Knight: The Beast Within\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://sierrachest.com/index.php?a=g\u0026amp;id=174\u0026amp;fld=s\u0026amp;gconf=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Island of Dr. Brain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://sierrachest.com/index.php?a=g\u0026amp;id=108\u0026amp;fld=s\u0026amp;gconf=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e3-D Ultra Minigolf\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://sierrachest.com/index.php?a=g\u0026amp;id=153\u0026amp;fld=s\u0026amp;gconf=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIce Age 2: The Meltdown\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://sierrachest.com/index.php?a=g\u0026amp;fld=s\u0026amp;id=22\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePolice Quest 3: The Kindred\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eBut that is not all. Honoring the Sierra legacy means the Chest does not only cover the products - those games didn\u0027t make themselves. Although these sections still require tons of work, the site will also cover Sierra\u0027s history, the technology, the designers, the publications and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe community\u003c/h3\u003eThe Sierra Chest is also highly active in the gaming community, keeping fans continuously informed about the latest developments in the world of Sierra. Over the years I created a wide network with people from Sierra, Dynamix, Impressions, and other developers who are more than happy to share their experiences with the fans.

That\u0027s why the design of \"Sierra Chest 2: Legacy of the Half-Dome\" is currently in progress. Sierra Chest 2, expected to be launched in the Spring/Summer this year will feature:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ebrand new modernized interface\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ebetter userfriendliness and accessibility through mobile phones and tablets\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eexpanded databases for even more detail\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003enew features, mostly focused on the community, including forum, news blog, member contributions (screen shots, box art, game reviews added by members), a store to facilitate auction listings, and even a feature for members to compose their own virtual collection\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch3\u003eKen Sent Me\u003c/h3\u003eWith all that said, who am I really? In a nutshell, I\u0027m a Sierra fan for nearly 3 decades (since King\u0027s Quest IV), as well as \na collector, historian and curator - all that grew over the years to the point of the Sierra junky I am today. I became heavily involved in the Sierra community since 2003 on the former official Sierra forums, where I was appointed as moderator in 2006 (hence also my interest in the later games). I had already planned for years to set up a massive fan site but, when the official Sierra forums were shut down and all support was dropped, that was the impetus to launch it in 2008.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sierrachest.com/gfx/members/rudy/DSC09018.JPG\" style=\"width: 607px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2010 I also became admin of Sierra Gamers, the personal Sierra site of founders Ken and Roberta Williams, whom I had the pleasure to meet on one of their European trips (I live in tiny Slovenia). Through my active involvement with the Sierra community as a whole and by running both the Sierra Chest and Sierra Gamers community, I guess I\u0027ve somewhat become the face of it and gained the rep of \"super fan\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/t31.0-8/892570_4539707151124_1433171294_o.jpg\" style=\"width: 615px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\n Why a Patreon account?\u003c/h3\u003eThe Sierra Chest has probably already grown into the largest Sierra fan site in existence with over 500 game entries,\n2,000 people profiles, 15,000 screenshots, 1,500 self-made videos, 2,000 songs,\nand more, but the site is still FAR from complete. This is continuous work and, roughly estimated, it would\nstill take over 2 decades to complete it, full time. The Sierra Chest is my life project. It is my dream to turn this passion into a\nfull-time occupation. If you enjoy my work, then with your support, I can make\nthis dream come true, and show you the world of Sierra in a way you\u2019ve \u003cem\u003enever\n\u003c/em\u003eseen before. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am still working on the rewards to offer you as a Patron, particularly since several will be applicable to Sierra Chest version 2 which is still under development. For now, the rewards mostly relate to early access, listing in the site credits and voting on the site\u0027s next entree. Note that, while my personal collection is quite extensive, I do not own all Sierra titles yet, but in the event a title is selected which I do not own, I\u0027ll try to obtain it asap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and consideration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRudy\u003cbr\u003e"
