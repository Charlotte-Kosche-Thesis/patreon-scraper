    "summary": "Hey there everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Justin, but everyone just calls me \u0027Stoud\u0027 or \u0027Stoudman.\u0027 Yes, even my closest friends call me by this nickname.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Am I Asking For Support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am a freelance writer by trade, but I also spend quite a bit of time making videos for Youtube. I\u0027ve been using Youtube since 2007, and I have accumulated over 400 videos in that time. Believe it or not, I\u0027m still not done, and I\u0027ve got a lot of great ideas for content that I would like to make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately, with Youtube\u0027s Content ID system being as imperfect as it is, I can\u0027t afford to take the time necessary to make higher quality videos without taking a chance on the possibility that some random faceless company will make a copyright claim against it. I\u0027m not intending to illegally upload anything that I don\u0027t have the right to use, I just want to be able to create more in depth and legitimate reviews and educational videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy most popular video is entitled \"\u003ca href=\"http://youtu.be/_j4h3gGYZSk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Urgency of Now\u003c/a\u003e,\" and it features Martin Luther King Jr\u0027s \"I Have a Dream\" speech. In addition to the speech, I provided a clip show featuring photographic evidence of the racism that Dr. King spoke about, and I used text to explain some of the context of the speech and why it was so important. This video falls under fair use as both educational content and commentary, but that simply doesn\u0027t stop copyright trolls from making baseless claims.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI run into this problem so frequently that I\u0027ve become terrified of putting any content into my videos, even if I am doing so for the purposes of education and/or commentary \u2013 which are protected under fair use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s Where Patreon Comes In!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf I can receive monthly support for my content on Youtube, I won\u0027t have to worry about whether or not a copyright troll decides to make a baseless claim on my content. As a matter of fact, when my content is fully supported by Patreon, I won\u0027t even have to think twice about copyright claims. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nQuite frankly, I would prefer to just make the content that I want to make \u2013 content which I am absolutely sure does not infringe upon any copyrights \u2013 and let Youtube\u0027s Content ID have at it. Besides which, who wants to see ads on Youtube videos anyways?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s another area where Patreon can help, as it will allow me to consider turning off ads on my videos altogether. If I\u0027m receiving support from my Patrons, why would I need to display ads?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Kind Of Videos Do I Want To Make?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently, I am producing about 3-5 videos a week. My output depends on the amount of time I have to devote to making videos. Unfortunately, the quality of my videos also depends upon the amount of time I have and the problems I anticipate having with Youtube\u0027s Content ID system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith the freedom to work outside of Youtube/Google\u0027s system, I would like to make more of the following types of videos:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEducational/Documentary style videos about Film, Popular Culture and Society\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCriticisms/Reviews of Movies, Television Shows and Video Games\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLet\u0027s Play style videos of games played live on Twitch.tv\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBargain hunting videos showcasing various products\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReviews/Criticisms of various media formats such as Vinyl, DVD, Blu-ray, Retro Games, ect.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nThe truth is that I can accomplish most of the Let\u0027s Play, Bargain Hunting and Media reviews on my own. However, I want to take my channel to the next level and start putting more effort into the content that I offer. I have a lot of ideas for fun and educational content about geeky subjects, and I\u0027d love to have the freedom to make them all happen!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to better understand the type of video that I\u0027m most excited to make, check out my link to \"The Urgency of Now\" above. I would love to make a documentary style video like this dealing with Postmodernism in film and television, or perhaps even the lack of women in Hollywood. I would also love to do full video reviews for films which include video (from movie trailers and the like) and other additional content (such as a proprietary rating system).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make all of this happen, I need YOUR help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Much Do I Need?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, If I\u0027m going to be spending a lot more time on these videos, I\u0027m going to need more of a reason to put that effort in than the current profits I see from Google\u0027s Ad program. As such, I will be basing my goals on three factors: The quality of my work, the amount of time I put into it, and the revenue I would typically see from running ads on those videos. That being said, it won\u0027t take much for me to get started and make my visions a reality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery little bit will help, so even if you can only afford to donate $1 per month, I would truly appreciate it. You\u0027d be surprised how little it will take to get me out of Google\u0027s clutches, and I honestly hope that you will enjoy the videos that come as a result of the donations of my patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether, I know that we can make some great videos happen. Help me to avoid the concerns brought about by Youtube\u0027s Content ID system and together we\u0027ll bring better content to Youtube regardless of their artificial roadblocks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFringe Benefits\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn addition to helping me create better content for Youtube, you\u0027ll also be supporting my work on G33k-e.com! I am the Editor-in-Chief of G33k-e, and I\u0027d love to start putting more effort into my site. All of the money I currently earn from doing videos on Youtube goes directly into paying server and domain costs for the site, so anything you contribute to this cause will also go towards helping the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to receive enough support for G33k-e that it becomes self sufficient, but that is a concern for another day. Becoming a Patron of my Youtube Videos will more than likely not directly affect the health of the website, but it will allow me to spend more time writing and editing articles for the site instead of looking for more freelance work. The more money I receive from my patrons, the easier it will be to spend time curating and creating content for the site, or even updating its interface to make it more responsive and useful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s right, when you donate even $1 to my Patreon, you are helping me to increase the quality of not only my videos, but my written work and my website as well! It all goes towards making my content better across all platforms.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my content as it currently is and you wouldn\u0027t mind seeing an improvement, you can make that happen by supporting me here on Patreon. Thanks in advance for your consideration!"
