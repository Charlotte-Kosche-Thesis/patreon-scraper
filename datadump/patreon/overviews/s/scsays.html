    "summary": "Welcome! I\u0027m Andre, my stage name is S.C. Says. I\u0027m a national championship slam poet living in Austin TX, and I LOVE this art form. I\u0027ve won a few slam competitions, but the greatest \"trophy\" I\u0027ve ever received was performing a piece of mine titled Crayon Box at a school in Wisconsin and a girl coming up to me after the show tearfully thanking me for helping her not feel so alone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also currently a sales director at a startup company in Austin called Adonit. Adonit has been an incredible blessing, both in experience and just getting to work with dope people, and it has allowed me the downtime I need to pursue my true passion. I am now, though, at a point where I want to pursue poetry full time (alliteration, gotta love it).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s where the Patreon community comes in. I want to build a fanbase large enough to support doing solely poetry, always.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s what\u0027s up. If you enjoy any of my poetry or performance, please consider becoming a supporter through Patreon. I want to get these poems in front of as many people as I possibly can and your support would allow me to do that. This whole art form is about sharing your story, and I look forward to sharing mine with as many people as will listen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd to the people who already support, like, thank you for saving the whales and fighting to get us to 100% renewable energy (I imagine these are things you also do since you support art)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I went on to study acting at the USC School of Theatre and after I graduated I moved to Austin. There, in 2014, I found my voice through Slam Poetry. I\u0027ve now performed my poetry at schools, universities, and venues in 13 different states for thousands of people. I\u0027m a two time Austin Poetry Slam Champion, a two time Texas Grand Slam Finalist, and National Group Piece Champion.",
