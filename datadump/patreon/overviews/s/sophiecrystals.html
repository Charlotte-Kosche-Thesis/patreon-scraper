    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\tHi there!! I\u0027m Sopheria Rose, a trans writer and illustrator in Portland, OR. I do my best to tell stories straight from my heart. Sincerity is the absolute most important thing to me in everything I create.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I\u0027m focusing on making an episodic visual novel called Spare Parts. It\u0027s about a girl named Lucy who stumbles into a job at a shop run by androids, and her quest to emotionally support them, even though she doesn\u0027t realize they\u0027re androids. It\u0027s fun, it\u0027s cute, and it\u0027s all about living with trauma under capitalism! Wahoo!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond that, I want to learn a lot more about making visual novels. I have lots of ideas, so you\u0027ll probably see some of those as they take a more concrete shape after Spare Parts wraps up. Look forward to them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I am able to financially support myself with my part-time job alone, so nothing I get from Patreon is currently going into directly sustaining my livelihood. Instead, it allows me to pay other people to help put together the stories I tell. Like, I don\u0027t know anything about writing music! So supporting me allows me to pay a musician to write music for me. Stuff like that. It\u0027s deeply appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.bigcrystals.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Line-Break.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.bigcrystals.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.bigcrystals.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Patreon-Image-1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.bigcrystals.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBig Crystals\u003c/a\u003e is a queer fantasy/adventure webcomic about feelings and relationships. It follows Maggie, a girl who was separated from her two closest friends when the three of them attempted to escape from a mysterious tower. Eight years later, she meets Johanna, heiress to that same tower, who wants to put a stop to her father\u0027s sinister/confusing plans. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.bigcrystals.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Patreon-Image-5.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tAs they travel together, they grow closer, expand their family, and try to make sense of what it is they want from life, each other, and themselves. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\tBig Crystals launched in January of 2015, and is \u003cstrong\u003ecurrently on hiatus\u003c/strong\u003e while I focus on other projects. By no means is it over, but it might be some time yet before I return to it. Maybe with a little financial leeway, that\u0027d happen sooner?
