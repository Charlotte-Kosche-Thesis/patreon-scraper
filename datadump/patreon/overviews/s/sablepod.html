Hello! My name is Lane Lloyd, and I am the writer/narrator for this very podcast! Ever since I was a young child, I wanted to tell stories to the world, no matter what form that took. There have been many, many attempts to get the formula right. Comics, videos on Youtube, novels that no one saw, anything you could think of, I\u0027ve tried.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eIt was only 3 months ago when I found the perfect way to share my stories; Podcasts. I have been listening to Audio Dramas and audio books for years now, and for whatever reason, it took me until now to put two and two together and decide to try it out for myself. Needless to say, I fell in love with it, which is why I\u0027m here.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e13 episodes later, and I\u0027m still kicking. Sable has been an experiment like no other that I\u0027ve tried, and for once, I feel like it is where I always belonged.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS SABLE?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eSable is a singular narrative podcast meant to chill you to your very core and ask you one simple question; How much of this world is actually real? What has been hidden from us? Who, exactly, is doing the hiding? It\u0027s a podcast that can take place in multiple universes, all coming together to find an answer to all those questions and more.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThink of each episode like a chapter in a novel, and a full season representing the finished work. Every season (Except for those specified) Take place in different worlds, times, settings. Though the seasons can be enjoyed separately from one another, if you stick around from the very beginning, you will start to see the connective tissue underneath. Something is going on here, something that connects all of these characters together, even if they don\u0027t know it themselves.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eAs of this post, Sable is at 13 episodes. (10 for Season 1 and 3 for a mini series) I can\u0027t wait to do more for you, and I promise, the stories will only become grander as time passes.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO....WHY PATREON?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI\u0027m not going to lie to you, this show has taken a lot of time and money to create, and more is still needed. I work a full time job at the moment, one with hectic hours and draining tasks. The dream would be to be able to do this show full time, adding in extra shows along the way if time allowed it. Honestly, though, I would just be happy with a way to pay for hosting and new equipment when needed, maybe grant myself a little bit of time to work on more Sable and other projects.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO, WHAT DO YOU GET OUT OF THIS?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen I first started this Patreon page, the rewards were a little silly, to say the least. People are giving their hard earned cash per episode to you, the least I could do is give as much back as I possibly can. Patrons that are kind enough to throw money my way, at any amount, will be treated with as much as I can give. Early listenings of Episodes, exclusive monthly shows, and access to the best quality downloads one can get. That\u0027s just the tip of the iceberg! As goals are reached, that can only mean more sweet, sweet deals for you folk out there, and we all love deals, right? Except for that car. That car was a bad decision.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e"
