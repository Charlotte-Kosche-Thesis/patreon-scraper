This combination of agriculture and animal experiences is helping to educate the public on more humane ways to eat, and more loving ways to better the world. We even run a vegan u-pick CSA!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support through Patreon helps Sweet Farm with a daily animal care, feeding and love, as well as a number of on-going projects including expanding barn space, purchasing a transport vehicle for emergencies \u0026amp; expanding our educational programming. As Patrons, you will have first access to our plans, updates and most adorable animal experiences. We can\u0027t thank you enough for opening your hearts \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
