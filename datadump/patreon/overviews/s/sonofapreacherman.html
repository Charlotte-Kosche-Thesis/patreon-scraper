    "summary": "Friends,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve spent so much of my life never quite feeling like I fit in, anywhere I was. For all of the perils, that is one of the beautiful things the internet has made possible--so many of us misfits have been able to find each other! I live my life at some pretty complicated intersections, and the very fact that you\u0027ve come far enough to check out this page leads me to believe that you\u0027re probably living at some of those intersections, too. That\u0027s what the Son of a Preacher Man podcast is all about, really: \u003cem\u003efinding God at the intersections\u003c/em\u003e, finding beauty in brokenness...finding the One who calls us by our true name while we are still living in the ambiguity of the in-between.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo get this message out, I very much need your help.\u00a0Even after a year of trying to carve out a life writing and speaking on my own full-time, I\u0027ve still been somehow reluctant to open up space for folks to support what I\u0027m doing. Because as much as I may still be a Southern-fried preacher at heart, I admit that passing the chicken bucket for an offering was not part of my tradition I wanted to keep alive, so much :) Yet the more I explore these intersections, and the more I hear your own stories of finding grace in the midst of disillusionment and despair...the more I realize just how important this kind of space is. I really believe this podcast, in particular, is going to help some folks feel seen and known in the unseen places, and that means everything to me. I want to give the gift so many of you have given to me over the years--of feeling a little less peculiar, a little less alone in the universe. I want people to know their deepest identity as God\u0027s sons and daughters. I need your support to make it happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to use Patreon because I like that the format is simple, and no-strings attached; I like that you don\u0027t sign your life away, and can cancel support at anytime. I also like the way Patreon opens up avenues for real dialogue between creators, and those that support their creativity. \u00a0I want you to have an active hand in how the podcast takes shape as we go. I need you in the lab with me! This show won\u0027t mean anything if it doesn\u0027t meet you right where you live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSon of a Preacher Man is an ambitious idea, in that we plan to release two roughly 30 minute episodes per week (side A and side B), with some live shows and special episodes mixed in, for variety. It\u0027s very much like an LP/record---Side A will always introduce an idea/thesis, while Side B will be a creative, often sideways take on the same topic. Sometimes there will be sermons, sometimes guests, sometimes Q and A with you, sometimes music. But at the heart of this project, the goal will always be to help people discover their true identity as beloved sons and daughters, seen and known, and cherished.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am humbled and grateful that you would consider supporting me in this new work. Anything you are able to give is deeply appreciated. If you are not able or ready to give, please don\u0027t feel any guilt whatsoever about this--we all have too many tolls to pay, on the long road we are on. Just spreading the word about the podcast on social media, or giving us a positive review on itunes, would be a great way to help us!\u00a0Whether you give or don\u0027t give, listen or don\u0027t listen to the podcast from here, I hope you willl remember this: you are God\u0027s beloved, the object of God\u0027s affection, and delight. Nothing changes that, ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your time, friends, and for all the ways your own lives illuminate how God brings beauty out of brokenness.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrace and Peace,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJonathan Martin\u003cbr\u003e"
