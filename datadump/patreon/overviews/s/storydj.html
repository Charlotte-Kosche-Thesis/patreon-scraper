You might know me for my poetry books, or the poems that I post on my social media accounts (on instagram I am\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/storydj/\"\u003e@storydj\u003c/a\u003e). My most famous book is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Love-Space-Dust-David-Jones/dp/1499274815\"\u003eLove And Space Dust\u003c/a\u003e, but in total I have published five collections of poetry and a novella. My poetry has been shared by celebrities including Cara Delevigne, Britney Spears and Camilla Cabello. I post a lot of new and original writing for free on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/storydj/\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://story-dj.tumblr.com/tagged/popular\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/davidjoneswriter/\"\u003efacebook\u003c/a\u003e - I have around 500,000 followers across the world, and it seems that my poetry touches people and gives them something to identify with, which is honestly the most amazing feeling in the world. I\u0027m working on a novel which is very nearly complete and just undergoing the editing process. At the start of the year I finally finished my PhD at the University of Liverpool. At the moment every tiny particle of my being is pouring into my novel, and there\u0027s nothing better than working on a long term writing project. I also make\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/storydj\"\u003eYouTube videos\u003c/a\u003e which are\u00a0quite a varied mix including writing, comedy, sketches, all sorts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat on earth am I doing on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is about rewarding my readers and my most loyal followers. I post a lot of free writing, but I want to reward people who sponsor me on Patreon with exclusive monthly rewards. I see this as a type of subscriber service, and I want to send as much cool stuff to my followers as possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyone who writes is a writer. Anyone who wants their life\u0027s work to be writing needs sustainable income to live, eat and afford the various expenses which make up this thing we call life. That is what brought me to Patreon. I post a great deal of original writing free of charge on social media - at least a new poem every day because I think that art and writing should be as accessible as possible. At the same time writing is a job like any other, and I think it\u0027s super important that writers can earn a wage, or less people will become writers and there will be less writing, which is bad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is fantastic because so many artists are forced into working for free or working on far below minimum wage, something which would be unjustifiable in literally any other career in the world. I really, truly feel that Patreon, and this system of patronage, is the future. It is a very bright future, and above all else a very fair future.\u00a0There is a lot more to this than money though. As I continue to grow as a writer I become increasingly aware of a very simple rule: \"the more you write, the better you write.\" To this end, I and probably everybody else in the world needs to write more. There is \u003cem\u003ealways \u003c/em\u003eroom for improvement. If I am giving away new books and new writing every single month, then I simply \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e to write more, and hopefully improve more. It\u0027s as wonderfully simple as that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat on earth will you get for becoming a patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe lowest subscription is $1 - and for this you get a new book of poems every single month. I think that\u0027s great value! For $3 you get the free book, plus a newsletter and weekly podcast - less than the price of a cup of coffee! From there the rewards include personalised poems written just for you, poetry postcards, signed books, writing advise and even unique, hand-crafted, hand-written editions of my poetry collections.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that the rewards are a nice mix of books and poetry, but also advise and help for anyone looking to achieve their own dream of becoming a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for stopping by - and A TRILLION MORE THANKS if you decide to become a patron :)"
