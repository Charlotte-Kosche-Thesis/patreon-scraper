    "summary": "The Serial Squadron has been restoring rare and \"lost\" serials from the early 1900s to the 1940s for over 15 years now. We have access to archives of film prints of silent and sound serials, and now that we are partnering with USC will be able to bring you chapters and serials from the Library of Congress and other larger archive. We will be taking on the ambitious project of commissioning new digital transfers of silent, Mascot and Independent serials which have not yet been seen in high picture and sound quality, or not seen at all by anyone still living. Our goal is to make \"lost\" and rare serials viewable online and on DVD as possible, as quickly as we can do so. Purchasing or paying for loans of films and new digital transfers are expensive and we\u0027d like your assistance so we can get these serials onto DVD and available for online viewing sooner rather than later and everyone interested in them will be able to see high quality copies which have been unavailable for decades.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA sample chapter of one of our restorations, \u003cstrong\u003eDAREDEVILS OF THE WEST\u003c/strong\u003e, is above. This Republic serial was thought lost and unseen for 60 years, and all prints of it that exist were missing several reels of sound. The audio in the chapter above was missing from the first reel and so had to be re-created. Can you tell the difference between the re-created audio in the first few minutes and the original sound (which begins when the cavalry rides in)? We found a way to get the serial to you, and replaced every gunshot, every wagon sound, and had actors re-create the dialogue from the existing script so the serial could feel complete once again. That\u0027s how dedicated we are to bringing these serials, which were beloved in their time and have influenced the current superhero, Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies so heavily, back to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTitles slated for restoration in the future include some popular Republic serials which have never received high quality transfers, rare never-before-seen serials from the 1910s-20s and sound serials which exist now only in inferior \"budget DVD\" editions, sometimes incomplete and always unrestored, such as\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eTHE LIGHTNING RAIDER, THE EXPLOITS OF ELAINE, THE VOICE FROM THE SKY, PIRATE TREASURE, THE LIGHTNING WARRIOR\u003c/strong\u003e (complete with the \"missing\" Ch. 1 footage), \u003cstrong\u003eTHE HURRICANE EXPRESS, THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, A WOMAN IN GREY, THE FLAME FIGHTER, THE SHADOW OF THE EAGLE, ADVENTURES OF THE FLYING CADETS, THE WHISPERING SHADOW, BURN \u0027EM UP BARNES\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eTHE AMAZING EXPLOITS OF THE CLUTCHING HAND\u003c/strong\u003e. Serials which exist only in partial form will include restored and reconstructed sections. Audio on all titles will be restored to bring up volume and remove hiss or white noise, and picture will be cleaned up and stabilized as necessary or possible. Appropriate color toning and new scores will be included for the silent serials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you sign up as a \u003cstrong\u003eVIP Video \u0026amp; DVD Subscriber\u003c/strong\u003e by making your pledge here, you will receive:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- DVDs of serials as soon as they are complete and ready to ship\u003cbr\u003e- Your DVDs shipped before anyone not on the subscription list gets theirs\u003cbr\u003e- Bonus DVDs shipped free to subscribers and multi-disk set serials which may include extra titles \u003cbr\u003e- Access to members-only online serial videos\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd/or variations of the above according to your pledge selection.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can now also sign up for a \u003cstrong\u003ebasic Serial Squadron membership\u003c/strong\u003e at $10/month which will help support new online videos of serials to be posted (and we\u0027ll be posting a lot beginning very soon) and receive access to password-protected video directories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr, you can also sign up as a \u003cstrong\u003eSquadron Cadet \u003c/strong\u003eat $5/month just to help support the video program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake a look at \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.serialsquadron.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.serialsquadron.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e for more information about this and other serials as they become ready to release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on how projects are progressing any given month, your account may or may not be charged anything, but for serial titles which we know will be released within 3 months or less will pledges be collected, and that will usually happen once a month. At the same time, for some titles, supplemental funds from online Indiegogo pledge drives will also be raised which will be necessary for project completion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce you sign up on the subscription list you do not ever have to fill out anything else to pledge again for the next release; your pledge choice will roll over automatically to the next release so as long as you keep a few bucks in your PayPal account, if you sign up for the VIP list, if you want to you can just sit back and enjoy receiving new Squadron DVDs as soon as they are ready to go without having to lift a finger!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis system eliminates your having to send money too long before a title is released, and allows us to pay for transfers in advance as well as keep multiple projects in production at once.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015 and 2016 the subscription service helped make releases of \u003cstrong\u003eTHE WOLF DOG, MYSTERY MOUNTAIN, THE HOUSE OF HATE, THE MASKED RIDER\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eDEADWOOD DICK,\u003c/strong\u003e and\u003cstrong\u003e TARZAN THE FEARLESS\u003c/strong\u003e, among others,\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003epossible. In 2017 it funded the releases of \u003cstrong\u003eJUNGLE MENACE, DARKEST AFRICA, PERILS OF NYOKA, SECRET SERVICE IN DARKEST AFRICA, G-MEN VS. THE BLACK DRAGON, KING OF THE TEXAS RANGERS, THE TIGER WOMAN, \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eMANHUNT OF MYSTERY ISLAND\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDVD RELEASE SCHEDULE INFORMATION\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledges are collected when a serial film print has been acquired and ready to be transferred. A sample of the new transfer or full sample chapter of the serial to be published or added to the Squadron Archive will usually then be created and posted on a page describing the serial which will be shown to you. Over the next two or three months, the transfer and restoration will be completed and the finished DVD shipped to you. The time between subscription pledge and shipping date is currently about 90 days. So if you subscribe you will not receive the current release but instead the one noted as the next one subscriptions will be collected for. Current releases may simply be ordered from the website. You\u0027ll know the title you pledged for first as it will be the first one you receive a Patreon link to and description of.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWatch the Squadron website main page at \u003ca href=\"http://www.serialsquadron.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.serialsquadron.com\u003c/a\u003e for further information about the the release schedule and the order in which new titles are being scheduled for restoration and release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInformation about release dates of new titles will also be posted on the Squadron Facebook page at:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/serialsquadron/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/groups/serialsquadron/\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease sign up now to help us restore these classic cinema serials which deserve proper full-quality releases, and help us make them available online, and receive great forthcoming restorations of the classic movie serials on this list which any serial collector will be proud to own, without having to do anything else, as soon as the DVDs have been burned.

Since then we have located and restored many more rare serials, even some thought lost, including BEATRICE FAIRFAX (1916), THE TRAIL OF THE OCTOPUS (1919), THE HOPE DIAMOND MYSTERY (1921), THE LONE RANGER (1938) and DAREDEVILS OF THE WEST (1943) so they can all now be enjoyed again by fans of the form and cinema historians.",
