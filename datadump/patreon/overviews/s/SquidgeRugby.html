    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eGrowing up,\nI had but a small number of dreams.\u003c/strong\u003e However, once I got over the\nreoccurring nightmare in which I lost my teddy bear whilst stark-naked in a department store, I was left with the same dream as every other little boy unfortunate enough to be born of Principality blood. I wanted to play international rugby for Wales. Two things stopped me achieving this.\nOne was a coach who wouldn\u2019t pick me, and insisted, no matter how I argued, that I\nwas an out-and-out winger. However, with time, reflection, and one game at\nfly-half, I think everyone came to recognise we were all wrong. My best\nposition, without a shadow of a doubt, was spectator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe other factor preventing me from ever playing for Wales was that I was shit at rugby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEarlier this year, I decided to put that skillset to use and\nembrace my true position. \u003cstrong\u003eIn January, I\nlaunched \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2oaGQ6Dds6g9lqfexUFbQ\"\u003eSquidge Rugby\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. My goal was to create the kind of rugby content I\nwanted to see myself. Things that were funny, but also insightful and\nwell-informed. A sense of style, but still with\nsubstance. Content that is all the things Austin Healey isn\u2019t. It\u2019s not up to me to say whether\nor not I\u2019ve succeeded, but I\u2019ve very proud of all the content I\u2019ve put out so\nfar, and intend to continue producing well into the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eHowever,\nmaking these videos is very time consuming\u003c/strong\u003e. It now eats up most of my\nfree time, and means for months I haven\u2019t been able to do any of my other hobbies, like petting\ndogs, and typing Claudia Winkleman\u2019s name into Google. My family have forgotten\nwhat I look like, and my friends have given up on me and gone to live in\nsomebody else\u2019s imagination instead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019ll give\nyou some insight into the process of making a Squidge Rugby video.\u003c/strong\u003e I start off by researching the topic. I read up on it, I watch\nmatches back (Often multiple times), I work out how to crowbar in a\nmention of Alun Wyn Jones. Once I\u0027m happy I know what I need, I spend a few days writing and rewriting the\nscript; really polishing the thing so it\u2019s as cohesive and funny as it can be.\nThen I have to actually edit the video.\u003cstrong\u003e\nI spend somewhere around an hour and a half on every minute you see on-screen\u003c/strong\u003e,\non top of the time already put in. As you can imagine, this doesn\u2019t leave much\ntime for dog petting, never mind the dognapping involved to reach that point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs I write this, \u003cstrong\u003eI\nhave not received a penny in exchange for any of this\u003c/strong\u003e. I enjoy making them,\nand knowing that people enjoy watching them is its own reward. There \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e adverts on some of the videos, but\nall proceeds thus far have gone straight to the Six Nations board. This is fair enough.\nI\u2019ve used clips they own, and they\u2019re probably down a few quid since\nthey lost the RBS sponsorship. Otherwise who is going to\npay the crack team that investigated the Rabah Slimani incident and decided\nFriday night games in Cardiff are great idea? They haven\u2019t requested the videos\nbe taken down, or looked to cause any trouble, so I am not going to complain at\nall, not even in a snide, ironic way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut this is why I very cheekily want ask for your help. \u003cstrong\u003eI love doing this, and would love the\nopportunity to keep doing it, and to do it on a bigger scale\u003c/strong\u003e. At the\nmoment, I spend much of the week working an actual job, with linemanagers and\ntimesheets and rations on printing. Your support would allow me to work less,\nto spend \u003cstrong\u003emore time making videos\u003c/strong\u003e,\nand hopefully squeeze in a couple of image searches of Claudia per week too.\nLong-term, it may even allow me to do this full-time and really increase the amount\nof content I can put out as a one-man team. Everything I have done so far has\nbeen on reasonably limited resources, so it would also allow me to \u003cstrong\u003eimprove the production quality and scope of\nwhat I\u2019m doing\u003c/strong\u003e. I have a few ideas for different types of content I\u2019d\nlove to dabble in going forwards, and your support could make it happen. But I\nwon\u2019t say what those ideas are, so that nobody is disappointed just in case they don\u0027t happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe minimum donation Patreon allows is $1 per \u2018creation\u2019,\nwhich, thanks to Brexit, is about 77p. If you feel my work is worth more, \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u2019re welcome to donate as much or as\nlittle as you choose\u003c/strong\u003e. My aim is to make a video every other week, though they often take longer than that, and you\nwould be billed as and when the video goes live. If there\u2019s no video for a\nwhile, yes it defeats the objective in you doing this, but it also means you\u2019re\nnot paying anything. I\nrecognise most of you aren\u2019t Mourad Boujerall, so the thought of a few people donating just seventy-seven spare pennies is delightful to me. However, if\nany of you \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e Boujerall, I am also available\nif you want to offer me a Toulon contract, just so long as you don\u2019t plan on\nplaying me exclusively on the wing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn return, I\u2019m going to offer a handful of bonus rewards. The\nmain videos, the kind of thing I currently slave over will always be up on YouTube for everyone. \u003cstrong\u003eHowever,\nI plan to additionally create some smaller, bonus videos\u003c/strong\u003e. Think self-contained\nversions of the cutaways within in the current videos (\u2018Five theories on\nEngland\u2019s attack\u2019, the James Hook supercut, etc). Others won\u2019t be missing out\non content, but it\u2019s just a little bonus every now and again to say thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also want to provide \u003cstrong\u003eall\nPatreons with exclusive monthly extracts of Israel Folau slashfiction\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u2019ll\neven allow you the chance to request which players you want Izzy to lust over\nin the next chapter. Or to commission other ludicrous rugby fanfiction, I\u2019m not\nmarried to Israel Folau. I\u2019d love to be, but he voted against it. It\u0027s a silly little extra, but I found the thought of writing it funny, so it\u0027s going on offer. I plan to add\nmore bonus rewards and incentives as we go forward, so this won\u2019t be your lot\nif you do choose to support the channel. If there\u0027s something you, as a patron, want from the channel, or from me, I\u0027m very happy to listen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRegardless of whether or not you can afford to chuck a few\npennies my way, I really do appreciate the support of every single person who\nhas watched even one of my videos. Everyone who has taken the time to let me\nknow they like what I\u2019m doing. \u003cstrong\u003eI\nappreciate all of you as beautiful, wonderful, unique, shining, golden, marvelous human\nbeings, in a personal and very intimate way\u003c/strong\u003e. There\u2019s an automated message\nif you do choose to support the channel, but I just want you to know that I\nmean it. I really do. I\u2019ll never run out to play at the Millennium Stadium, and\nthat\u2019s OK, because thanks to all of you, I\u2019m getting a shot at working in the\nposition I was born to play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you,\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRobbie\u003cbr\u003e(The Squidge Rugby Guy)\u003cbr\u003e"
