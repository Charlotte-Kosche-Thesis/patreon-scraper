    "summary": "For those who don\u0027t know, I\u0027ve been working for the last 3 years to compile enough footage for a full length feature documentary that will shed light on the issues we face today, getting to the root of the problems, while exposing their simple, pleasant, symbiotic solutions. As much as I love working on this project, it has been a ton of work, and will continue to be. Add moving to Brazil, keeping up with Youtube activism, and life in general, and I\u0027ve found myself struggling to find time to work on the projects I feel are my purpose on earth, while staying afloat monetarily. In short, I\u0027m a starving artist, and would literally be starving if it weren\u0027t for the super cheap fruit here. So, I\u0027ve set up a Patreon account for anyone who would like to support my work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the middle class being squeezed out of existence, I totally understand that most people simply cannot afford to donate to others, no matter how much they would love to, and believe me, I feel \u00fcber strange asking for \"handouts.\" All that being said, if you don\u0027t have any extra cash laying around (does such a thing even exist? :D ) if you would please share my campaign and/or Youtube channel, Symbiotic Solutions, I will be very grateful! Your support in any way shape or form is appreciated beyond measure. Thank you so much, everyone. I am so lucky to have you all in my life. \u0026lt;3 Big things are on their way! \u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027m a dude who eat plants raw and moves in all sorts of ways all over the place. You probably already know that I am passionate about regrowing paradise, and think it\u0027s far more simple than we could have ever imagined. All we have to do is change what we eat, compost, tend to a garden, share and be kind to every living being, no matter what. I really appreciate any kind of support you give, and not just monetary support. I mean everything and anything. Without the kind words of my viewers, I don\u0027t know where I would be in life. Ya\u0027ll keep me going. \u0026lt;3",
