If you\u0027re here, you\u0027re probably at least somewhat familiar with what we do. While we each have work that we do under our respective names \u2014\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://shannoncurtis.net\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erecording artist\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://secretagentaudio.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erecord producer\u003c/a\u003e, respectively \u2014 more often than not these days people tend to think of us as being a unit. This is fair. a) We\u0027re married, b)\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://shannoncurtis.net/houseconcerts\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewe tour together a lot\u003c/a\u003e, and c) at this point, even when we\u0027re doing something that will get put in the Shannon bucket or the Jamie bucket, we\u0027re generally both working on it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shannoncurtis.net/images/patreon/train%20station.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we\u0027ve grown together, our work has branched outward in some unexpected ways. We still make a number of records each year, together and with other people. That hasn\u0027t changed. But more and more, there are other components to our daily life \u2014 and this Patreon is a way for us to help sustain that extra \"outside the box\" work that we do together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese joint efforts include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommunity engagement and leadership.\u003c/strong\u003e We started off just making music. But as you\u0027ve seen if you\u0027ve been on our journey with us, the community-centric nature of what we do has taken on a life of its own. These days we function as the loose center of a passionate community of people with whom we have meaningful, interactive, ongoing relationships. We do our best to live our lives with wide-open eyes, and to advocate for people and causes that need it. We believe our leadership of this community is a powerful opportunity to inspire other people to create positive change in their lives and in their worlds.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArtist mentoring.\u003c/strong\u003e We believe the world is changed for the better when independent artists are empowered to make their voices heard. Any given week, between the two of us, we spend on average about 10 hours mentorin, encouraging, providing feedback, helping with songwriting, giving career advice, coaching people on how to do house concerts, and so on. It\u0027s incredibly rewarding. There are voices out there that deserve to be heard. We\u0027re doing what we can to help.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eWriting.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0We want to help as many people as possible to be able to do art full-time on their own terms. In service of this goal, we put as much as possible of what we\u0027ve learned into writing. Sometimes this writing is in article form; we have each had a bunch of articles published in freely-available artist-centric outlets. And sometimes the writing turns into books! We have one book already out under Shannon\u0027s name \u2014 a how-to book for doing house concerts. We\u0027re working on another book under Jamie\u0027s name \u2014 it will be a series of essays and meditations from learned experiences on how to do independent art better.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting our Patreon helps support all this extra stuff that we do in hopes of helping make the world a slightly better place.
