We are committed to ending farm animal cruelty and promoting plant based living through \u003cstrong\u003eour rescue, rehabilitation and education\u003c/strong\u003e efforts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe provide a home for abused and neglected farm animals. We also seek to educate others by raising awareness of the horrible conditions animals face in factory farms, as well as the dangerous effects factory farming has on our health and the environment. Through our events and visiting days, we encourage the community to connect with our animals and realize how sensitive, emotional and loving they are. They are really no different than the dog or cat you have at home, except maybe larger. We also work with local and state governmental organizations and agencies to advocate for laws and policies that prevent animal suffering and promote the fair and compassionate treatment of animals. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSpring Farm Sanctuary was founded in 2016, by Robin Johnson. A lifelong vegetarian and now vegan, Robin has dedicated much of her life to advocate and care for animals and animal rights.\u003cbr\u003e\nA book by Jenny Brown founder of Woodstock Farm Sanctuary opened\nher eyes even wider and inspired her to open a sanctuary in\nMinnesota. Libby was one of the first animals to join us at Spring Farm\nSanctuary. She is inquisitive and kind, greeting returning volunteers and new\nguests alike as they enter the barn. She loves attention, and often asks to be\nstroked and pet. She is also energetic and adventurous: it isn\u2019t uncommon to\nsee her running through the fields and exploring on a beautiful day, even at\nher size. We love her so much, and we can\u2019t imagine Spring Farm without her.\nUnfortunately, this August, we almost had to. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen we first brought Libby home, she wasn\u2019t in\ngood shape. She had been living with a backyard butcher who kept her in filth\nwith no food or water, which made her thin and weak. She also had prod marks\nall over her face and body and a high fever due to a bacterial infection. It\nwas obvious that he had been abusing her, and we immediately got her veterinary\ncare, including antibiotics and pain relievers.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7v5b_C4FpjE/0.jpg\" style=\"width: 383px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEven with veterinary care for the first time,\nthings weren\u2019t easy for Libby. Her fever persisted and although she loved\nwalking through the fields and being outside, she was often lethargic. Then in\nearly August, Libby suddenly became severely ill. She was unable to stand up,\nunresponsive, and even had seizures. When her vet came to help her, he said\nthat it was already too late. He headed to his truck to get his euthanasia kit,\nbut told us she would be gone by the time he got back. He was wrong. Call it\ndivine intervention, call it a miracle, it was a powerful experience. Robin\ntalked to Libby and begged her to find the strength to get up and get on to the\nlivestock trailer. She did.  We rushed her to the U of M Vet Hospital\nwhere she underwent a major and life-threatening surgery that removed her\nuterus along with 42 liters (over 100 pounds) of pus-filled fluid. The\nveterinarians told us that she was probably not going to make it and kept\ncoming out of the surgery to ask us if they should continue. The surgery was\nexpensive, but we didn\u0027t care. They gave her a 5% chance of survival. But we\nhad faith, and Libby continued to surprise everyone. Even the Vets said it was\na miracle that she survived.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57a8cc3a2e69cf821eb2fa76/t/59889462ff7c50408a6ad290/1502123132234/Libby.png?format=500w\" style=\"width: 645px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter nearly a week of observation after her\nsurgery, Libby was finally able to return to the farm. She is a lot lighter,\nbut also healthier and happier than she has ever been. You can see her joy in\neverything she does, from afternoon naps in fresh straw to playing with\nAnnabelle. She is happy to be alive, and every time we see her we know she has\na soul, and a will to live. She is what Spring Farm Sanctuary is all about. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course, it takes a team of amazing volunteers, donations and contributions to continue our mission. It is very expensive and a lot of hard work.  Which brings us to asking for your help. By donating just $1.00 a month, you become a part of this growing movement to stop the exploitation of animals. Together we can push towards ending farm animal cruelty and promote compassionate living.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
