I live with my husband and my two pets, Gengar the pomeranian and BT the cat. I graduated Magna Cum Laude\u00a0from SCAD with a Bachelor\u0027s Degree in Animation in 2015, and I\u0027ve been working in the freelance industry ever since.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eLet\u0027s talk about my work:\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI love the aesthetic of the 1940s and 1950s, so a lot of that is evident in my illustrations. I draw a lot of inspiration from fashion choices of that time, a tiny bit of Tex Avery, some Betty Boop, and anything super cute. I also love drawing flirty pin up girls! I\u0027ve always loved 1950\u0027s pin ups, because to me, they always seemed confident in themselves and the scenes were always cute and fun. If you become a patron, you\u0027ll be able to see some cute pin ups.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have also started my own personal project about 4 griffin riders. I really want to ramp up my portfolio to showcase character design and concept work, so I wanted to create a story from scratch and develop all the characters, backgrounds, props, and scenes to showcase what I am interested in. If you become a patron, you\u0027ll be able to see ALL my sketches, concept work, and studies that pertain to this particular project. So why don\u0027t you follow me and watch my journey from start to finish? :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eWhy a Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs some of you may know, the freelance world is very unreliable. I bounce from studio to studio and I work\u00a0on projects until they are completed. Once they are completed, I have to move on and find something else to help\u00a0keep me and my family afloat. I don\u0027t expect Patreon to be my main source of income by any means, but more as a tip jar/encouragement for me to keep going. With donations from patrons, it will help me dedicate my time on fun personal projects, original art, fan art and Pinups much more easily without as many financial concerns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan\u0027t donate? Worried I\u0027ll stop posting art unless you become a patron? Don\u0027t worry! I\u0027ll still be posting work online for free, although my patrons will either be the first to see it, or there will be certain work I will \u003cem\u003eonly \u003c/em\u003ekeep on my Patreon feed, such as sketches, studies, and conversations about my personal project. But even if you can\u0027t donate, just visiting this page or sharing it helps me out a ton! So thank you so much for stopping in!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find me here as well:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://savannahalexandraart.tumblr.com/\"\u003eTumblr\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SavannahAlexandraArt/\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/savannahalexandraart\"\u003eInstagram\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eY\u0027all are swell~!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
