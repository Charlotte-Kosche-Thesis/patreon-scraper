    "summary": "I stream my gameplay on a daily basis, with games ranging from first person shooters like Planetside 2, Borderlands, to strategy games like Endless Space, Endless Legend, Civilizations 5, Beyond Earth, Anno 2070, to survival games like Factorio, Rebuild 3, Starbound, and many other games. As well as streaming my gameplay time. Along with streaming, I record my gameplay so that I can post it up onto my Youtube channel for when someone cannot make it to my stream. I will not edit the footage and select specific moments to capture, I will always show every moment of my game play from the grinds, to the excitement, to the frustration, and even the horrible deaths.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a personal side, I aim to also provide tips and advice on being disabled, how to get help that might be needed to live a more normal life, and how to handle family and friends that maybe having difficulty accepting or adjusting to your disabilities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledges and funds will be going towards helping me continue to provide content. Along side that, I look to host public servers for games such as Starbound, and many others that have co-op options for them where supporters can come join me for some co-op fun, or go up against me in some friendly competition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout myself, I go by SilentK1tt3n, or just Kitten for short, I am a disabled gamer. I live in constant pain from a condition known as Dystonia, while this is not cure-able, it is treatable. This pain can become so intense that it can be debilitating and leave me bed ridden for hours or even days at a time. While I am capable of walking short distances with the aid of a cane, for longer distances I must use a wheel chair to get around, presently I am unable to drive because I am having to fight the government for financial help in getting hand controls for a vehicle. On top of that, I am also a mute; yep that\u0027s right, a mute; I lost my ability to vocalize (speak) back around 2009, while there is a small chance I might one day be able to speak once more with surgery and therapy, this however is not a sure thing because of the extent of the trauma to my vocal box. Along with those things, I also have mild OCD which I do not even consider a disability, I take my OCD as a challenge to life in managing it and using it instead to my advantage. I also have a very stupid immune system, basically to put it simply, I have the condition that causes my own white blood cells to attack my body thinking that my own body is the enemy. Because of \u00a0this I regularly have to get immune boost treatments that are similar to a plasma infusion only much more painful and taxing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy tell you this, not to give you incentive to pledge to me, no. I tell you about myself to give you a look into why I am doing what I am, and why I do it the way I do. Since I am unable to speak, I will often play music that I find enjoyable while I game, or have a friend in teamspeak with me so they can commentate, or with Niisan, a supporter and dear friend to me. \u003cbr\u003e"
