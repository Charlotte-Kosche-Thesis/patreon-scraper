I love being behind a camera, and I also love being in front of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past 6 years I have modeled as an amateur fairly frequently.

Responding to comments and messages, sorting through old and new photos to post to keep things interesting, writing blog posts to keep people updated on my life... But I\u0027d like to do more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to get back in front of a camera more frequently, and I\u0027d love to interact with my fans on a whole new level! At the same time, I cannot sacrifice my time and well-being without being repaid in some tiny fashion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you love my modeling work, please consider being my patron and help me have the ability to connect with my audience better\u00a0(which includes you!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently cannot offer ultimately exclusive access to photos or prints, because I do not own the photos. But I can give prior access to photos that I plan to post publicly later, candid behind the scenes photography, and candid photos from my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I make my monthly goals though, I will be able to hire photographers and offer a lot more goodies to my fans.\u003cbr\u003e"
