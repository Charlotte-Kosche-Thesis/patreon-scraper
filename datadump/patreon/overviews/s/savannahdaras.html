The aspects of life that you notice when you stop allowing your mind to take control, and just \"be\". I like to say that I bring dreams to life, maybe they are my dreams, and maybe they are the dreams of others. With all that is tarnished in this world, creating allows me to live in the most ethereal existence that I can conjure up. With vibrant colors, bright tones, whimsical yet emotive characters, and working with nature as my canvas; this is what I do, these are my creations.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"http://m1.22slides.com/savannahdaras/img1320-edit-web-2045603.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/9lct1u.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"http://www.savannahdaras.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/savannahdaras\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/savannahdaras\"\u003efacebook\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://500px.com/savannahdaras\"\u003e500px\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/savannahdaras\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/savannahdaras\"\u003eyoutube\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/1251ff8.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003ePledging a monthly donation will allow you to access exclusive content produced by me!
