Transformation is one of my greatest passions, and I love helping connect people to their fantasies through the written word\u2014even if said word can tend to be erotic at times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom mental to physical transformation, my stories have a little bit of everything for fans of the genre. I\u0027m a hobbyist writer who loves to please people, and I really want some way to thank my biggest supporters. Patreon is a nice fit for this, and so I\u0027ll be working hard to maintain a decent output.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to try and upload every story I write (starting October 2016) as a .pdf to this site, and I\u0027m hoping that the tag search on Patreon will make it a convenient way to download .pdf files my supporters will enjoy. As a heads-up, I do have a tendency to write nonconsensual transformation, leaning towards mind loss. Just so you all know what you\u0027re in for. ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of that having been said, welcome to SketchySeraph\u0027s digital library of TF! I hope you enjoy your stay, and that you emerge in whatever form you want most."
