I\u2019m a music maker in Austin, Texas.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE I\u0027M FROM\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u2019m from Snyder, a safe little town in the west Texas panhandle. I grew up with 3 sisters, one hilarious, multi-talented Mummy, and I\u0027ve had luck enough to call the best man on planet Earth, \u0027Fa\u0027(Dad). \u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been making music for most of my lyfe. My mom and sisters all play piano and sing beautiful fam harmonies (s/o to a shared genome). Mummy taught us to read books and music, and put us in piano lessons before we could reach the pedals. Fa used to pull out my great uncle\u2019s old Gibson and play us Bluegrass diddies and oldies he learned as a kid. I remember climbing up the bench to the old upright at home to play a concerto of \u0027sad songs\u0027 on the lower keys and \u0027happy songs\u0027 at higher pitches for my family, babysitters, pets, and whoever else was in the house and down to be enthralled!\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was 15, I picked up guitar so I could sing the country songs I heard on the radio, and to impress the boyz. I quickly started writing songs. My people were very encouraging, and I loved to hear that they felt connected to my music. In HS I would have recently heartbroken friends come over to collaborate on their own breakup songs. It became a way to connect with people that made me feel useful and heard.\u003cbr\u003eAfter I left home, I studied music, live sound, anthropology, and graduated from University of North Texas. Then I fluttered on down to Austin:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE I AM\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI haven\u0027t stopped writing, and, recently, I\u0027ve been focused on getting creations from my bedroom to the internet. I\u0027ve learned to track, mix, film, edit, loop, and time my recording sessions perfectly around my neighbor\u2019s lawn maintenance schedule.\u003cbr\u003eI work as a live sound engineer at a few venues here in Austin. I dig getting to meet new bands and be a part of their show, and I get especially stoked when I get to be the performer.  Usually I fly solo, but when I get to bring the bandbros it is LIT! I collaborate on a few side projects as a singer, bassist, looper, and \u2018wild card\u2019.... whatever that is.  I think it\u2019s probably good, and 100% most definitely doesn\u2019t mean insane person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE I\u0027M GOING\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to spend more time writing and releasing my music. I want to tour with the music I\u0027m releasing, and I want to pay my bandbros to come with me. I want to make a pie so I can cut it into pieces and outsource booking, promotions, PR campaigns, and management. I want my hard work to be valuable and sustainable. If you\u2019re picking up what I\u2019m putting down, any encouragement you could send my way is so appreciated. Whether it\u2019s a follow, subscription, share, kind words, or a request, I\u0027d love to connect."
