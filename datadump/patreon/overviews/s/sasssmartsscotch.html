    "summary": "Hi everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, this podcast does not mean I am giving up acting. Acting is and has always been my absolute dream and I will continue working hard to make sure that dream becomes a reality. I have been looking for work that will allow me the time to travel to Austin, San Antonio, or New Orleans for auditions or work, but these jobs are few and far between. So I have been thinking of ways to hopefully make money, and continue on my acting journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePodcasts have been one of those things that have crossed my mind time and time again, but to do something else that would not help me pay bills is something I cannot afford. After discussing podcasts with a friend, he suggested I check out Patreon. Patreon allows anyone to give whatever amount they want for each podcast I release (once a week). You can also set a limit to the amount you want to donate each month. I love the idea of Podcasts as you can listen to them on your own schedule:  while sitting in traffic, bored at home, or during your workouts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want Sass, Smarts \u0026amp; Scotch to be a fun escape from your hectic day. Along with some of my favorite people, we will be dishing on those crazy personal stories, relationships, entertainment, must see movies and TV, current events, style, and important topics important to our listeners. I want to know what you want to hear more of or less of, and I will listen to your suggestions and requests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI understand that not everyone can afford to donate (I\u2019m in the same boat). Sharing links to the podcast, sharing the\u00a0\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook page\u003c/a\u003e, listening, liking, and subscribing, will be a huge help! Over time, I hope to build this show to something that can make you all laugh and improve your day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for the continued support from my friends and family, it means so much more than you could ever imagine. And thank you in advance to those who decide to pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxo\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVicki"
