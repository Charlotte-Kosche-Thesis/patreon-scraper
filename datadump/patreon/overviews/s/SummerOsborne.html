    "summary": "I remember sitting cross-legged on my white-wood, Ethan\nAllen canopy bed, looking out the window, contemplating the implications of\nwar. I was drafting a letter to the President of the United States.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEven at six years old, my little eyes and impressionable\nheart could see and feel the struggle of humanity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI was very observational - although at that time, my\nfather would often worry that my head spent too much time in the clouds. My\nimagination was just too much for his analytical brain. And he was under the\nimpression that I just didn\u2019t pay attention.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo be sure, my imagination WAS impressive\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI told them I had magical powers. Because I could change\nthe direction of the school bus windshield wipers with my brain.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI made elaborate radio shows on my cassette player with Meow\nMix commercials. I\u2019d play the jingle on my little keyboard and \u201cmeeeoooow!\u201d for\nthree minutes straight.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also had this pervasive notion that if I were stick a\npipe cleaner down my throat and into my lungs, it would scratch that itch I\u2019d\nget when I was on the verge of getting bronchitis.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo yes\u2026 my dad worried about me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut when my mother picked me up from my first day of\nfirst grade, and Mrs. Paige asked me to tell her what I\u2019d learned in Science\u2026 I\nlooked up at her and regurgitated, almost verbatim, the classroom textbook. And\nthen asked her when we were going to start reading chapter books. Because I was\nbored in my reading circle. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt was then, and only then, they realized that I WAS\nlistening. And I WAS paying attention.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI was the \u201cWhy?\u201d kid.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI wondered\u2026 a LOT.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSunday school teachers would go to my parents with the\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop her from asking so many questions\u201d conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut they never made me stop.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt some point, I started making connections between what\nI observed, and the thoughts that go with it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThen I made connections between the thoughts, and how I\nfelt.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd finally, started making connections between what I\nBELIEVED\u2026 and the results.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI was also blessed with the gift of music. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhy?\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecause music is what people listen to.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll people\u2026 of all generations, ethnicity, backgrounds,\nand faiths.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd it\u2019s the one thing I do that instantly connects me\nfrom heaven to earth.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis has culminated into a broad-based understanding\nzone\u2026 that is still growing and evolving.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecause I always reserve the right to change my mind, if\nmy mind comes to a better understanding.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am willing to grow.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAre you?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen you subscribe to my Patreon, you are contributing to\na journey.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nA journey without a destination.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou\u2019re joining me on an adventure \u2013 and I have no idea\nwhere we\u2019re going.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut I can promise you love.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd laughter. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd deep thought. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd tears\u2026 of joy, of empathy, and of realization.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI want to share my art with you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI want to share my process.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNot only the process of songwriting\u2026 that is not the\nwhole of who I am.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut also, the process of how we process.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe process of life itself.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHow to love in the face of irritation and\nuncomfortable-ness.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHow to grow, when it feels like we\u2019re moving backwards.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHow to practice the art of using your heart.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut please know\u2026 that there is no equation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere is no formula or recipe.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u2019s a quest\u2026 with no last stop.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd it\u2019s full of questions, and color, and sound, and\nlight.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere may be some answers. But each answer will come in a\ndifferent form to each person.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere may be some road blocks. But each one an\nopportunity to seek alternate routes to discover multiple paths!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDo not underestimate your own ability to learn, and to\nteach, and to grow.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTHAT is what I\u2019m here to show you\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYour Own Light. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI love you,\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSummer Osborne\u003cbr\u003e"
