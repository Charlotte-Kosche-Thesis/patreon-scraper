Morse\u003c/strong\u003e, creator of the Parsec Award-winning podcast \u003cstrong\u003eSupervillain Corner\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupervillain Corner is an audio advice column for up and coming villains. Hosted by the ultimate evil overlord and mad scientist \u003cstrong\u003eProfessor Brainfever\u003c/strong\u003e, it covers the means, methods, and the lives of the evil but likeable hosts. If you want to know how to achieve evil glory, listen to Professor Brainfever, Spine Tingler, Chao-mancer and the rest of the nefarious cast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt least that was how things went in Season 1. In Season 2 we discovered the life and methods of the superheroes in this universe, as a captured Professor Brainfever was forced to produce the \u003cstrong\u003eSuper Hero Corner\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil his sudden but inevitable betrayal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose first two seasons were phenomenal, but I took a long break from both writing and producing while my family expanded with the birth of my first child. Now I\u2019m getting back in to it with the creation of \u003cstrong\u003eSupervillain Corner Season 3: Supervillain World\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will go to the continued production of the weekly podcast. Supervillain Corner will always be free, as it is a labor of love. But any support would make the production slicker, the website hosting more manageable, and the audio clearer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u2019t expect your support to be for nothing, though! By becoming a patron you will get exclusive behind the scenes content, special previews and occasional goodies, both audio and physical. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, most importantly, you\u2019ll be helping to make \u003cstrong\u003eSupervillain Corner\u003c/strong\u003e the best podcast it possibly can be!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://christopherxmorse.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/brainy.jpg\" style=\"width: 627px;\"\u003e"
