On the interwebs, I go by StrangeLuv (or just Strange, for short). If you\u0027ve looked up Darksiders, Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare, or even The Witcher 3 on YouTube, there\u0027s a good chance you might have stumbled across my gaming channel.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy gaming interests span a wide range of titles, from shooters \u0026amp; adventure games, to action RPG\u2019s and puzzlers. I cherish games that can offer memorable, fun, and unique experiences.\u00a0I strive to make decent quality content that is enjoyable, informative, and fun!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the last couple of years, I have worked to grow my YouTube channel, and have even seen some success in my endeavors. I would like to be able to post videos on a wider range of games, and serve a broader audience of gamers, particularly in the realm of indie games.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI feel I have a strong foundation with my YouTube channel and would love to graduate to become a full-time content creator. I have a job that allows me to make ends meet, but this also gets in the way of my ability to consistently create videos.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith the volatile climate of YouTube these days, one cannot thrive off of ad revenue alone. Success does not happen in a vacuum, so I have set up this Patreon account to humbly ask for your support. There\u0027s no where to go but up, and I\u0027m inviting you to be a part of my journey!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128,100,162);\"\u003eWhere does your pledge go?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nYour contributions would go toward various video-related expenses, including internet costs, software fees, new recording/streaming equipment, and general maintenance of all the tech bits and bobs related to gaming.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also have four little fur babies (cats) that need food \u0026amp; litter, so part of your contribution will go towards keeping them healthy and happy. So if not for me, then please do it for the kitties!\uff3e\uff65\uff6a\uff65\uff3e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlus, there\u0027s always bills. My student loan debt has been looming over me for quite some time, so if I could pay at least pay\u00a0part of those off, I\u0027ll be one happy stranger.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128,100,162);\"\u003e\u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nPlease only consider being a patron if you have the means to do so. If you are low on money, then don\u0027t feel pressured into donating, because I will love you either way.
