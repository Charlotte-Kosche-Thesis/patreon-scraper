As a graduation project on the Art Academy in Zagreb Croatia, in 2011 I created Silence Wanderers: Book One. It was 80 pages long, full color, written and illustrated completely by me. Alas, I found out how expensive it is to print so I managed to get only 16 copies. Since I could not find the publisher that was where the story stopped for the graphic novel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOn June 16th, 2014 the story continued in form of\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://silencewanderers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSilence Wanderers web comics\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cstrong\u003eFeel free to read the first story of \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://silencewanderers.com/comic/e00p01/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSilence Wanderers here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSince I was making no money at all from the series, I was drawing pages veeeeeeery slowly in between deadlines of jobs and projects that put food on my table and paid my bills.
