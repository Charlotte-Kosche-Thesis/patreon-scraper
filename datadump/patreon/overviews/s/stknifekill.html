St. KnifeKill is a collaborative channel created and directed by myself, Nico, as well as edited and co-hosted by my brother, Jake, and\u00a0we are always looking for ways to improve, whether it\u0027s equipment, animations, graphics, or just time in the studio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Little Bit About Us and What We Do\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eJake and I met back in 2007, when we were in high school. By the time we graduated, I\u0027d gone out to get a B.A. in film production, while Jake went to serve his country as a United States Marine. One of the things that always kept us close was gaming. Jake and I are very competitive, so we kept in touch through online games. Unexpectedly, we got to be fairly decent, and as time went on we wondered if there wasn\u0027t some way for us to share our stories and shenanigans with the world. So we made use of my experience in film making and his willingness to entertain to create St. KnifeKill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, we stream every night at 9PM EST, and we produce a vlog answering questions and detailing any updates and news on our content, about once a month. We are building a tight-knit community around the world, and this Patreon is where you guys can go to make the biggest difference to our channel."
