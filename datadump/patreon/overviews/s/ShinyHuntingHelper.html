They\u0027re just so...shiny...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, I started shiny hunting on Pok\u00e9mon Sun and the SOS method worked for me, but I often lost track of my chain. So I built a website that would keep track of the chains for me. I called the website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.shinyhuntinghelper.xyz\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eShiny Hunting Helper\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI showed the website to a few people, they liked it and I decided to improve it even further.\u003cbr\u003eRight now, the site has support to Shiny Hunting from Generation 4 to Generation 7. When a new game is released, the game and its various shiny hunting ways are added to the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the site itself is done for free, the domain name and hosting the site aren\u0027t. And despite the fact that I love the freedom money can provide, I don\u0027t want to ask money from anyone who can\u0027t afford to give.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is very important: if you \u003cstrong\u003ecan \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003ewant\u003c/strong\u003e to pledge, by all means, go ahead. If you want to pledge, but can\u0027t, that\u0027s completely fine. Share the site on social media, talk about it with your friends. Just don\u0027t get yourself into trouble by giving me money you can\u0027t."
