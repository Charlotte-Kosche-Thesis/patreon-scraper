    "summary": "In 2004, the Sandpoint Reader was first published by three 20-somethings who wanted to provide an alt-weekly voice to Sandpoint, Idaho. Thanks to the hard work of Zach Hagadone, John Reuter and Chris DeCleur, the Reader established itself as a voice of arts, entertainment, politics, humor and in-depth stories that a daily newspaper doesn\u0027t have the ability to publish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2012, Zach and John were both offered jobs that took them out of Sandpoint and the Reader went out of publication. It was a dark and lonely time in Sandpoint. No one knew what the hell was going on, where it was happening, who was playing music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, in January 2015, Ben Olson and Keokee Publishing banded together to bring the Reader back into publication. They hired on Cameron Rasmusson as editor and the irreverent alt-weekly was resurrected on January 29, 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlmost 150 issues later, the Reader has firmly established itself again as one of the most read publications in Sandpoint. Offering commentary by the people, for the people, the Reader\u0027s strength is the fact that is it written by the community at large, with everybody pitching in to provide a new voice and a new way to get your news in Sandpoint.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBringing a newspaper back into print in this day and age is a risky gambit. As the Reader has been and always will be a free publication, the only money that we earn comes from our advertisers. While daily papers rely on a cash crop of legal notices and subscription revenue to keep the lights on, the Reader gets by because our advertisers know that our publication is picked up by a wide demographic of people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to grow, Sandpoint. We want more investigative pieces, more in-depth features and profiles of important people in the region. We want to cover the unique politics of North Idaho and help inform our readers of what\u0027s happening both in their backyard and in their neighborhood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. Every month or two, someone invariably walks into our shabby little office on Cedar St. and reminds us of why we do this. Why we grind 50 hours a week for little to no pay. They thank us for our hard work and write a check for a small sum of money. $50, $100. One beautiful man wrote us a check for $250 out of the clear blue sky.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery time one of these angels walks into the office, I am always humbled by their generosity. I would like to thank them and give the check back, but the truth is, I need every dollar we can pull in, so I gladly accept their donation. It really means a lot when it happens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat got Cameron and I to thinking. Cameron mentioned there was this site Patreon that was sort of like a Kickstarter crowdfunding site, but it was more geared to the arts, where people can be micro-patrons of an artist who is creating work that they appreciate. They can give a buck a month, ten bucks at a time, whatever they wanted to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could go on and on about how I feel about crowdfunding sites. I understand that every once in awhile a really cool project gets the funding it deserves, and that\u0027s great. What I don\u0027t like is how it has become this crutch that people rely on - give me money to succeed and I\u0027ll try to succeed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo it\u0027s hard for me to set up a crowdfunding site like this, but I recognize that there are some out there who might want to show a little support to our newspaper.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I said before, the Reader always has been free and it always will be free. From time to time, some of these kind souls who donate to us say, \"I\u0027d gladly pay if you charged per issue.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of this Patreon page as a way to give a virtual subscription to the Reader. Seriously, anything will help. $1 per month, $5 per month. We do this because we love it, not because we\u0027re getting rich off of it. But, as any small business owner can attest to, there are times when I can\u0027t even pay myself, and that is always difficult to rationalize after putting in another tough day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny donations you make to the Reader will go into the future of our paper. We\u0027ve hired a staff writer, a recent graduate from the University of Idaho, Lyndsie Kiebert. We\u0027d like to purchase a few snazzy racks and newspaper boxes to place around town. We\u0027d also like to bring a live concert series to Farmin Park every Tuesday in summer, which is a plan we\u0027re working on now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to all of you who continue to support an informed community. We appreciate you and we appreciate any help you can give."

     "about": "The Sandpoint Reader is an alt-weekly newspaper from Sandpoint, Idaho that began publication in 2004. It was originally owned by Zach Hagadone, John Reuter and Chris DeCleur with Ben Olson as contributing writer. The Reader was published every week until 2012 when remaining owners Hagadone and Reuter accepted jobs out of the area and were forced to stop publication. The Reader went out of print for two and a half years until January, 2015, when Ben Olson brought it back into publication with the assistance of Keokee Publishing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, the Reader enjoys a strong following of support from the communities surrounding North Idaho. It is owned by Ben Olson and Keokee Publishing, who are both locally based in Sandpoint. University of Montana graduate Cameron Rasmusson was brought on as editor. Advertising director Jodi Taylor was hired in 2016 to work with advertising clients and keep the money coming in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBringing back a print publication in the age of digital publishing may seem foolhardy to some, but we believe in the medium at the Reader and have found overwhelming support from those within the community. To satisfy the needs of the modern age, we also publish a website with expanded content from the print edition, as well as operate a Facebook page to be able to keep up with breaking news on social media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are starting this Patreon account for a variety of reasons, namely we need support to improve our product. While print dailies rely on subscription costs, legal advertisements, obituaries and advertising to pay their overhead, the Reader only has one source of revenue: advertising from the community. Ben Olson serves as publisher, layout editor, advertising salesman and designer, writer, photographer, webmaster and more. Cameron Rasmusson serves as editor, staff writer, deliveryman and more. We are both doing at least twice the work we should be. Such is the reality of operating a small town newspaper.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother reason we have started this Patreon account is that we regularly receive donations from the community at large. Sometimes these donations come in anonymously, sometimes they are handed to us by thankful readers who wish to support our work. While I am continually humbled by these shows of support, I am also aware that there is a definite need for a system to collect these donations in a more organized way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Reader is essentially a for-profit business that doesn\u0027t make any profit. Hopefully this will change that. We are dedicated to providing Sandpoint and the surrounding region with fair, unbiased news, long form journalism, arts and entertainment, as well as community news of interest. We appreciate any and all support in helping us be a better publication each week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBen Olson, Publisher",
