We\u0027re turning to the public access television model to get access to a studio, and will be handling distribution of our show on YouTube and Amazon Prime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe positive? We have completely control over our show and its content, and can make the show that moves us. The negative? We do so on a volunteer basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have an awesome team of producers, editors, camera operators, and set technicians who have put so many hours of their lives into this project. Not to mention all of the talented acts who\u0027ve traveled from all over the place to perform in our studio. I\u0027m hoping that with a bit of funding, I can compensate all of these awesome people for their time and effort with a little dough. Patreon seems like the most fair and democratic way to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t make this show for money. If we break even on production costs, that\u0027d be a huge win.
