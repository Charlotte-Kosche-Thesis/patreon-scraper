I believe telling and sharing stories is a great way to impact others in a major way. My best friend and I from childhood grew up together drawing and creating original stories and are working on a little something known as, Cross Stories\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ethat we plan to get up and going soon with your support.\u00a0The stories that I have and love to share with others are Christian based with a lot of action and character development. The characters face different trials that they must learn from in order to progress and grow from if they are to succeed in life. My stories are also family orient and something that everyone can hope to enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
