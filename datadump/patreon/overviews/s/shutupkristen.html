Welcome to my Patreon!\u003c/span\u003e My name is Kristen, although you have probably surmised that from the giant text up at the top of this page. I am an actress and content creator just tryna make a living doing creative things that I love. BUT before we get to the business stuff, here\u2019s some possibly-irrelevant information about me! I\u2019m 25 years old, my birthday is Columbus Day (October 12th- the real Columbus Day, not the fake lets-move-the-date-around Columbus Day) which makes me a Libra! I\u2019m totally a Libra. Not that I\u2019m going to make life decisions off of horoscopes or anything, but I do fit the archetype. I\u2019m a Ravenclaw (hollaaaaaaaaaa) and I treasure coffee as you would a life source. Starbucks is my \u003cem\u003eCheers.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Everybody knows my name and more importantly HOW TO SPELL my name. Yes, that is a feat that I am particularly proud of. Overall, I\u2019m a big ol\u2019 nerd who loves to be a part of this crazy Internet culture. Oh- and I have a Dog named Maxx. You will see him pop up in anything and everything I do.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e*\u003cstrong\u003eCue adorable yet sensible picture of Maxx*\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/22dc84e5f44d2a44e112e6eed121c6de/tumblr_ondwckj3yi1qa78dko1_540.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/22dc84e5f44d2a44e112e6eed121c6de/tumblr_ondwckj3yi1qa78dko1_540.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(146, 205, 220);\"\u003eNow onto the purpose of this page-\u003c/span\u003e as any person who aspires to succeed in a creative field knows- it\u2019s not easy. The videos that I make here on the World Wide Web take a lot of time, energy and unfortunately- money. Do you sense that I\u2019m about to ask you for help with the money thing? You are on Patreon, after all. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe magical, amazing part of being a member of the YouTube community is that what we are doing is free no-strings-attached entertainment. I never want that to change. Certainly if I had to pay to watch the content I want on YouTube, I would be very broke very quickly. With that said, it also means that there is very little compensation for the people that are working hard to make the videos that you love. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t need a lecture from me on why money is important. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003eThis page is like a tip jar!\u003c/span\u003e If you like what I do and you have a dollar to give me every month, that\u2019s amazing! If you have more than that- ALSO amazing! What I\u2019ve realized as a person that\u2019s been making videos for 5 years now is that in order to make certain next-level videos that I am dying to make, I need a little help. This is your chance to help me achieve those video goals faster. FUN FACT: In the 3 years I have been on Patreon, this site has now helped me leave my office job! Amazing people like you made that happen. THAT IS THE POWER OF THIS WEBSITE!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this borderline Shakespearian monologue! Your support means more to me than you know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

A series like this takes a ton of time (seriously, far more time than you\u0027d expect), and also will require me to get some new equipment like lights and more flexible tripods to really be able to show you the process in depth. Along with that- cosplay is expensive!
