Last year we bought our JAEKA (Beneteau Cyclades 43.3), and this year started off our journey constantly being in pursuit of gorgeous sunsets and cozy breeze.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoing places with no visible presence of life, we came up with an idea to share our experience and film those hidden and distant parts of the world. We both are excited and happy to lay out chronologically our adventure, flavoring the atmosphere with our own existence. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour invisible (or visible) presence in out story is an essential part beyond cameras. We are planning to spend some time around every single island, where our keel will let us to go, and produce unforgettable pieces of content for you to discover and for us to remember. Being a part of our long (hopefully) tour is already a huge help for us, your comments and reviews will keep us motivated and inspired. Becoming our patron will help us following the direction on our navigation program we set, not the direction a wind will blow us to :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSandy feet,\u003cbr\u003eJack \u0026amp; Kateryna\u003cbr\u003e"
