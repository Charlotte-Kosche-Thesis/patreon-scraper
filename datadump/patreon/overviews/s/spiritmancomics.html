     "about": "Spiritman is a comic book created by Scott Allen Snyder and Everett Paul Burris about 30 years ago. We were teenagers then. We loved supehero stories and we loved God. We always saw a great metaphor in these stories\u00a0for the adventure that happens when you follow Jesus. While we had fun making the Spiritman comic we lacked the skills to do it right. Eventually we went separate ways. Scott pursued play writing and I pursued drawing. One day we decided to reconnect and work on Spiritman again. This time we think we can actually pull it off.",
