     "about": "This hobby of mine started with me being a gear freak and an urge to buy a good camera with some money I suddenly got. I ended up with the Canon 70D, which was the first Canon DSRL camera that could focus while filming. I didn\u2019t care about filming too much at that time, but I attended Oslo Open 2015 and wanted to take some pictures of the final round at that tournament. There I met Hassimus who was covering the final round and was renowned for filming Disc Golf videos in Norway. I ended up filming instead and gave him my footage and he used parts of it in his coverage of that tournament.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat would end up with me filming Skien Open 2015 as well, and after that I was hooked. I started buying some new gear and asked J\u00f8rn Idar if I could film the first round of the newly founded Oslo Tour event. He was stoked, and together with him helping on the commentary, my YouTube channel was born. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I try to film as many tournaments as I can, and increasing the production value as much as possible. Hopefully my channel can grow to become as popular as the \"big boys\" in America :)",
