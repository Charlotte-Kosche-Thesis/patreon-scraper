I believe in this concept with all my heart. I think it\u0027s BRILLIANT. Please consider giving me a dollar (or however you much you like) per music video that I upload to youtube. I will continue to bring you nothing but the absolute best production and effort that I have since the first time you ran into some of my work on Youtube (But BETTER) . I will be releasing a video every 10-18 days (about two a month\u2026sometimes more, sometimes less.) If you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, there\u0027s an easy way to set a monthly maximum for yourself when you\u0027re entering your payment info.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere your money goes:\u003c/h3\u003eI\u0027ve GOT a production team that I work with to keep my covers coming every two weeks, and I try to work WITH an incredible video team when I have enough money to pay them!  Please don\u0027t become a patron if you\u0027re low on money - I know what that feels like - and please don\u0027t feel like you have to. I will carry on making music videos whether you donate or not, they just might be a bit better and more frequent if you do. Please don\u0027t donate anything if you\u0027re strapped for cash and certainly don\u0027t feel obliged to support my work in this way. I am able to keep on making this music because of YOU guys. I choose the songs I do because YOU all ask for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cimg src=\"http://i1314.photobucket.com/albums/t573/patreoncreator/silhouette-film-crew-57_zps04ee7f60.jpg\" style=\"width: 263px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHere are some awesome rewards for you! \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1/video:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to my patron only stream\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFree download of I Am Muslim*\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e*Limited time only!
