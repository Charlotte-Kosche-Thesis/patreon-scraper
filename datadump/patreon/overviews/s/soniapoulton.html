    "summary": "Hello - thank you for arriving here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the link to our first documentary \u0027The McCanns and The Police\u0027 Part 1.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q1M_CulIDrQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an unintentional professional troublemaker. \u00a0I have done this via my journalism and broadcasting where, for decades, I have refused to toe the party line. It has got me into a lot of trouble.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMany people now know that mainstream media (TV, radio, print and internet platforms) discuss the same stories over and over again. And, as we see, usually agreeing on a common consensus of what that story is.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, there is great and lively debate to be had within this narrow framework (thank you, Noam Chomsky) but it\u0027s always designed around a basis that maintains the status quo and does not challenge it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVariety is not appreciated - and neither are radical thinkers. You have to conform, to a degree, to be part of that MSM narrative. And many journalists - e.g. those who seek news and not public relations - are tired of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that, marks you out as a troublemaker. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhich brings me back to how I became a professional one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut here\u0027s the good news. MSM is being challenged in ways that it never has in history. For, as the internet gives rise to fresher, less-agenda\u0027d alternatives, the naked emperor has been exposed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd this is where I come in.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make videos which do what mainstream films seldom do: question the official narrative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut,\u00a0with the knowledge that this information will have been fact-checked and be evidence-based and can become a trusted source in your news arsenal.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to bring in the talented and the creative and the visionary (and as I know these are often the people who have not had the break they deserve)...and I want them to be paid a decent wage for doing a decent job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo far, my independent work has been supported by the goodwill of\u00a0people who either know me well enough - and what I stand for - or who are prepared to take a punt based on a substantial back catalogue of journalism and broadcasting.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo...for those who are new to me, \u003cstrong\u003ewhat do I stand for?\u003c/strong\u003e Well, freedom of speech and anti-censorship and an absolutely deep-in-the-bone loathing of brainwashing, indoctrination and injustices. This combination has made for an interesting career so far. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome of it described here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.soniapoulton.co.uk\"\u003ehttp://www.soniapoulton.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd here is the back story of what brought me here...and why \u0027The McCanns and The Police\u0027 is my first video on Patreon:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.theuntoldstoryofmadeleinemccann.com\"\u003ehttp://www.theuntoldstoryofmadeleinemccann.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eLET ME MAKE THIS CLEAR: THE AIM IS ALWAYS TO CREATE FREE AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE CONTENT. THAT IS A MUST.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create a body of work, from a journalist who understands the importance of large, mainstream audiences but with the less cautious (and prepared to take more risks) approach of alternative media. Because, for no other reason, than it needs to be so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWork that can stand as evidence of our times, and the times before us, and that there were people like me, like us, who were prepared to say \u2018No, wait a minute, that\u0027s not OK\u2026\u2019 \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot to be deliberately provocative but\u00a0because it needed to be said, rather than follow in great conformity because it may appear easier not to rock the boat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur entire existence \u2013 from cradle to grave \u2013 is managed for conformity. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe go to school, we learn history from the pen of the victor, the financial influencers, the perpetrators \u2013 but seldom from the underdog, the trampled over, the oppressed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe are guided, scalded, cajoled and bullied into doing as we are told. No questions asked. I wasn\u0027t raised like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI grew up in an unconventional household, where questioning so-called authority was the norm.\u00a0Some people think I\u0027m a bit \u0027out there\u0027, some think I\u0027m not far enough. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nHowever, most agree that I am far from a mainstream media puppet. Friends and enemies alike.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo, here\u0027s the plan:\u00a0I will produce a minimum of one documentary video a month as well as uploading content as and when the news climate inspires me. I want to be able to question narratives as they are happening and being fed to the mass majority. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEach month, patrons can vote - from a selection - which film they want me to make next. However, the next film has already commenced because of the timing issues\u00a0of launching this platform. That documentary will be out in early June. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe film looks at the tragedy of Grenfell Tower where a blaze took hold, in June 2017, in London. I have gathered a great deal of first-hand information and footage and want to share that with you. It is a story of social failure, corporate greed, national corruption and needless death. And it must be told.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe video following \u0027Grenfell Tower - One Year On\u0027 will be at the end of July and every video from that point onwards will be released at the end of the month so we can start to regulate our content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, together with regular news uploads, I think things are going to get quite busy around here. And I, for one, cannot wait to immerse myself further in this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI hope you feel this is a journey worth undertaking and, as my Patron, you will enable me to take up this challenge and help create a counter narrative to the biggest (and sometimes smallest) stories in our world. Together, we can make the difference.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you....now, let\u0027s get cracking! Sonia x\u003cbr\u003e"
