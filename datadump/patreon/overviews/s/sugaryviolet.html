I draw both \u003cstrong\u003eNSFW and safe\u003c/strong\u003e pictures, and this Patreon will be a \u003cstrong\u003emix\u003c/strong\u003e of both. Meaning that I will draw and post both sexy and non-sexy pictures to this patreon. However, as I wouldn\u0027t want anyone to see anything you don\u0027t want to, NSFW images won\u0027t be posted directly to Patreon, but rather be \u003cstrong\u003elinked to my Dropbox\u003c/strong\u003e and get a safe teaser image and be tagged accordingly. This way I hope everyone will be happy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a micro-donation site much like Kickstarter. Unlike Kickstarter though, where you pledge a specific amount one time, on Patreon you pledge to donate a smaller sum every month. In return you get some neat perks, like WIPs of my work and an input in what I draw next. You also get the option to commission me and get priority in my comission queue!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the first time I\u0027ve had the chance to \u003cstrong\u003elive off my art\u003c/strong\u003e completely, which is both exciting and terrifying.\u003cbr\u003eSo far my main art money has come from commissions, but there\u0027s always a limit when you draw for others. I\u0027ve got so many more projects I\u0027d like to do! I have comic ideas and image sets that\u0027ve been sitting in my head for years, but I\u0027ve been too busy trying to pay my bills to realize them. I hope that \u003cstrong\u003ewith your support\u003c/strong\u003e, I can finally start making more of my own art for you guys! The more money I get through patreon, the less time I have to spend on working as a bus driver!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePay upfront\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI got pay upfront activated, which means you\u0027ll be charged right after you pledge, with the next payment after that on the 1st the upcoming month. This means you\u0027ll be given your sugar cubes immediately after you pledge, if you go for any of those tiers, :) \u003cbr\u003eTo prevent anyone being charged twice within just a few days however (which would be the case if you pledge near the end of the month), I am 100% willing to refund the second charge if you pledge after the 20th in the month. Just make sure to message me as soon as possible and preferably within two weeks after the second pledge as gone through so we can sort it out \u0026lt;3\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, \u003cstrong\u003ethank you so much\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0for reading this and checking out my patreon. Hopefully I will have your support, but even if you can\u0027t pledge I want you to know it means a lot to me that you took the time to check me out anyways!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://sugaryviolet.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSafe Tumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://sugaryscarlet.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNSFW Tumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SugaryViolet\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/sugaryviolet\"\u003eFurAffinity\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/93f54f4d91e88939a794cab02ca07e7a.png\" style=\"width: 243px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat are sugar cubes?\u003c/h4\u003eSugar cubes are a kind of \u201cCommission points\u201d for my patreon supporters. \u003cbr\u003eBy pledging to any of the commission teirs you get\u00a0(along with regular patreon rewards) a set amount of sugar cubes per month, and then one more per additional $10 you pledge at that teir.

They can be given away to a friend or fellow patron as long as you talk to me first (to ensure I write things down properly).\u003cbr\u003eIf you were to unpledge or lower your pledge to a non-commission teir,\u00a0you will still keep all your collected sugar cubes until they expire. In the unlikely event you do something that warrants being banned from my patreon though, all your collected sugar cubes are considered expired.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
