    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho is this Stuff+ person?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGeneric greetings! I make videos about games. This myriad of generic gaming related stuff ranges from informative previews, full playthroughs, collaborative builds, nostalgia trips, and just about everything in-between.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/OfficialStuffPlus\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e channel\u00a0for the end results.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027ve been doing this for over five years and produced more than 2,000 videos, all freely available on YouTube.\u00a0Not one has ever been gated or hidden behind a paywall. Not one has ever been sponsored by any person / company / generic entity. Not one has ever been made for the exchange of even a single generic unit of currency.\u00a0I\u0027d like to keep it that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning ads on YouTube is an unobtrusive\u00a0way to claw a little bit back for my time. Sadly in the current climate ad revenue is at an all time low. Factor in Content ID shenanigans and the prevalence of ad blockers and you end up with just enough to buy a couple of beverages per month... well maybe a little more than that, but its still low.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to continue making the videos you and I enjoy, as well as have the flexibility\u00a0to try new things, without having to worry about view numbers, clicks, or whether or not they will recoup the cost and effort in making them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years many people have offered to donate to me directly, but up until now I\u0027ve never had a convenient and safe platform to support it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon solves all these problems and gives you an opportunity to help. Choosing to support me on Patreon means pledging a few generic units of currency per month so I can not only try new things, but also maintain general consistency and continue in the way I find most comfortable: I make the stuff, you watch the stuff. Nothing hidden or compromised, everyone wins.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the pledge tiers?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can pledge any amount you wish and all tiers are essentially all the same. Supporting me at any level gives you access to the Patreon feed and direct chat. I\u0027ll be posting updates, channel news, surveys, random ramblings about games (... and anything else I feel like) as well as doing Q\u0026amp;A sessions etc, all exclusive to Patreon supporters. The only difference between tiers is the number of Generic Appreciation Points you gain and the minimum amount you choose to pledge... which in all seriousness I am truly grateful\u00a0for. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the goals?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese will change based on the current overall pledge amount, Patreon supporter feedback, and what I feel is most beneficial and practical. Any videos produced as a result of achieving these goals however will still be available to all, just will instead be directly sponsored by the Patreon supporters and credited as such. Basically everyone can watch them, but you made it possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell that\u0027s up to you. In summary you can support me by pledging as above, or just keep watching the videos (...or not) as you see fit. I\u0027ll still be making generic gaming related videos, all freely available on YouTube. Pledging just means you get access to the extra bits mentioned previously... and net some Generic Appreciation Points in the process!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGeneric partings!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNotice: Please be aware that Generic Appreciation Points are fictional, non-refundable, quasi-superfluous\u00a0entities that are only redeemable at licensed Stuff+\u00a0Generic Outlets... which also don\u0027t exist. Sorry.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
