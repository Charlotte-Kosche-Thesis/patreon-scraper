I work Monday-Friday, 6am-4pm and create YouTube videos in my spare time. \u003cstrong\u003eOver the past year, I have struggled with the idea of becoming a \"Youtuber\" and really wanted to define what the goal of my channel was. What I have defined my channel to be is an upbeat motovlogging channel, with great people interactions, spreading positive vibes, all while trying to lead by example for the young viewers! \u003c/strong\u003eI have had a lot of up\u0027s and downs but through it all I decided to stick with it and damn glad I did!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eToday, I cant imagine my life without YouTube nor can I imagine my life without creating content for all of you!

Did I mention the free sticker program? Stickers, envelopes, stamps, shipping tags and lots of gas for our crazy adventures which again, isn\u0027t cheap! Last thing to mention of costly items would be my trip last year to SCMM and again this year to SCMM just to see all you lovely people... I wouldnt trade it for the world but just know, those trips arent cheap!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eHelp me make my adult hood dream come true?\u003c/strong\u003e I want to take my YouTube channel to the next level and with this Patron\u003cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e \"tip jar\"\u003c/em\u003e it will give me the added support to purchase bigger and better things for the channel; giveaways, traveling adventures, track days, off roading... the sky is the limit!\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eGuess what?
