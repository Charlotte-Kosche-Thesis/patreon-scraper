You might already know me - if not: my name is Paula\nalso known as \"Suzu\" and I\u0027m a cosplayer by passion from germany. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve fall for cosplay about 6 years ago, when\nI was at my first convention ever. I\u0027ve seen all these beautifull, creative,\ncrazy, colorful costumes and when I came home I said to my mom \"I want a\ncosplay!\". So in that summer my mom showed me the basics of making\npatterns and sewing at my first costume. I always was into crafting, sewing and\ndressing myself up for halloween and carnival so cosplay seemed to be the hobby I searched for. Since then I try to get better,\nlearn to work with different technics and materials.After 6 years I still enjoy making costumes and becoming my favourite characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/H0sdi5h.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the last year I\u0027ve started studying and moved from my parents house to get more independent. Since I don\u0027t earn money by studying it\u0027s pretty hard for me to make my costumes in the same time as before. So I want to give those who like the stuff I\u0027m doing a way to support me. All the money I\u0027m getting here goes directly into the materials for my costumes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI will do my best to show you all my work step by step - how I made everything and the results of it. But I also hope that this plattform is not just for support my passion, but where you can get inspired to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1G7YkfY.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Content will be basically cosplay related. I\u2019m really\ninto Games so 90% of my future costumes might be from games. You will see behind\nthe scenes photos, detailed progress and tutorials. Sometimes\nsome early access photos or Original Design Drawings might sneak in. \u003cbr\u003eThere won\u0027t be every reward every month and I\u0027m also not making a new costume every month, because my costumes take me much longer. Beside the usal behind the szenes and progress-stuff, there will def. be min. one detailed progress post and 3-4 high res pictures per month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAt the end I want to create a place of inspiration, creativity and kindness. And maybe those who havn\u0027t find the warrior in themself yet will find it here. ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/B0NAxcN.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
