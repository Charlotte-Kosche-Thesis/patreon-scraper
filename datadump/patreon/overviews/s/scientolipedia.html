    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e\u201cAnd I believe the freedom of the material which we know and \nunderstand is guaranteed only by lightness of organization, a maximum of\n people, good training and good, reliable, sound relay of information. \u003cem\u003eAnd if we can\u2019t do these things, sooner or later the information \nwhich we hold will become the property of an untrustworthy few. This I \nam sure because it has always happened this way\u2026\u003c/em\u003e\"\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://scientolipedia.org/info/L_Ron_Hubbard\"\u003eL Ron Hubbard\u003c/a\u003e - Anatomy of the Spirit of Man Congress - Lecture #15\u00a0 What is Scientology Doing? 6 June 1955\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Internet has certainly created the opportunity for a \"lightness of organization\" as well as the means for us to utilize \"sound relay of information\" in an unprecedented way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \"maximum of people\" is not an issue. We\u0027ve got the entire Scientology \u0027field\" to draw from...a virtually unlimited resource of vast experience in the subject.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"..good training...\" is perhaps the biggest issue of all. Currently, there is \u003cem\u003esome\u003c/em\u003e training occurring on a very limited basis around the world, but, in no way, shape or form can we feel confident in the future development of trained auditors. The \"church\" is certainly not producing any.\u003cbr\u003eE-learning needs to be developed immediately! (see my thoughts on that in the video above)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what do we do about LRH\u0027s warning that \"it has always happened this way\"?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully, \"forewarned is forearmed\", as the old saying goes.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s up to us to ensure it doesn\u0027t go that way this time and I\u0027m asking you to help in that effort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always looked upon Scientolipedia\u00a0 in two ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. As a \"Project\" in the sense that it includes the testing and trial of many technologies under one banner. \u003cbr\u003eIn other words, the website is just one piece of a total package, or collection of initiatives, with the goal of getting lRH\u0027s wisdom broadly known and used.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. The website as we see it today, and despite the fact it has been a roaring success, has not begun to scratch the surface of its potential.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a \"good start\", in fact a great start, but is not yet fulfilling its potential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve reached the point where the primary obstacle to reaching its potential is a lack of funding to do what\u0027s necessary.\u003cbr\u003eThis means software, hardware, professional services (server admin \u0026amp; web developers), web services, upgraded web hosting as well as legal and corporate matters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a long laundry list but we can do much of it \"on the cheap\"\u00a0 by using freelancers and our tremendous community of willing and able volunteers to help where we might otherwise have to pay for services.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think most people understand by now that we are serious about our mission to disseminate and expand the Scientolipedia Project as demonstrated by what we\u0027ve done thus far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you appreciate that the work we\u0027ve done thus far was done as a \"labor of love\" and everything we\u0027ve accomplished is solely due to people like you being willing to lend a helping hand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m asking you to become a Patron and help us take it to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny amount you are comfortable with is appreciated and helps tremendously.\u003cbr\u003eYour $1, $3, $5, $10, $20 (or more)...will be enthusiastically accepted and appreciated.\u003cbr\u003eAnd we\u0027ll do everything possible to make you feel welcome and a part of the team.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy utilizing things like web meetings, we can regain a sense of community and common purpose.\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to seeing you soon in one of our webcasts or special Patron only briefings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDave LaCroix\u003cbr\u003ePresident\u003cbr\u003edl88008@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://scientolipedia.org/info/Dave_LaCroix\"\u003ehttp://scientolipedia.org/info/Dave_LaCroix\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
