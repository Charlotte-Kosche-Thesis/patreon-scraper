I post new videos everday at 11am from Horror, to Adventure, to Platformers, Collaborations with other creators and everything between! I love making all my videos for every single one of you to watch and love hearing all your wonderful feedback! But to be able to produce more and become better, This is were you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn the future of my channel, I would like to make it become Self-Sufficient. And in doing so i\u0027m going to need some help so I came to Patreon. The reason I picked Patreon and asking for your support, is to help with all the little behind the scene\u0027s that go into my Channel and all its content. There are many things such as Internet Bills, Upgrading Equipment and even buying current games to play for all you to watch that a little extra support could really help and support my channel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs there a catch? What\u0027s in it for me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHate to break it to you... but there\u0027s no catch! As long as you Pledge, Patreon will charge you between the 1st and 5th of every month. And if you ever want to stop supporting my channel, you simply can! It\u0027s as easy as that. But as a Patreon you will receive many perks such as Skype/Dischord calls with me to chat, Your name in the credits of my videos, and even getting to hand pick something for me to play!"
