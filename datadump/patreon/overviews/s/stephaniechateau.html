     "about": "Stephanie has over a decade of experience working for theme parks, interactive entertainment companies and conventions as either an artist, writer, performer, director or director\u2019s assistant.\u003cbr\u003eHer varied interests in the arts has lead her to wear many hats over the years. She\u2019s both performed on stage and assisted backstage. Sometimes she\u2019s wearing a costume and sometimes she helps design costumes for others. She has worked as a Director\u2019s Assistant helping with casting extras for film and worked as an extra for movies as well.\u003cbr\u003eIn 2006 Stephanie decided to use the skills she learned while working at Universal Studios Florida to conduct her own \u201ccreative experiment\u201d at conventions. This creative experiment turned into what is now known as Concept Galaxy: Interactive Production Troupe and Creative Team. The troupe is now managed by her proteges, Chuck Stroschein and Miranda Fuqua and provides entertainment for Realms Con annually.\u003cbr\u003ePrior to creating Concept Galaxy, Stephanie originally started booking conventions to promote her independently published comics \u201cOh, Captain!\u201d and \u201cChaos in the Outer Region\u201d. Recently, Stephanie has been working on a new comic project with a small team or artists and writers, titled \u201cThe Adventures of Baba Bhalu\u201d that will feature stories primarily inspired by Hindu, Celtic, Norse and Native American legends and traditions.\u003cbr\u003eSee more about Baba Bhalu at: \u003ca href=\"http://www.bababhalu.com/\"\u003ewww.bababhalu.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStephanie\u2019s past experience designing costumes for third party contractors combined with her experience as a theme park performer often proves useful to conventions seeking out a fair and knowledgeable guest judge, entertainment director or panelist for their cosplay related events. While Stephanie\u2019s early education in fine art and animation combined with her passion for sequential art has compelled her to design a series of interactive \u201chow to draw\u201d panels and workshops for conventions that would like to provide some programming catering to aspiring artists and their comic \u0026amp; cartoon enthusiasts.\u003cbr\u003e",
