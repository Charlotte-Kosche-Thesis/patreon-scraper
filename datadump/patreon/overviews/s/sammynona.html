    "summary": "I write erotic fantasy and science fiction stories, mostly revolving around submission, dominance and mind control to accentuate the two. In my stories I typically examine the themes of changes in personality, revealing hidden desires as new forces bring the characters to embrace their new lives. Whether it is mind altering machinery, a wicked sorceress or a devious hypnotist my work will help explore multiple fetishes and forms of submission. Most of my work is lesbian erotica though I do plan on writing a few m/f stories which will be marked as such. Right now most of my stories go to mcstories.com to be enjoyed for free, or available on my smashwords or amazon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter two years of publishing here on Patreon I\u0027m blown away by the support that I\u0027ve received. With everyone\u0027s support I was able to quit a job I hated and spend more of my time focusing on writing. Your pledges go towards paying my bills, food and gas. My next goal is to make enough off of the erotica I love writing that I can begin paying off my student loans with it, so that I can continue to put out quality content for my fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve recently changed up my schedule, so that now I will be writing 2 stories a month for all of my patrons, being made up of updates on the series you the fans vote love. In addition to that I will also produce 3 bonus stories for all fans who pledge $5 or over. With this schedule I can hopefully complete the stories early enough in the month that I can reopen voting and begin focusing on commissions again. Naturally when I open up commissions I\u0027ll make sure to let all of my patrons here know first, in case any of you have custom stories you want to have me work on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for your amazing support!"

You get the same rewards as the last tier with the additional ten dollars a month being pooled in with the other illustrators to commission artists. Everyone at this tier will be able to propose scenes or characters to illustrate, as well as what artists they want to see, and we\u0027ll hold a vote to decide which it will be. Since some artists charge higher prices for more characters and quality work there might not be art every month, but every time art is commissioned the illustrators here will get to see it exclusively before everyone else. So if you\u0027ve ever wanted to see that one scene from Falling for her Tits or Snake Goddess by your favorite artist then this is the tier for you!\u00a0",
