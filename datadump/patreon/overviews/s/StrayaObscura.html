    "summary": "In September of 2009, I created for a traditional illustration class a handmade, pop-up book inspired, paper craft... \u003cem\u003ethe first of many! \u003c/em\u003eIt was at that exact moment, in between the \"Wow!\" and \"That\u0027s so \u003cem\u003ecool!\u003c/em\u003e\" that I realized... paper crafts are where my art is meant to go! I attended my first Japanese culture/anime convention (Anime Weekend Atlanta) in 2010 with my paper crafts in hand and \u003cem\u003eno idea\u003c/em\u003e what I was doing! Into the start of the convention I could not get away from my table because of the crowds of people who couldn\u0027t help but stop by and see what these new things were!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow here we are beginning 2016 and my paper crafts are continuing to grow momentum! I\u0027ve begun traveling to conventions in the southeast (with HUGE success), sending art out to conventions as far as Texas, and shipping original commissions all the way to Japan! \u003cstrong\u003eThis is HUGE, and it is all thanks to you... my fans!\u003c/strong\u003e I want to continue doing these paper crafts, and continue to improve on what I do with them! I do hope you will join and support me on this journey, thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support me, you ask?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell... other than because you are \u003cem\u003efreaking\u003c/em\u003e awesome, I am hoping to move away from my job in retail and do my art full time. \u003cem\u003eThis is a dream many artists strive for, but few can achieve \u003c/em\u003eand I know that very well! BUT, does that stop me from going forward? HECK NO! So I\u0027ve come to Patreon to ask another favor of my fans (that\u0027s right, you awesome person you!) and art family for even the smallest bit of support in the ability to bring you the \u003cem\u003ecoolest freakin\u0027 things that can be done with paper!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is in store for us supporters?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m continuing on a daily basis to iron out all of the details. But right now I have a plan to release a monthly piece/completed project, I only intend for my supporters to be charged once a month. Once I reach certain milestones I am going to begin releasing sketches, and feedback requests to lower tier donators. I will move all the way up to printable \"color-and-build-your-own\" paper crafts, that include instructions and materials needed for the higher tiers! \u003cem\u003eI am going to work hard to make it worth your while, I promise!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
