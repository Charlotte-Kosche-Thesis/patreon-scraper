H. Beck \u003c/a\u003ewith my oldest son. The book is about bioluminescence and this particular passage about dinoflagellates stuck out.\u003cblockquote\u003e\"Little animals glow. But if you have enough of them they can have a BIG effect\"\u003c/blockquote\u003eThe fact that small creatures can coalesce together with spectacular results ( in the case of dino-flagellates glowing tides) is a metaphor for the times we live in.While researching further I discovered that \u003cstrong\u003eBioluminescence is the most common form of communication on earth! \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was ever curious and then read the book \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Other-Minds-Octopus-Origins-Consciousness/dp/0374227764\"\u003e\u201cOther Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness\u201d by Peter Godfrey-Smith\u003c/a\u003e and learned that the ocean is the cradle of life, how we evolved from single-celled organisms, developed nervous systems to support our consciousness, just as an octopus has but in a completely different way. A powerful quote from the book:\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u201cWhen you dive into the sea you are diving into the origin of us all\u201d\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cem\u003e This perfectly describes this feeling deep within that pursuing this project is also a way of raising consciousness one of my missions as an artist and human being\u003c/em\u003e. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInto the deep on the surface is about these amazing creatures but it\u2019s also about diving deeper into ourselves. It\u2019s about how these creatures living in the harshest most extreme environment on the planet, without light have evolved in the dark and how we can learn to do the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of these interesting facts compiled together were instrumental in turning my fascination, awe, and curiosity into admiration, respect, and love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEducation and saving the sea\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from philosophy, a huge goal of Into the Deep is to allow people to experience what the depths of the sea are like. To bring these creatures into view is the start of changing the way we think about the oceans. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain Peter Godfrey-Smith sums this up:\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201c The features that made the sea productive of life and mind are invisible to us most of the time. They exist on a tiny scale, the sea does not change visibly as we do things to it- not in the way that cutting down a forest is immediately, undeniably visible. Waste poured into the sea just seems to drift and dilute away. As a result the sea rarely appears urgent as an environmental problem\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003eTo evoke the same feelings of wonder most people feel about space exploration in artwork/exhibits about the deep sea is the first step in caring about the ocean and about the actions we take that affect it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConquering Fear\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAn even deeper reason for choosing to tackle this project is my fear of drowning, or more accurately being submerged underwater without the means to come back to the surface\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was about 8 or 9 years old our neighbors had an above ground pool. Most of the older kids started the game where 5-6 kids ran around the outside of the pool creating a mini whirlpool since I was a lightweight I got sucked into the middle and I recall not being able to get up. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSitting on the bottom of a pool staring up at the light coming down unable to do anything ( probably only about 30- 40 seconds) was both terrifying yet there was a presence of serenity as well. I was rescued by our neighbor but to this day I still get anxious about being under the water. I still go swimming but I have never been one to jump off a pier into the water. I have a healthy love for the animals of the sea but have never strayed too far from the shore. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe fear isn\u2019t an accurate description, maybe it has more to do with the fact that I can still feel that moment and I know if I were to feel that calm again I might decide it\u2019s okay not to come back. Through this project, I can deep dive in many ways and still come up for air. It is said one way to conquer your fear is through exposure and so this is sticking my feet in the water and wading in up to my neck. With this, I will be one step closer to swimming underwater truly testing my limits mentally and physically.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eRISKS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eIt\u2019s safe to say that this is a huge project, you may be wondering if I will follow through. Rest assured that there is room for experimentation to be able to find the most effective ways to create, present and display while captivating audiences. Expect to see me work through any issues that come up, that\u0027s the great part of Patreon I can be completely transparent about everything including the trials and tribulations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if the work is not complete for an exhibit by the end of this year (2018) I will have enough work to fulfill the rewards in terms of prints and aim to keep accurate records of supporters to invite to the first preview exhibition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sincerely hope that if you aren\u2019t already intrigued, fascinated or head over heels in love with these creatures of the deep you will get there and help me spread the word.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\u003cbr\u003exoxo\u003cbr\u003eSara\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

What\u0027s holding you back from creating, making, showing the world who you are?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile you noodle on that pretty large question here are some of my quirks\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I am a dress wearing( anti- pants, love tights), DIY maven who tells jokes like your grandpa. Seriously, they\u0027re pretty bad just ask my husband.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u2019m not working on a creative project you\u2019ll find me binge watching Netflix shows like Stranger Things, thrifting and shopping local, and hanging out with my husband and 2 sons having dance battles to Weird Al Yankovic in the basement.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create art for those who are obsessed with puns, sea life and anatomy and I teach art classes for those who struggle with feeling they are enough. I am SO lucky to be able to show people how to get in touch with their creativity so they can feel empowered.\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;\"I believe that creativity is the key to accepting ourselves and also changing the world.\"\u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003eI teach creative classes because unleashing my inner artist has been a source of grounding, recentering and healing, a catharsis, a way for me to fully embrace all of the parts of myself, the good along with the bad. It\u0027s a way for me to work through my shit, be happy NOW and truly know that TODAY and every day that I am the woman of my dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want you to know the power behind that sentiment and be able to arrive in that happy place. I want you to know that this path of acceptance is a constant journey and if I can help you along the way that is my mission., I know it isn\u0027t easy but when I say \"Unleash your Inner Artist, Embrace Yourself\" I truly believe that through your discovery and practice of creativity you can open yourself and truly believe the statement \"I am the woman(man) of my dreams\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have had so much positive feedback on the classes I have taught that I realized this is something that people need more access too and that is why I have started making videos, to teach these methods to you. Let\u0027s get creative!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
