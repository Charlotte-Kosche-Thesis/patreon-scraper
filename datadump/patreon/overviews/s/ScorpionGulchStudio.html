The big one I am working on is for Ark Survival Evolved. The mod is named Southwest Territories. This mod started with the thought of \u201ca working TeePee in the game would be cool\u201d and grew from there. It seems to have taken on a life of its own. I have been doing this in the little free time I seem to have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I continue to learn (in and out of school), I would also like to continue on my own survival project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my goal to someday have Scorpion Gulch Studio be more than just a name and an idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy Goals:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e First, this Patreon page will help keep the test server running and add more maps for the cluster. Perfect for like minded individuals who love primitive mods. Chipping in to help keep them up, grow the cluster, test the mod, and have some fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Second: Funds will go to upgrade the machine I do the creative stuff on. Helpful for mod creation and the survival project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Third: Funds will allow me to continue the mod through completion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Fourth: I\u0027ll also use funds to flesh out and and start building the basic components for my survival game. Make it work now as it can look pretty later.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Fifth: Once the basics work, then you\u0027ll be funding me moving onto the static mesh models, and after that, my map concept.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
