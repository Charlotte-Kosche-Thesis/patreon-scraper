    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello Gamers and People That Enjoy Watching Gameplays!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"What is Up?... Its Shimas In The Game...\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love playing games and connecting with people, however I work full-time and Im not always able to get videos every single day. So please be patient and we will grow together. Im still new Youtuber and I dont think that I make the best contect, but I try my best and try to improve with every video. Subscribe to my Youtube channel if you like what you see. Ask me any question in comments or private message. Will be sure to reply!  Thank You! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI already invested into my setup over 1,000 Euros (1,231.10 US Dollar). This money was spent to create my own acoustic room and buy Mic, Mic Stand, RBG LED\u0027s, LED Glass Logo and much more. I really take this seriuos and I want my videos and my recording area to look nice and eye catching. Show me some support by Subscribing to my Youtube channel and Liking the videos or leaving me a message or a comment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a Patron is your own choice as for now I dont have anything else to offer except my videos and my gratitude. I will do activities with Patreons exclusively in the future when I have atleast a few patroens. Also will do Giveaways and some Patroen interviews or something else. Well I will decide on that with the help of my Patroens latter on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main dream is to be able to help other Youtubers and Small channels that are starting their carrier as Public Figure. I would love to be able to help and mentor them. To teach what I have learned during my process. Help them avoid mistakes that I have done(and still doing). Hopefully be able to boost their views and Subscribers. I know how hard it is to start doing what I am doing now. You have full-time work, but during the work you cant stop thinking about the ideas what to do next and how to grow your view counts and Subscribers. It is hard work. You make videos that noone is watching and try to promote them on every social media known to man with no luck. Not knowing why people are not watching you as noone is leaving any comments or anything. So I would love to be able to help other channels and other youtubers and people on Patroen website. And do this full-time, but for now I try to research as much as I can and do my best. Hopefully I will be able to do it. :) \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIm still (what we call) noob in all recording youtube videos and all interactions with Subscribers and Patroens, but I think everyone, even the biggest Youtubers and Channels started at the same place. I have much to learn and I hope that with Your help some day I will be better at it and we all will have a BLAST!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You For Your Time reading this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust as a fun fact. I made my own acoustic room within a room. Might do a\n video on it latter on as I took pictures at different stages of it. \nWell I think that\u0027s it for now and feel free to message me and lets have\n a chat. :) \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHave A Great Day. \u0026lt;3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I am getting my room ready for gameplay recording so my voice sounds clear and professional. Hopefully all will go according to plan and I will be able to push videos daily or every other day. I\u0027m looking forward to live stream in the near future, but at this point there is no point streaming when I don\u0027t have people that watch my gameplay. Well that\u0027s it for now and I will see you In The Game :)",
