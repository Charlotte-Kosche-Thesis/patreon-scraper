    "summary": "Before I even get into the patreon, I just want to thank you all for simply looking at the page and considering leaving a donation. Your support means the world to me and even if you simply watch my videos and nothing else, I still appreciate that greatly. Just seeing people enjoying what I do makes me a very happy person. Thank you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, I have hit the point where I worry that I won\u0027t be able to pursue this career path for much longer without your support. Despite the channels growth, the ad revenue I receive is dropping and this is something that keeps me up at night worrying about. Even though I don\u0027t earn much on this channel, I still rely on it to pay my rent when my hours were cut at my job. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hoped that it would be a very long time until I made this patreon but YouTube has forced my hand. I want to stress that I will be continuing to run the channel the same way I always have for as long as I can with or without support and I also want to give something back to those who donate and help keep the channel going. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of the content that I already publish on the channel, I want to make something for those who donate because I don\u0027t want this to be a charity, but a service. If you donate just $1 a month, you will have access to my patreon feed where I will publish an extra video of every Magic Arena and Gwent deck I play each week which works out at 12 cents for ~60 minutes of content each week. On top of that I will offer priority access for names in any game I play that allows it, and priority access for subscriber decks (Rotating between patrons and non patrons each week to still give everyone a chance). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor just $2 you get access to all previous rewards plus access to polls that help you shape the channel and decide what I play on it. Once a game has finished a poll will go up for you to vote on which game you would like to see replace it. I also have a poll every fortnight (2 weeks) where you can vote on the deck I build for the next Magic Arena video. If you have any suggestions for decks or games that you\u0027d like to see on these polls then don\u0027t be afraid to message me and give me some suggestions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally for those who want to support the channel for $5 I am offering in addition to previous rewards, my deck building services to you personally. Feel free to message me anytime on Patreon with a deck that you\u0027d like me to build just for you, whether that be on Magic Arena, MTGO or Gwent.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe moment I feel that I don\u0027t need this patreon any more, I will close it. This venture is not about profit but the pursuit of happiness; YouTube has made me the happiest I have ever been in my entire life, and I don\u0027t want to let it go without a fight. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to check out my page and if you do decide to donate, know that I\u0027m incredibly grateful for your generosity."
