That ad revenue is in steep, steep decline. How much of a decline? Literally, we made only 10% as much in ad revenue in April 2016 as we did in April 2014 -- 10% for about the same number of page views. So if you worked a job for $10/hour, and one month your boss just announced you were now working for $1/hour... what would you do? Find another job, of course!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpdates on Shadowbinders.com have slowed because we\u0027ve had to take on more and more freelance gigs just to keep the lights on. We know our readers want more Shadowbinders -- and they want it faster -- and we want to give it them. But right now, we literally cannot afford to update faster because every Shadowbinders comic update is 8-10 hours of paying freelance work that we\u0027re passing on, not counting any time invested in keeping the site running, social media, etc. Two pages of Shadowbinders is more than half a work week when you factor in everything that goes into it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo after our hosting and misc. business expenses, we\u0027re basically making Shadowbinders for free these days. And we\u0027re honestly not sure how long we can continue to do that. Unlike a lot of younger webcomics creators, we\u0027re married with two awesome kids and a mortgage. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we\u0027re turning to Patreon because we want to continue to not only keep making Shadowbinders, but to be able to ramp up our update schedule and finish telling the story we set out to tell over a half a decade ago!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy have the comic updates been so sporadic lately?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShadowbinders began in the summer of 2010. When we started out, we were able to update 2-3 times per week in full color, thanks mostly to Kneon\u0027s Day Job! The Day Job (TM) paid well and had great hours, so we were able to easily schedule \"comics time\" and didn\u0027t have to worry much about paying the bills or even making the comic profitable. That changed when THE ECONOMY HAPPENED. \u003cem\u003e*cue dramatic music*\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, our lives have been \u003cem\u003echaotic\u003c/em\u003e -- Kneon working multiple jobs, one of which was a 2+ hour commute -- and taking on a bevy of paying freelance assignments just to make ends meet. Because of this, time for Shadowbinders has been whittled down significantly. (Trust me -- we\u0027re bummed, too! No one has more invested in this story than we do. Kam has this story written several chapters ahead, we just don\u0027t have time to draw it!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan\u0027t you just hire someone else to draw it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUmm, that actually costs \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e than doing it ourselves. However, we might hire a colorist to help speed up production of pages!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how will Patreon help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we can hit certain funding goals, we can afford to \"buy back\" the time to work on Shadowbinders. Every page of Shadowbinders we draw is 8-10 hours of paying freelance work that\u0027s not getting done. We can\u0027t very well tell our children that they have to go without food or a roof over their heads because a free webcomic needs to be drawn!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut webcomics are supposed to be FREE, right?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWebcomics were once supported by banner ad revenue, which is in steep decline due to ad blocking and other issues. Technically, webcomics have \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e been free -- the creators were eating the cost and/or the advertising was paying for it. The comic will still be free to read online... eventually! But first we have to cover production costs which also include computer hardware, graphics software and hosting (among other things!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou retooled this Patreon -- what\u0027s different?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe tried to use this like a \u003cem\u003estore\u003c/em\u003e, not a tip jar! We were actually making ourselves \u003cem\u003emore work\u003c/em\u003e, which took time away from making more Shadowbinders pages. While the support is mucho appreciated, it wound up being counterproductive in the long run. So we\u0027re distilling it down!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for ME?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur gratitude and knowing that Shadowbinders keeps getting made, first and foremost! Some tiers will get advance looks at pages, concept art and behind-the-scenes stuff like the Belatyr Beastiary!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I only to donate $1 or $5?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNope! You can donate as much as you like, and can scale your pledge each month. There is only a difference in the reward at those levels. (For example, a $10 pledge gets the same reward as a $100 pledge.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat happens if you CAN\u0027T reach the funding goals?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, we\u0027ll keep on posting Shadowbinders \u003cem\u003eas we can\u003c/em\u003e.
