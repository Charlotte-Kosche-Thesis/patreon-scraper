It was at version 2.34 I think, when I discovered it. I remember I tried it, then thought \"What is this thing, it\u0027s way too complex for me, let\u0027s go back to Diablo 2\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter about a month, I gave Blender another chance, because I was intrigued. I forced myself a bit of discipline (coz Blender is just too intimidating at first) and followed the old \"biscuit-man\" tutorial, from the official Blender documentation, and I was hooked. I never touched anything 3d before, except for playing games. I learned a lot just by myself, so my progress was slow, but very pleasant. I love toying around with technology, especially things that let me create other things. I learned Blender\u0027s features one by one, stumbling randomly on them, discovering as they came out with each new Blender release, then trying what cools things I could achieve with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo it went. But when the stream of cool features to play with started to dry out, I remembered reading on the forums that developing addons with Python inside of Blender is what advanced users do. Since I love programming, that was the logical next step. At the same time, one of my professors showed me a picture of a 3d city made from a program. OH MY! I want to do that too! I found my passion at that moment: art, 3d and programming, all together, and it\u0027s called procedural generation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd here I am today, still working on my craft.\u003cbr\u003eThere is much to learn, to improve, the stream of cool features is still flowing :)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
