     "about": "Hey friend, I\u2019m Shane. I\u2019m a  Jesus follower, blogger, speaker \u0026amp; host of my podcast Seminary Dropout. I like comic books, theology, and growing beards.\u003cbr\u003eI grew up in small town west Texas, went to college and lived for a number of years in small town central Texas until my wife Kate and I moved to the promised land of Austin, TX.\u003cbr\u003eI did have a few adventures in the middle of all that Texas living. For short periods of time I\u2019ve lived in Sacramento, California, Buffalo, NY,  and even New Orleans for about a month before evacuating from Hurricane Katrina.\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was 24 some friends of mine and I planted a church in Brownwood, TX. We were young, naive, and excited.\u003cbr\u003eI served as the pastor there for about 5 years.\u003cbr\u003eKate Blakeney was one of those friends who helped plant the church and joined us on staff. As the pastor I thought the only appropriate thing I could do was to ask her out. What could go wrong in dating a member of your church staff?! Well, nothing went wrong, in fact it went very right, and now she\u2019s Kate Blackshear.\u003cbr\u003eIn 2011 Kate and I moved to Austin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce in Austin, I started a career in Real Estate and thought my days of full-time ministry were over. It took about 9 months for me to realize that something wasn\u2019t right. I felt discontent. I didn\u2019t miss everything about vocational ministry, in fact there was some things about being a pastor that I just flat out wasn\u2019t good at and didn\u2019t enjoy. Some things however, brought me joy and life. I loved having spiritual conversations about life and theology. I realized that in American Christianity if a person feels any call to ministry, then we tend to shoe horn them into a few designated positions (lead pastor, youth pastor, music pastor, etc.). I began dreaming up a way to do the things I was gifted at while forgoing the things I wasn\u2019t. This blog, and later on my podcast were birthed out of that time of dreaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn the beginning I recorded Seminary Dropout at our kitchen table in our tiny one bedroom apartment.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn September of 2013 the most amazing thing happened\u2026 we had a Margot!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"500\" src=\"http://www.shaneblackshear.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/birth-300x300.jpg\" style=\"width: 196px;\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"500\" src=\"http://www.shaneblackshear.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/margot-bath-300x300.jpg\" style=\"width: 205px;\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKate became a Chaplain for a hospice agency, and I became a work at home Dad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout the podcast\u2026\u003cbr\u003eWhy is it called Seminary Dropout? I\u2019m glad you asked. It is true that I am literally a seminary dropout. In fact I have dropped out of TWO seminaries, so I don\u2019t mean to brag, but I\u2019m pretty good at it. That is not however the primary reason the show is called Seminary Dropout. I named it Seminary Dropout because I felt that it served as the perfect metaphor for what the show aims to do. \u003cstrong\u003eSeminary Dropout is an interview format podcast that exists somewhere between seminary and youth camp. Not full on academia but no trust falls either. SD is fun, insightful, personal, thoughtful and engaging. It\u2019s two friends talking over coffee about your creations, theology, life, and the church. \u003c/strong\u003eSo it\u2019s a little seminary and a little dropout, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s called Seminary Dropout.\u003cbr\u003eIn the past I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to have guests like \u003ca href=\"http://www.shaneblackshear.com/seminary-dropout-022-philip-yancey/\"\u003ePhilip Yancey\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.shaneblackshear.com/seminary-dropout-011-richard-foster/\"\u003eRichard Foster\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.shaneblackshear.com/sarahbessey/\"\u003eSarah Bessey\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.shaneblackshear.com/seminary-dropout-027-greg-boyd-on-doubt-anti-intellectualism-open-theism/\"\u003eGreg Boyd\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.shaneblackshear.com/seminary-dropout-017-jamie-wright/\"\u003eJamie Wright\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.shaneblackshear.com/bio/seminarydropout.com\"\u003emany more\u003c/a\u003e. You can subscribe, rate and/or review Seminary Dropout in \u003ca\u003eiTunes\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eSo there it is. Now you know more about me than you probably ever wanted to. I hope you find this content edifying to your life and that it causes you to think about God, theology, and life in new and unique ways. If you\u2019d like for me to come and speak at your church, conference or other event, or just want to chat then shoot me an email at shane@shaneblackshear.com. Thanks again for spending these few minutes with me friend!\u003cbr\u003e",
