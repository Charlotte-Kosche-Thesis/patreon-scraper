    "summary": "There\u0027s no such thing as a small film.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany years ago, I began doing film criticism as a way of getting to review, debate, and discuss the medium of film and its importance. As time has gone on, I\u0027ve come to realize that many blogs and websites tend to focus on big, mainstream releases, undermining or ignoring altogether the smaller indie productions (except for those that become sleeper hits), documentaries, and films outside of Hollywood or the big foreign releases. And I realized that I could actually begin to use my blog,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://suddenlyashotrangout.com/\"\u003eSuddenly A Shot Rang Out\u003c/a\u003e, to promote film and TV that I truly believe is worthwhile, regardless of size or relative popularity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to expand the work that my blog does, to enable me to review more contemporary films outside of the mainstream, and to throw new light on past films that have maybe not been given their due. I want to focus my efforts on independent films, films made by women and people of color, and forgotten or ignored classics. To do that, though, and be able to spend the time and the money to do it, I need help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page will help to support me in that endeavor - to watch and review indie and classic films outside of the mainstream, to promote the work of cinematic artists who, perhaps, have not received enough attention or their due. If I earn enough, I will also be able to bring on writers and critics who want to do the same thing, and be able to pay them reasonable rates for their work. Right now, all proceeds will go to enabling me to run and maintain this blog as sole writer and editor.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to support me in this, thank you, from the bottom of my heart. I am truly grateful."
