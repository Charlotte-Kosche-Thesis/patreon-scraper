     "about": "I have also been an artist and painter since I was quite young when I worked with pen \u0026amp; ink, marker, and acrylic but have only been a serious photographer for a few years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInitially I became interested in Photoshop over a decade ago when it still came on floppy disks. My motivation to actually focus on photography came when I realized that no matter how I modified an image it was never truly mine, mentally or legally. I could paint or manipulate the image for hours or days, and never actually own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe decision to start shooting my own stock started me on the journey I am on today. My initial challenges were basically lighting related. I could envision the image I wanted, but getting the lights to cooperate was a constant source of frustration. To get past this I shot as often as possible, and by changing small variables each time I learned how my alterations were affecting my images. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Physics major I enjoy the technical aspects of photography. I like to know my camera settings, angles, focus depth, fall-off, as well as other aspects of the scene that directly effect the result. By understanding how an image will look at 24mm verses 200mm, or when lit by a larger or smaller apparent light source, it becomes easier to make creative decisions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn our studio challenge each other to set up complete scenes and take a single photo without test shots. This has greatly improved our abilities to create successful scenes from our imagination, even on location or group shoots where planning isn\u0027t much of an option. We are always learning and trying new ideas. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur challenges now lie in finding dependable muses, unique designers, and amazing stylists that can work in a collaboration. I am quite blessed with a bevy of such individuals here in the Milwaukee area, where we can additionally pull talent from Green Bay, Madison, and Chicago when needed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my work is now commercial photography and retouching as well as shooting fashion. I do corporate headshots as well as catalog and magazine work, but love the occasional commission for something much more artistic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTeaching others is something I enjoy doing via workshops, speaking engagements, or traveling to shoots as often as possible. I also do themed shoots, workshops on lighting, posing, and post production seminars that are open to the public at my studio near Milwaukee, WI.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love passing on my knowledge to those who are now facing similar frustrations with the technical aspects of this awesome artistic outlet.\u003cbr\u003e",
