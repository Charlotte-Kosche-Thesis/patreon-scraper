I love drawing landscapes, fantastic objects, magical moments, and eerie mist. I build one of a kind guitar effects, as well as write, record and perform music all under the name\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://spiritwas.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpirit Was\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/03ae551b7f1ab2723ae2f736a9d2b2f9/tumblr_inline_p50v0ceh3z1u01d1o_500.jpg\" style=\"width: 413px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n6 years ago I started hand building effects for distorted guitar, illustrating every individual pedal with it\u2019s own image. The project became more and more of a vehicle for drawing, a chance to experiment, a creative outlet to collect and reproduce tender images on a repetitive format. I fell in love with the project because it amalgamated so many of the precise, repetitive and challenging qualities I enjoy in making visual art and music. Lately, though, I\u2019ve noticed that what I was building felt like it appealed to a hyper niche audience. Not only musicians, but guitar players, and not only guitar players, but those willing to go out of their way to find and buy a handmade item at a premium cost. I was feeling insular and wanted to branch out and offer something less expensive that more and different people can enjoy, like prints and books. However, I need your help to get things off the ground, and turned to patreon to provide a monthly preorder service to anyone looking to purchase prints of my original work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhere is your money going?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nRight now all money generated by this project will go directly to paying to get prints made, and for art supplies for new original pieces. For the time being I\u2019ve only been able to afford risograph prints. While risograph printing is an endearing medium, I\u2019ve always loved the texture, definition, and stark contrast of large silk screen prints. Silk screening also opens the doors for printing on other surfaces, like clothing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSpirit Was is my lil light. This is what I love and it\u2019s the work I\u2019ve always wanted to do, I simply need your support to get these projects off the ground. The more people get involved, the more I can do, try, experiment, mess up and learn and grow and get better. Right now this platform is a way for you to see what I do and preorder some prints, but if this becomes something that helps me support myself I can look into offering more items and incentives; posters, soft goods like clothing and bags, books, records and a myriad of other content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for looking!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
