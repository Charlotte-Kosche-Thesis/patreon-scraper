    "summary": "Hi, everyone. Thank you so much for making your way to my Patreon page. I have some really big plans for the future and I\u0027d like you to be a part of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you\u0027re wondering, I\u0027m an indie author who writes original light novels in English. The kind of novels that I write are Young Adult (YA) Thriller and Suspense novels. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also expect to see me blending facts and fiction together in my novels so then not only you\u0027ll learn new things, but you can also get yourself entertained too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe novels that you see in the picture above are the novels that I currently publish which you can get on Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Kobo and iBooks. The books are also available in print and audiobook too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why I\u0027ve decided to write an original light novels? Well, it\u0027s because I love anime, manga, and videogames. While I do enjoy reading English translated light novels (SAO, Accel World, etc.), I also enjoy reading original light novels written by non-Japanese authors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd being able to publish it and tell everyone that I have my books available on retailers like Amazon is the happiest moment in my life. It feels so liberating to be able to publish what I want to read and have it available for sales to those who are looking for similar books.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then again, the reality hits me. I got my feet wet in self-publishing when I began publishing my first nonfiction book. I thought that I could wing it just fine since it didn\u0027t cost that much for me to publish the nonfiction books.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt looks like I was wrong.\u00a0It takes a huge amount of money and time to create a professional-looking light novel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite the hurdle, I don\u0027t feel like giving up. After all, I always dream of having my books adapted into anime. If you have ever watched the anime Bakuman or read the manga, I admit that I\u0027m no different than Mashiro and Takagi. In Bakuman, they\u00a0don\u0027t just want to make a living from their works. But they also want to see their works adapted into anime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this vision in mind, I would love to have your support so then I can continue to produce professional-looking original light novels for people who love to read this kind of book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the breakdown on how I will use the fund:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHire professional illustrator to do the book cover illustration\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHire editors to do structural and line editing\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHire a proofreader so then my manuscript will be error-free before it hits the printing press\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBuy a proof copy of my book just to see that the formatting for the print book is correct (I won\u0027t lie that it feels great to hold my book physically and proudly shows it to other people)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBuy a high quality microphone and a pop filter to create a professional and high quality audiobook (Audible and iTunes will reject my audiobook if it\u0027s low quality)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCover other expenses such as web hosting, email marketing provider, domain name, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBuy books that I can use as a reference and inspiration for my next book (It can be non-fiction books or manga)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a nutshell, the fund is mostly used for publishing the books and also for the website maintenance. It\u0027s a bonus that I can buy the books that I want while using it as a source of reference and inspiration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love anime, manga, videogames, reading light novels and original light novels, then I\u0027d love to have you supporting my work. You can pick whatever tier that you can afford to support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt doesn\u0027t matter whether you choose the cheapest tier or the most expensive tier to support me, it still means the world to me. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, thank you for your time to take a look at my campaign."
