    "summary": "If you are a contributor, thank you! Thank you for sending the message to the world that the arts matter. we need more creators, philosophers, thinkers, and dreamers to be able to pursue their talents and make the world a better place. Your financial donations make that possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are a reader, thank you! Your\u00a0 investment is your time spent in the world that I have created. I can\u0027t thank you enough. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a passerby wondering what this is all about, thanks for stopping by! Let me tell you a bit about myself. \u003cbr\u003eI am an independent author who writes high fantasy for middle grade and young adult readers (though all ages are welcome!). \u003cbr\u003eI currently have two books out. Ring of Fire, and Anhedonia. \u003cbr\u003eI aim to entertain, but also to encourage critical thinking. To give youth exposure to the idea that good and evil aren\u0027t black and white, and explore topics such as institutional bias, relationships, and mental health within the safety of a fantasy world. \u003cbr\u003eMy hope is that my characters and the themes they represent will stick with them throughout their lives, the way that my favorite characters carried me through the heartaches of adolescence. Books were there when I needed them, and I aim to return the favor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003eThe Arts are an endangered species. Not because there is no one to create, but because creating art doesn\u0027t exactly pay well--at least not at first.\u003cbr\u003eStart up costs as an indie author are prohibitive. I\u0027ve taken to freelancing to absorb some of the burden, but that takes away from my readership in the form of delayed release dates. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not looking for Patreon to become income, but it would be great if it could help reduce the amount of freelance contracts I need to break even.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll contributors will receive exclusive updates on future projects made possible by them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1 a month will get you a personal thank you email\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose who contribute $5 a month will be sent a hand-written thank-you and a signed bookmark\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose who contribute $10 a month will receive a hand-written thank-you,\u00a0 and a digital ARC of my next book. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose who contribute $15 a month or more will receive a hand-written thank you and a signed physical ARC of my next book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you aren\u0027t in a position to contribute financially, but still want to help, here are some other ideas:\u003cbr\u003eTell your friends about my books\u003cbr\u003eDonate a copy of Ring of Fire to your local middle school or library\u003cbr\u003eRead my short story on Wattpad and leave a comment\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re local, sign up for my upcoming workshop (details TBA), or book a speaking engagement for your school, scout troop, etc. \u003cbr\u003eJust keep reading. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
