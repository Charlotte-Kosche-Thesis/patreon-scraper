    "summary": "I am a newbie to video creation, but I intend on producing meaningful content for any open-minded person or persons to consider. My prime area of interest is the how and where of intersections between culture and science, and the very helpful light that empiricism and true skepticism can shine on the often discourse that ensues in this arena.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI say \"true\" skepticism, since the self-described skeptic community online has devolved into a circle jerk of right-leaning apologists for reductivism and scientism, from my estimation. My channel has come about from an apparent need to counteract that sort of nonsense on the same grounds: question everything. Except, in this channel\u0027s case, I will actually be questioning everything--even myself, when enough sufficient evidence stands to change my mind on any given issue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInevitably, politics will come up in the discussions had on this channel. It\u0027s fairly impossible to avoid politicizing any topic these days, but I have also come to change my perspective as of late on whether or not objective observation can lead to political application; it can, does, and should.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut enough rambling. Check out the videos for yourselves, and if you feel like contributing as little as $5 a month, that will go a long way toward keeping the output steady and pushing the quality ever higher.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for listening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
