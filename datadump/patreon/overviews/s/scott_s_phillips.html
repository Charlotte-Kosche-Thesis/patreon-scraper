    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://www.cheese-magnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Welcome-flat.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHey folks!\u003c/strong\u003e I\u2019m Scott S. Phillips, and I\u2019ve been writing for a heck of a long time. Sold my first short story 28 years ago and since then I\u2019ve written all manner of things \u2014 screenplays, novels, television, short stories, comic books, and even dialogue for talking dolls. I wrote the script for the cult action flick \u003cem\u003eDrive\u003c/em\u003e (1997), which has won many awards and a few years back was named \u201cThe Best American Martial Arts Movie Ever Made\u201d by Kung Fu Cinema. You can see my other film/TV credits\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0680780/?ref_=nv_sr_1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eat imdb\u003c/a\u003e. And oddly enough, my \u003cem\u003eFriday the 13th\u003c/em\u003e tie-in novel, \u003cem\u003eChurch of the Divine Psychopath\u003c/em\u003e, sells for crazy amounts of money to collectors, which always surprises me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what really excites me is writing novels and short stories \u2014 no notes from the producer\u2019s boy/girlfriend, for one thing, and lots more freedom to go where the stories take me. My main focus right now is the \u003cem\u003ePete, Drinker of Blood\u003c/em\u003e series of vampire novels, and I\u2019m currently working on the fourth book in that series, \u003cem\u003eThe Room-Temperature Warrior\u003c/em\u003e. If you dig \u003cem\u003eBuffy\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eAngel\u003c/em\u003e, I\u2019m guessing you might like the \u003cem\u003ePete\u003c/em\u003e books. I\u2019ve written\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/-/e/B002BMN3IQ\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eseveral other novels\u003c/a\u003e as well, including \u003cem\u003eGun Up\u003c/em\u003e (a crime novella featuring Boone Butters). \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMost importantly, I once served as stand-in for the immortal Lemmy on the video for Motorhead\u2019s \u201cSacrifice,\u201d although I have since cut my shaggy locks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.cheese-magnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Why-Patreon-flat.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve got a massive list of ideas I want to peel off of the \u201cidea\u201d pile and squirt out into the world for people to read \u2014 more books in the \u003cem\u003ePete\u003c/em\u003e series, more Boone Butters stuff, some stand-alone crime novels, and a little number called \u003cem\u003eMan with Chihuahua\u003c/em\u003e, among others. The reason I\u2019m taking a stab at the ol\u2019 Patreon thing is that I would love to gain more time for the writing. I work a day job (as a transcriptionist) and it\u2019s pretty tough to maintain a regular writing schedule around all that day-job typing (case in point: I was aiming to have \u003cem\u003eThe Room-Temperature Warrior\u003c/em\u003e out already). The transcription gig doesn\u2019t pay by the hour, it pays by the amount of work I do, so whenever I take a bit of extra time away from that to write or do writing-related things (such as maintain ad campaigns and whatnot), my paychecks suffer, which in turn makes it that much harder to maintain the writing schedule. My goal is, of course, to make the writing a full-time thing and drop the day job entirely \u2014 thereby releasing at least two and possibly three novels a year. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother reason I\u2019m trying Patreon now: Earlier this year, I had a partially-detached retina and had to have that fixed. I don\u2019t have health insurance (it\u2019s a case of cheapest plan or groceries, quite literally, and I like to put food in my mouth) so I\u2019m currently making payments on the surgery to repair the retina \u2014 and the exciting bonus is that I was told going in that the laser could make the pre-existing cataract in that eye all excited and cause it to grow at a faster rate, which it is doing, causing terrible double vision and crappy eyesight in that eye. Which means I\u2019m now forced to have surgery to remove the cataract (and make even more payments every month). And just for good measure, my beloved dawg Casey had some eye issues of her own and fixing that actually cost even more than welding my retina back in place (and at the $2 a month tier, you\u2019ll get exclusive photos of the Casey-dawg!). Right now I\u2019m staring down (with an eye and a half) somewhere in the neighborhood of $4800 worth of eyeball nonsense, so let\u2019s face it \u2014 every little bit is a huge help.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.cheese-magnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/What-Im-Hoping-For-flat.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery penny that comes in through Patreon will go towards my goal of writing my butt off and getting more books out there for you guys to read. Check out the options I\u2019ve set up for Patrons \u2014 I think there\u2019s some cool stuff in the pipeline in all price ranges, and best of all is that if you dig my work, this could lead to seeing a heck of a lot more of it every year. I ain\u2019t getting any younger and I\u2019ve got a lot more stories I wanna tell, believe me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.cheese-magnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Cool-Stuff-flat.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$1\u003c/strong\u003e \u2014 For just $1 a month, you\u2019ll get access to my Patron-only blog, where you\u2019ll get to read my yammering on all kinds of subjects!
