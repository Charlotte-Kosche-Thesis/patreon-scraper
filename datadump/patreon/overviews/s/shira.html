You can find my full bibliography\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.shiralipkin.com/?page_id=32\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. My work has won the Rhysling Award, been shortlisted for the Million Writers Award, and been nominated for the Pushcart Prize and more, so I must be doing something right! You can read a sample story\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mythicdelirium.com/?page_id=1537\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and a sample poem\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://stonetelling.com/issue5-sep2011/lipkin-changeling.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, if you\u0027d like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is my only job these days, because I\u0027m disabled - too disabled to be hireable, but not disabled enough to get SSDI without a hell of a fight. I\u0027m on year two of that fight: applied, denied, appealed, denied, had a hearing, denied on the judge\u0027s error, and now appealing. That appeal process will likely take a full year. In the meantime, maybe help me out?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current project is a series of novels - antifascist urban fantasy. The world I\u0027m writing in is one that I came up with when I was sixteen, and have brought to life in fits and starts online and in comic form over the years. The full story of the world of Shayara and how I came to tell it the way I\u0027m telling it now? You\u0027ll have to sponsor me to find out! The first book is \"My Empire for Ashes\", the story of a young archivist who learns more than he thought possible, on many levels. My first-reader has called it both mannerpunk and vintage urban fantasy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I got SSDI, it would be about a thousand dollars a month. Since the SSA won\u0027t do their job, maybe you want to help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny sponsorship would be greatly appreciated, and please tell me what rewards you want! \u00a0:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
