(She\u0027s still searching for Narnia but heard The Shire is somewhere in New Zealand.) She studied English and Philosophy at Kent State before running off to join the Renaissance Festival circuit because everything\u0027s better with corsets and faeries. After spending years exploring all four corners of the US with some fabulous artist friends, hitting up Canada and Mexico, living off-grid in a tree house, learning to milk cows on an organic farm, and writing for some newspapers and magazines, she finally decided she had enough life experience to start writing stuff of her own. She also loves food, dancing all night and wearing faery wings."
