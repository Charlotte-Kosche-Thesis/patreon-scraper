    "summary": "When we started Scanline Media in March of 2013, we had one primary goal: produce quality editorial content about video games. Whether it was a review or piece about the culture itself, we wanted a place to broadcast our thoughts and opinions without burying them in forums or behind obtrusive paywalls. Over the years, our focus has expanded: while we still write, we\u0027re also working to upload our own series of Let\u0027s Plays on various games that pique our interests, along with a regular podcast on DOTA 2 and the occasional roundtable discussion on whatever game has our group\u0027s collective attention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been very happy with our growing stable of content, but in truth, we want to aim even higher. We\u0027d love to cover even more games, hold more live streams, record more Let\u0027s Plays and podcasts, and experiment with even more options to talk about the medium we love. Some of these goals are easily within our current means, while others are harder to justify for a site that currently generates absolutely no income for anyone involved. Even if we felt more comfortable about adding ads to the site itself (which we don\u0027t, because we hate ads as much as you do), the people who read gaming content in the first place are increasingly using ad blockers. Put simply, we\u0027d appreciate your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow You Can Help\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBy contributing to our Patreon, we can invest in exciting new ways to make our site even better! We\u0027d love to afford and cover more games, spruce up our videos with professional editing software, buy capture equipment for Six and install sound-dampening fixtures to make our recordings sound even better. Your participation will get us closer to achieving these goals, along with reducing the costs necessary for maintaining our website\u0027s domain, bandwidth and collaboration services. We\u0027ll be immensely grateful for anything you choose to chip in, no matter how small.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat If I Don\u0027t Chip In?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNothing changes. We\u0027ve been creating content for free for more than four years now, and we don\u0027t intend to stop. We want to improve the site, expand our coverage, and generally make everything Scanline better- but we have no intention of locking any of that away. This isn\u0027t a for-profit enterprise, and we don\u0027t want to wall people off."
