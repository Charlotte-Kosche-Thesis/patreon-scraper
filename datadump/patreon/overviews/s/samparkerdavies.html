It is an amazing and poetic articulation of my dream for the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFree food and housing for the world!\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eForging forward in food forest formation, mending marks with mud masonry. Trees planted that will end world hunger, benefiting people and animals for hundreds of years to come. Houses formed from materials local to the land can be made for free, creating communities and connecting people to this planet without a care for ludicrous concepts like debt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is a Food Forest?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA forest doesn\u0027t need a gardener. Nature constantly balances itself, welcoming creatures and plants of all kinds to bring together their creative gifts. By observing nature and interacting with it in awe and acknowledgement of its divine intelligence we can co-create forest with nature, favouring plants that will feed us what we want to eat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the Garden of Eden.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCultures all over the world have done this throughout history, and now permaculturalists, gardeners, foresters, farmers and individuals have rediscovered this lost art, this divine communion with nature. It is the secret to reversing climate change, as we store carbon in our forests and soil; the secret of ending world hunger, as we passively harvest our food; the secret of ending drought, as we store water in the ground and filter it with plants; the secret of ending erosion as we populate the land with trees and protect our soil. This is the innate abundance of nature. Through food forestry and gift we can remember the beauty of living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy name is Sam and I am on a life-long mission to assist humanity\u003c/strong\u003e in living harmoniously and happily with this earth. Cutting against the grain I finished my HSC and went traveling Australia straight away. Without a dollar in my pocket and a commitment to not make or spend any money my 17 yr old mind was truly expanded. I came back to my home two months later to celebrate my mum\u0027s birthday and join her in ceremony. With no room in my mum\u0027s home I moved out and directed my first festival, learning how to live without money in a stable place, so that I could fund the festival and save for other projects. I then ran for my local council on a whim. Encouraged by supportive mentors I advocated an empowered community organised through meetings, using the council to create its dreams, rather than the other way around. With little more than one month in the public eye and only just being old enough to vote we created community meetings and got an eighth of the total vote for our area. But we did not get in. All the while stumbling from organic restaurants to whatever other environmentally conscious jobs I could find. I then found permaculture and eco-building. This was the discovery of my purpose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am now in my second year of permaculture and eco-building studies. Having completed a Permaculture Design Course, several eco-building workshops, working as a labourer on many eco-builds and taught 7 eco-building and permaculture workshops myself, I am now living and breathing permaculture at Zaytuna Farm, the \"permaculture bootcamp\". Here from sunrise to sunset I am learning all that I can to help this world thrive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/geofflawtononline/videos/767380020115198/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/geofflawtononline/videos/...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon? What is it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy nature there is no record label or agents for my art, and while it can be commissioned not all those who need it are abundant in money. I dream to make food forests and beautiful, sustainable, well designed housing free to everyone. Patreon is what will empower my dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is created for a new wave of artistry. In the modern era free access to art is abundant, no one has to pay, and no one can be made to pay. So instead of fighting change we adapt to make our reality even more beautiful. Patreon is this adaptation. It is a site that invites support rather than demands it. It enables the artist to do their work without dead-lines because they love what they do, and to still be supported by those that want to support them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Dream\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI dream to create a business run purely on Dana (donation as an unconditional gift from your heart, not in payment for what you have received). This would mean no one need give, and if people choose to they may give whatever they wish - money or not. The business would offer workshops, courses, design and direct implementations to green and re-village urban areas, to build eco-villages, to aid those in crisis, and to educate the people of all these situations on how to ripple out this type of change. The basic mission is to help people living in excess remember the essentials and help them come back to the village, and to help those in poverty access the abundance around them through food forestry and water passive land design. Although an excellent tool in our current world, money is not essential for these things to happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next step of realising my dream is to go over to the middle-east to assist in the work of people that inspire me deeply. One man demonstrating how to grow food agriculturally and as food forest... in the middle of hyper-arid desert! Through his sustainable practices he holds the key to transforming human-made deserts into forest and reversing climate change. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvmx4lcqQVw\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvmx4lcqQVw\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother working with people in crisis areas all over the globe, such as working to turn refugee camps in the middle-east into eco-villages. Her work gives refugees a chance to live with their basic needs of water and food met so they can grow in happiness and health, it gives them skills that make them an asset to any country, and it spreads sustainable farming practices and food forests around the world all in one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHliBFMal0\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHliBFMal0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an amazing opportunity to ask for support as I work towards goals for my contribution to the world. It helps me continue to do the work I do for love and not for financial gain. \u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much to everyone who has found themselves giving to this\u00a0work. It means more than I can communicate.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

My life is at your finger tips. I aim to be your mud-covered, food forest dwelling guardian angel here to assist you in your dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWHY I GIVE IT WHETHER YOU DONATE OR NOT\u003cbr\u003e\nI encourage you to give to this cause because you want to support it and see it flourish! When we put our money or energy into something we care about we support its growth in the world, helping it become more available to ourselves, those we love and everything else. This is much better than the motivation of short-term self-gain, or rewards. To do something for the greater good of all increases potential benefit for everyone and cultivates a culture abundant in gift, one where people share what they have and therefore everyone has what they need. After all, only a culture without gift would have surplus food and a starvation problem.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is also important to me not to exclude those that cannot give big sums of money from what rewards I have to share. To grow food in harmony with nature and build for free are skills that are very important for everyone. Anyway I can assist anyone make a better world for themselves and others is a gift to me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you feel called to support this cause, whether through its embodiment in your own life, of mine or in the infinity of other ways, I am so deeply grateful; you are creating a great benefit for yourself and the world. Beyond any reward I could give you. Thank you for having such beautiful intention.\u003c/p\u003e",
