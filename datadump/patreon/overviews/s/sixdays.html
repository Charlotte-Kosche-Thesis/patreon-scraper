    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Six Days Studio?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSix Days Studio is a small independent production company, founded by me, Stephen Orsatti and Ian Juby. We create high-quality, God honoring Christian films...for you. That\u0027s all we want to do. And our videos aren\u0027t just for Christians; it\u2019s our goal to reach all people with the Good News of Jesus Christ.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhy are you on Patreon?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are on Patreon because of you. I appreciate that you made it to this page. Just the fact that you\u0027re here tells me that you realize there is a lot of time and effort that goes into making Christian films. Thank you. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe huge challenge is we have day jobs, and we create in our spare time. But, that simply is not practical and takes far too long. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEven though we\u0027ve become experts at making cinema quality videos on a shoestring budget having little to no money for a \"production budget\" ultimately makes production painfully slow. And, since we know you expect high quality as much as we do, production speed is the thing that suffers.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe want to work on our films full time...creating incredible Christian content. Our dream would be to do content creation for you guys full time. That is what this Patreon is for. If you like what we are doing and would consider buying some strangers over the internet the equivalent of a coffee, we would appreciate it more than you could imagine.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy giving your support through Patreon, we can deliver our films much faster and can focus our efforts full time on producing Christian films.. So, providing your support means you get to see more content of the highest quality, while we get the creative satisfaction of creating bigger and better videos.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe can promise you we do the best we can and invest as much time and love into youtube as possible without being irresponsible. Thank you for your ongoing support, it really is a huge deal for us and we very much appreciate it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nHow does this work?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSeveral cool reward levels allow you to tailor your subscription. You can give a small $10 donation or as much as $500. I would like to convince you to choose one, even at $1, so you have access to the Six Days Studio feed here at Patreon.  When you sign up via Patreon you\u0027ll be notified directly when I upload a video, which is pretty awesome!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe it goes without saying that I would greatly appreciate you joining me in changing the world. I\u0027ll say it anyway though. Thank you. I greatly appreciate it. The Patreon model has us place rewards here to entice you to donate, but if we\u0027re both honest... you\u0027re here because you understand what I\u0027m trying to do with Six Days Studio, and you think the many hours I put into the films is worth it! You \"get it\". \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhat you get.\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a Patron we want to reward you with exclusive bonuses unavailable to the public!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen you join us, depending on what level you choose, you will instantly get:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAccess to the Patron-only Activity Feed\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eGoogle hangout each month!
