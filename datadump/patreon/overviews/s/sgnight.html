As time goes by and sales from Book 1 start to\u00a0dwindle, I\u0027m left a little strapped as I work toward finishing Book 2. The first purpose of the Patreon is to provide continuous support (month-to-month instead of a single lump) for a young writer as he finishes the next installment, facilitate the marketing to spread the word about the series, and help launch the next publication.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m kind of awful when it comes to keeping in touch.

He began the final version of \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAttrition: the First Act of Penance\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e at age fourteen. 584 pages and one Kickstarter campaign later, he self-published the novel through Amazon\u0027s CreateSpace and Kindle Direct Publishing at the age of 18.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter its debut in August of 2013,\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAttrition \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003ewent on to win the 2014 Gold Medal for Fantasy fiction in the Readers\u0027 Favorite Award Contest. It became a #1 Dark Fantasy BestSeller on Amazon - as well as an Amazon Top 100 in Epic Fantasy - and has received the acclaim of dozens of readers and reviewers, accumulating an average rating of 4.5 stars across Amazon, GoodReads, and B\u0026amp;N.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, Sam has spent his time drafting the \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSecond Act of Penance\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, releasing two short stories, and slaving away as a student of e-Commerce marketing. He\u0027s a storyteller, a cynic, and a libertarian - he does things his own way. A sucker for puppies and English Muscials about French people, Sam also enjoys the winter, writing before the break of day, and the company of fire.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
