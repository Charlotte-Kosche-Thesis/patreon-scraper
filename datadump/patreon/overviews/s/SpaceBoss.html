We can\u0027t spend all the time we\u0027d love to working on projects and costumes as there\u0027s only the two of us doing what we love. The immediate goal is to earn enough to cover living costs (like rent, heating, travel, and all that pet food we need) so one of us can go full-time and create an stable groundwork going forward. Further in the future, we both want to do this as our full-time real jobs, and reach more people to collaborate with new projects.\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a step for us to achieve more and become more, both in personal projects and in creating for others. We want this Patreon to be Transparent and open to everyone who is interested, so if you donate anything you\u0027re totally welcome to ask what we\u0027re up to and what we\u0027ve got planned with the funding we receive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/13580581_719681431503027_3119194838574596327_o.jpg?oh=3d92a8ab4774cb088249a5f5bae6b65d\u0026amp;oe=59DA8E8F\" style=\"width: 577px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe make things, and we want to share what we know with more people.
