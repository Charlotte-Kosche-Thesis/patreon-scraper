    "summary": "Hi. Good to see you here. Who am I? Patreon asked, and I know you\u0027ll want to know, too, so here we go. I\u0027m an independent writer \u0026amp; scholar, a U:S. citizen living and working in a foreign country (Chile, to be exact). While not living on table scraps, neither do I command the resources of a Bill Gates or a Warren Buffett (ha!). I\u0027ve supported another creator on Patreon for the past couple of years to the tune of $25/month; now it\u0027s me that\u0027s seeking support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve written a novel. It is entitled \u003cem\u003eReality 101\u003c/em\u003e. It may be the first political novel of the Donald Trump era. Short and to the point, it presents a lot of issues in a new light, \u003cem\u003efirst\u003c/em\u003e from the point of view of a wheeling, dealing \"blue state\" retired banker and globalist who hates everything Trump stands for and more, and \u003cem\u003esecond\u003c/em\u003e, from that of my narrator whose instinctive rebellion against what he hears forces him into intense self-exploration of life\u0027s meaning beyond economics ... all in a small, Oklahoma \"red state\" town near where I grew up, its local college struggling, a dying community filled with lost souls who turned to Trump. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you love Donald Trump or dislike him, whether you have any interest in economics or if the subject bores you to tears, you\u0027ll find food for thought here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePromoting the novel after it comes out (sometime this summer) will mean traveling internationally, and if you\u0027ve traveled internationally you know how expensive it can be (airfare, plus rental car expenses, hotel, food, etc.). I\u0027ve never had a \"sugar daddy\" as do some writers, nor am I connected up with \"big name\" promoters. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich means, I\u0027m just one person who had an idea ... and I\u0027ve run with it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to think the book is a good one (hey, don\u0027t all authors think this?), but if it doesn\u0027t get in front of its would-be audience, how will anyone know, and be able to decide for themselves? That means more ready cash than I have now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust getting it into print will cost. Getting an ISBN # I can use will cost $99. I\u0027ve not gone the traditional route of getting an agent, who then finds a major publisher, etc., etc. My biggest reason: the process is too slow. This is time-sensitive material! (Trump now seems to have gone full neocon but what if he backpedals and is forced from office before the end of the year?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTarget date for completion: May 9, 2017. Target date for publication. As soon as possible after that. Please do stay tuned!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf 1,000 people see this and donate just $1/mo., that\u0027s $1,000. All of us probably waste more than tha before noon each day. If 1,000 people donate $5/mo, that\u0027s $5,000 per month which would more than meet the needs I\u0027ve described. $25/mo.? Wow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh! Obviously, if you donate at least $5/mo. you get a free copy of the book, and anything else of this sort (I also produce nonfiction) I get around to doing this year, or in the near future. As indicated, I have nonfiction projects in the works (three, to be exact).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWish I had a nice, slick, well-produced video to drop in here, but this isn\u0027t about me. It\u0027s about your country, the future, and where we go from here. Where do we want to go from here? God may be in charge, but I don\u0027t think He wants us sitting on our duffs. Some things \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e up to us. If \u003cem\u003ewe\u003c/em\u003e don\u0027t assume responsibility for the future, others will do it for us. Camus says somewhere, we\u0027re in this boat together. Join me on this adventure, and I\u0027ll do my part to help steer the boat through the troubled waters ahead."
