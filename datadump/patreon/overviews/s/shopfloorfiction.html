Critique as I write for as little as $2 and receive\u00a01 New Chapter per Week!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAime All American is an amalgamation of several favorite stories with themes on sexuality, identity, the Other, the They, and the created. This near-future fiction depicts a progressive world with an ever-steepening Bell Curve of technological interface and identity-culture entrenchment. The stories pulled from our Pygmalion, Pinocchio, and Frankenstein.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDecades after the Trump administration, the story opens on late middle-aged Millennial, Bernard Shaw, who is affected by old, deep scares from the culture wars we are now experiencing. Fossil fuels and manual driven vehicles are being phased out as the quantum computing revolution heralds a new age in artificial intelligence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWidowed and with a teenage daughter, Bernard is disillusioned by the complexities of modern catfishing, click-baiting, and contingent dating. Dissatisfied and with no more patience to discover true love, revolted by the dead mundanity of a \"Premium Sex Doll,\" the lack of intimacy with online prostitution, he takes up a challenge brought by a mysterious benefactor met on the back channels of the web. The challenge to make the first free-thinking human AI.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAime All American is as much the story of the created as the creator as they quickly discover how much of a storm rages around them disguised as everyday modernity where everything is political...from the clothes you wear, what you identify as, to who you talk to at work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to also acknowledge Betty Friedan\u0027s \u003cem\u003eFemine Mystique,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0the 2016 Election Season and all the angry American actors involved (Thanks Bernie, Hillary, and President Trump!), all the trolls and social justice warriors...the outliers like Blaire White and Shoe on Head...the Goddam Internet...and all the -ists and -isms out there. And Arthur Goldwag.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReading this story you may get mad, you may get upset, you may feel a little fuzzy...you will experience emotional feedback. I simply hope, as the writer, you will get addicted to it!"
