Good morning and in case I don\u0027t see you..good afternoon, good morning, good evening, and goodnight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027d like to take the time to reach out and thank you for dropping by my page, it\u0027s been a long time coming for sure. I have been shooting photos for a little over a year now and it is one of the few true passions I have in my life. It all started when I purchased a cool little Canon AE-1 from my local film store without any real inkling as to what I would truly do with it..At the time I purchased the camera I was definitely into being in front of the lens with no ambitions of being on the other side. As time progressed the camera set idly by collecting dust, serving no purpose at all but to sit on my mantle and look pretty until I decided to put it to use. I am still learning, I am still growing, I am taking time to hone my craft and capture the true essence of the people I work with. I continually do my best to capture real emotion and a sense of timelessness with my photography.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a patron you will have access to photo sets and videos that encapsulate the beauty of the Pacific Northwest with all the people who happen to reside or travel here. With your patronage I am able to purchase film, hire models, execute concepts that are merely dreams, and purchase more equipment to further my goal of having a career in photography. \u003cstrong\u003eEvery little bit helps, like for real, for really real.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eThis page will be a culmination of many works by me, a little blogging about feels n\u0027 thoughts, and sets of myself from various wonderful artist in the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, thank you, thank you\u003cbr\u003eyou are far to kind\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAkira\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sealthmademan/?hl=en\"\u003e@sealthmademan\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

After a few years of being in front of the lens I decided to try my hand at capturing some magic of my own. In the summer of 2016 I picked up my faithful canon ae-1 and from then on I fell in love. Through the months I have continually worked on my craft and hope to grow as an artist as time progresses.\u00a0",
