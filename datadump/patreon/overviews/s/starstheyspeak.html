She spoke to the stars as her comfort. One day, they spoke back to her. Eliana discovers a forgotten world in the Cosmos, laying dormant in wait for her. But some stars are not what they seem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe animation will be around 7-10 minutes, with Eliana\u0027s poetry voice over, and the character acting telling the story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re interested in seeing the animation\u2019s production and artwork, become a patron and support the project!

I\u0027ve seen so many fans asking to bring the very best Batman show from the 90\u0027s back. Well, since no one\u0027s done it yet, I want to do it. This is mainly for my art/animation portfolio and my love for all things Batman/DC. If you love Batman TAS and are interested in seeing a reboot, then join me on this journey!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m animating the characters with the same design as in the original series, and also using the same art process. Many of the artwork was originally created on black canvas, so I always animate and draw production art on black background. It\u0027s quite a refreshing take on the art process.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also being using the same score from the original series and weaving them into the new action on the storyboards.\u003cbr\u003eBatman\u0027s character has definitely evolved from the dark, stern and serious bat we know, into something very different. He\u0027s lost, shut in the dark, torn in between the crossroads. His character and the demanding decisions he makes molds and shapes into this story of redemption.\u003cbr\u003e",
