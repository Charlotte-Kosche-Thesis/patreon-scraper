    "summary": "Over the years, I\u0027ve created projects like :\u003cbr\u003eIt Wouldn\u0027t Be Make-Believe @ ARTEL\u003cbr\u003eClarendon Hotel in downtown Phoenix is an amazing mid-century hotel that has updated its facilities and is host to one of the best restaurants in Phoenix, as well as my favorite spot for sangria on a hot Arizona summer day. They host an event twice a year called ARTEL, in which 20 rooms and other spots in the hotel are given over to installation artists who are given free reign (within reason) to transform the room - we filled the entire room with strips of newsprint floor to ceiling and participants explored the space with delight and sometimes fear, as this article pointed out:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/slideshow/artelphx-at-the-clarendon-hotel-41888032/4/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/slideshow/artelphx-at-the-clarendon-hotel-41888032/4/\u003c/a\u003e#9\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacing Our Fears:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ea mountain of faces that participants can climb to enter into the project and become one of the many faces,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGlance Floor:\u003cbr\u003eAn interactive sculpture including a dance floor with video of people underneath making lewd gestures to the dancers above, as well as the Phone Sex Booths that allowed a peek into the life of a voyeur from the voyeur\u0027s perspective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbundance Tree:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA gifting tree made by weaving together limbs of felled trees to make a small room in which people can interact and branches to hang items to give as gifts. When left up long enough, the abundance of items creates a sort of odd magical serendipity between the items and the needs of those interacting with it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvents such as:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelly of the Whale:\u003cbr\u003ea monthly\u00a0artists exploration that included experiments in percussion, poetry, improv games, psychic navigation and sneaking abstract. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStone Soup Salons\u003cbr\u003ea monthly gathering in which participants brought one item to add to a \"Stone Soup\" and one item of creation to share with the group that matched a selected theme for the evening.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBrain Hacking - Wide Open Weekend retreat.\u003cbr\u003ea one time event (that will likely become a yearly event) in which attendees brought diverse \"brain hacking\u0027 devices as wide ranging as binaural beats installation, a trans-cranial electrical stimulation machine, a dream machine, narrative experiment, and a sensory deprivation tank and explored all the various ways to break your brain and put it back together again. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently working on many upcoming projects including (but very definitely NOT limited to): \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMcMuses Instant Inspiration:\u003cbr\u003ea monthly micro-patronage project that seeks to bring together artists working in ways \u00a0that are difficult to fund and the patrons most likely to appreciate their works.\u00a0In fact, my research for that event is what led me here, by the wonderful serendipitous trail.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt Wouldn\u0027t Be Make-Believe @ The Icehouse in Phoenix - a bigger, more elaborate version of the installation last month at ARTELPHX @ Clarendon Hotel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeo-Babel\u003cbr\u003ean interactive musical sculpture in which participants communicate via music - the object itself can be entered into and played either from the outside or inside. It\u0027s a prayer, a reflection and a mode of communication.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI-Artist\u003cbr\u003ean interactive painting installation in which four painters lead a group of participant/ artists to discover that they really do know how to paint and inspire them to move past their fears.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been able to create one or two of these installations and events on my own each year for over a decade funding them almost entirely on my own and now I\u0027d like to see how the world would look if I were able to do what I love to do full time and didn\u0027t have to split my time between this and working in an office - though the wild artist by night, executive assistant by day dichotomy has been fun for a while, it now drains energy that I\u0027d rather use to add to the creative conversation. As you can see, above, I\u0027m not what you\u0027d call lazy. If I had the time and resources, there literally are boxes and boxes filled with ideas I would no longer have to put off because of lack of time or money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can tell, my ideas aren\u0027t particularly marketable by normal means, but hopefully you can also tell that their purpose is usually to get other people to communicate, find the value in their own creativity and give everyone the right to explore and experiment by giving them opportunities to notice that they already are. That\u0027s my vision. I hope it\u0027s also yours.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you believe in magic, and would like to help me make some, please donate a small amount (or a larger one) so that I know my bills are paid and the means are in place to create so I can make these events and upcoming projects better than I could have alone. Many hands makes light work - something I preach with my crews all the time - I guess it was inevitable that I\u0027d recognize I needed to start letting people help this way too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyone donating is automatically invited to all of my events, and the explorer in me is really interested in talking directly to new folks who might be interested in helping out, about my vision, you and your lives and YOUR vision as well, and the wonderful mutual inspiration that this sort of relationship often engenders. Welcome to my world!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find out more here:\u003cbr\u003esondracarr.com\u003cbr\u003e"
