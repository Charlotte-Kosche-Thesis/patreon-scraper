    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Courtney, an artist, and feminist currently living in Joshua Tree, California. I work across multiple mediums and platforms, but drawing and painting are at the forefront of my art.\u00a0My work includes aspects of feminism and social justice, imagery from the high desert, and a focus on accessibility.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYour support, comments, likes, and shares do so much to encourage my\u00a0practice and share my experience. And I want your support to be just as meaningful for you. As I build my page and add content, I hope you will use your keyboard and your voice to let me know what is important to you about feminism and how you would like to see that reflected in my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you support my practice?\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon is a platform that allows creators to \u003cem\u003econtinue making the work you love\u003c/em\u003e. By supporting your favorite artists, you\u0027re allowing them to both pay their bills AND constantly improve by: purchasing better equipment, taking a class to expand our knowledge, hosting in-person community gatherings, or financing a large-run product like an enamel pin or tapestry. \u003cstrong\u003eThink of yourself as a business investor and a patron of the arts!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDonate because you see value in what I do. Donate because you want to become a vital component of this community. \u003c/strong\u003eKnow that your donation will also be helping out in a HUGE WAY. Every little bit is appreciated, and I will continue to do my best to create work that speaks to our shared feminist values and share my process and art with you all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you are unable to support me at this time, that\u0027s OK!
