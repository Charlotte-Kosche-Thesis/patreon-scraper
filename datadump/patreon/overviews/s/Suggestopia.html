Every Patreon donor\u0027s suggestion will be read and contribute towards a playable alpha of the game each month.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi!  I\u2019m Widget.  I\u2019m a freelance game developer.  I\u2019ve built prototypes and experiences for clients, and now I want to something completely different!  I love game jams starting from the first Global Game Jam in 2009.  Game jams are events that give you a some arbitrary rules and limited amount of time, usually 48 hours, to make.  You can see some of my other projects on \u003ca\u003ewidgetsworkshop.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this Patreon for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to create a game based on crowd-sourced suggestions.  A never-ending game jam with many, many arbitrary rules made by you, my patreons!  After seeing so many reviews about kickstarter games not meeting the expectations of their backers, I think this is an interesting way to give gamers what they want, one minute of development at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContribute any amount to the Patreon then send me an email with a suggestion to add to the game.  I will spend at least 1 minute per dollar contributed implementing your suggestion!  Every month, I\u2019ll release an update to the the game with the suggested changes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I suggest\u2026..anything?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePretty Much!  Try to make your suggestion fit the amount you contribute.  For example:  I cannot make an MMORPG for $2, but I can add a homemade fart sound effect when you jump.  You can submit anonymously, or include your handle so you can get credit for your suggestion.\u003cbr\u003eDon\u2019t say \u201cTetris, but as a rogue like\u201d.  Suggest story elements, designs, models, and themes.\u00a0  See your weird ideas come to life. This is a game design version of an exquisite corpse. \u003cbr\u003e  I intend the game to be playable on streaming sites, so please no 18+ content,  No copyrighted material, and all suggestions are up to artist interpretation.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if Suggestions directly contradict each other?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will try to reconcile conflicting suggestions to the best of my creative ability. In the event of a direct conflict, I\u0027ll add the suggestions to a poll and the one with the most contributions will be done.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will the suggestions be organized?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, I\u2019m just going to keep a big spreadsheet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis sounds like a terrible idea that will result in something unplayable.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProbably!  Let\u2019s find out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat platform is this for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently Mac and PC are supported, but you could suggest more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003egoals\u003c/strong\u003e rewards or rewards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGoals may be added later for assets, licenses, etc.\u00a0 Rewards are already directly linked to the amount you pay.\u00a0 The more time I get to spend on your idea the better it will be!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eOther questions?
