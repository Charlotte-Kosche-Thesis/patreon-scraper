    "summary": "Hey there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to the Patreon page for Soundole VGM Covers. I\u0027d love to take a little bit of your time to tell you who I am, what I do, and why I think Patreon can help me take it to the next level.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Peter Anthony Smith, and I\u0027m traditionally a classically trained clarinettist from Sydney, Australia. Since around the beginning of 2014, I\u0027ve been devoting more time to making multitracked recordings of video game music using the EWI, or Electric Wind Instrument. I tend to focus on soundtracks from the 8-bit and 16-bit era, both because they suit the instrument and it\u0027s a period which was historically significant to me as a gamer. Have a listen to some of the tracks I\u0027ve made:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuper Mario 64 - \u0027Inside the Castle Walls\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-_IOs74GP5s\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOrWMn1jBsk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMinecraft - \u0027Sweden\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZIxJuok7z_w\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSonic the Hedgehog 2 - \u0027Casino Night Zone\u0027 (Ft.

My income comes in small amounts from a few sources as I work in multiple studios and take on whatever playing work I can find. The money from Youtube monetisation is both unpredictable and tiny (I make $2-5 a month!), so additional money from Patreon could give me the financial security to devote more of my time to making these recordings (which I love doing much more than teaching!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, Patreon wouldn\u0027t just be allowing me to pay rent and break the musician stereotype, it would allow me to make my videos more professional through better lighting, higher quality microphones, better software and cameras. Patrons have helped me to afford several key pieces of tech which I now use for every track I make! These funds would also go towards physical CD releases, which of course would make their way back to my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I do have some albums available on Bandcamp for people who like the convenience of downloadable albums and appreciate high quality formats (\u003ca href=\"https://soundolevgmcovers.bandcamp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eyou can check out my bandcamp page here\u003c/a\u003e), it\u0027s also really important to me that my music be free for anyone who wants to listen to it. My videos on Youtube will always be free for everyone, and anyone is welcome to download any of my tracks from this folder, which contains everything I own from my VGM playlist on Youtube: \u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/x5zwvxi6ox8gp5v/AABzOkdnjF6pPmgVneGD1gUma?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDropbox MP3s Folder\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat else is in it for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eIn\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eaddition to the knowledge that you\u0027re supporting me (and receiving my eternal gratitude!), there are a variety of extra perks to becoming my patron, which I\u0027ve detailed below. I\u0027m not a huge fan of offering Google hangouts or Skype chats as rewards for upper donation tiers, which I see a lot of Youtube musicians doing. My thinking is this: if you like my music, donator or not, I am more than happy to talk to you any time. Email me, chat on facebook, I\u0027d love to get in touch! Instead, I\u0027ve tried to offer some rewards which are more tangible and personalised. I\u0027ve partnered with the artist \u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://michaelfurler.tumblr.com/\"\u003eMichael Furler\u003c/a\u003e to make some new art for any patrons that pledge $5 per cover and up.\u00a0I\u0027m also going to keep my Patreon feed active for any donators, with previews of upcoming works or discussions about what works to do next. For the highest tiers, I\u0027ll work to pursue some of your suggestions, or even write music for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow frequently are videos coming out? How much would I be paying?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, I aim to release around 2-3 videos a month, which is subject to change based on what other work I\u0027m doing. I\u0027ll never be releasing more frequently than weekly, and Patreon allows you to set caps on how much you can potentially pay out each month, so you\u0027ll never get scammed if I decide to release 15 videos in a week. That doesn\u0027t sound like a fun (or plausible) situation for me anyway! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also setting up some ground rules, to make sure that my patrons feel like they\u0027re getting a decent return for their money:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eVideos have to be at least 1.5 minutes long (that\u0027s the audio, not including the endcard)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI need to feel like they\u0027ve been work-intensive enough to justify charging for!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn general, I\u0027ll be trying to cover tracks that aren\u0027t too obscure - so you\u0027ll rarely find tracks for a game written for the N-Gage that was only released publicly for 2 weeks in Czechoslovakia. I can\u0027t promise that every track will be from something you\u0027ve played, but I\u0027ll try to make at least every second release from a mainstream title (a title generally considered \u0027popular\u0027).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor collaborations that I\u0027m involved in, I need to have done at least 50% of the work involved for me to list it as a Patreon creation.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThat doesn\u0027t mean that I won\u0027t cover any simple tracks, or tracks shorter than 1.5 minutes, but if I do, I won\u0027t list them as creations for patrons to be charged for. Also, I won\u0027t be charging for anything that\u0027s weirdly outside of my style that you didn\u0027t sign up for - but I\u0027ll occasionally be producing other free stuff - like original VGM - too!\u003cbr\u003e"
