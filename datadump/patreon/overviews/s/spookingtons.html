I\u0027m Norm Scott\u003c/strong\u003e, and if you know me, it\u0027s probably from my comics, like EGM\u0027s \"Hsu and Chan,\" \"Violence Man\" and \"The Otters,\" or my animation/game work on sites like Cracked and 1up. If you don\u0027t know me at all, hey, you\u0027re still here, it\u0027s not like I\u0027m gonna look a gift horse in the mouth.

The simple answer is that, while I\u0027ve been fortunate enough to make a significant portion of my living income from work in the arts, in recent years it has rarely been from MY arts, specifically. I miss writing Hsu and Chan, Violence Man, the Otters, and all the rest, and as time has passed and new projects arisen, opportunities to work on the adventures of my dear, old, weird friends have been harder and harder to come by.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEnter Patreon!
