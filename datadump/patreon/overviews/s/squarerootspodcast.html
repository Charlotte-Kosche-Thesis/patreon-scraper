    "summary": "Howdy Square Roots fans!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past two years, Jim, John, Vanessa and Matthew have been playing through all of your favorite RPGs one chunkerino at a time and having an absolute blast. From Final Fantasy to Mass Effect and everything in between, Square Roots has been charging through RPGs with no signs of slowing down.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAnd we\u0027re ready to do so much more! But we need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your patronage (patreonage, patreonocity...?) we\u0027ll be able to produce more content, invest in things like better equipment and more games, get some new merch out to our listeners and (maybe!) even get us all in once place to do some live RPG talk! We\u0027re ready to take this \u0027cast to the next level and, with your help, we know we can get there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We Have Planned\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBonus Content: \u003c/strong\u003eSince our inception, we\u0027ve all had ideas for more content but we\u0027ve never really had the bandwidth to do it - mostly because these things take time and money. But we\u0027re ready to get out more episodes - including a new bi-weekly \u003cstrong\u003eLevel Up\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0news and reviews podcast \u003cstrong\u003eAND \u003c/strong\u003ea new rotating monthly\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSquare Roots: Versus \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eSquare Roots: Instant Classics\u003c/strong\u003e podcasts, for patrons only!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBetter Equipment: \u003c/strong\u003eUp to this point, the hosts have invested their personal dollars into their individual setups. We\u0027d like to increase the quality of our content by investing in some new microphones and other equipment to be as polished as we absolutely can be. We want to make sure that all of our talk about vore and horny grandmas come through as clear as it possibly can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBetter Merch: \u003c/strong\u003eWe\u0027ve done the t-shirt thing a few times but, as some of our listeners can attest, it was a pretty cumbersome process. With your help, we can find the best designers, vendors and partners to help us with our merch and make sure we follow through on all the great ideas we have for swag.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that\u0027s our pitch.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve always loved making this content for our listeners and interacting with our fans and hearing how they love these games as much as we do. It never gets old! We\u0027d like to keep doing this until we\u0027re dead - in whatever form we can - and we\u0027re all extremely excited to keep growing and growing and creating more and more awesome content for our amazing listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks, friends, for listening and sticking with us. There\u0027s lots more awesome stuff to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJim, John, Vanessa \u0026amp; Matthew"
