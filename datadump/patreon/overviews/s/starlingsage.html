My background is in fashion and theatrical\ndesign and after working professional for a time I had to leave to\ntake care of some personal stuff.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI originally made this Patreon\ncampaign to focus on having consistent rent but I also love the potential for community input in my work! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYes, Patreon is an\nopen ended commitment. I am sensitive to peoples need to be\nfinancially responsible. I suggest that you commit to a year of\nfunding at a level of your choosing. Then when the time has passed\nreassess if you want to continue. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eThis Year\u0027s Projects\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kRlH9-5-6k8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOne Canvas a Month: in which I fill up a canvas with paint and other things each month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n100 Yards of Fabric in One Year: in which I weave 100 yard of fabric in one year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpdates will be posted here most often and also on the instagram.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eThe Patreon Platform\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vLy-U20-k4U\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe basics: Patreon is a platform that allows regular, ordinary\n(or even extraordinary) people become patrons of the arts. You can\ngive patronage to an artist on a monthly or project basis. This\ndepends on how the artist sets up their account. Either way you chose\nexactly how much money you want to give and the system automatically\ndoes the financial stuff and we can all run free and go dancing and\nhave a good time. You will be supporting an artist, such as myself,\nand the artist won\u2019t have to spend as much time fining funding\nthey would be able to spend more time doing their awesome art thing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe details: because my mom is old school and wants me to make\nsure you know all the things you could possibly need to know about\nbefore trying out this thing I will now tell you how I understand\nthis  thing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSay you want to give me money. Awesome! You will start up a Patron\npage from which you can fund your artist. From that page you then can\nset your contributions. Each artist will have a different incentives\nprogram. I\u2019ll explain mine below. Built into the incentive program\nis a way for you to check on what the artist is doing. Each month the\nsum of money you have given will be taken from your bank account and\ngiven to the artist. They will then have the money to do things like\npay rent, buy supplies or enter triad shows whatever they have asked\nmoney for.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn my case you will mainly help me pay rent on studio space.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI know that giving me money for, \u201cno apparent reason\u201d is\nnot the way we normal do things so to make it nicer for you there\u0027s an incentives program.\u00a0 This is a list of things that will evolve over time but is\ngenerally meant to give you access to my work at a privileged level. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe other thing my mom wants me to point out is that Patreon takes\na 5% commission on pledges. This means that for every dollar you give\nme I get $0.95. I\u2019m OK with this because it\u2019s better than a book\nroyalty which, if I\u0027m lucky, THEY take 40%. \nAlso, I will have to pay taxes on this money because it will be business income. I don\u0027t know the percentage off the top of my head. So there\u0027s that too.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd of course you can cancel your contribution for any reason at any time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWheew, that was long winded.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eHow I thank you\u003c/h1\u003e\nNot only will you get good karma from helping me I have an awesome incentives program featured in the side bar. As a patron you will get direct access to me and be able to influence the projects I take on. Cool! I will always be grateful for your help and look forward to getting to know you better.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThese incentives are a small way for me to express how awesome you are for committing to support me long term.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eAccountability\u003c/h1\u003e\nI feel kind of weird\nabout giving to people who aren\u2019t accountable. So I don\u2019t intend\nto be that person with this project. I will release an annual report\nthat will include a summary of what I did and an outline of where the\nmoney came from and what I did with it. This will go to anyone who\nhas given me any level of support throughout the year.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course I will\nalso update my patron feed regularly so you shouldn\u2019t be surprised\nby the report but I\u2019m doing it so you can have all that kind of\ninformation in one place, and it will make taxes easier for me, and we ALL win!!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
