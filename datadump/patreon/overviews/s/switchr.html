    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHey there Friends!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in 2009, I was working a job at a help desk. That was where it all began. There was a distinct need for automation, deployment, data reporting, data backup, and secure access to host machines. I knew that if I could automate greater portions of my job, I could turn my attention to more important issues and topics. Now, my team and I have done just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Switchr.io, large corporations and help desks can exert a dramatic level of control over their businesses, cutting costs and saving precious time and resources. Even a home user could incorporate our software into their life, though: it\u2019s that simple to use. Bringing to the table many years of experience supporting Alpha POS, I have catered the system to service-industry organizations such as bars and restaurants. We have been using this system to support our clients for some time already, and the functionality is already up to par. The features here are numerous, including remote desktop, port forwarding, system info, system rebooting, backup, reporting, and assigning users to hosts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, we need your help, friends. By contributing to our Patreon, you will make it possible for us to continue to work on and improve the system that we have created. We need funding not only for hosting, but every day living essentials. I have an awesome sidekick to work \u0026amp; live along side me, but i\u0027m paying all of our bills out of my pocket, so he doesn\u0027t have to find himself a job. Nearly always broke, I\u0027m working two other jobs currently to make ends meet, and it\u0027s really just slowing me down. On top of that, I live in Denver half the time to keep my job there, so I\u0027m flying back every two weeks to work with my sidekick in person at our apartment in KCMO (Thankfully Frontier keeps it cheap, and I still spend less traveling back and fourth, than what I would renting an apartment in Denver). It\u0027s a lot less costly for what we need in comparison to Denver, but I would rather us just be able to afford something in Denver, and work together full time. Sounds a little crazy doesn\u0027t it? I\u0027ve made a lot of sacrifices in my life to do this, and we are here ready to make it all worth it in the end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want patrons with insight \u0026amp; new ideas from people who care about our product to become members of our page. Our goal is to make this our full-time career, we enjoy this stuff, and we\u0027re not asking to become rich. In return for your wondrous support, you\u0027ll enjoy VIP access that no general public will. We look forward to your advice, and input.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour generous support means the world to us. We thank you for your ongoing faith in what we\u2019re doing!\u003cbr\u003e~Nick\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeatures \u0026amp; Capabilities of Switchr.io:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrently built for Windows OS\u003c/strong\u003e, but we are able to forward access to other hosts on the same network such as, video cameras, mac \u0026amp; linux OS, etc. It\u0027s easily installed by yourself, or by an onsite person with access to the machine. \u00a0A technician only needs to create the host in web console, and provide a license key to the user for installation. The user can also opt to enable RDP upon install, so that there is at least one native method of remote access right away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving many years of experience supporting Aloha POS, we cater to and work with a lot of service industry groups like bars \u0026amp; restaurants. You\u0027ll find our focus to be that of a technical support help desk, network administrator, or small business owner. We\u0027ve been using it to support our clients for a while, and test point-of-sale interactive functionality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we do provide similar features like popular software such as Logmein, \u00a0Teamviewer, or Dropbox. I believe we\u0027re really very different in our business model \u0026amp; functionality. We have packaged other great features into the software such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePort Forwarding\u003c/strong\u003e - Expose a hosts port to the public from nearly anywhere with optional IP/Subnet restricted access. Easily switch it on and off as needed. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eUsage Example #1: A support technician might need to access someones computer for support. They would have the end-user download the Switchr installer, and complete installation (marking the enable RDP \u00a0option at install). The tech creates a host in our web console, and provides the license key to the end-user. The tech then can create a forward to open port 3389 for Remote Desktop Protocol. It is then assigned a random public port, accessible on the server you choose to set up the host on (we provide them in different locations, and soon for private use).\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eie: city-location.switchr.io:35646 -\u0026gt; yourhostip:3389.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsage Example #2: A developer could be at a coffee shop, and show their local environment for client demos, or serve data on the fly especially behind wifi hot-spots or secured networks without access to the router. They would open something like port 80 and/or 443 for web traffic,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsage Example #3: \u00a0A home user may need access to their computer, so they install switchr with option to enable RDP, add a host on the web console, and enter the license key into installer. The user is then able to remotely access the machine. Within the host menu under Connect-\u0026gt;Create RDP, this sets up the the connection to the host for rdp via our web connector, which works well for mobile also. Then simply press host menu-\u0026gt;Connect-\u0026gt;RDP to get connected.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsage Example #4: Home user has a security system setup, but doesn\u0027t know how to forward ports.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem Info -\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Get a basic dashboard glance of system information for the host. Network cards, IP address, hot fixes, OS. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem Reboot\u003c/strong\u003e - Reboot any host machine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBackup\u003c/strong\u003e - Off-site \u0026amp; Incremental for (FTP/SFTP/Amazon S3) - \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCurrently in available w/beta access.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis feature is setup from the web console, but can be restored from the hosts using the task bar icon.\u00a0Now you can use your Amazon AWS account to pay dirt cheap backup prices for version capable backup, or setup ftp/sftp space at your home office, or web server for non-versioned backup. If you change a file, it\u0027s synced back up to your backup server.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePoint-of-Sale Reporting\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0- Exported sales and labor reports viewed, emailed, or text/sms them.
