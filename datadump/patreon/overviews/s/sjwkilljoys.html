    "summary": "The online communities we\u0027ve been involved in have historically been pretty divided on how they feel about the two of us, and the kind of feminism/activism we promote and work towards --- But there was no way we could take it personally... Until the amazing people acting as cheerleaders started asking for a podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t think either of us expected the kind of response we\u0027ve gotten here. It\u0027s been reaffirming, and has added to our already long list of motivations to push for true equality across the board, but it also takes quite a lot of time and energy to keep on top of all the things we\u0027re involved in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we started working as an impromptu team, it was because we love what we do - working to find new ways to educate, unpack privilege, and unearth/destroy oppressive systems. That is \u003cstrong\u003eabsolutely\u003c/strong\u003e still the number one motivator, and there is no expectation whatsoever - anyone who stops to listen to what we have to say has already donated a lot (we know we\u0027re challenging :) ) This patreon page asked us to designate rewards for people who donate, and I clicked the stuff that\u0027s entered automatically, but just to be clear - you\u0027re not going to have to pay for blog entries and extra content - I\u0027m sorry, but that\u0027s absurd. We will put some serious thought and time into figuring out rewards for people who donate, but for now the rewards will just be our undying gratitude and a personal thank you message. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo all the people who asked us to do this... You fucking win everything. Thanks.\u003cbr\u003e"
