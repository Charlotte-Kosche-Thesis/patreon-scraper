But there is still enthusiasm, and thank you for expressing yours for science by supporting the show. I\u0027m David Huntsberger, and I sit down with scientists and artists and share some beer and try to figure out the world. We chat about space, time, physics, philosophy, biology, math, computers, artificial intelligence, art, creativity, consciousness, and all the things that make us human. I also call strangers from the internet and find out what\u0027s going on in their lives. It\u0027s released every Monday as an episode of the \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/space-cave/id1039075361?mt=2\"\u003eSPACE CAVE\u003c/a\u003e. If you decide to help, that would be stellar, and it will help me to put more energy into the show and potentially even pay my hardworking engineer friend Dan, who cobbles the show together from the goodness of his little Australian heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
