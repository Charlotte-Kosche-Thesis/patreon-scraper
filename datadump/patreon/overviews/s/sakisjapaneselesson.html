When I was in my 20s I visited many places, like Cambodia, Singapore, and the US. So of course, being in all types of locations allowed me to witness all types of cultures. But being in America especially introduced me to all cultures and religions gathering in one huge country.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what was the one thing that stood out to me as a young Japanese girl in a foreign land? The fact that everyone was able to come together through the power of language. Of course not everyone could understand each other. But everyone had the desire to understand each other, and that was very touching to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the more popular languages to learn was Japanese. Indeed, I met many friends through Japanese/English language Meet-Ups. So, I thought, hey, why not share my knowledge with the world? So, during the time I lived in New York I thought to start Saki\u2019s Japanese Lesson. Since then I have joined many festivals and even held an event. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActually, it\u2019s my dream to hold more events for my fans so we can come together through our love of Japanese. I didn\u2019t enjoy school when I was a student. It was so cold and boring. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s another goal of mine to teach everyone through warmth and ease within a fun and exciting atmosphere, even if it\u2019s just through a computer screen (for now that is). \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eI want you to feel at home with me!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I will be able to live my dream of helping people learn my language.
