I published my first book review in 2011 and since then have\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.strangecurrencies.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epublished reviews\u003c/a\u003e of nearly 100 novels, as well as several games, films and other SFF media. The first time I saw review text I had written, on a real book, in a real book store, I cried.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn my life I\u0027ve worked in 4 different bookstores, including one I opened and ran myself, and it has been so wonderful to make a career about sharing my enthusiasm for speculative fiction. The only feeling more satisfying than reading a really excellent book is knowing you might be able to help other people find it and enjoy it as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy supporting this Patreon you are helping to offset the cost of books, allowing me to pick up the newest titles in hardcover for more timely and helpful review content. You\u0027re also helping cover the costs of freeing up the time to dedicate to sharing my love of this medium with people just like yourself who benefit from recommendations and suggestions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo my current and potential future patrons I say thank you. Thank you for contributing to my passion, and for helping me to share that passion with you.\u00a0"
