In the years since I first set it up we have released more than 1800 blog posts including reviews, interviews with industry insiders, GM and player advice, and more. I have also released a number of free roleplaying games over the years including the popular\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.stargazergames.eu/games/warrior-rogue-mage/\"\u003eWarrior, Rogue \u0026amp; Mage\u003c/a\u003e. To learn more about the games I had a hand in creating check out the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.stargazergames.eu/\"\u003eStargazer Games\u003c/a\u003e site or my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://rpggeek.com/rpgdesigner/22914/michael-wolf\"\u003eRPGGeek designer profile\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe bulk of the posts have always been written by me, Michael Wolf. During the last years friends and fellow RPG fans have joined me and written posts for the blog as well. At times several writers have contributed to the blog on a daily basis, nowadays things are a bit slower, but that doesn\u0027t mean that you don\u0027t get quality content on a semi-regular basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t like ads and I have never accepted paid posts. I make some use of affiliate links but most of the costs of hosting, buying games for review purposes, etc. is paid out of my own pocket. This has worked fine for years, and it probably will do so in the future, but I wanted to provide my fans and readers with an opportunity to support us if they so decide. Every bit helps and it might allows us to bring you even better stuff in the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
