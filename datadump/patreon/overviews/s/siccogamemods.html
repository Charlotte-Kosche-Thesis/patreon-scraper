I love this game even after such a long time in early access. After a while i was think about to make a own map, because i saw all the other great mod maps. So i\u0027ve started working on the map about 1 year ago. It was my first contact with the a game engine, in this case Unreal Engine 4. At the beginning it was only, how the basics for the game are working and so one. After a few weeks later i\u0027ve started the work on the map. After a total start over (after 3 months of work) because of a fatal error, \u00a0i\u0027ve released the first playable version of my map The Volcano on July 2nd 2016. The first 2 months was as i expected, only a few visits and subs, but i was okay with that, because it was kinda only for me, to show others what i\u0027m doing. After about 3 month i got a push from a friend via Twitter and from this point on the player count was growing really fast, from only a few hunderts to now over 100000 subs to my map. Since then i had up and downs becasue of a ongoing learning process but i still love working on the map but it\u0027s going to be more and more time consuming. I wanna spend more time to work on my map to get things done faster, but i still need money to life and that\u0027s why i need to do my real life job. I\u0027m self-emploeed which is a plus so i can manage the time by myself, but for the last few weeks it\u0027s going to be harder for me since my real life work needs more time as well.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso i already have plans for a new ARK map, which i already started with the landscape.\u00a0Maybe with this i can turn my hobby into a real thing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks in advance for all the support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest\u003cbr\u003eMike aka Sicco0803\u003cbr\u003e"
