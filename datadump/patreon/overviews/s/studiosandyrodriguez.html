    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eSandy Rodriguez\u003c/h2\u003eSandy Rodriguez is an artist and independent educator. Her artwork investigates the methods and materials of painting across cultures and histories. Her most recent work includes the Codex Rodriguez-Mondrag\u00f3n, a bioregional map and series of paintings about the intersections of history, color, medicine, and cultura. Her landscapes capture moments of transformation in the social, political and cultural landscape of Los Angeles, with a focus on themes of resistance, persistence and cultural regeneration. She was raised in San Diego, Tijuana, and Los Angeles. Rodriguez earned her BFA from California Institute of Arts and designed and administered education programs and resources for numerous museums and arts organizations since 1998. Teaching across constituencies is part of her artistic practice and embodies her belief that artists are critical to reshaping our time and place through civic engagement projects. She has exhibited at institutions such as the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego; Art+Practice, Los Angeles; and Self Help Graphics, Los Angeles. This spring you can see her work on view as part of a two-person show with John Valadez at Fine Art Solutions\u2019 creative space, East 26 Projects, Los Angeles. Recent awards and residencies include: Department of Cultural Affairs Cultural Trailblazer Award (2017-18), Artist-in-Residence for Los Angeles County Arts Commission (2016-2017), and Artist-in-Residence at Art+Practice in Leimert Park (2014-15). Her artist communique and artwork are featured on the cover and in the Fall 2017 issue of Aztl\u00e1n: A Journal of Chicano Studies from UCLA\u2019s Chicano Studies Research Center.
