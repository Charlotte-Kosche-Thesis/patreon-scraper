We are over-worked, over-committed and over-stressed, and we compete on how busy and important and sleep-deprived we are. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we don\u0027t need to. There is an ever-growing group of people who are opting to slow down, simplify, say no and focus on the things that are truly important. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m\u00a0Brooke and I\u0027m one of them. I also\u00a0truly believe we\u0027d all be happier if we focused on people and experiences, as opposed to status and stuff. I created The Slow Home Podcast to introduce the idea of slow living to a wider audience, and I\u0027m stoked to have you here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany people who listen to the show have expressed desire to support us via direct donation, as opposed to supporting the brands or companies who sometimes sponsor us. That\u0027s why I created this Patreon page - for listeners who love the\u00a0the show and want to support us by helping cover our costs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease know, there is no pressure or obligation here at all. If you want to continue just loving the show and spreading the word to your friends and family, that\u0027s wonderful too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for being here! xx\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen is the podcast released?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEarly every Monday and Thursday mornings (AEST - aka \u0027The Future\u0027). If you live in the States or Europe, it will hit your feed Wednesday afternoon/evening some time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat rewards are being offered?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have created a live video call that is recorded every month in addition to our two weekly shows. We know you haven\u0027t asked for this but have done this because:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. It\u0027s a way of thanking our loyal supporters\u003cbr\u003e2.

Again, I don\u0027t have any specific ideas about this right now, but if you have an idea that would be a good fit, please let me know via\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/brookemcalary\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBottom line?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis isn\u0027t a money grab!
