Now, in 2018, we\u0027re introducing our Patreon page as a way for you to get even more SNST goodness in your life. Ha. We gave a full rundown on\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soccernsweettea.com/soccer-n-sweet-tea-2-0-launch-ff29db5251d9\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewhat 2018 looks like for us over on the site\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor those that don\u0027t like clicking links that take you elsewhere, our staff of 20+ soccer fans from around the Carolinas wrote \u003cstrong\u003e445 stories\u003c/strong\u003e last year about our local teams, started three podcasts, recorded over \u003cstrong\u003e38 hours\u003c/strong\u003e worth of conversations, and gathered up \u003cstrong\u003eover 1,000 followers\u003c/strong\u003e on social media. There\u0027s an appetite for soccer coverage in North and South Carolina, and we\u0027re just getting warmed up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2018 promises to be even better as North Carolina FC joins Charlotte and Charleston in USL and the Courage try to make it back to the NWSL Final. Will we hear more about MLS expansion to our region? Will a Carolina PDL team repeat the Eagles\u0027 run to the national title? Will Greenville FC see the inaugural season success Asheville did? Who knows... but we\u0027ll be there to tell the story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor anyone that would like to \u003cstrong\u003esupport our work\u003c/strong\u003e, we have several different tiers of monthly pledges over on the right hand side of the page and rewards to go with those pledges. From $1 per month to $100 (who are you?), we hope there\u0027s an option for you. Thanks for considering us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever you choose, we\u0027re looking forward to another year as your \"locally-brewed source for Carolina soccer.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, thanks for the opportunity.\u003cbr\u003eJohnny Wakefield, Managing Editor of SNST\u003cbr\u003e"
