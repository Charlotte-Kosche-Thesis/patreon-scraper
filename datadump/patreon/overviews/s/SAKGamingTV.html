    "summary": "SAK Gaming is a grassroots competitive gaming company formed in 2015 in Tempe, Arizona. We focus primarily on hosting tournaments and creating content for Super Smash Bros. Melee, Project M, and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. Since 2015 we have grown from hosting monthly tournaments, to hosting weekly events, to owning and operating the SAK Gaming Lounge, a venue dedicated to competitive gaming located in Tempe at 1849 E. Baseline Road.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe decided to invest in the SAK Gaming Lounge because we were tired of haggling with venues over event dates, times, and prices. We wanted to create a place where people could come and play any time, as well as have a place that gave us total control over our event dates and schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the first two months of operation at our new venue we managed to break even on our expenses, but we hit a rough patch in November between the holidays and the majority of our player base having to deal with finals. Lower attendance at events as well as unexpected expenses such as a mishap with SRP that cost us $300 in a single day gave us a $1,400 loss in the month of November. While we do our best to have funds set aside for rougher months, we can\u0027t survive a loss like that again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in! We\u0027ve had so many people tell us that they love what we do and want to support us, but because of school, work, transportation, or location issues they can\u0027t make it out to our events. Now you can offer your support through Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar donated will go towards the more than $4,500 in overhead that we have to contend with each month. Anything above that will be used for pot bonuses, new equipment, flights for out of state players, and give away prizes for Patreon members!"
