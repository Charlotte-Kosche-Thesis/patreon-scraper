    "summary": "Hello, my name is Tara, but most people will know me as \u003ca href=\"http://shaami.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShaami\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e from DeviantART. ^_^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently creating a fan comic based on the manga/anime series Death Note. This is the biggest project I have ever taken on by myself and one that I have been fully dedicated to for quite some time now. Everything you see is written and drawn by me. Often it is a lengthy and challenging process, as I\u0027m doing everything by myself, but it\u0027s something I enjoy working on very much. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are already over 100 pages available to read\u00a0for free on my \u003ca href=\"http://shaami.deviantart.com/gallery/39006879/Death-Note-Doujinshi\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeviantART\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e account. The comic has always been free to read there and this is something I want to continue. My readers have been very supportive over the years--something I am very thankful for. Everyone\u0027s kind words have encouraged me to keep going and strive to do my absolute best with each new page. So, my comic will always be free to read on my DeviantART. That will never change. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, you might be wondering why I\u0027m here on Patreon. It\u0027s honestly something that I\u0027ve been thinking about for probably over a year now, so it\u0027s not a decision I\u0027ve made lightly. Working on my comic takes up a considerable amount of time. I\u0027m very conscious of that because I do rely on my art for income. I get that nagging feeling like I should be putting my time and energy into other things that help towards my living expenses. However, the last thing I want to do is stop telling the story I\u0027ve built up til now. I love my comic, but I think my readers may love it even more, and I don\u0027t want to let anyone down. That\u0027s why Patreon came to mind as an option. I think it might be the perfect solution to my dilemma and hopefully a good way to make everyone happy. After all, that is the main goal that I\u0027ve kept in mind. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy the work on my comic and would like to help support what I do, I would be so happy if you could offer me a pledge.\u003cbr\u003eI know not everyone is able to make a pledge and that is absolutely fine. If you want to, and you can afford it, I would be forever grateful for anything you are willing to give. But If you can\u0027t, that\u0027s okay, too. You don\u0027t have to do anything. I\u0027ve never taken the comments, Favourites, Watchers, or anything that I receive for granted. As far as I\u0027m concerned it is all greatly appreciated support that I am very happy for. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to support my comic in a more direct way, receive early access to new pages and some exclusive content then this is the place for you! =D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking a look. ^_^"
