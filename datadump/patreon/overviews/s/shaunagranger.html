I love my readers. Their support has taken me this far and saved me after I lost my job in 2011, but times are getting rough again, but I can\u0027t give up on my writing. When I go without writing I feel off, like I\u0027m on the verge of getting sick. Writing is my passion, telling fun, life-escaping stories is what I want my life to be. I want to give readers the books they\u0027ve come to love."

Five years ago, Shauna started work on her Elemental Series. She released the first installment, \u003cem\u003eEarth\u003c/em\u003e, on May 1, 2011 and has since released four sequels, with the series coming to an end with \u003cem\u003eSpirit\u003c/em\u003e. In 2013 she published the first in a paranormal Post-Apocalyptic trilogy, World of Ash, with the sequel releasing in July of 2014. She is currently hard at work on a new Urban Fantasy series, starring a spunky witch with a smush-faced cat named Artemis \u2013 the first book, Wytchcraft, is available on all retailers!",
