The methods that we use to transform our selves must be equal to or greater than the technologies that drive our world. Soullab embraces the best of ancient and modern ways to bring Soulful living to Life. Soullab offers a way to connect, share and transform, together. Throughout history, we have gathered in circles to connect, to share and to learn. We come together to share our unique insights, our passion to make change, and co-create ever new ways to navigate the personal and collective paths back to rich, Soulful living.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nWe hold space for a collective awakening.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nHow are we doing this? The solution is to create a platform that is organized around\u003cbr\u003e\nthe fundamental aspects of the human developmental\n\u003cbr\u003e\nexperience. \n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe ancient alchemist saw that the path to\n\u003cbr\u003e\npersonal development was the same for cultural and social\n\u003cbr\u003e\ndevelopment. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJust as in research methodology, there are\n\u003cbr\u003e\nprocesses that lead to the most generative outcome.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSoullab is based in a simple model that brings the 4 elements\n\u003cbr\u003e\nof our shared experiences (Mind, Body, Emotions and Spirit)\n\u003cbr\u003e\nand offers a meeting place for all to share around. In this\n\u003cbr\u003e\nmodel, all traditions, all belief-systems, all sciences and\n\u003cbr\u003e\ntechnologies (ancient and modern) may add something\n\u003cbr\u003e\nsubstantive to our understanding of these common areas of\n\u003cbr\u003e\nexperience and phases of development.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe result is many ways, many insights and many universal\n\u003cbr\u003e\npractices can be shared without creating more confusion,\n\u003cbr\u003e\nmore noise, or overwhelm due to the vast complexities and\n\u003cbr\u003e\ndifferences in the systems that gave birth to the wisdom\n\u003cbr\u003e\nshared.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn other words, all are welcomed to share, with their\n\u003cbr\u003e\ntraditions, systems and practices remaining in tact while the\n\u003cbr\u003e\nmost salient and relevant information, insight, wisdom and\n\u003cbr\u003e\npractices are offered within the collective fields of shared\n\u003cbr\u003e\nexperience.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor example, in the Element of Fire, a Tibetan Monk can\n\u003cbr\u003e\nshare wisdom about Tibetan Buddhism\u2019s understanding of\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInspiration, Intuition, Self-development, Personal Identity,\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCreativity, and Ritual.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe same remains true for a Taoist Master, a Yogi, a\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNeuroscientist, a psychotherapist, healer and all who have\n\u003cbr\u003e\nwisdom to share. They can share without fear of cultural\n\u003cbr\u003e\nappropriation, being co-opted, or being misunderstood\n\u003cbr\u003e\nwithin their broader systems.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eSoullab is destined to be an essential meeting place for\u003cbr\u003e\ngathering wisdom, sharing practices, and incubating new\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nways that are coming through the individual and the\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\ncollective endeavors to awaken and transform our world in\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nneed.\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nTo meet this task,\u003c/strong\u003e we have designed a concept that will\u003cbr\u003e\nhonor the demands of the alchemy of developmental\n\u003cbr\u003e\nprocess, the need for a common ground to share in, and a\n\u003cbr\u003e\nway to organize both the personal development process as\n\u003cbr\u003e\nwell as the collective agents of change.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nPhase One\u003c/strong\u003e is creating the fundamental Platform Online that\u003cbr\u003e\nwill Curate the Vast amount of Wisdom already available for\n\u003cbr\u003e\nmass distribution.
