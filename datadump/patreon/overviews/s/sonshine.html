    "summary": "Hey, there! I\u0027m Sonny, and welcome to my Patreon page! I thank you so very much if you have even clicked on this. What do I do? Good question. I\u0027m a little all over the place: I make visual and auditory art, mostly. It\u0027s pretty difficult to describe just exactly what my craft is, though, my preferred term for it is \"artsy hot mess\". I sing, write music, act, make podfics/podcasts, draw/paint, write aggressively long essays, and so, so much more! A better question might be why on Earth I would need a Patreon. Well, here\u0027s the thing: I\u0027m a high school student. It takes time to create content, and I often don\u0027t have that time. I have a goal of getting 200+ volunteer hours, being an Honours Student, and getting into a good university, and this is also accompanied by the fact that I need a job. I would never, ever, \u003cem\u003eever\u003c/em\u003e, want to stop creating, but there\u0027s a lot on my plate. Though I have little-to-no expectations for this Patreon, it\u0027s definitely good to know that it exists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny money that is gained from this page will go directly into creating more cool stuff! Money from this Patreon will go towards making sure I can keep up my podcasting habits, since everything from the time spent on scripts, recording, and editing, to the RSS feeds required all cost some serious money that I don\u0027t have. I\u0027m also saving up for a new laptop, since the one I currently do everything on is, without any exaggeration, seven years old, spontaneously shuts down, and needs to be plugged in at all times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCURRENT MAIN PROJECTS: \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike my podfics or podcasts in general? Well, I\u0027ve got some news for you! I\u0027ve got an original podcast, and a film coming soon! Inspirations for these include podcasts such as \u003cem\u003ears PARADOXICA, The Penumbra Podcast, The Orbiting Human Circus (of the Air)\u003c/em\u003e,and\u003cem\u003e Alice Isn\u0027t Dead\u003c/em\u003e, and films like \u003cem\u003eJuno\u003c/em\u003e, so if you like those, you might like this. As a creator who is under-represented in most media, my goal is to create entertaining content with diverse characters that you can connect with, accompanied by all the tropes and twists that you love!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE \u003cem\u003eOPHELIA YANG\u003c/em\u003e PODCAST\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDue to an adoration to mystery novels and a love-hate relationship with \u003cem\u003eThe Maltese Falcon\u003c/em\u003e, we bring you\u00a0 \u003cem\u003eOphelia Yang\u003c/em\u003e. I always wanted to see a cool female detective who wasn\u0027t either a cookie-cutter teen-aged girl (sorry, \u003cem\u003eNancy Drew\u003c/em\u003e, but there\u0027s only so much I can take) or a demure manic pixie dream girl. In the heart of New York City lurks Ophelia Yang, a detective and private investigator. Follow her adventures as she encounters murderers, mobsters, and a woman who very well may be the end of her lone-wolf status. We have a cast and team currently comprised of very few people, and all of us are high school students. It would be very much appreciated if we could get people to simply listen to our show.
