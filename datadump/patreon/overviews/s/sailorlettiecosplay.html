My name is Haley or known by the Internet as Sailor\u00a0Lettie (formerly Rage Kitten). I come from the United States and usually attend conventions around the west coast. I\u0027m a huge nerd and belong to many fandoms, usually of the anime or video game variety. I just really love the communities I\u0027m apart of because of it. \u00a0I\u0027m a widely known cosplayer, which means I create costumes to portray favorite characters from most video games and anime. All of my costumes are handmade and can range anywhere between $20-$300 depending on what the costume calls for.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px; text-align: center;\"\u003eHowever, cosplay has always been much more to me than just dressing up as my favorite anime characters.. its always been something I look forward to. \u00a0I always stay motivated to work on my projects because I know once I get out on the convention floor I no longer have to think about what to say. \u00a0I always let the costume I\u0027ve worked hard on for months do the talking. \u00a0Although I love conventions, I feel very accepted into the community and I love new meeting people who share the same interest as a socially awkward night owl like me.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(229, 185, 183);\"\u003eWhy am I on\u00a0Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason for me is mostly due to wanting to work with different materials and eventually have somewhat of a workshop? I\u0027ve always loved experimenting\u00a0with\u00a0different materials and techniques to create different\u00a0effects with my cosplays. In a way, I like to make costumes to be something to be awestruck by whether it be bad ass armor or extremely beautiful\u00a0looking flowy dress. I mean I can dream, right? haha well, either way, I\u0027d also like to eventually do more than just cosplay! I\u0027ve always been interested in try Twitch Streaming, Youtube, and making tutorials for other cosplayers as well. I hope that one day I can eventually have the time and money to do all these things!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(229, 185, 183);\"\u003eThanks for stopping by \u0026lt;3\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
