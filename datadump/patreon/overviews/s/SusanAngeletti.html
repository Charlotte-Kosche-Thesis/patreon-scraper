Woo hoo!! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 A little background for you... \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u00a0 I am a Singer, known for fiery and passionate, bluesy n soulful Vocals. I lead my own band called The Susan Angeletti Band. I write my own songs, plus co-write songs with other writers as well as interpret and rerecord my own versions of other artists songs.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 I\u00a0particularly have a fondness and love for\u00a0old school, kinda classic, funky, soul songs and killer blues and rock songs that really move me from the past n some new stuff. Think in the vein of Etta James, Howlin\u0027 Wolf,\u00a0The Stones, The Record Company,Johnny Winter ,T- Bone Walker, Aretha, Smokey n Jr Wells , Patti La Belle, Janis, Joss Stone,Aerosmith n Wilson Pickett, Prince n Tina Turner were havin a Soul/Rock n Roll Summit style Picnic in the backyard playin\u0027 music! Well that\u0027s a peak into my\u00a0kinda thing. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 So I am a singing and music making gal and am so happy to be launching my new artistic Home at PATREON with all of these super fabulous other Artists here on this wonderful platform that fosters creativity and connects Artists directly with their fans!!\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u00a0 Every since I can remember I have loved music, starting with Piano and Trumpet lessons as a child and then I\u00a0found my true love, singing and somewhere in my mid teens in one of my first gigging Bands at 16 years old I was bitten by the Blues n \u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003eR n B,Roots Rock\u00a0fever and it would never let me go!! I am so, so glad it didn\u0027t! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fast forward some years and several bands later and in 1998\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0I started playing out live very regularly with a terrific Rock n Blues n beyond guitarist John Sheldon and we were building a loyal following. I was out singing the blues and loving every moment of it. In that year of 1998 I recorded my debut CD, Independently released called Susan Angeletti, Next Year\u0027s Model Of The Blue\u0027s, produced by John Sheldon. (This CD was later remastered and re-released as: Susan Angeletti,The Things You Throw Away in 2005).\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0The debut CD: Next Year\u0027s Model\u00a0started to catch fire and it gaining momentum in airplay and quite unexpected consistent positive reviews. The combination of all this really helped launch my music singing career and it led our \u00a0Band on to\u00a0our first\u00a0ever National Tour with legendary Blues Guitarist Johnny Winter!!\u00a0That was such a thrill. We played the House of Blues in LA and Las Vegas the Fillmore West and many more amazing venues with Johnny and I got to witness first hand what a real heavy career and truly loyal blues fanbase Johnny Winter had built over many many years of touring and by putting out consistently really good music. Plus the more I watched Johnny and his band play hot blues every night live from the wings after our bands opening set I knew this was what I was going to do for the rest of my life,there was no turning back for me!! I am very very grateful to Johnny Winter for having us and taking me under his blues wing. Rest in peace Johnny.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0After the music tours with Johnny Winter things continued to progress from there to an amazing opening for B. B. KING which I have recorded live as a CD ( I will happily offer some of those live tracks as MP downloads as free rewards for becoming a Susan Angeletti Patron at the $5 Reward level).\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 One evening I had a chance to sing with Ian Anderson and his Solo Band live and there is a recording of the song that I wrote that we performed together. That song All Gassed Up is also included on the Susan Angeletti: Live, \"99 n a 1/2 Won\u0027t Do\"! from the B.B. King opening. \u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 Some of other folks we have opened for:Wilson Pickett, Tommy Castro,Duke Robillard,James Cotton,Dicky Betts,Shemekia Copeland,J. Geils Bluestime,Luther Guitar Jr. Johnson,Irma Thomas ,John Hammond Jr,James Montgomery n more.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 After the successful Tours with Johnny Winter the opportunity came for me to record a more polished CD in Nashville w a well known Roots Rock/Blues Producer n Drummer: Tom Hambridge,but it did not come cheap,lol. \u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\n \u00a0All of these recordings and touring experiences were wonderful but the thing is they all cost money, and the costs get higher as you keep working your way up in the ranks the more you continue on. Especially when you start getting to Nashville and big-time Engineers and Producers. The quality of the players and the production all goes way up,so you come out with very fine super sounding quality recordings and the level of excitement and all goes up :)It was a terrific experience recording my Susan Angeletti Bittersweet CD produced by Tom Hambridge in Nashville. The Bittersweet CD garnered alot of very favorable reviews and airplay. Tom Hambridge\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003ehas produced Cd\u0027s for Buddy Guy, George Thorogood, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Susan Tedeschi.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0I also teach Voice Lessons to supplement my Singing performance career and have for years and that is very rewarding. I was never afraid of hard work and still am not.\u00a0My struggle\u00a0has been and still is,\u00a0 not making\u00a0enough money steadily to survive from music because I was spending so much more n more money on recordings and bigger radio promotion campaigns and just not bringing enough in from live gigs and teaching to pay for it all.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\" Blessed with a Voice that burns like red hot coals,Susan\u0027s voice soars with a Mick meets Janis attitude!!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Art Tipaldi\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0\" Susan is a sterling Vocalist and a ballsy blues chick\"!!\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Ian Anderson( Jethro Tull)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 KEY THINGS I NEED TO DO:\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e1.Finish RECORDING MY SOUL Cd that I started 2 years ago.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThis will be my 6th CD Recording that I put out independently.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e2.Write new music:\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003ePlus: get the word out on all of the music. getting the new music out to all online channels, networking, gigging.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003eRelease and promote some of my previously recorded music out to a broader audience that many people have still not heard!\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0Making music or Art or running any kind of your own business is a 24/7 job! \u00a0I have sadly not been able to get back in the Recording Studio much at all on my diminishing budget in the last few years and continue to make the kind of quality well produced recordings that I need to when there is not enough cash flow and that has been a devastating blow to me and a loss for you the fans. \u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 This is where you my FRIENDS and AMAZING FANS can really make a difference in my life and help me start making wonderful new recordings for just the cost of a cup of a Coffee every month. PATREON \u00a0now comes along, this tremendous and amazing fundraising platform that allows an Artist and his or her audience and fans to be able to contribute money directly to an Artists Fundraising Campaign by a donation/pledge in any amount you choose that fits your budget comfortably \u00a0from donating only $1 to $3s to $5 n $20 etc. \u00a0either per month or per piece of content. Content in\u00a0my case being Recorded Songs and Videos! :)\u00a0\u00a0 \u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 What is Patreon you ask? Patreon is a Crowdfunding Platform for Creators! It is like a Kickstarter Campaign except for one very big difference and that is instead of getting one pledge/donation as you do on Kickstarter. On Patreon artists, musicians \u0026amp; creators are funded by Patrons who choose to give their financial support for an ongoing period of time to Artists , Musicians n Creators on Patreon! Pretty amazing right!?! As I said a Patron can pledge from a $1 to $3 dollars to $10, $25 or higher for an ongoing period of time to a creator of thier liking. Then we give the Patron Cool Rewards for being such a great Patron of our Art! :) The rewards vary depending on your Patron level,for example access to the Artists news feed,MP3 copies of brand new recorded songs sent to you Patrons earlier then the rest of the World!! Concert tix, live google chats, merchandise discounts, for some of the higher tired donations: Your NAME on the Credits a special birthday message to someone of your choosing.A Skype hangout session. You can even occasionally get rare copies of Susan Angeletti MP3s of unreleased live n studio material n more.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0You can change your pledge amount at anytime, whether it is up or down. I know what it is like to have financial ups and downs, and you can cancel at any time as well. We will always be cool. :)\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 I will always be here for you. If you need some Kleenex, a tall cold one, and a song to ease your pain.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 ***Or just maybe you need a hot live Blues Band to help celebrate that brand new Oceanfront Mansion you just bought somewhere in Paradise!! We can arrange that to!!\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhatever amount you are comfortable with it all helps,every dollar.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0My plan is to be recording 2 - 3 songs every 2 months and releasing them online. \u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Let me explain in more detail\u00a0about the recording n promotional costs n how it works.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 Paying and hiring a Studio that has great equipment, excellent experience and most importantly has a\u00a0very good Sound Engineer is the key and their time can add up. Paying the Engineer/Studio is the most expensive part of making recordings.\u00a0It varies but typically a sound engineer charges about $50\u0027s an hour to record you. Some more, some little less. So song by song, n it takes time, adding lead guitar parts, harmonies horns, redoing parts, redoing lead vocals, all of this is hourly on the clock\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 So you get the idea. All of your financial support goes to helping me make new recordings, paying the musicians, hiring the engineer. Making Videos.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 I am ready ready to go in to the Studio and sing my heart out and finish this Classic Soul n Blues recording that I started almost 2 years ago that I just couldn\u0027t afford to finish. I am here because I need your help, it truly takes a Village, an extended loving supportive family to do this, a Record Label so to speak, one that loves and adores me and knows me, and wants what is best for me.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 I have done alot on my own, I am stubborn and I never stop working. I \u00a0put out 5 CD\u0027s over the last 17 years, and went out and built a name for myself show by show. Yes I struggled a bit :), but I did not care and I have absolutely NO REGRETS!!\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0I would never take any of it back, or do it differently. I am in this music and my singing and my love of blues and soul music with both feet and hands and I will never Stop doing it until the day I die.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 I have had my dreams come true by having the amazing chance to share stages\u00a0with and\u00a0open for B. B. King, tour with blues legend Johnny Winter on 2 Coasts, and open for so many amazing musicians I have always loved and admired Soul legend Wilson Pickett and opening for him n seeing him in person up so close was heaven to me. ( 1 year before he passed. ) He was amazing in a Silver Suit!!\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 Money can never give you those kind of cherished moments. I have come to a place where I want and need to make my recordings the best they can be and put them out there with your help so I can be an even better Artist, be more creative, more inspired, and be even more productive.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWe can do this together!!!\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Making this Soul Classics CD recording has been a dream of mine for about 15 years and the time is now to keep working on it and get it out there.

I\u00a0am sooo excited about this recording. It includes a track that I love singing that Miss mighty Etta James recorded on her Seven Year Itch album called: Damn Your Eyes and and she is one of my hugest heroes and influences. So \u00a0I think you get the idea...This\u00a0 Soul recording features John Sheldon on guitar\u00a0on several tracks who is fabulous guitarist wo played guitar for Van Morrison at only 15 years old! John produced and played guitar on my very 1st CD! He is a very special soul.\u00a0It is great to reunite with him here. Been awhile.",
