    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://www.eldritchdark.com/files/galleries/of-cas/cas_sentinel.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClark Ashton Smith is one of three writers most associated with \u003cem\u003eWeird Tales\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0magazine, but unlike his friends H. P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard no full-length biography of him has yet to appear. Part of that is due to\u00a0the\u00a0 fact that very little actually happened in his life: he lived most of his life in the small town of Auburn, California, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas, and except for a brief excursion to nearby Nevada never left the state. Therefore any biography of\nSmith must of necessity address his \u003cem\u003einner\u003c/em\u003e\nlife. He spent his entire life caring for his parents, writing first poetry and then short stories, then experimenting with drawing and painting, before finally discovering a talent for carving macabre busts out of the minerals native to the region. Smith was one of those \u201cultra-romantic minds\u201d described by George Santayana, whose\nfascination with the infra-natural causes them to \u201cdetest to be caged even in\nan indefinite world, if there is any order in it.\u201d But during his life he created some memorable poetry as well as over a hundred tales of \u201cinconceivable fear and unimaginable love\u201d\u00a0 that were polished, ironic, and unabashedly macabre. These have won him a small but appreciative readership that has spread across the world to Finland, Japan, Turkey, Russia, Hungary, Poland, Germany, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Spain, and other countries.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Clark Ashton Smith is not a literary appendix to H. P. Lovecraft. From\nthe latter\u2019s first gushing letter to Smith in 1922\u2014a correspondence that\nLovecraft initiated after he was introduced to Smith\u2019s work during a visit to\nSamuel Loveman\u2014until his death in 1937, Smith was the only writer among his\ncircle of associates that Lovecraft considered to be his peer. Smith was\nalready well known in American and British literary circles long before he\nbegan to correspond with Lovecraft. Beginning with his first book of poetry, \u003cem\u003eThe Star-Treader and Other Poems \u003c/em\u003e(1912),\nSmith\u2019s work was widely reviewed in both West Coast and East Coast periodicals\nas well as in Great Britain. Smith was mentored by the poet George Sterling,\nwho was widely regarded as the leader of the San Francisco Bohemians. Smith\u2019s\nwork was read and praised by such figures as Ambrose Bierce, Jack London, Edwin\nMarkham, Arthur Machen, and Vachel Lindsay. The Book Club of California honored\nhim in 1918 by publishing a selection of his work as \u003cem\u003eOdes and Sonnets\u003c/em\u003e. Yet by the time that Smith published his second\nmajor collection, \u003cem\u003eEbony and Crystal:\nPoems in Verse and Prose\u003c/em\u003e in 1922, the type of poetry championed by Smith\nand Sterling had been eclipsed by the Modernist poesy of Harriet Monroe\u2019s \u003cem\u003ePoetry: A Magazine of Verse\u003c/em\u003e and Ezra\nPound\u2019s Imagists. Yet despite this history, and despite Smith\u2019s recent\ninclusion in the Penguin Classics (\u003cem\u003eThe\nDark Eidolon and Other Fantasies\u003c/em\u003e, 2014), there are a mere forty-seven entries\nfor Smith in the Modern Language Association Bibliography, of which all but a\nhandful were published in non-academic journals. Publication of a full\nbiography that discusses Smith\u2019s relationship both to literary modernism as\nwell as to the alternate literary modernism espoused by Lovecraft would be a\nsignificant step in rectifying this situation, just as interest in Smith\u2019s\nwritings has grown exponentially since his poetry and prose have been brought\nback into print in standard editions. As Smith himself noted in a letter to an\nunexpectedly positive reviewer, \u201cPoetry, particularly work like mine, which is\nso far removed from the everyday interest of the immense bulk of mankind,\nstands in little danger of being overestimated in these days. Therefore I am so\nmuch the more grateful for your appreciation, and desirous of thanking you for\nit.\u201d It is not expected that\nClark Ashton Smith will ever attain the popularity of his two literary\ncomrades, Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard, but to paraphrase his poem \u201cThe\nSorcerer Departs,\u201d we are sure that his volumes and his philtres shall abide.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I have been researching Smith\u0027s life since my first visit to Auburn in the 1970s, where I met such friends of his as Helen and Marion Sully, Robert B. Elder, Ethel Heiple, Violet Nelson Heyer, John Robinson, etc. Since then I\u00a0edited or co-edited twelve books by or about Smith, including\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Collected Fantasies of Clark Ashton Smith\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(five volumes, Night Shade Books); \u003cem\u003eSelected Letters of Clark Ashton Smith \u003c/em\u003e(Arkham House); \u003cem\u003eIn the Realms of Mystery and Wonder: Collected Prose Poems and Artwork of Clark Ashton Smith\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(Centipede Press); and\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Freedom of Fantastic Things: Selected Essays on Clark Ashton Smith\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(Hippocampus Press). I have been twice nominated for the International Horror Guild Award and am the receipient of the special Founder\u0027s Award of the H. P. Lovecraft Film Festival and CthulhuCon for my scholarship on Smith and other writers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pictures.abebooks.com/KATKEL/md/md17841460889.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Scott Connors has established himself as the leading authority on Smith,\u00a0\u00a0both in his co-editing of the Collected Fantasies and other volumes and in\u00a0his trenchant critical and biographical studies, which it is hoped will be\u00a0melded into a full-length biography.\" S. T. Joshi, author of \u003cem\u003eI Am Providence: The Life and Times of H. P. Lovecraft.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Mr. Connors ranks chief among those who have achieved solid work based upon the pioneering scholarship that I did on Ashton Smith during the 1950\u0027s and 1960\u0027s. Mr. Connors has already produced some ten books related to Ashton Smith and other figures active as writers during the first half and beyond of the 1900;s. These ten books rank high in quality and general accomplishment, as well as in pioneer status.\" Donald Sidney-Fryer, author of \u003cem\u003eThe Golden State Romantics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\"As a scholar myself, I never cease to be impressed by Scott\u2019s professionalism, meticulous approach, and astonishing command of the most recondite detail of Smith\u2019s literary milieu, works and life, which have provided a rich base for Scott\u2019s prolific output of articles, essays, introductions, and edited books.\" William A.

I\u0027ve completed most of my research (although there are still some things I\u0027d like to check out), and am in the process of actually putting my findings into at least a rough form. $1300 a month will allow me to keep a roof over my head and food on the table so that I write without too much stress making my occassional bouts with the black dog too severe.",
