This story is set in an alternate reality to our own, where humans and anthros co-exist, and it explores a vast future just under two hundred years from now. You can see a preview of the comic\u2019s setting here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/r5yh2goddvlaq4r/AADob6Omy8PCHC93TOba7B8Ea?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eExalt Introduction\u003c/a\u003e - The other project, Forever Falls is currently being produced by another artist on our team, Atherra and previews will be posted here as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the side we plan to work on various projects, ranging from SFW to NSFW, transformation sequences, mini-stories and the like. Some of this requires little effort and no resources, but not all of this is drawn up for people who can afford to dedicate their time freely, we work with members of our staff who need money to survive and thus we need to pay them for their services in order to get art done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe various NSFW content will be mainly posted to FurAffinity in this gallery, be warned as it is very adult:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/gallery/fireorca/folder/283056/SKS-Sponsored-Content \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSKS Sponsored Adult Gallery\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support SKS?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to supporting our livelihoods (helping us eat!), supplying us with funds to save for better equipment and to pay artists outside the group for the project\u2019s we are working on, this allows us to build up a base for bigger and better projects! But you may ask, what does this give YOU? First off the more we make the more content we can release for free, projects like Exalt will be free to read but a lot of the smaller items will be released on a digital shop on the side. The more we raise, the less money we actually need to make from side content. This means lower-priced (and eventually FREE!) products! It also means funds can possibly be allocated towards other special goodies from artists in and outside of the SKS team.\u003cbr\u003e-~-~-~-~-~-\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is partnered with the lovely artist Jaeh, please check out his Patreon and support him!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/JaehTheBird\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePatreon\u003c/a\u003e -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/jaeh/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFurAffinity\u003c/a\u003e -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://jaehthebird.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- ~ - ~ - ~ -\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKitsune Shukko - Jeremy Gillis -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/fireorca/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFurAffinity Account\u003c/a\u003e -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kitsuneshukko.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantART\u003c/a\u003e -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyKitsuneCorp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStudio Lead | Writer\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrincess Ishtar - Alia Goodall -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/princessishtarthered\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFurAffinity Account\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriter | Artist\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapterAquila92 - Liam Morgan -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://chapteraquila92.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantART\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eWriter | Military Consultant\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eZacs Brebac - Vincent Croteau -\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFinancial Management\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTokkinim\u00a0- Bradley Kim -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/tokkinim\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFurAffinity Account\u003c/a\u003e -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mimby-rabbit.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantART\u003c/a\u003e -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/tokkinim?ty=h\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePatreon\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArtist\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAtherra - Sonia\u00a0Cirea\u015f\u0103 -\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/atherra/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFurAffinity\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eArtist\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
