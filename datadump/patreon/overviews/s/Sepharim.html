    "summary": "Hey guys, Sepharim here. Since I was young I\u0027ve always enjoyed playing games socially to share the experiences, from NES to PC. With the advent of twitch, youtube, and other such services sharing moments has become easier then ever before. I tend to break down most games as I have a highly analytical mind and tend to prefer strategy games. What makes a game good, what makes it bad, what is questionable or subjective. These are questions I try to answer regularly while playing most games, although like anyone I am only human and I often struggle at being completely objective with my judgements. Honesty and/or not being just a \"persona\" or an actor is the single most important thing to me about streaming, honest genuine reactions are all you will find here. Will all of them be good, correct and 100% accurate reactions. No, but that\u0027s part of what interaction between people is about, sharing and reexamining differences of opinions about the same sorts of stimuli.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now that you know a small bit about me and why I\u0027m doing this (really a tiny amount) you might be questioning why you should be a patron of mine. Do you like the content, types, games, amount, and quality of stuff I produce? Do you want to see an improvement, or just want to support me because I provide you entertainment.\u00a0Maybe you want more say in what happens, what I play, what future youtube videos and twitch streams I create. If so this is the place to amplify your voice, though I\u0027ll listen to any constructive (and even most destructive) criticism anyone offers patrons of all amounts will have considerably more power to directly affect what I do. Not only that but you\u0027ll be supporting me in directly improving overall quality of the content, as well as adding new content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to everyone who read this intro, and to everyone who has supported me, past, present, and future. I could not even dream to attempt this without the valuable support you\u0027ve all offered.\u003cbr\u003e"
