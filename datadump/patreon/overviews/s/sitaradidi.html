    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello! \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m Lohla. \u003cbr\u003eI do a lot of things, but the one that everyone in my life will tell you I\u0027m hands-down, unmatched the best at is astrology. Reading charts? Interpreting events? Telling you about how you\u0027re feeling or what just happened to you without you saying a word? I\u0027m the one you\u0027re looking for. I\u0027ve been doing it casually for well over a decade, like since I was a kid. Then, in my teens, I accidentally invented zodiac memes. (I\u0027m sorry.) Then right after that, I realized I had so much more to bring to the world than memes, and astrology had so much more to bring to people\u0027s lives than memes, and I started writing about it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing about the stars has moved homes a lot over the past five years, but now it\u0027s settled down at \u003ca href=\"http://www.sitaradidi.com,\"\u003ehttp://www.sitaradidi.com,\u003c/a\u003e and here on Patreon. I\u0027ll be able to share articles with you that teach you about current transits going on in the stars and how I think they\u0027ll affect general dynamics in relationships and the world at large. These can be anything from outer planet movements, to general horoscopes, to short analyses on current events, pop culture and politics, to some quick astrology lessons and debunking. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy goal?\u003c/strong\u003e If enough people support my work and want to hear my insights, I\u0027ll be writing horoscopes regularly...and inching closer to my other 500 plans for this project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCool. I\u0027d love to support you. How much am I supposed to pay you? How does this work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a patron, you get to tell Patreon how much $ you want me to get \u003cem\u003eper creation\u003c/em\u003e I write. You can set a top number that Patreon won\u0027t go over per month, too. That way, you never get charged a sudden and weird amount because I was like really chatty that month or something.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of right now, I am working on educational series that I will release in bundles, so just set a per-creation amount that you\u0027d like to tip me or a monthly limit that you\u0027re comfortable with. \u003cstrong\u003eYou only ever get charged as long as I\u0027m producing work! \u003c/strong\u003eBy pledging, you\u0027ll also help me be able to devote my time and resources to writing horoscopes and other timely, personalized guides to what\u0027s going on in the stars right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs it really a big deal if I\u0027m a patron or not?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes and no. Even if you can\u0027t contribute right now, you should follow me anyway because a lot of my writing is going to be open to everyone, patron or not. However...patrons are going to get access to private posts, and other stuff that\u0027s coming soon to the rewards section. So think about trying out a pledge with a monthly max!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome more stuff on why I care about astrology so much, anyway\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince childhood, I\u0027ve felt a strange connection to the stars that quickly developed into a voracious (and lifelong) study of astrology. I was raised with a mix of cultural influences and systems of thought. My spiritual identity has shifted over and over throughout my life, from the Hinduism I was raised with through complicated atheisms and affairs with magic and energy in endless forms. Through all of those experiments of being, I never let go of astrology. I think that is because, despite its reputation as unscientific and wacky and out there, astrology is an extremely logical system. Some forms of divination or mysticism are all about intuition and unguided emotion (which is why they attract students with such varying intentions.) Astrology, as I\u0027ve known it, is very different. It is reliable and has rules and geometry and coherency. Through its limitations, however, it gives me a structure in which I feel comfortable allowing myself to be emotional and expressive. I think that\u0027s why I\u0027ve always loved it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0For me, it is not important to look to astrology for hard-cut and definite answers. I am not interested in approaching it by ascribing absolute causation to the observations it makes. Instead, I have found a number of useful aspects of it that make it extremely cherished to me as a practice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe the mere act of associating concepts and stories and qualities between faster-moving and more dynamic parts like people and events often helps me to synthesize what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not. I think the exercise of doing that helps me learn more about the world, and other people, and myself \u2014 by deeply reflecting on them and sorting through all the information in front of me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think reading charts as a teenager helped me to develop more empathy and understanding for others, because I learned to practice and acknowledge the respectful observance and validation of difference \u2014 difference in our beings, our experiences, and how we are shaped by the continual act of moving through the world and time. And at times, I have simply found astrology profoundly healing as a way of processing events and their emotions by giving me a space \u2014 outside of right here on Earth \u2014 to think and connect and problem-solve, as well as feel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see very often people describe astrology as a ruthless and rigid practice of \u201cis\u201d and \u201cis not\u201d that characterizes people and boxes up events. That is a grave misreading of the practice, and a defeatist way of understanding what it has to say. It is a way of thinking that I believe opens you up to possibilities and ways out (from yourself, your situations, everything about your world that makes you feel boxed in) that you wouldn\u2019t have seen before. I hope by learning more about astrology with me here, that you\u2019ll get to have some of these experiences too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m here (again, in case you missed it earlier)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing about astrology for years, but I have so many ideas and observations that I haven\u0027t found a good channel to express or teach without exhausting myself. I have plans upon plans for my project of bringing (better, more useful, less bullshit, but also kinder) astrology to the people who love it or are infatuated with it right now. Not only that, but I have tons of insights and pep talks to give you via horoscope (which I am now doing on a regular basis at \u003ca href=\"http://www.sitaradidi.com/)\"\u003ehttp://www.sitaradidi.com/\u003c/a\u003e!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you want to read more, learn more, see more, or just want to see where my work is going -- please support it here on Patreon! I\u0027d love it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and I will be providing my chart reading services again soon, but in the meantime if you\u0027d like one -- please support me here on Patreon! You\u0027ll bring me closer to having enough time to do charts, as my style is really thorough, in-depth, and ~crafted to order~ rather than spit out by a computer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
