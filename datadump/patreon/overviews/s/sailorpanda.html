I would love to be able to create for others and have the support of people who enjoy my work. Right now I am very focused on making sure I can meet all of my bills every month until I can find a new job, so I\u0027m doing whatever I can to keep money coming in. I want to create things you want to see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI illustrate in an anime/manga style, so that is what you can expect from me. I mostly work in copic markers for traditional work, though I am eager to test out watercolor. Digitally I use Clip Studio Paint and a Wacom Cintiq. Any work of art done for Patreon will not be available anywhere else for a few months. I would like to do a theme every month and would like to decide that on what you want to see. It might be a poll done through Twitter!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t wait to see what we will create together."
