We love video games and we love to talk about them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we started this show a couple years ago, there really wasn\u0027t a podcast for players like us. So we made one! We wanted something short, that fit into our lives as busy parents and professionals. We wanted something smart, that resembled the way culture--movies and books and theater and more--gets covered by the \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and NPR and the \u003cem\u003eNew Yorker\u003c/em\u003e. And we wanted something sophisticated, that didn\u0027t treat video games like a curiosity or a foreign country that you\u0027ve never visited.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom 2012 to early 2015, Chris was the main video game critic for \u003cem\u003eThe New York Times\u003c/em\u003e. He\u0027s also written about games for places like \u003cem\u003eWired\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eSlate\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eRolling Stone\u003c/em\u003e, the \u003cem\u003eWall Street Journal\u003c/em\u003e, and the \u003cem\u003eWashington Post\u003c/em\u003e. He\u0027s talked about video games on CBS, ESPN, and NPR. Yet JJ--a\u00a0former executive producer, Pentagon correspondent, and Baghdad bureau chief for NPR--somehow might play even more video games than Chris does.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you need my money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe are a completely independent podcast, with no funding from a journalistic outlet or podcast network. With your support, we\u0027ll be able to keep making the show, and to keep making it better. We\u0027ll be able to travel to shows like\u00a0the Game Developers Conference and E3, to redesign our website, to buy better equipment, and if there are enough of you, even to create a new kind of video game publication, modeled on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/matter/welcome-to-the-new-york-review-of-video-games-dad14c9d6c8d#.7nh0i4iol\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eNew York Review of Video Games\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e that Chris invented for Medium.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will bill our supporters once every four podcasts.

Yet we\u0027ll also never charge you more than 13 times a year, or once every four weeks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s the \"pay what you want\" model pioneered by Radiohead--except for video game podcasts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have thousands of listeners who tell us they love the show.
