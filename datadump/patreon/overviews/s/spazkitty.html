    "summary": "I\u0027ve been playing in bands since I was 14. I\u0027ve been creating music ever since! As I\u0027ve been blessed with the ability to have music as my career since 2001; I\u0027ve been granted the time to learn how to edit videos/ make my own videos lately. Plus exploring creating collages; mixing images I love together. And I\u0027ve also always been a writer, writing my own lyrics since age 18. I guess writing since I can remember. On my days \"off\" to get a break from music marketing, and survival, I paint. \u003cbr\u003eHere you will see some of my paintings, which I\u0027m very shy of as they are not really good. I only paint on printer paper. Just personal escapes. You\u0027ll get first views of the videos I\u0027ve been making. Because music videos take many many hours and days to complete; I try to supplement this page\u0027s content with collages I make. \u003cbr\u003eMy life is lucky to be centered around creating. Thank you for joining me on my artistic and spiritual journey that is the life of Adrian Conner!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I stop donating in the future if I can\u0027t afford it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes of course! You can cancel or adjust your pledge amount for any reason at any time. \u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "If i reach $1000.00 for just two months, I will be able to begin working on my next video for my next single \"Unspeakable\". This video will be different from the others in that I plan to hire two actors and an assistant director. I really love this song. And I have a certain idea for the video that I cannot create on my own\u00a0 without around a $2000 budget.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eI will share as much of the creative process as possible on here. With outtakes. And a look into the process of editing.\u00a0 I have my camera person/assistant director already on board. I just need to find the actors and have the budget. I will do all the editing. All previous videos you\u0027ve seen before that I have made, have been done on a $0-$300 budget. Meaning.. not more than $300 was spent. Pretty amazing. And I had some help from some very nice people. I didn\u0027t do these videos all alone. \u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u0027re interested to see what I can do with a little bit of a budget, and you love the new song Unspeakable.. .. help me reach this goal by either sharing and helping me get more patrons OR by doing a one time larger subscription reward tier. \u003cbr\u003eThanks guys!\u003cbr\u003e",
