    "summary": "Hi, my\nname is Dave and I am a motorcycle enthusiast in the Tampa Bay Area. I am looking to connect with other riders in the area, and other amateur MC mechanics in the area. Right now I run a free rescue service for broken down on the side of the road motorcycle riders. I have a truck and ramps and will go get anyone in the area whether they donate or not, because it sucks to be in that position and have no one to come get you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy\ntarget market are ladies and gentlemen who ride motorcycles, in the\nTampa Bay Area, who would like a place to converge, meet up, hang\nout, chill, escape, work on their bikes, maintain their bikes, and\norganize and execute group rides.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you are like me you are at\nleast suspicious, and at most outraged, about how you have been\ntreated by some of the local shops. If a member has a mechanical\nissue we can\u2019t collectively figure out, maybe we take some of these\nfunds and hire a MC mechanic we trust to come do a workshop on that\nparticular issue. I know a guy, maybe you know a better one. I want\nto create a group where motorcycle riders can congregate,\nshare stories, tips, and help each other avoid some of the pitfalls\ninvolved in riding, maintaining, repairing, and customizing\nmotorcycles in the Tampa Bay Area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually I would like to take the funds generated and rent or buy a location where we can meet up, share tools and knowledge, and share all things motorcycles in the Tampa Bay Area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, if a group like this sounds cool to you, please donate to the cause. The truck needs maintenance, and gas, and every little bit helps. Keep this number handy, 727-243-3108, because if you need me I will come get you whether you donate or not.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
