I write\nbooks, novellas, and short stories \u2013 erotic fantasy, erotic science\nfiction, steamy urban fantasy, YA fantasy, and so much more. I am\nalso a freelance copy editor, RPG game designer, and Illustrator \u2013\nwhich occupies most of my time, unfortunately. The rest of my time is\ntaken up caring for my hetero life-mate and my pets (which at times\nfeel like the same thing) \u2013 a dog, three cats, and a snake who is\nnow longer than me by several inches. That lack of time to write is\nmy primary purpose for starting this Patreon account.\u003cbr\u003e\nLast year (2017),\nI wrote and released two novellas and started two more novels and\nthen I ran out of time \u2013 and by started I mean fully outlined and\nseveral chapters written \u2013 one urban fantasy (well-steamed) and one\nYA fantasy novel (un-steamed). This made me sad (a sad Sirren is a\npitiful thing no one should ever be subjected to, it\u0027s seriously not\npretty). The purpose, then, of this Patreon is to take some of the\npressure off my freelance work for income and thereby free up my time\nto pursue writing instead. The better the Patreon goes, the more I\nwrite \u2013 and, presumably, the more I can write, the better the\nPatreon will become for Patrons. It\u0027s a feedback loop \u2013 like really\ngood sex, actually.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFiction and\nartwork, and my undying affection and gratitude of course.\u003cbr\u003e\nLike the wealthy\naristocrats of old, your patronage will allow me to create art - both\nwritten and drawn (is it still called \u0027drawn\u0027 if half the work is\ndone on a computer?). This will mostly come in the form of PDFs and\nKindle files (the Kindle reader app is seriously free on Amazon, I\nhighly recommend you go get it \u2013 it works on any device from\nDesktops to smart-phones), though at higher levels of patronage I\u0027ll\nbe in the position to mail hard-copies of many things. Unfortunately,\nhard-copies require serious loot to acquire, and mailing even more so\n\u2013 so the offer has to be limited to those higher levels.\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso at higher\nlevels you will start to be able to be part of the process, gaining\nvoting rights that will guide my writing and producing choices in the\nfuture. You will be able to make requests for specific characters,\ntypes of storylines, and other features that will \u2013 in effect \u2013\ntailor what I write to YOUR tastes. I will be your genie \u2013 you\u0027ll\nbe able to rub my tummy and make a wish and see it come true (HEY! I\nsaid rub my TUMMY, move that hand now!).\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons will\nreceive digital copies of all of the work made possible by this\nPatreon, plus additional rewards at various backer and milestone\nlevels. There\u0027s a possibility that some of those short stories will\nreappear elsewhere, such as future anthologies as reprints, or (in\nthe case of preview chapters) as part of a completed novel or\nnovella. But you Patrons will get to read and enjoy them long before\nanyone else.\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m aiming to\nproduce at least one thing a month for the foreseeable future, giving\nyou twelve new stories of varying lengths each year and giving me a\nsome room to turn writing from a wistful dream (wistful Sirren is\nmuch prettier than sad Sirren) into a full-fledged, bills-paying\nreality. Plus you\u0027ll be helping me buy pet food \u2013 have you SEEN\nthose prices?\u003cbr\u003e\nReal talk for a\nsecond \u2013 what I want more than anything else is to produce fiction\nand art that entertains people and offers a brief escape from the\nmadness of the world. If I can give someone that feeling of being\nswept away into another world for a little while, then I feel I\u0027ve\nbeen successful. Thank you so much for supporting this effort, and I\nhope I am giving you a passport to unlimited adventures!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOh, and \u2013 final\nnote \u2013 my first name is more or less pronounced exactly the same as\nthe last name of that equally ginger pop singer Ed, just FYI.\u003c/div\u003e"
