So why\n not follow an ordinary middle aged guy who finally goes and lives the \ndream. After 30 years in the ad biz \u2013 and some 30 years of \nmarriage, three kids then three grand-kids \u2013 Sailor Alex is born, and \nhe\u2019s going to live his dream of sailing into the sunset and take viewers\n with him on his journey. From making the decision, finding a boat, \nowning it, learning to sail and living on it. And finally discovering \nthe world on a 1981, 40 ft. sailboat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy \u003cem\u003eWinded Voyage\u003c/em\u003e is dedicated to all of you loyal \nsupporters of creative independence. Those of you whom exercise their \nright in getting the content they choose. I\u0027m with you, as I\u0027m a Patron myself and choose my entertainment on-line rather then on TV. (OK, I admit I do watch series and deal with those annoying pop-ups). I\u0027d rather support the independent rather than commercialism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not all fun \u0026amp; games to be living and sailing on a yacht. I\u0027ve traded my comfy Swiss apartment with living in a space the size of my kitchen. I burn my eyes \nediting video and spend hard cash for boat equipment. I can guarantee that I\u0027ll be working for your money! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy idea is to offer entertaining and \ninformational content completely and undeniably independent. FREE! I\u0027m not charging for my \u003cem\u003eWinded Voyage\u003c/em\u003e, just asking for help. It may be \ncrap or it may be genius. It\u0027ll be up to you to like or dislike. There \nwill be plenty of adventures to come, all produced without any commercial or editorial restrictions thanks to your help.\u003cbr\u003e"

From \nthen on I became an American, attending a public elementary school and consuming Saturday morning \ncartoons. I also learned that it was frowned upon to have a friend of another color when I\n brought home my new classmate who happened to be black. At the age of eleven, I did not \nunderstand racism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past 35 years, I raised three boys, been in love, married, and worked as a creative in advertising. Today I\u0027m free of kids, marriage and advertising, and been working as an independent film maker for a few clients and special projects. I\u0027ve saved just enough money to buy my boat Galopin and begin my \"Winded Voyage\", a living adventure series. In this context, I will bring stories to life in video and pictures fully independent and in free thinking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a writer, one-stop-movie-maker,\nphotographer \u0026amp; sailor.
