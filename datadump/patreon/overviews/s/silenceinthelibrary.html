     "about": "\u003cbr\u003eFounded in 2011 by a group of authors, Silence in the Library, LLC was established with the goal of creating an environment that allows authors, artists, editors, and other publishing professionals to work collaboratively to showcase their work. Our model keeps the creative decisions, throughout the publishing process, as close to the actual \u003cem\u003ecreators\u003c/em\u003e (i.e. authors and artists) as possible. Authors are deeply involved in their projects from start to finish. By closely controlling the quality of inputs to the process, we ensure a high level of quality in the final product while allowing space for imagination to flourish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of our goals is to prove that there is no \u201cstandard\u201d face to a protagonist or an author of speculative fiction. Talent and strength know no race, sex, or other artificial boundary. Our projects, in particular our anthologies, strive to reflect this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eAthena\u2019s Daughters\u003c/em\u003e anthology (and its sister volumes) were conceived, developed, and driven by women. The books have one unifying theme: all of the protagonists are women, and they exhibit a wide range of physical attributes, ages, abilities, ethnicities, and orientations.\u003cbr\u003eFor \u003cem\u003eHEROES!\u003c/em\u003e, a collection of stories about superheroes, we focused on diversity with respect to gender, ethnicity, age, body type, and life experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe consider representation a priority\u2014all readers should be able to find someone like themselves in the books they read. We hope to contribute towards this goal by continuing to offer our customers a diverse selection of authors and characters.\u003cbr\u003e",
