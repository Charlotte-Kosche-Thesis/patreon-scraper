We believe that everyone who plays tabletop games is a game designer and every game you play has been modified.  We talk about all of the different ways to make games work in new, interesting ways and write some brand new games in the process!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProtean City Comics\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAre you seeking thrilling tales of Adventure and Super-Heroics?\u003cbr\u003eDo you crave the weekly drama of Teenage Hijinks and High School Angst?\u003cbr\u003eProtean City Comics is a weekly actual-play podcast run in the Masks: A New Generation system.

All the initial setup of equipment and software was paid out of pocket. We launched the Patreon to attempt to raise money to cover the recurring fees and free up some finances to explore new podcast options. We were almost immediately able to increase our hosting quality to release better sounding episodes. After blowing past our starting goals we were able to get better equipment and even launch a second podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are really excited to look at ways in which we can produce even more content. It\u0027s been so amazing meeting you wonderful listeners and we want to keep on getting better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThank You For Your Support\u003c/h2\u003eWe appreciate every kind of support our listeners give us and want to just thank you ahead of time. Thank you for helping us make Stop, Hack, \u0026amp; Roll be everything it can be.  And as you are shuffling pledges between Patreons and Kickstarters, Indie Go-Gos and Backerkits, never forget to Stop. Hack. And Roll.\u003cbr\u003e"
