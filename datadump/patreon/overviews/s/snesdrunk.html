    "summary": "Hi there. No, I\u0027m not charging for videos, I\u0027m going to keep posting two videos a week regardless if anyone donates at all. I will keep doing what I\u0027ve been doing since 2013 no matter what, because I like doing this. I\u0027ve had a few people ask me about a Patreon, and since Youtube is discontinuing fan funding, I thought I\u0027d set this up. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem is I don\u0027t have much to offer in terms or rewards. I guess I could\u003cstrong\u003e get really drunk \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003econtinue my Super Ghouls n\u0027 Ghosts LP videos\u003c/strong\u003e but with other SNES games, and make those available only to Patreon members. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow about this: I usually plan 4-6 weeks ahead, but if you sign up for at least $1, \u003cstrong\u003eyou can make a request\u003c/strong\u003e. I haven\u0027t really thought this through so I\u0027m not sure if that means it would be 1 request per month or what, but uh, you can get at least one request and I\u0027ll make sure I\u0027ll do a video on that game, provided it\u0027s something I have the means to play and capture footage. (For example, I wouldn\u0027t be able to do a Super Scope 6 video because I don\u0027t have one and I don\u0027t own a TV it would work on, PSX stuff can be difficult, modern games are near impossible for me to get footage for if it\u0027s not at least on Steam, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegarding the goals on the left over there, I figure the natural way to expand this channel (besides doing more than 2 videos a week, which really isn\u0027t possible since I have a separate full time job) would be to stream stuff on Twitch and just hang out. The thing is, I\u0027m stuck with DSL, that\u0027s the best I can do out here unless I sell my soul to Comcast and I just don\u0027t have the means to do that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway that\u0027s all. I can\u0027t think of any more rewards or whatever, if you have any ideas let me know. Have a good rest of your day. \u003cbr\u003e"
