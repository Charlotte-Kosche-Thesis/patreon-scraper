Though\nshe did her very best to raise me, her first born, according to her tradition, her\npeople, made it abundantly clear that I am not one of them. Which is somewhat\nproblematic, since according to most Indigenous traditions--and old slave\ncodes--a child follows the status of its mother.  Furthermore, as per the \u2018One Drop Rule,\u201d\nwhich is still legally in effect, and as long as we live in a thoroughly racialized white supremacist\nsociety, I am not, and will never be white\u2014not that it ever appealed to me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m not Black enough to be proud\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo Black to be Red\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd even though my mother is a white girl\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI know for certain,\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\u2019s NOT what I am.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank Goodness, I\u2019ve was blessed with other\n\"mothers\" in my life; strong women of color, beginning with my\nfather\u2019s Mohawk aunties, who saw me, claimed me, and recognized my need for the\nkind of nurturing, only other Black and/or Indian women can provide. For their\nlove, guidance and acceptance, I am eternally grateful. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy father publicly identified as Black or Negro,\nwhile he was actually Virginia Saponi, New York Mohawk, Black, and part Euro\nAmerican, like so many tri-racial Indigenous folks with roots from the southeastern\nUS. My parents didn\u2019t stay\ntogether, but he made sure my brother and I knew who we were.  His mother, my paternal grandmother, was raised on what used to be a\nslave breeding plantation, in Patrick county, in\nthe Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. \u00a0Apparently, her mother, my great grandmother, was offered a house and 60 acres\nto work for the Rucker family, as a midwife.  When the slave breeding business ended, the family left her with the property. \u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.visitpatrickcounty.org/\"\u003ehttp://www.visitpatrickcounty.org/\u003c/a\u003e  Note that the county seat is on Rucker Street,\nin Stuart Virginia, named after its most favored son, the Civil War General Jeb\nStuart.  Note also, that Patrick County\nis on the Virginia /North Carolina border, along Rt 58, which goes through the\nheart of Saponi land, also known as Blackfoot, Eastern Siouan\u00a0ancestral territory.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNeedless to say, my grandmother, who was born in the late\n1890s and curiously carried the name, Rucker, couldn\u2019t get away fast enough.  She married a Mohawk man, and moved to\nPennsylvania, where my father was born. Dad\u0027s paternal grandmother was Mohawk. Her husband, my great grandfather, was described to me only as, \u201ca Southern gentleman\u201d\nnamed Smith, whom I have reason to suspect, may also have been of the\nsoutheastern Siouan people. \u00a0My\ngrandfather was one of seven boys. He had seven sisters, making a total of\nfourteen children.  By today\u2019s standards,\nit was a very large extended family.  So\nwhen my grandmother left her husband, she left her baby boy with his Mohawk grandmother,\nand went to work as a costume designer and seamstress.  Grandpa worked in the construction trades,\nlike many Mohawk men, as a diesel mechanic.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen my parents were married\nin the early 1950s, dad was 18 years older than my mother. He had already been\nin Show Business as a Song-N-Dance man at the famous Cotton Club in Harlem, and\nhad traveled the world in the Entertainment Corps during World War II.  When they met, dad was working for the New\nYork City Youth Board as a \u201cSocial Worker\u201d and Mom had just graduated from\nMount Holyoke with a degree in Philosophy. Because miscegenation (interracial\nmarriage) was still illegal in many states, and socially unacceptable in all\nthe rest, the only place they could safely live together was Harlem. Which is\nhow my brother and I came to be born and raised mostly in Manhattan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMysticism came naturally to me, as did the arts. Living\nin this world, not so much. I think the various ancestral legacies and gifts\nbestowed on me, combined with the Quakerism I learned from my mother, the\nartistic sensibility I inherited from my father, and the rebellion I \u00a0must have acquired\nfrom both my parents, created something Quakers like to call, spirit led\nactivism.\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve\nalways been outspoken. Not just to hear myself speak, but to say what feels like it needs to be said, as I am led,\nby my ancestors, as part of my spirit-led activism. Quakers call it,\n\"speaking truth to power.\" Yet I have learned from hard experience,\nthat in today\u2019s white supremacist, competitive, commodified, \"time is\nmoney\" world, I am often perceived as challenging, and sometimes\nthreatening. I have learned that it is one thing to be a white truth teller,\nand yet another to speak the unvarnished truth as a person of color\u2014even among\nFriends. Let\u0027s just say, my experience has afforded me a unique perspective. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYet, I feel the weight of ancestral responsibility more as I\nget older. It is a ministry I am well suited for as a rare birthright Friend\n(Quaker) of color.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
