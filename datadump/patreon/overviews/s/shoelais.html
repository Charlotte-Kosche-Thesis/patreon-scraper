    "summary": "My name is Kara Love, and I write things!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kinds of things?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAll kinds of things. Think pieces, reviews, comics, personal essays, short fiction, poetry, songs - \u00a0I\u0027ve been writing for as long as I can remember and as such, I\u0027ve come to appreciate and touch on many different forms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a young girl with unsupervised internet access and little interest in going outside, fanfic and online roleplaying games were a big factor in shaping my adolescence. I developed Tripod and Angelfire website specifically to house pages and pages of my original characters\u0027 backstories, side stories, and family lineage. It was... intense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I wasn\u0027t obsessively thinking about my OCs, I was consistently submitting to creative writing and essay competitions through school. Sometimes I won. Sometimes I did not. The one thing I always had was the sense of accomplishment from putting something I made out into the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first paid assignments began in my early 20\u0027s, in the form of articles for local entertainment magazines and small geek-centric websites. They were fun, they paid, and I learned a lot from them. However, it was early 2016 when I made the decision to pursue writing as more than a hobby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2016? That was last year!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re right, and congratulations on your understanding of the Gregorian calendar. You are obviously a very intelligent - and dare I say attractive? - person. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast year, I was given the opportunity to write a couple short side stories in the back of an on-going comic book series. They were well received, and after seeing my work available in the world for others to enjoy, I was hooked. Since then, I have participated in two comic anthologies, self-published a short one-off, edited a children\u0027s book, and have worked on many pitches.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCool. So why are you here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGlad you asked, fictional conversation partner. You see, I love the work I do, but the pay is inconsistent. Months can go by before I see payment from publishers or have completed books to sell. And honestly...? I just really want to tell stories. Sometimes I have a story whirling around in my head for months, with no perfect place to release it. Well, Patreon can be that place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting my Patreon, you will gain access to both works in progress and finished products that may not be available anywhere else. There will be updates for projects I\u0027m working on, behind-the-scenes looks at how I take passing thoughts and turn them into stories, and potentially other benefits that I just haven\u0027t thought of yet!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus, of course, you will have my undying love. I cannot thank you, the people who have supported my work and goals, enough. But I will try.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!"
