Everyone here at Signal Horizon has a full time job on top of their contributions to Signal Horizon.\u00a0 As teachers we have little expendable income as it is.\u00a0 Join us and help pay for our theatre visits, film festival entries and participation at other conferences, and even basic hosting and domain fees.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0"
