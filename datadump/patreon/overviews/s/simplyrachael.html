    "summary": "Hey there! Thanks so much for visiting! I\u0027m Rachael, artist of Simply Rachael. It has always been my lifelong dream to make a living with my art, but I have been told by pretty much everyone that it\u0027s impossible. According to most, there will always be a \"real\" job and art can only ever be my hobby. Well I hope to prove them wrong. More than anything, I want to look back on my life and know that I did something worthwhile - that I made a difference - that my life had real meaning. So I created a business where my talent can shine and hopefully one day change the world (even if it\u0027s only a little bit).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/HhIWSaS.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI have always had a passion for animals and they have been very prevalent in my art from the beginning. For a long time I wondered how, as an artist, I could make a career when my biggest focus was animals. In a world where you could walk into any store and pick up a plastic toy animal, how could I make my very simple approach to animal sculptures different? It took a long time, but I found my answer in the form of a baby black rhino.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/MyfS7YH.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRhinos are one of the most endangered animals on the planet, but since they are neither furry or adorable (to most), they are not at the forefront of animal fundraising campaigns. So I had the idea to create an adorable little rhino who could be the ambassador for the real rhinos and bring awareness to the struggles they face in the wild. But why stop there? There are so many animals in desperate need of our help, quite a few of the less cuddly variety. For this reason, it has become my goal to give those animals a voice.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NVByjvp.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith every endangered animal sculpture sold, I will donate 10% of the total price to animal based charities around the world, such as Save the Rhino and the ASPCA. It is my hope that one day this business can be my dream job - the one where I never actually work a day because I love every minute of it. So if this is a message and an ideal you support, I would love to offer you inside looks, helpful tips, and even exclusive items in return for your patronage. And any and all funds accrued will translate to adorable animal creations and much needed donations for animals everywhere. Many thanks in advance for your interest and consideration. And from the bottom of my heart, thank you for helping my dreams come true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor more information on my art or to visit my store, check out my website:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://simplyrachael.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSimply Rachael\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThanks so much for visiting!!!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
