I also want to explore my creativity in terms of video editing and voiceover work. What that leads me to is working on honing my skills in the things I\u0027ve always done in my spare time for fun. I would rather find ways to monetize what I love to do rather than waste away at a job i\u0027m not invested in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI just want to say ahead of time, thank you.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eTo everyone who watches my videos (as awful as they are), thank you. And thank you to anyone that even considers donating through Patreon. From this point forward I\u0027m starting a path toward a much happier and better life for myself, Jayn, Shinji (our puppy), and Clair (our kitty). So thank you for helping me chase my dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe last thing I want to say.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to let everyone know that I\u0027m open to suggestions for Patron-only posts and rewards. If you have something you would like to see, whether it be behind the scenes things, explanations of my processes, unreleased old songs, or just extra new songs, let me know.\u003cbr\u003e"
