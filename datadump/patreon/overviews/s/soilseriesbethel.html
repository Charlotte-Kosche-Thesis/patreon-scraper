Below is a brief description of our project and what we need from you in order to keep running our free art programming for the residents of Bethel, OH.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is \u003cem\u003eSOIL SERIES\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSOIL SERIES: A Social Drawing\u003c/em\u003e is a collaborative work of art and an ongoing conversation between artists Francesca Fiore and Hillary Wagner, poet Matthew Kosinski, and the rural Appalachian community of Bethel, OH. A dynamic set of relationships between artists, community members, agricultural producers, local organizations, academics, and policy-makers, \u003cem\u003eSOIL SERIES\u003c/em\u003e is a drawing in the most expansive sense. As it creates the conditions for new conversations and relationships within the community and without, each new connection becomes a dynamic line in a relational web. This relational web, or \u003ca href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsoilseriesbethel.wordpress.com%2Fabout-2%2F%23social%2520drawing\u0026amp;h=ATNzqwoUvVWPkUJgGakeaSbo20qmmjbHVlsb3khj8Q8iQBj1SNo_Y3Q_V_TiYrIUiKm-SDxaK-rqc3pzepJvAvBV66hRbqvBvtTd0xNIsnu0kS75O0G2tmW0\"\u003esocial drawing\u003c/a\u003e, is the generative engine for community-initiated social change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe began \u003cem\u003eSOIL SERIES\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0in June of 2017 after receiving our graduate degrees in fine arts from Parsons The New School for Design. As the presidential election in the fall of 2016 caused tensions to flare across the country, we began an ongoing dialogue\u00a0which illuminated points of intersection and departure between our disparate lived experiences: Francesca as the descendent of Italian immigrants in the New York metropolitan area, and Hillary as the descendent of generational Clermont County farmers. These conversations proved especially valuable against the backdrop of national tumult, and we found common ground in our shared belief in art\u2019s capacity to promote empathy and engender new possibilities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn particular, we became interested in how we might use thoughtful artistic practice to engage Hillary\u0027s hometown of Bethel, OH, which is experiencing a staggering opioid epidemic, widespread food insecurity, and the erosion of cultural and economic opportunity.\u00a0We were especially concerned about an emergency operating levy on the ballot for Bethel\u2019s local school district. Finding itself in an precarious financial situation, the Bethel-Tate district was forced to confront the possibility of deep budget cuts if the increase in tax funding was not passed. The proposed cuts threatened arts programming, gifted education, and student transportation, among other services. Although the levy ultimately passed by a narrow margin of 28 votes, the stopgap measure is only expected to sustain the district until 2022. Remembering the obstacles she had faced as a curious and creative child growing up in Bethel, Hillary was heartsick for her community, and ever since our efforts have focused on how to provide cultural and intellectual nourishment to the residents of Bethel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommunity Studio\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soilseriesbethel.com/art/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCommunity Studio\u003c/a\u003e is a free public art program we developed in partnership\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://empoweryouth.me/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEmpower Youth\u003c/a\u003e, a local non-profit organization dedicated to partnering with children\u00a0\u201cin hopes of instilling in them the confidence and resources needed to break through the chains of generational poverty.\u201d Since 2015 Empower Youth\u0027s food bags and mentorship programming have provided vital resources for Bethel\u0027s at-risk youth, and our Community Studio Program now extends the organization\u0027s mission to include new pathways to cultural resources as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur arrival in Bethel coincided with Empower Youth\u0027s acquisition of a 15-acre former horse ranch.\u00a0In April of 2017, a local bank, \u003ca href=\"https://www.bankwith-csb.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCommunity Savings\u003c/a\u003e, gifted Empower Youth the foreclosed property, and The Empower Youth Ranch (or EY Ranch) has since become home to the organization\u0027s operations and an active community hub. When we arrived in Bethel in June, Empower Youth\u0027s directors, Lori and Scott Conley, generously offered us space in one of the property\u0027s barns for our proposed programming. Over the course of the next month and a half and with the help of Empower Youth\u0027s network of hard-working volunteers and interns, we created the \u003ca href=\"https://soilseriesbethel.wordpress.com/2017/07/21/introducing-the-barn-studio/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBarn Studio\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0The images below show the amazing transformation:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://soilseriesbethel.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/befunky-collage2-e1503790485623.jpg?w=1140\u0026amp;h=370\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Barn Studio, now the site of our Community Studio Program, is a safe space for exploring new ideas in the heart of Bethel.

Become a patron of a Community Studio artist!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAlthough we received generous in-kind contributions from friends and supporters during the renovation of the Barn Studio and the first session of the Community Studio Program, much of the funding for the project thus far has come out of our own pockets. We were happy to provide the initial funding to kickstart the project, but we now need a sustainable funding strategy that matches our commitment to long-term change in Bethel. As we gear up for the next session of Community Studio, which will run from June to August of 2018 and will culminate in another public exhibition, we are looking for a group of generous individuals to become patrons of our incredible artists so that we may offer them the best possible experience. A small monthly contribution on your part will go a long way toward providing our artists the resources they need. Below are images from Community Studio 2017.
