We have a new online platform that\u2019s \u003cstrong\u003eall about you, our community of patrons and artists\u003c/strong\u003e. There are 31,102 verses in the Bible, and we are going to work together to illuminate every one over the next twelve years with a new work of art, music, theatre, poetry, dance, or film.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way you will experience the Bible like never before: you\u2019ll hear a verse come to life in ways you never would have imagined, and watch incredible artists wrestle with Scripture right in front of you\u2026 \u003cstrong\u003eall of this, thousands of times over.\u003c/strong\u003e This is a truly one-of-a-kind, giant, never-been-done-before project, and \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u2019re going to make it happen! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSign up here as a patron at \u003ca href=\"http://patreon.com/SparkandEchoarts\"\u003ePatreon.com/SparkandEchoarts\u003c/a\u003e.

You can also use your sparks to give a boost to a work in progress. Let an artist know that you like their concept for a work and help them shape their work along the way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatrons, you really are the fuel that makes this project go. We\u0027ve done the math: A full house of patrons will allow us all to \u003cstrong\u003eilluminate the entire Bible in twelve years\u003c/strong\u003e with thousands of stunning works of art, from artists in every US state and every country around the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSounds fun, right?\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSign up on Patreon today!\u003c/strong\u003e Oh, and before we go\u2026 here\u0027s a little more about our mission and our artists! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nSpark and Echo Arts is creating a new work of art, music, theatre, poetry, dance, or film in response to every verse of the Bible. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis project was founded in 2010 on the question, what if we asked today\u2019s most innovative creators to pick a passage in the Bible and respond to it however they like? What would they uncover? How would the process impact them? How would the work move through their artistic community?\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince then \u003cstrong\u003ewe\u2019ve commissioned hundreds of artists from diverse backgrounds\u2013religious, secular, across cultures, and around the world\u003c/strong\u003e. These artists have illuminated over three thousand verses through gorgeous dance films, beautiful sculpture, quirky music, and THE best art you\u0027ll ever find about a genealogy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlong the way we\u0027ve built this \u003cstrong\u003efunky community of artists and art lovers\u003c/strong\u003e, Bible fans and people who might not otherwise be interested in the Bible. Now we want to bring everybody together to help Spark and Echo Arts really take off, and the site Patreon is where that is going to happen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon is a platform that unites creators and their audience, helping you personally support the ongoing work of projects you love. Instead of a big one-off crowd funding campaign, Patreon lets you support steady work, and in return become a key part of making that work happen. For long-term non-profits like us this is ideal, because we are regularly creating new work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs more of you sign on, together we can reach new goals like releasing an illuminated Bible app, or starting a workshop for major collaborative works on Scripture. And someday, we will have every verse of the Bible illuminated, with this wild collection of art, and in a very direct way you will have made that happen. Thanks friends and patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTry it out, sign up. We\u2019ll see you on Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e"
