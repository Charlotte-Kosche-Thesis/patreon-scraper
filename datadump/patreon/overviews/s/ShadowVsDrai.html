Well, becoming a patron is super-easy and comes with heaps of perks and rewards! These include things like song downloads, project files, shoutouts in future videos and much more as time goes on!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can set a monthly limit (even just $1) and cancel patronage at any time, so if there\u0027s a specific reward you\u0027d like you pledge just once for that reward and cancel whenever you\u0027re ready!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI upload new videos a few times a month, with plans to increase that to weekly, and this page doesn\u0027t include second channel videos or small production videos.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am honestly so so grateful to my patrons who allow me to add another dimension to my videos, both professionally and creatively! This allows me to fund ideas and make videos I wouldn\u0027t be able to do otherwise!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you!!!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\n~ ShadowVsDrai\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
