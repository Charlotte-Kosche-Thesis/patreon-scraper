Nice to speak to ya.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just an artist trying to get her start in a career in just creating things. Ever since I was young I\u0027ve always wanted to make my own characters and worlds through art just like the other creators who put their work out there. For a while now, I\u0027ve been making small animations and things all in between it. I also occasionally mess around with game making and occasionally make little tunes every now and again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLately though, times have been hard. I haven\u0027t been able to have the drive or funds to realize my dream and many of my ideas still have yet to really be developed. I started College recently, and along with some major family drama that wounded up with me and my sister living in a small studio, trying to get enough to stably move so we can rescue our brother from being stuck in a group home..... I could use as much help as I can get. ouo;;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping that my time using Patreon will both allow me to create what I\u0027ve been wanting to for ages as a career while supporting the little family I got.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI seriously appreciate any and all pledges\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.ko-fi.com/A728L0D\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e(and also ko-fi donations.
