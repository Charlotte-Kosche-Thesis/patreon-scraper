We have a responsibility to not only deliver top-notch community news each week, but we also have a responsibility to survive and to prosper so that St. Marys may continue to have a viable and consistent news source for the next 100+ years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe get suggestions from our readers all the time that we should charge a fee for the newspaper, so that the fees would create a new income stream for us to help create even better content.\u00a0 We want to maximize the readership of our paper so to give our advertisers the greatest possible exposure. So we never want to make reading our paper contingent on paying a fee.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHowever, we do understand that people see the value in our paper and that they WANT to pledge their support to help. We have created this Patreon page for that purpose.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are truly touched by the amazing support that we have in St. Marys and surrounding areas like Thorndale, Stratford, Lakeside, Granton, Kirkton, St. Pauls, Sebringville and around the world. Thanks so much for any support that you give our newspaper.\u00a0 It truly does make a difference as we strive to continually improve our service to you."
