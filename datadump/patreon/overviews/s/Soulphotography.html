     "about": "Hey there! I am an urban photographer from Belgium that takes great pride in capturing the true spirit and personality abandoned places and models that I photograph. After the birth of my daughter in 2007 I discovered my passion for photography. Passion is something that can only comes from within and it\u0027s one of the most important things that I bring to every photoshoot. \u003cbr\u003eAs a passionate hobbyist I pay everything myself (diesel, highwaytaxes, etc). Next to many likes I don\u2019t get real support pity enough after presenting so many pictures for free.    Premium photobooks \u0026amp; Urban Art wallprints are for sale in limited series. From 1/1/2018 you can make a (small) donation by Patreon to cover our costs, this would be much appreciated!  Also to support us in 2018 for our future trips, if there is some real support we will visit more stunning locations in Italy, France, Germany and Eastern Europe. In my next 3rd book all names of everyone that supported by Patreon will be published!\u003cbr\u003eUrbex photography is my escape to daily life, it\u0027s the complete opposite of what commercial mainstream photographers are doing, it\u2019s artistic, adventurous, teamwork, storytelling, exciting and each trip is a surprise, sometimes we travel into real time capsules.  Abandoned places expose a dark, dramatic atmosphere with a certain mood of sadness and isolation. The emptiness and silence never fail to generate haunting visions from the past.\u003cbr\u003eSeeing the images makes the viewer wonder what once was and what happened. Abandoned locations are taken over by nature which claims back it\u0027s place and represent a forgotten era in our fast moving society. Most buildings were an expression of utopia in their time and are clever pieces of architecture. Now, they are decayed and forgotten, past meets future... \u003cbr\u003e",
