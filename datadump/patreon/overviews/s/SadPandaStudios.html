Simply, it\u0027s like a tip jar. Any money made on Patreon goes towards funding game/studio specific goals, such as recruiting more art talent or outsourcing animation, etc. It all goes back into the games we\u0027re making so they can be even better!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://sadpandastudios.com/images/patreonBanner3.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy number one goal is to continue updating Crush Crush and developing other games under Sad Panda Studios. Patreon payments help us achieve all the awesome stuff we\u2019d like to do with our games. That can be animations, higher quality art, voice work, spinoffs, prints and figures, etc. I\u2019m the only artist working on our games currently, so I try to spend all my time in the evenings/after work doing this stuff and it is a ton of work I\u2019m doing for free in hopes that people will enjoy the game and fall in love with the characters I design :) \u00a0Any funding raised here would go towards hiring more artists to help me out.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://sadpandastudios.com/images/patreonBanner4.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI will be active on Patreon making sure that all of my concepts, process, lineart, color, and final art makes its way here before going in the game.
