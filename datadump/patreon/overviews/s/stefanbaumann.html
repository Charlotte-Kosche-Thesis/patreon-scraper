It\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003eNICE TO SEE YOU\u003c/strong\u003e here! I hope you\u0027ll like what I have to offer you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you already made yourself familiar with my musical work, you know that I\u0027ve been making music for my whole life. It started with the passion for the piano, then I begann to sing. At the age of 17 I built my own little music studio where I recorded, edited and mixed my first projects. Now, I\u0027m basically still doing the exact same thing. Certainly with much more experience and on a high quality level. But making music for a living is hard. That\u0027s why I decided to start using patreon and see for myself, if crowd funding concepts are the future of todays artists. Are you willing to help me? Great! Let\u0027s start an adventure together! Your companionship is much appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can you expect when becoming a patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eArtists have the need to live out their creativity. They want to create. They need to create. It\u0027s in their nature. So if you give them the means to realize their ideas, they will not hesitate. As a patron you will be giving me a chance to create and that\u0027s all I want to do. I have so many ideas and projects waiting to be realized. With your generous help I can finally do that. By supporting me you\u0027ll get access to exclussive content and depending on the amount you\u0027d like to donate, you\u0027ll get different rewards. Even if those rewards can\u0027t meet the generosity of your donation, you have my gratitude and I will give my best to create cool, new and inspiring music for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my goal?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNow that we are in the starting phase, it\u0027s all about building up my fanbase. Let\u0027s see, if we can reach 100 donors untill the end of 2018. In order to release one music video per month, we\u0027ll need to raise up to 500 dollars monthly. Untill we make it to our first milestone I will be releasing my second studio album and a bunch of simple music videos. For the future I can imagine to create additional content, such as tutorials, teachings and talks. But let\u0027s save that for another milestone...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat else can you do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you like what I do, why don\u0027t tell someone you know about my music...? Or you can like my facebook page, subscribe to my youtube channels, follow me on instagram or promote my music in any other way. Every effort is much appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to become a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo become a patron just click on your favorite reward button on the right side. The program will guide you through the process. You can change the amount of money you\u0027d like to donate easily. \u00a0Please have in mind, that you\u0027d sign up for a monthly donation. Your donation will automatically be transferred each month. If you\u0027d like to cease payment, you can do this at any time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s it. That\u0027s the plan. Are you with me? It would be great!\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to read this and if you decided to become a patron I can only say THANK YOU SO MUCH! I\u0027m looking forward to our new journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to see you soon! By.\u003c/div\u003e"
