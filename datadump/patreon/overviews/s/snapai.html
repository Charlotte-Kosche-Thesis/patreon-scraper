    "summary": "Hi folks, some of you know me as Adrian, and some of you know me as \nSnapai, and some of you I guess might not know me at all but then how \ndid you find your way here? o.o Anyways, hi! I\u0027m an animator, working to\n make the world a little more fun and interesting. I\u0027ve worked for \nFacebook game companies and TV shows, but I want to make my own stuff too, whether that\u0027s fan art of stuff I love, spec art for groups I think I could benefit, weird crossovers, or original content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve gotten a lot of love from you all in the past, for both my \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAcKM90WPlM\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efinished\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsFQn6_YH18\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eunfinished\u003c/a\u003e projects. And while commissions and freelance gigs help pay the bills, I\u0027d love to spend more time making the original content you enjoy, and now with Patreon\u0027s help, have a chance to support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m asking for support per-month, rather than for any particular finished work. I tried per-shot before on here, and it pretty much prevented me from posting anything. I was worried about things \"Well this could be for a client\" or \"This is just a WIP\" or \"This is fan-art, can I really claim this for Patreon?\" or \"This could be used to make an animation but it\u0027s not an animation itself\". But I\u0027m pretty sure you all like my work regardless, so I\u0027ve switched my Patreon to monthly, so I can just create a ton of work, and share it all with you without worrying about which bits are \"worth it\" and which should go elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m only asking for a dollar - Patreon\u0027s minimum donation - for my sole patron tier. You can actually put in whatever you like, but I\u0027d rather keep this about whether my work is worth supporting, rather than about how much it\u0027s worth. And if someday I hit $2000/month, how cool would it be if that was because nearly 2000 people thought my work was worth it? :D I\u0027ll likely be tweeting and otherwise posting WIPs, but major releases will be available here a couple days before being made public on other sites (using unlisted Youtube links and the like).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyways, if you can spare a dollar, I\u0027d love to have you, and anyone else you know who likes animations, particularly of the sort of characters that have tails. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
