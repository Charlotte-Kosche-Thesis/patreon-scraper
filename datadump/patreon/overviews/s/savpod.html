    "summary": "I am an award-winning audio producer. \u00a0And I believe in deep listening. \u00a0I love talking\u00a0with people who are creative and passionate. \u00a0I love talking with people who are either working for or represent change in some way. \u00a0I also go to interesting lectures. \u00a0You can learn a lot more when you sit and listen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSavannah Podcast is a multimedia storytelling enterprise that puts my beliefs and loves into forms that people can enjoy and share in a variety of ways. \u00a0You can listen to them as a podcast. \u00a0They\u0027re mobile. \u00a0They\u0027re on your computer or smartphone at anytime of the day or night.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can listen to them as a radio show on Fridays at 2pm on WHCJ 90.3 FM (Savannah State University). \u00a0Or just read them as stories. \u00a0It\u0027s up to you. \u00a0But all of this takes time. \u00a0And time is money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where Patreon comes in. \u00a0Patreon is a way of supporting creative people. \u00a0It\u0027s like Kickstarter. \u00a0Except it\u0027s not a big campaign for a single project. \u00a0This is small, ongoing support for small, ongoing works. \u00a0So it\u0027s perfect for podcasts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou only pay when I create. \u00a0And you only pay as much as you say it\u0027s worth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eRight now I intend to produce about four per month. \u00a0I would love to produce more. \u00a0But right now I have to take higher-paying work to meet my financial needs. \u00a0Your support will help me balance my time in favor of what you want me to do -- tell stories about our creative, passionate and changing community.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will charge you monthly based on the amount that you set and the number of podcasts that I produce. \u00a0So if you set the value at $3 and I produce 4 podcasts, Patreon will charge you $12. \u00a0If you set the value at $5 and I produce 3 podcasts, Patreon will charge you $15 dollars. \u00a0Et cetera.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport levels start at just $1 per podcast! And if you\u0027re worried about me producing too many of them, you can set a monthly maximum so you never go over your budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eRight now I also produce podcasts for a few organizations\u00a0(currently Telfair Museums and Ossabaw Island Foundation) that pay me to record their lectures. \u00a0I believe in these organizations and want you to hear their fascinating talks. \u00a0I never will ask you to pay for these audio productions. \u00a0You only pay for \"listener-supported\" podcasts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for coming to my Patreon page. \u00a0I hope that you will conclude that my work is worthy of your support. \u00a0I am telling stories that no one else is telling. \u00a0And I am telling them in ways -- in depth, in conversation, broadly focused and broadcast quality -- that no one else is telling them. \u00a0Your support will help this continue in Savannah. \u00a0Thanks again.\u003cbr\u003e"
