    "summary": "I have spent almost every waking moment over the past few years attempting\nto turn my Facebook page into an ever - expanding, online museum of images, visual\ndelights, oddities and wonders drawn from every conceivable culture, era and corner\nof the globe. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo far, my ongoing attempt at creating the ultimate virtual \u2018Cabinet\nof Curiosities\u2019 has attracted more than 170,000 Facebook followers and friends worldwide,\nspanning every age group and continent. \u003cbr\u003eAt the moment my Facebook page attracts\nbetween 5-10,000 new followers every month and increasing, (if occasionally\nunwelcome), international media attention.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRummaging and foraging around in some of the murkier, more remote\ncorners of the internet in an endless search for the\nmost beautiful, arcane and startling images I can find, whilst also attempting to\ndeal with the many hundreds of messages, comments and questions I receive on a\nweekly basis, has basically become a full-time job. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nObviously, such a time-consuming endeavour has also taken a considerable\ntoll on resources , employment prospects and finances and so I find myself here\nseeking funding to enable me to simultaneously devote far more time to Facebook\nand to branch\nout into other areas and activities in the near future, such as books , online publishing,\nstationery, exhibitions, events, even tours (if the demand is there). \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am working on a couple of\nquite ambitious book and stationery projects and proposals at the moment and\nadditional, regular funding would help ensure that these, together with other plans,\nwill see the light of day sooner rather than later. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor any kind souls who would\nlike to make a contribution I plan to offer various rewards and incentives, including\nexclusive content and patron-only posts and albums , visual essays, Question\nand Answer sessions, Special Requests (within reason!), event invitations,\ndedications and , in the future, limited\nedition prints , books and stationery . \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for your kind attention and thanks in advance to\nanyone who is able or inclined to help my ongoing attempt to create a visual\nantidote to these dark, dispiriting and difficult times. All and any contributions\nwould be most gratefully received. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nStephen xxx \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere now follows a representative selection of some of the\nmany endorsements and plaudits I have received via Facebook. (A representative selection of some of the hate-mail,\ndeath-threats, brickbats , abuse, correspondence from stalkers, scam-merchants, con-men and con-women and offers of non-existent or\nnon-paying jobs I also receive will also\nbe made available on request in\ndue course) : \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018If I\nwere home-schooling a kid, I think I could build a whole curriculum around your\nFacebook posts. I don\u0027t know where you find all this cool stuff, but I sure\nappreciate the time \u0026amp; effort you put into sharing it with us\u2019.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018Stephen\u0027s Facebook page is\nincredible. I get to see pictures, paintings and photos that I would never have\na chance to see. Will his page stop me from going to an art gallery? Absolutely\nnot. I enjoy the experience of both. Please continue Stephen\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018Stephen\nis just the beginning of something altogether new. The old mausoleums of art\nare slowly disintegrating. How boring can the paintings of the \"famous\nstars\" be? Stephen has shows us a vast panorama of our accomplishment as\nhuman beings. It change our attitudes, our dreams reach over every border. The\nold concept of \"art\" is maybe struggling to its end.\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018You\ncan sneer at Facebook all you want. But if you aren\u0027t on Facebook you can\u0027t see\nthe posts of Stephen Ellcock\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018Everyone\nshould be following \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stephen.ellcock\"\u003eStephen Ellcock\u003c/a\u003e on Facebook.

He\nis the High Priest of Social Media Curation and deserves a permanent spot at\nthe Met. His news feed is a highlight on Facebook and represents the very best\nthat FB and social media can be. Inspiring, educational, culturally on point\nand just all together AWESOME. This is one thing you will not regret.....\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018Stephen\nis great.

I have a pretty exciting life but can\nhonestly say it would be way more dull without him.\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018You are the best social and\ncultural historian, Stephen, thank you so much\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018There is no Facebook for me without this Man\u2019!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018I\u0027ve thought of ditching\nFacebook so many times, but then I remember Mr Ellcock and how rancid life\nwould be without this stream of beauty.\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018Everyone\nshould be following \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stephen.ellcock\"\u003eStephen Ellcock\u003c/a\u003e on Facebook.

Your posts raise the bar of what Facebook\ncan be each and every day\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018The community of love and support Stephen has is\nincredible. It illustrates the best of this new world at play.\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018A constant, glowing beam of light shooting through the mundanity of Facebook.\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018With all the shit that goes on in the world...there is\nthis beauty and light and hope coming from one person that is able to see and\nto find it and showing it to us, spreading out to so many people of all\nnationalities..and it\u0027s all about art and from art ..art from all times and all\ncultures.\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018Stephen makes the world magical again\u2019 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018..The greatest teacher I\u0027ve ever had\u2026\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018My favorite professor, proclaimer, protagonist\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018Stephen.. you make the world a better place.\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018Stephen\nEllcock should be celebrated as someone who has used Facebook in a unique way\nthat has inspired tens of thousands of users.\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018The greatest online curator of them all\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018 A dandy\nin the weightless world xx\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018The\nbest art history teacher in the world!\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018Stephen\nis the eighth wonder of the world\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018(Stephen\u2019s)erudite, stunning posts bring magic, an\nextraordinarily curated museum accessible to all \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018I personally do not believe that Stephen Ellcock is the singular human\ndescribed here. I have actual proof that he is indeed a small tribe of pygmy\naesthetes roaming the free computers in libraries across the globe,\ndisseminating visual propaganda with the sole purpose of destroying the mundane\nstatus quo of boredom in 21st Century society. For this Wiki of unknown origin\nI am forever grateful.\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2018Stephen should be\nstreamed and displayed across billboards on traffic jammed highways and\ncongested subways across the globe. It would change humanity for the better.\u2019"
