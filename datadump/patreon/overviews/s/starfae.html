I live in South Florida, with my boyfriend, several roommates, a handful of dogs and cats, and a tarantula. I have been painting since November 2015. My other hobbies include playing the ukulele, seeking out live music as often as possible, camping, and playing video games. Painting is something relative new in my life, but it has completely taken a hold of me! Most of my inspiration is drawn from the cosmos, nature, and music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eAs stated by Patreon, \"Patreon is a way to pay your favorite creators for making the stuff you love.\" Patreon has successfully removed all the barriers between artists and the folks who enjoy their art. It creates an environment where users can become involved in the creative process and connect directly with artists. In this way, artists are able to be supported by a community of admirers, and those admirers are rewarded with free stuff, access to additional content, and more free stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s In It For You?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eSO MANY COOL THINGS! Depending on your level of commitment, you could be finding in your mail boxes anything from cool handmade postcards, especially written just for you, to one of a kind, custom hand made pieces that you help me create!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
