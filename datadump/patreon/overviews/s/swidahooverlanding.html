You can donate \nas low as $1.00 per video that I upload to YouTube. You can set your limit to \nwhatever amount you like. So if I should upload 5 videos in one month and your monthly set\nlimit is $3.00 you will only donate $3.00. \u003cstrong\u003eYou can cancel at any time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou, my valuable friends, are what will help me drive this channel and make more content available on my YouTube channel.
