    "summary": "Welcome! We\u0027re excited that you found our Patreon page and hope that you join our community of fellow patrons who enjoy LARPs that are both fun \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0challenge cultural norms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat is \u201cSideReal Sanctuaries\u201d?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nSideReal Sanctuaries (SRS) is a LARP setting that examines social and political issues through the lens of urban fantasy tropes\u003c/strong\u003e. Before jumping further, let\u2019s break that down:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nLARP is short for \u201cLive Action Role-Playing\u201d.\u003c/strong\u003e It is make-believe for adults where we provide the setting and you create a character that explores the world and interacts with others. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nImmersion determines how much your gaming experiences engages your physical senses.\u003c/strong\u003e Some LARPS require minimal costuming and props, with success in actions determined by a neutral activity such as drawing cards or rock-paper-scissors\u2026 and that\u2019s okay! We encourage our participants to put in a little extra effort in costuming, props, and decorations. The intention is that by encouraging everyone to pitch in what they can, we are creating a better gaming experience for all. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nModern Urban Fantasy sets the tone of what players can expect in the setting. \u003c/strong\u003eThe world of SideReal Sanctuaries is set in the modern times, minus some elements of technology. The fantasy element is that the supernatural stuff also exists. There are vampires, shapeshifters, fairies, mages, and other creatures of myth. Magic is also part of this fictional universe. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat is SideReal Sanctuaries about?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nSideReal Sanctuaries encourages participants to examine concepts of community and various social and political issues through the lens of urban fantasy tropes. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn the world of SideReal Sanctuaries, \n\u003cstrong\u003ethe Internet and most forms of long-distance data transfer broke down\u003c/strong\u003e in August 2017 (around the time of the North American solar eclipse), and the technology has yet to be recovered. In addition, most electronic devices go through periods of malfunction or have ceased working completely. \u003cstrong\u003eT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehe gaps between the \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave nots\u201d have widened\u003c/strong\u003e, as the elite and government institutions are among the few who possess reliable technology. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe game is set around the year 2028 (ten years from the present day). What happened in the 10 years since the lost of the Internet? \u003cstrong\u003eS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eocial progress slowed to a crawl\u003c/strong\u003e (and in some cases has gone backwards) because those who mainstream society has deemed as \u201cnot normal\u201d have lost their key tools for advocating for change. \u003cstrong\u003eThe world (at least the Western world) became a lot more insular and tribal\u003c/strong\u003e as individuals focused more on their personal survival and the well-being of those who were most similar to them. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnother theme that participants can examine within SideReal Sanctuaries is how \n\u003cstrong\u003emedia and historical narratives are shaped by those in power\u003c/strong\u003e. One element that participants learn early-on is that magic and supernatural beings exist and have worked alongside humanity. Those who thought they had mankind\u2019s best interests at heart hunted down the supernatural beings and hid their stories in myth and superstition. \u003cstrong\u003eCharacters who are skilled at research will have the opportunity to try and uncover information about past events, untainted by biased narratives. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is for LARPers to utilize SideReal Sanctuaries as a way to \u003cstrong\u003euse the power of play to encourage individuals to examine current cultural issues\u003c/strong\u003e. Whichever group you identify with, we welcome you to joining us through this journey of creating a new game.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWho are we?\u003c/h4\u003e\nSideReal Sanctuaries is the co-creation of Jessica Karels and Jason \u201cJei\u201d Kobett\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nJason Kobett \u003c/strong\u003e(\u201cJei\u201d for short) has over 15 years of experience with a variety of live action role-playing games.  He also has 30+ years of experience with historical-fantasy interactive entertainment (aka \u201cRenaissance Festival\u201d).  Jei has experience with building organized, safer geek communities. As a volunteer for CONvergence (a science fiction and fantasy convention) he developed and facilitated a workshop to train their operations team on how to respond to incidents of member harassment.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nJessica Karels \n\u003c/strong\u003ehas over 15 years of experience in developing and supporting gaming communities. She held a number of global administrative positions across multiple LARP organizations. Jessica also writes about the importance of community-building in creating healthy LARPS, and has written for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://keepontheheathlands.com/author/jessica/\"\u003eKeep on the Heathlands\u003c/a\u003e as well as in the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/213624/Minds-Eye-Theatre-Immersion-Secrets\"\u003eMind\u0027s Eye Theatre: Immersion Secrets\u003c/a\u003e anthology. She uses her code-geek skills to make web applications to streamline the administrative side of networked games. There is no truth to the rumor that she\u2019s really a dragon in human form, even though she has a hoard of shiny things and gamer books.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhy are we doing a Patreon, and what can you get out of it?\u003c/h4\u003e\nOne of our goals is to provide our community with concept \n\u003cstrong\u003eart that showcases characters of a variety of ethnicities, genders, and body types, and levels of ability\u003c/strong\u003e. There are a lot of talented artists out there who we would like to partner with, and \u003cstrong\u003ewe want to offer more than \u201cwork for exposure\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPublishing a gaming system can be expensive once you get attorneys involved (business documents, contracts, and guidance on how not to get sued). Attorneys are among those who do not \u201cwork for exposure\u201d, and thus we need to have money to pay for their services. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWe would like to be paid for our work.\u003c/strong\u003e One of our setbacks so far has been the need to work full time in order to pay the bills. If this Patreon is successful enough, we will have the financial means to focus on being creative. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nMost importantly, we want to share the progress with you\u003c/strong\u003e so that you can see the system and setting and provide feedback during the development phase. There are a variety of backer rewards where you can get a sneak peek into what we are working on or give input on what you would like to see us focus on next.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhere can we find out more?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eWebsite: siderealsanctuaries.com\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFacebook: facebook.com/siderealsanctuarieslarp\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e"
