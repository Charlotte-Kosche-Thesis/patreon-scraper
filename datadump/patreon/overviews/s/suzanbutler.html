Most likely...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://notyourmomsromance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/patreon_whoami.jpg\"\u003eHi there! I\u0027m Suzan, and I write under the name\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://suzanbutler.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eS.M. Butler\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m a New York Times and USA Today bestselling author who writes military romance and romantic suspense. I used to write contemporary sports romance, but it didn\u0027t do well, so I had to stop. Turns out I like blowing stuff up in my books. Who knew?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://notyourmomsromance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/patreon_whypatreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI currently work as an overnight manager for a gas station. I work for an amazing company that I love, but even that can\u0027t make up for the amount of suckitude that job has. I\u0027d like to not have to do that anymore. Plus, I want to write and create more, and that pesky Day Job gets in the way.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat said, the more selfish reason here is that I really wanted to write the stories I will post here, and they aren\u0027t set well for retailers because of their length mainly or the way it\u0027s set up as a story. Patreon is my way to give myself permission to work on these stories.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://notyourmomsromance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/patreon_whatdoyouget.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFiction. As much of it as I can afford to write. So the more that this page earns, the more time I can spend writing the things.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMost of it will be virtual. From time to time, I may do a milestone goal of a physical product for the higher tiers, but I really suck at going to the post office, so those will be few and far between.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, by supporting this Patreon, you will be allowing me to write stories that otherwise would not have been written for (in some cases) years. The bulk of this project is currently\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.notyourmomsromance.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe Section Five serial\u003c/a\u003e, which is a doomed serial that my mailing list received a couple years ago, that I just couldn\u0027t continue because of deadlines and time restrictions and a load of other crap.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://notyourmomsromance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/patreon_thankyou.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMembers of this Patreon will get access to every story I post here. While these stories may find their way into other projects, you guys will get to enjoy these stories long before anyone else does. They\u0027ll be Patreon originals, if you will.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope to be posting new fiction at least twice a month here. I\u0027m not sure if both posts will be the serial or just one. I don\u0027t know yet. it could be something new. I\u0027m keeping that open, and hopefully it will give me a little breathing room.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
