I\u0027m primarily a digital artist, but I would live to get my hands onto more traditional mediums someday. I\u0027m trying to get myself back into creating and posting artwork because I \u003cem\u003eDESPERATELY\u003c/em\u003e miss the feeling of bringing joy to the ones I create art for. Hearing the happiness in their comments or voices makes me one heck of a proud mama hen. :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever I now work an 8-10 hour job and I\u0027m barely getting by on what they pay, especially when I have to drive an hour to it every day. Because of this and working a full time job straight out of college, my motivation for almost three years has been crumbling away to nothing. All I have done is focus on getting by to pay for food, cell phone, gas especially, college loans, and many other bills. Also, my boyfriend and I are talking more about wanting to live together, but until I get my finances in order it might be a while until I can move in with him. He is my rock and my greatest love, someone who supports me in whatever I do, and right now he\u0027s rejuvenating my old love for art. I want to draw everything from commissions to my head world, and even finally get to writing my short stories again! However, I need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a humble person who tries to support others more than myself, and I\u0027m usually the one that had helped give money to those in need. I use to give money to friends who could barely afford food, donate money to help save their pet or family member, and even donate to get that other person one step closer to their dream! Sadly I can no longer do that, and I would like to ask for help in achieving my own dream, and that is to have a future with my boyfriend and get back to creating the art and stories that I so long to get back to, as well as the smiles of others I make art for! Help me, and I\u0027ll help you! :D\u003cbr\u003e"
