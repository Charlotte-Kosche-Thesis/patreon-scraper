Well, no. That\u0027s a lie -- actually, I thought about making videos all the time.  But the thought always scared me...yes me, performer and artist.  Has a fear of making videos.  Because if it\u0027s not perfect, it never sees the light of day. \u003cbr\u003eLast month, I started to realize that maybe every tiny piece of a video doesn\u0027t have to be perfect . \u003cstrong\u003eMaybe it\u0027s the process of making something perfectly imperfect, and willing to let it go into the universe without trying too hard, that makes a genuine expression of art. \u003c/strong\u003e So, I decided it was time to let go of trying to be perfect, and step up to face my fears. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m taking video-making baby steps. \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ll be releasing a cover video (or original/tutorial) once a month on the First Friday. \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eMy goal is to get over this silly fear of mine, while inspiring you with more music.\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eSo I hope you enjoy! :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat my videos will look like and where your money goes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach release will include an acoustic cover video, original, or tutorial. \u00a0With your support, we\u0027ll soon be able to create beautiful videos with a professional film crew, and cover costs such as editing, recording professional audio, and more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t forget to scroll down to see the cool things you get for supporting.
