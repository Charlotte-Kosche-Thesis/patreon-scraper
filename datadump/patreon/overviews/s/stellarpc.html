I loved the community of players and checking in daily to the familiar player names and characters. \u00a0I want to get back to my passion of creating this (recreating) and the fellowship of other gamers. \u00a0I want to have the time to do it right and keep the community together. \u00a0I also want to possibly open this up to a more community run operation where players can become admins and attend discussions, meetings, and possibly even work with me on the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContributors\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy original plans and methods of trying to monetize this platform so I could afford to host and work on it involved ads and the \u0027pay tournament\u0027 that both failed.  I want to reinvent this whole system and not overwhelm users with ads and pressure.  This funding platform will provide this as an opportunity and the contributors will be the first to receive any prizes or benefits of furthering this dream. \u00a0My patrons will be first consideration on all open admin positions as they come available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#2 RPG Saga Adaptation (Fully browser based top down RPG games)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHistory\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong ago, Japanese Role Playing Games (jRPGs) captivated the world and our imaginations. \u00a0I was a young child set out to role play as a brave warrior in worlds in siege by monsters of all shapes, colors, and sizes. \u00a0My original tasks were simple, but eventually led to becoming a hero of epic proportions. \u00a0These worlds had great stories, consequences, and endless hours of game play. \u00a0Then something happened... 3D graphics took over, game play got complicated, and story lines were ignored in favor of brilliant graphics and full movie sequences that you didn\u0027t control. \u00a0Imagination waned.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginal titles like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest (Dragon Warrior), and Chrono Trigger go down in many gamer\u0027s books of the greatest RPG games of all time... not just the greatest of the late 80\u0027s and 90\u0027s, but of all time. \u00a0The answer lies in the fact that for over 40+ hours of nonstop game play, you were immersed in a great story, just like a good book, and couldn\u0027t put it down and when you finally confronted and beat that final boss, you watched the credits roll in a great satisfaction, but also in sorrow because the story was over. \u00a0You then waited until Square or Enix, released the sequel... or not. \u00a0Despite their insane popularity early on, this was not a guarantee and most times did not build on the prequel... it was just a better graphical version with a similar, but new game play system and characters in a new story in a different world. \u00a0It wasn\u0027t a sequel at all... it may have been a great game in it\u0027s own right, but not worthy of a sequel title.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat!?! \u00a0Using slimes over and over doesn\u0027t make it a sequel? \u00a0Burying DW1\u0027s world inside DW3\u0027s world doesn\u0027t make it a sequel? \u00a0Sorry, guys... no.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was a young child who had a knack for story writing and drawing. \u00a0I wrote sequels and drew monsters while I waited. \u00a0I focused on graphic arts as a teen. \u00a0When I got older, I decided to get into programming to write games... instead, I wound up programming for other companies business needs. \u00a0I occasionally tried to point my free-time towards writing some games, but with no fame I knew I was putting tons of time into something nobody could ever find... let alone pay for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe right technology is here now... I\u0027ve got the right platform to make a web-based game system that can be played from any device.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter crowd funding... this is the perfect platform to find the right people with interest who are willing to provide that extra motivation, support, and replacement income to see this to fruition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Goal\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWith my childhood imagination still intact, my adolescent creative writing and artistic skills stowed away, and my adulthood programming experience well at hand, I\u0027m ready to build a multi-part gaming saga for RPG lovers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe saga will be built one game at a time, but in the interest of being a trilogy at minimum with the hope of having endless sequel or expansion possibilities available at a decent rate of release. \u00a0The desire is to follow the same world, events, and characters, just like a movie trilogy would. \u00a0Completion of one would lead you towards the next game in the series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe style of the game would closely follow the older style 2D top down worlds where physics was of no concern, initially focusing on the timed turn-based battle system with scheduled and random enemy groups (Final Fantasy style). \u00a0World maps are downsized to represent travel over large areas where a town is a smaller icon that you go into and it expands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf and when (post trilogy only) a different game style is adapted, such as real-time fighting, it will be introduced outside the original series and follow new characters, story and track, but may overlap within the same saga world/environment and share global \u0027events\u0027. \u00a0I will only ever code games inside the same \u0027world\u0027 so they all mesh and work together and gamers will always be familiar with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContributors\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMonetization of a game like this is difficult. \u00a0I\u0027ve orchestrated the subscription for this so that it would work like a monthly subscription to a service. \u00a0You can play what I\u0027ve got at different subscription levels just as you would to any other subscription based game. \u00a0Any public subscriptions that aren\u0027t part of Patreon will actually be more expensive and not have any \u0027rewards\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e"
