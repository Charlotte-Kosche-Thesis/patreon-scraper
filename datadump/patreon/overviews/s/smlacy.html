    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eWell hello there, friend! Welcome to my Patreon page! :)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for being here and for supporting my work!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWho am I?\u003c/h3\u003e\nI make art about grace, humanity and connection. My work tells the stories of our bodies through this lens, asking us to consider what makes us beautiful? Is it a pleasing arrangement of features or something richer, deeper? Is it the spirit that moves us, the grace that flows through our bones? Is it the beauty and wisdom of the stories that live in our cells? Is it our inherent nobility and dignity, the stuff of spirit, that is truly beautiful?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am madly in love with the human body. The way our flesh lovingly wraps our bones, the way you can read the story of someone\u0027s life in their cells. Our bodies never forget; they record every moment. Our bodies are a treasure map of our lives, a patchwork quilt of our memories.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to tell our body stories, our true and honest body stories. The only bodies we tend to see are the ones in the media: homogeneously thin, white and young and run through filters and photoshop, these are false stories, rewritten to sell us something. They don\u0027t connect us; they isolate us and shame us.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe deeply in the work that I do and I think it\u0027s important to tell these stories. That\u0027s why I started this Patreon - not everyone has the room or the desire to hang nudes and portraits on their walls. But maybe you still believe in this work and in this mission. Maybe you want to see more art like this in the world. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy supporting me every month, you buy back my time from freelance gigs to make this work. You help me pay the models who so generously let me tell their story. You allow me to buy supplies.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn return, you get to see behind the scenes, including videos of my process, as well as more stories and tales from the easel. I will share as much of my process as I can with you. You\u0027ll get discounts on art, and raffles for signed prints and maybe the occasional painting giveaway! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for believing in what I do! I literally couldn\u0027t do what I do without you."
