My name is Adam and I write, run and edit Switch Indie Fix; a website dedicated to indie games on the Nintendo Switch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love indie games and indie developers. I find they are much more interesting and thought provoking than triple A titles. Plus, they are usually cheaper than triple A games, which is always a bonus! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, I love my Nintendo Switch. In 2017 Nintendo returned to hardware market with an amazing piece of tech. The Switch has become the home of indies and being able to take it anywhere has made it my main console; playing it whenever I have a free minute.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you love indie games and the Nintendo Switch, then Switch Indie Fix is the website and community for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to thank any potential Patrons. I love writing about video games and by supporting me on here helps me achieve that dream. So thank you guys!\u00a0"
