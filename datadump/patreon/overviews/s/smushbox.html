A\ngraduate of the College for Creative Studies with a Bachelor of Fine Arts\ndegree in Illustration I\u0027ve been included in more than 20 groups shows and 3\nsolos shows across the country.\u00a0\nI mainly work on freelance projects and showing art in various galleries and at conventions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI decided at an early age that I had to be an\nartist starting my first business on the elementary school bus with a\nbinder of artwork. I hired a friend to take orders for commissions,\naccepting anything from lunch money to bubble gum as payment for drawings.\nNow I continue to try to make a living doing what I love: drawing and painting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\ngenerally work with acrylic on canvas or wood panels, using bright colors with a touch\nof my dark sense of humor. I blend these themes with childlike colors and pop culture\nthemes alongside of my sometimes grotesque imagery. It creates a world of blended\ndichotomies, where innocence meets corruption light meets dark life meets\ndeath and food meets waste. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve made it this far you now realize this entire thing was my way of making an elaborate poop joke. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

That means I will have 365 days of sketches that I would really love to compile into a small art book. \u00a0It shows a great progression in my drawing skills already and i\u0027m only just over day 100 as of this addition. \u00a0If I can manage $100 a month this will help me take some of the burden off the printing costs and will add another item I can use at conventions and sell online which will help me out a ton! \u00a0Thanks!!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/PTih8Zc.jpg\" style=\"width: 161px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/zG8zSO3.jpg\" style=\"width: 161px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Is997JB.jpg\" style=\"width: 162px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/TAPQIbk.jpg\" style=\"width: 162px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "One of my strengths in life is definitely not web design. It\u0027s hard and tedious. \u00a0I always have to try thirty different things in order to get one to work. \u00a0In college we were taught a really backwards way of doing websites which doesn\u0027t even allow crawlers to recognize text on the page and loading times are terrible. We created and sliced an image in Photoshop which I now know is the worst way to design a website. \u00a0If I can get at least $50 a month I can pay for a service that actually helps with all of these things. \u00a0I will actually be able to update and maintain a website rather than just having some image sit on a server that does me very little good.",

This is seriously one of my main goals for my business right now. \u00a0I want to be able to make higher quality items so I can provide a better service. Plus the time making things like this myself takes away from making NEW works. \u00a0All positive things!",
