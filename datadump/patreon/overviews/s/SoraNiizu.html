    "summary": "Hello, I\u0027m Sora, Welcome to my Patreon page :)\u003cbr\u003eI created this place with several goals in mind : I\u0027m a student, I don\u0027t have much to live, but I\u0027m really determined to keep creating during all of my free time, and hope that in the future, I\u0027ll be able to live from my creations. Patreon could help me to earn a bit of money and that would be very helpful for several things : I draw a comic, make illustrations and do photography. For that, I pay an Adobe \"Creative Cloud\" subscription for both Photoshop and Lightroom, which is about 160$ per year. So far, I\u0027ve payed it on my own, but that would be a great relief if I had some help, since it\u0027s the only tool I need to create and share visual art :). I also create costumes, especially historical ones or cosplays. I\u0027d love to do more of them, and share my passion with you all, but most of the time, fabrics are really expansive, so in the end, it is always hard to create everything I have in mind. A little financial help would allow me to buy fabric and material that I need for creating costumes, sharing pics, knowledge and tips with you :) Finally, organising photo shoots, going to a convention, an event where my art can be shown or perfected often costs some money (the trip, stay ...) and a little help is always useful and appreciated :) In the end, earning a bit of money for my art and creations would allow me to do more of it, to dedicate way more time to it, like posting more pages for my comic in a month, and above all, that would be more easier for me to share a lot of posts with you all, and maybe, one day, to be able to turn my passions into a proper and viable job :-D ! Thanks for reading !!\u003cbr\u003eSora !\u003cbr\u003e"
