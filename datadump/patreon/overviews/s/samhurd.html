I\u0027ve been back and forth about doing this for some time. I truly love educating people and enabling them to be their own creative force in the world, but I hate the idea of charging for it.

I will make the introduction between you and the inquiring wedding couple and hand the relationship off from there for you to book them as you normally would. This is a chance to grow your own business under your own name and on your own terms. Note - most inquiries are in the DC/MD/VA areas and a portfolio review for quality control will be done for first time backers."
