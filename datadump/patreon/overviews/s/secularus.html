    "summary": "Our goals and efforts are lofty, but worth the dedication! We intend to establish a comprehensive resource - predominantly free for use - for individuals, communities, and grassroots activists the world over! This includes publishing educational guides, interview material, videos, event calendars, and skill/demand matching services. This also includes taking on community assistance projects as able.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll efforts are approached from a secular perspective that humans are quite capable of producing the aid they need through cooperative networking, dedication, and support. Jump-starting these efforts will take a considerable outlay of resources. If you possess the skills and interest, we would love to bring you on-board to help in building! Much can be accomplished with your donation of time and knowledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are huge fans of open source communities and intend to provide the vast majority of our material free of charge under Creative Commons licensing. Moreover, we will make every reasonable effort at transparency to bolster your confidence that \u003cem\u003eyour contributions will be going where they do the most good - and not to exorbitant operating costs or frivolous endeavors.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those skills that we must contract out for, we ask the community at large to aid by contributing donations in support of covering operations and special projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecularus is an all-volunteer organization at this stage!\u00a0No one involved in this organization will be receiving compensation of any sort - wages, donations, payment-in-kind, or any other type of payment scheme - for the foreseeable future. Once feasible, this may become a full-time effort with paying positions. However, that will be announced well in advance of any such transition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor us, this is a labor of love. If this resonates with you, please consider lending a hand.\u003cbr\u003e"
