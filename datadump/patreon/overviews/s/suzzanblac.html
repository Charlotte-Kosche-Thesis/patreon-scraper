That is why\nI work as much as I can to spread awareness and educate people about\nchild and adult abuse.

Believe\nme, there is so much to cover!  I would really like to be able to\ndevote myself to the work full time, but my current day job leaves me\nvery little time to do this. Please take a look at my sites and you\ncan see for yourself how I try to help others. Unfortunately, what I\ndo is not enough and I need to do more.

I needed an antidote to this \u0027psychological poison\u0027 that was slowly \nkilling me. Little did I realise that I had long ago, produced my own \nantidote. It was a dusty art case that contained my personal paintings. I\n came to understand that this poison that was killing me, was called \n\u0027Silence\u0027 And that silence can slowly eat away and destroy a person \ncompletely.  And, as I posted my personal paintings online for all to \nsee. I began to receive endless messages from other survivors, who said \nthat \u0027I was a voice\u0027 for them, in their inability to express their own \ntrauma and pain. They said that I inspired them. The truth is, that they\n inspired me. I was no longer silent. Indeed I was going to shout out \nabout my abuse and the abuse of others.\u003cbr\u003e For \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0027Silence empowers the perpetrators and impairs the victims\u0027\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e",
