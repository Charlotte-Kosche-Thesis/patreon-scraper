    "summary": "Hey! I\u0027m a Canadian guitarist and music instructor, with a passion for sharing my ideas, guitar arrangements, tabs, lessons and more. I\u0027ve always had an interest in so many different genres of music, with one common thread throughout - THE GUITAR! So, I had to start my own\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/guitarinstructor2010\"\u003eYoutube Channel\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout university, I taught guitar and played live music gigs full time to support myself. After finishing university, getting the day job, and continuing to perform live music (part time) I realized I missed teaching music and sharing ideas and experiences with others. I started thinking.. what if I could spend more time bringing guitar related content to the world and less time working that office job? That\u0027s the dream. If you\u0027re seeking quality guitar content to keep you inspired, such as arrangements of popular songs, exciting guitar licks, and ways to expand your own playing, then I hope you\u0027ll join me on my journey. This is my way to connect with guitar players globally. I look forward to connecting with you!\u003cbr\u003e"
