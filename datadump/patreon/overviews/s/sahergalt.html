    "summary": "Hey, I\u0027m Saher Galt. Singer, composer and co-founder of the rock duo Galt Aureus. I\u0027ve been sharing my songs and music tutorials on \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/sahergalt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e for a long time (almost 10 years). I hear from you every single day with words that are beyond inspiring \nand that\u0027s a big way I know what we\u0027re doing is important.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy lesson videos are different: they\u0027re interactive so you can practice \nright along with them. They\u0027re cut from the same cloth as the methods I use to develop professional musicians. And it makes me proud to hear that by working with them, \nyou\u0027ve conquered a challenge or \ngained a new ability. So I want a big part of this journey to be about \ncreating an increasingly \n\u003cstrong\u003evast library \u003c/strong\u003eof interactive lesson videos--like a virtual\n music conservatory! Covering training for the new musician all the way to \nthe venerated pro. Free and open to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also aim to share all the music that\u0027s in\n my head and in my \nheart. I have a pile reaching to the sky of big ideas we can bring to life. And, as you might imagine, my \nwork \nin an award-winning rock band has opened many doors for me--join me on this and we\u0027ll walk through them together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re also making some pretty awesome projects collaboratively. Our pilot project was \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5HP6T0RnXA\"\u003eThe Blackened Bloom\u003c/a\u003e,\n a rock song uniting the many talents of my musical patrons. Up next is \nan epic story with voice-acting, musical score, integrated songs and \nillustrations. There are lots of ways to participate. You\u0027re invited!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e What I do is a labor of love--I believe in it all the way down to my bones--but practical realities are what they are. A single video can take 30 hours or more to produce. To be able to clear my schedule and invest the time, energy and resources it takes to create these videos--and to make them freely available--I need your support. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/strong\u003e You can choose to pledge per \nvideo I create. I like this because you can select the amount that \ncorresponds to the value my work brings to your life. It also means that\n I\u0027m free to create the kind of content that matters most to us, rather than \nwhat corporate sponsors might want to hire me to create or what \ngenerates the most clicks. With Patreon, what we\u0027re doing stays \npure--100% about the content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe now live in an era where we can directly support the content we believe in. It does mean assuming a higher level of personal responsibility--taking action when it\u0027s easier to do nothing--but it also means we directly shape the world around us. \n\u003cstrong\u003eWe get to choose what flourishes\u003c/strong\u003e. And we earn the pride of having been personally responsible for it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s not all practicalities, either. You\u0027re here at the most exciting time. I\u0027m on Patreon not just to continue what we\u0027ve begun, but because I have the desire to do so much more. This is an opportunity for us to embark on a bigger adventure together.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we\u0027ll make happen:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eNew\u003cstrong\u003e in-depth, interactive\u003c/strong\u003e music lesson videos (\u003cem\u003eweekly\u003c/em\u003e, when we hit that goal!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eA massive music resource area where I share my knowledge and private tools with you\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eSpecial one-off projects (like launching my next album!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e...and lots more exciting things along the way!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou also get awesome rewards:\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e  Join me on Patreon \u003cstrong\u003ecollaborations\u003c/strong\u003e (songs, games, stories!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExclusive\u003c/strong\u003e and early access lesson content and music\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFree downloads of every song \u003cem\u003ebefore \u003c/em\u003eit drops\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e...Plus a \u003cem\u003eunique \u003c/em\u003ereward every month!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was little and heard my favorite musicians conjure the most \nprofound emotions through song or watched my own music teachers spin \ndizzying miracles on the spot, I knew that\u0027s what I wanted to do. These \nwere my heroes. And because of them, I\u0027ve honed those skills in myself \nand developed ways to cultivate them in others. After years of \nperfecting my educational methods with my own work, diligent research, a\n popular \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.galtmusic.com/lessons/products/\"\u003evocal method\u003c/a\u003e and by teaching many thousands of private lessons, I have so much to share with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe music is important. It\u0027s the exalted expression of who we are. And this \nmost personal art form can slip under the walls we build up, make us \ncloser, and bring out better versions of ourselves: more heroic, caring,\n brave. Songs can contain powerful sentiments and ideas which in turn \ncan set off positive change like wildfire. And music is the only way I \nhave ever been able to completely communicate what\u0027s inside of me. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI intend to post up to 1 - 2 videos a month to start. When we hit the weekly goal, I\u0027ll be able to make a video every single week! It\u0027s worth noticing that you only support when I \n\u003cem\u003emake \n\u003c/em\u003esomething--as direct as it gets. And only substantial lessons and songs will count. When I \npost a quick tip, vlog or cat video, that\u0027s on me. And don\u0027t worry, you can always cap how much you want to contribute per month, so even if I post more than usual, you\u0027ll only support up to your chosen amount.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour pledges will help us hit milestones like the creation of the next big project, video or production goal. In addition to achieving our goals, you also receive rewards like free song downloads, exclusive lesson content, one-on-one Skype chats and other unique things. Basically, you\u0027re doing good in the world, supporting the work you believe in and also getting perks in the process. The fabled win-win-win! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOK, any questions, feel free to shoot me a note. Thanks for watching and sharing and all the ways you make what I do \npossible. If you choose to be a part of this, beyond the ever-growing \nimmensity of my gratitude, you also have my promise: I\u0027ll give this \neverything I have. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re in, let\u0027s create incredible things together!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u0026lt;3,\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSaher\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://galtmusic.com/images/SaherGalt-IWillRemain.gif\" style=\"width: 455px;\"\u003e"
