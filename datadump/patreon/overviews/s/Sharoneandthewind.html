    "summary": "We are Sharone \u0026amp; The Wind, hailing from Denver, Colorado. We\u0027ve been called dark rock, alt-pop, goth prog, and more, but the consensus is that our sound is heavy, our words are haunting, our stage presence is exciting, and our potential is limitless. We five have been a group since May of 2017- Sharone singing lead; Michelle accompanying with harmony vocals and piano; Alex shredding the guitar; Zach finessing the bass; and Anthony driving us forward on the drums.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal on Patreon is simple: to amass funds for our next big thing, be that another music video, another EP, or a tour across the States. If you\u0027re here, chances are you create something yourself. It\u0027s possible that you understand the challenges of artistic endeavors: struggling to balance your time between working for hourly wages and working on your creations, and maintaining energy for both...struggling to save and plan for your future in a pragmatic way while financially sustaining your art by any means necessary. There are sacrifices. There are dilemmas. But thanks to Patreon, there is hope.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have so much to offer you in exchange for your support. Take a look at our goals and our tiers of rewards. They range from access to simple rewards like posts, photos, and a vlog, to big fancy stuff like complimentary merch, music, and tickets. We\u0027re gonna make this worth your while, so that you get back what you put in to support our dreams. This is your band, just as much as it is ours. Thank you for your support! We\u0027ll see you soon, Stormchasers \u0026lt;3"

     "description": "\u003cstrong\u003eJune 2018 Tour through the West\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the release of \u003cem\u003eEnchiridion of Nightmares\u003c/em\u003e, it only makes sense that we would use that momentum to go on tour to promote ourselves and this new music. We have our first three dates booked and ready to play, but we are still working on the other seven. Our tour schedule is as follows: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eJune 2nd, Tour Kickoff at Moe\u2019s Barbecue in Englewood\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJune 3rd, Colorado Springs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJune 4th, Albuquerque \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJune 5th, Phoenix (or Flagstaff or another major city)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJune 6th, San Diego (or nearby city) \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJune 7th, Los Angeles (or nearby city)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJune 8th, Reno (or nearby city) \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJune 9th, Salt Lake City (or nearby city)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAt this time we uhhhhhhh have \u003cstrong\u003ezero\u003c/strong\u003e band savings, after spending thousands of dollars on the album and hundreds more on t shirts, CDs, stickers, PR, Facebook post promotions, and more. All five of us work for wages, and to be able to supplement our merch sales and contributions to the savings account would increase our likelihood of being able to tour at all. We will share more details about our costs and our budget as our dates get booked and our route becomes clear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we reach this goal, we will create \"carpool karaoke\" style videos while we\u0027re on the road, sharing a different track off \u003cem\u003eEnchiridion of Nightmares\u003c/em\u003e each day.\u00a0 Thank you so much for your support, we couldn\u2019t do any of this without you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",

We\u2019re embracing it. But we\u2019ve also basically run out of outfits that you all haven\u2019t seen yet. Goodwill is nice and all, but it\u2019s pretty hit and miss when it comes to spooky attire. We have a Wish List with Wish (called \u201cWitchy Business\u201d for fun) full of accessories and costume pieces for very low prices that we dream of acquiring. The cool thing is that Sharone and Michelle are built very similarly (#TBC) and can share costume pieces! Alex also has a flair for extravagance, so he\u2019s got some items on the list too. Sounding great live is one thing, but looking great live takes the performance to the next level. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope that you\u2019ll contribute to our cuteness. If we reach this goal, we will do a photo shoot decked out in our new attire just for you to see! Perhaps something from that shoot could become a poster...you\u0027ll be the judge of that.\u00a0",
