My goal is to Inspire others to Get Out There by doing the same and enjoying life\u0027s adventures!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you really make $XXX PER VIDEO?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNope, that\u0027s not exactly how it works. The number shown on this page is what is made for the 1st piece of paid content (video) each month. Then the next video is currently less than half of that first number, then the next is less than half of that second number and so on.... The number can be a false indicator of the amount pledged each month since some accounts are set up to support once, twice or unlimited times per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy You Should Support the Channel:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need your help to create more content and further the reach to inspire more people to Ge Out There. Videos are challenging to say the least to produce with filming, many hours of editing, camera equipment, camera failures and lots of other behind the scenes expenses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help I will be able to deliver more content, higher quality content as well as hopefully more unique and adventurous destinations. I have lots of ideas in my head for future videos and your help will make those ideas a reality much quicker.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so fortunate and happy to be a creator and have such a strong community of viewers out there. My goal is to inspire others to Get Out There and enjoy life whether it by by paddling their kayak or any other adventure. \u00a0Please consider supporting the channel at a dollar (or however much you like) per month or per video that I post on Youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo need to be concerned about going over budget because you can easily set a cap to how much money you support each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTake a look at the awesome rewards at each support level on the right side of this page!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eQUESTIONS:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t have much money to spare, can I still be a Patron? Yes! \u003c/strong\u003eJust $1 per month or $12 per year would make a huge difference with an army of Patrons! Your dollar could make a huge difference in the future of the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars? No. \u003c/strong\u003eEven though this is a US website and I\u0027m in the US, any currency can be used and converted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many videos will you post a month? \u003c/strong\u003eI hope for 4 at a minimum but I\u0027d like to do more. But don\u0027t worry you can set a cap to your amount supported so you don\u0027t spend more than you can afford.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if my financial circumstances change in the future? \u003c/strong\u003eYou can change your amount at any time by reducing your monthly/per video support or stopping your account whenever you need to.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main goals are to inspire more people, make more videos, provide better videos and visit more distant destinations (plus a few other crazy ideas).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, we can inspire more people to Get Out There and do something, to Get Out There and live!\u003cbr\u003e"
