You came here from Twitter, didn\u0027t you? Either way - I\u0027m really glad you\u0027re here! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy (short) Story:\u003c/strong\u003e I grew up playing video games and enjoy being involved in the creation process. I also grew up making graphics and my first job was doing graphics for a landscape architectural firm. However, I hope you won\u0027t peg me as a \u0027graphic designer\u0027 right now and move on - it\u0027s not my favorite thing in the world to do! After my first job I was involved in a serious (successful) game development project. Though it was not long after our first game launch the economy tanked hard and the team had to look for work elsewhere. For a while I worked part-time jobs like at target, or delivering food, I did some graphics freelancing... but it just didn\u0027t last and wasn\u0027t exactly what I had in mind for a career. When I had enough of the part-time work I forced myself to learn code and created a web design \u0026amp; development company to help pay the bills (eventually several small companies), I was in suit and tie\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003enetworking\u003c/strong\u003e multiple times a week. Didn\u0027t get much sleep. Honestly, I \u003cstrong\u003ehated\u003c/strong\u003e almost every moment of it despite it paying quite well and learning a lot about business. I really \u003cstrong\u003ehated myself\u003c/strong\u003e at that point and became severely \u003cstrong\u003edepressed\u003c/strong\u003e. I took a break and had an \u003cstrong\u003eepiphany\u003c/strong\u003e at that point, I started a small business consulting firm trying to share the realizations I had. Long story short... eventually, I just felt that \u003cstrong\u003ein helping myself I also needed to use my skills to do something bigger, to help other people in a big way. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s when I got the idea for (social media) stickers, I could use my graphic design experience to design unique stickers and sell them online while helping others grow their small business or organization... I made a small site that grew, since 2011 I\u0027ve made several hundreds of thousands of decals and sent them all over the world\u2026 eventually I came up with a special composite that worked really, really well. When I wasn\u0027t making decals I was marketing them day \u0026amp; night. Some rare evenings I would have some time off, last year in some spare time I managed to write an eBook on Photoshop, I found out I quite enjoy writing... I\u0027d like to have the time to write volume II: \u003ca href=\"http://infozaps.com.\"\u003ehttp://infozaps.com.\u003c/a\u003e I dabbled in many small projects on the side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut yet still, stickers are not my passion. I\u0027ve been making stickers for going on 6 years now to help others be more successful so that I too could pay the bills (only barely, sometimes not even, \u003cstrong\u003ehyper-niche stickers aren\u0027t exactly a lucrative business\u003c/strong\u003e!). Meanwhile, I stopped making music... I stopped making art... I stopped working on games... you know that phrase \"all work and no play?\" well it\u0027s especially true if you can\u0027t even find time to play...on top of that: with all the news going on in the world I got increasingly depressed again, I learned, from this outstanding essay, it was actually called \"demoralization\"\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://newint.org/columns/essays/2016/04/01/psycho-spiritual-crisis/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://newint.org/columns/essays/2016/04/01/psycho-spiritual-crisis/\u003c/a\u003e... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI went on for months like that... I was keeping a close eye on politics, to see where the country is headed, because politics was starting to affect every day life for me and those around me... and it wasn\u0027t until early 2016 that I learned about a very important idea... an imperative idea...it\u0027s called Universal Basic Income (UBI or BIG Basic Income Guarantee). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI remained highly skeptical, which is normal...\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I found out about it through reddit, and creator of the subreddit /r/basicincome, Scott Santens \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/scottsantens\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/scottsantens\u003c/a\u003e who is here on Patreon! There I read about many tests going on around the world to see how it could help. The idea is that as a human being you should be guaranteed the right to a \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003efoundational\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e amount of income and thus the increased freedom of time for choice, increased freedom to access \u0027basic\u0027 doors in society that may be closed, for example: going to the dentist or having access to clean water.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome of the experiments so far around the world showed that having a UBI helped people escape poverty, increased nutrition, reduced crime, helped parents pay for their child\u0027s education, helped addicts reduce their alcohol or drug consumption, helped individuals invest or start small businesses, among many, many other important benefits to society.\u003c/strong\u003e To my surprise there were several pilot studies in the past as well as ongoing real implementations (such as in Alaska) where \u003cstrong\u003ereal people, today\u003c/strong\u003e, are benefitting from these programs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI then set out to learn as much as I could about \u003cstrong\u003eUBI\u003c/strong\u003e. The more I learned the more important (and nuanced) I discovered the idea to be. Money touches everything. I\u0027d go as far as to say, this might be one of the most important ideas, \u003cstrong\u003eperhaps ever\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo,\u00a0I also began to research the motivations behind earning income beyond survival, as well as why some people are against the idea of Implementing a societal foundational Basic Income, but the arguments are\u003cstrong\u003e few and weak\u003c/strong\u003e. Recently I compiled all these resources about UBI, including studies and evidence:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://list.ly/ubiadvocates/lists\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://list.ly/ubiadvocates/lists\u003c/a\u003e - and including many of the misconceptions around the idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we saw in the recent science march, environment march, and women\u0027s marches...there\u0027s far more people who support and respect and who seek and who are open to \u003cstrong\u003eevidence and science\u003c/strong\u003e, and are thus likely to support \u003cstrong\u003eUBI\u003c/strong\u003e\u2014 but they are wallowing in depression or demoralization like I was...or...they\u0027re very busy with day to day life...or... they think they are more deserving of basic necessities than other people... or, they\u0027re generally misguided (etc).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eStill, I dug deeper and attempted to figure out why those would fight against it- I\u2019m still researching this now. It seems somewhere between 1-5% of people are vocally \u0026amp; vehemently opposed. BUT WHY? I continue to research and learn.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I believe there are far more people that can see the merits of Universal Basic Income out there - they\u0027re just like me who didn\u0027t know it existed, or they knew something like it existed- but didn\u2019t realize that \u003cstrong\u003eother people all over the world are advocating it, and have been doing so for 50 YEARS! ...\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and really, we all need to get involved, because it works, and it is necessary... and I\u0027m now watching where things are going and starting to really\u003cem style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e feel that time is running out!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I have decided to devote much of my time to introducing new people to the idea of UBI now so that hopefully, it can come sooner for all.

Beyond the vast forests are treacherous icy mountains that no Elves have returned from exploring. Rumors remain of mysterious creatures, cultures, artifacts, treasures, and legends of safer pathways through the mountains to the Otherworld. Within the green forests are ancient and well-worn pathways that string along through. The pathways cross rivers and hug the edges of rocky hills. Some of the Elves have built small but complex villages deep within the forest which are extremely difficult for visitors to find without a guide. That is where the Elders live. Other simple villages are found in the meadows and gaps between the forest growth. Only one of the forests in the land has not been explored as the Elders have expressly forbidden it: The Great Forest, believed to be both cursed and enchanted.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://kindredelves.com/images/map.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Many years before that, located only a four-moon hike away from The Great Forest, the small Village of Vaeri thrived.
