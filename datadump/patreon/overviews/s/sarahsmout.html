    "summary": "Hello humans, beasts and critters,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for visiting my patreon page. \u003cbr\u003eI am a cellist, writer, songwriter and explorer. Here you will find out about my eco-art-projects \"The Polar Line\", \"This Planet Ocean\" as well things like fundraising gigs for environmental charities - and how YOU can help me make them happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up close to the land - to the animals, the hills, the sound of snow. My writing has been shaped by this connection, and at heart I am an environmentalist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u0027The Polar Line\u0027 is all about the Arctic. It\u0027s a long way from my cosy little house, but it\u0027s melting fast. Little do we feel the damage already caused - \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We build to the sky,\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ice falls, confetti in mind\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and we cry with rain?\"\u003cbr\u003eMy songs and poetry focus on the Arctic, and how it\u0027s changing - how Polar Bears have to learn to swim for longer to find food, or else starve. They are now a critically endangered species.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027This Planet Ocean\u0027 focuses on human relationships with the sea - the thing that makes up most of this ball of mass. I\u0027m interested in stories about the sea - how we\u0027ve travelled across it, (over)fished it, fallen in love across it, and everything else in between. It\u0027s the tide that binds us to our places where we learn to stand. And now it\u0027s changing, steering whales off course and washing jellyfish up on the shore, all because of climate change and our actions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will help pay for:\u003cbr\u003erecording new songs for environmental campaigns,\u003cbr\u003evideos,\u003cbr\u003ecollaborations with other musicians who inspire me, \u003cbr\u003ethe costs of fundraising gigs, \u003cbr\u003etravelling to remote communities, \u003cbr\u003eand make sure I have all the tools I need to do this - especially the time to actually write! \u003cbr\u003eAnd you will get all of what I do come up with in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spend a lot of time writing about deep connections to place, and I can\u0027t do this without actually spending \u003cem\u003etime\u003c/em\u003e in places, and seeing the effects of climate change, talking to communities, and researching sustainable possibilities for the future. If you feel like you can help me realise my dreams as a kind of eco-artist, then please do join me on my journey to far flung corners of the earth, to sit and feel the pulse of the land, to raise awareness of the biggest issue our planet will ever face.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSarah\u003cbr\u003e"
