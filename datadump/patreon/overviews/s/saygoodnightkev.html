    "summary": "Welcome Friend!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re reading this, I\u0027m guessing you\u0027ve watched one of my youtube videos (though I\u0027m not the best guesser in the world, so if I\u0027m wrong you can check them out right here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/saygoodnightkevin\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eyoutube.com/saygoodnightkevin\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started the Say Goodnight Kevin channel in 2014 as a way to connect, share my thoughts, and maybe even help others! It was one of the best decision I ever made! Since then, I\u0027ve tried a lot of different creative ideas on the channel, but when I think about it, the central theme has always been the same. \"Encourage myself and others to expand the mind.\" Sounds deep, eh? Basically, I want to think for myself and encourage others to do the same. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is that you\u0027ve felt that encouragement from one of my videos. Maybe one of my Movie Reviews or vlogs, or maybe even that Dog Vlog I did that one time (which is pretty great, if I do say so myself). The point is, making these videos is fun, and more than that, I really believe in them. I\u0027m not only proud of the videos I\u0027ve made, but I\u0027m also proud of the strong community that has grown around them. The people who already pledge, and pledged in the past to this Patreon, have been so crucial to the growth of this channel, both in quantity and quality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe point of this Patreon is to give you the opportunity to be a part of that SGK community and to help it grow in a very real way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s what I do with the money we raise\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIncrease Quality: \u003c/strong\u003eRunning a consistent youtube channel comes with expenses. I cover these expenses myself, but since we started the Patreon, it\u0027s made it a lot easier, and help increase the shows quality much quicker.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIncrease Frequency:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently, I work a full-time job and put my videos together on nights and weekends. Recently, I\u0027ve cut back on the frequency of videos, until it can justify itself financially.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIncrease\u00a0Variety:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently, my time is maxed out, but there are projects and shows I\u0027ve made in the past that many viewers would like me to bring back. Unfortunately, with limited funds, I have continue to be responsible by focusing on the select shows that get the most views.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy the content we\u0027re making here together, in the Say Goodnight Kevin community, and you want to be a part of it by contributing financially, then this is the place for you. Thank you, with all my heart, for watching these videos and for considering helping out the Patreon!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
