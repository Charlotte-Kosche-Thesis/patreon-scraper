Born in the middle of a weed-trimming session in the hills of Humboldt County, the magazine is now distributed all over Northern California, Oregon,and beyond.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough a dozen or so writers, artists and distribution folks help put together the \"fun\" part of the magazine, we are literally a \"ma and pa\" business, with publisher Chris Durant and his wife Monica doing 90% of the behind the scenes work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur advertisers have shown us a great amount support throughout the years but production costs have steadily rose while we\u0027ve kept rates as low as we could to help our clients be able to afford marketing their products and services. And it was working well. Keeping the mag free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then Jan. 1 hit and the clients in the cannabis industry who were all ready to market their farms, collectives and dispensaries now have all their money tied up in certification and licensing and they\u0027re hesitant to put themselves out there with Jeff Sessions vaguely threatening legal cannabis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe adjusted and then we got hit with the news that the Trump administration is slapping tariffs on newsprint and our costs will jump up another 20% to 30% in a matter of weeks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe popularity of the magazine and comedy brand around the country continues to grow though and the readers and fans have never been more and more enthusiastic about Savage Henry Magazine.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need your help to keep an independent publication going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf just half our readers pledged just $1 a month, not a day, not a week... but a month, we can still put out Savage Henry Magazine free like we have been for 8 years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love doing this magazine and are humbled by the responses and feedback we get from readers and drop off locations all over the west and beyond. We want to keep bringing you laughs and something to look at on the toilet besides your phone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider pledging just $1 a month. Check out the killer rewards and you can always reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eeditor@savagehenrymagazine.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we hit certain benchmarks we will limit advertising in the magazine and be able to include more and funnier articles and art, and pay those writers and artists something for their work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eFor the uninitiated and those who would like to find out more about Savage Henry Magazine, send along your address and we\u0027ll send you a free magazine, or you can check out our site at \u003ca href=\"http://savagehenrymagazine.com/\"\u003ewww.savagehenrymagazine.\u0026lt;wbr\u0026gt;com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThank you for your time and support to keep an independent voice and humor in print and available to the masses.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://savagehenrymagazine.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"

The popularity of the magazine and comedy brand around the country commands our full attention.
