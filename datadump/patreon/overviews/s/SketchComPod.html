New sketches are released every Sunday, with the conversation that prompted that sketch released every Tuesday and on Thursday is a classic sketch from the archives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProduction starts with Stuart inviting a person he feels is interesting; someone he knows in life or someone that he has reached out to because they are doing something interesting. This person can be an actor or actress, a scientist, comedian, fellow podcaster, or family and friends. Literally anyone who is interesting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecording sessions (which are released on Tuesdays) start with a conversation for about 30 minutes and from that conversation comes an idea for a sketch. Conversations can range from what people are doing that week to serious discussions, depending on how the two interact. The duo then take a little time to plot out and perform the sketch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis rough draft from the recording session is then produced over many hours to trim content, add special effects and create atmosphere to allow the sketch to come alive. The show is often praised for its high-level of production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the most exciting prospects for this podcast is seeing different types of people try their hand at improv and sketch comedy. It is surprising how so many people who think they do not have what it takes to make great comedy can come up with some amazing concepts and characters. Even the times it doesn\u0027t go well seem to have their own charm and humor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting this show allows it to grow. There are lofty goals of creating stage shows that have a lot of participation from guests and audience members, as well as creating more video and offering a financial incentive for people to come onto the show. Your contribution will absolutely help with that.\u003cbr\u003e"
