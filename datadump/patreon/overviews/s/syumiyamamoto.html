    "summary": "I am Sophia Yamamoto, writer of fantasy/sci-fi, short stories, movie reviews, and dabbler in creative non-fiction. I\u0027ve been published in a blog and two separate anthologies (woohoo!), but haven\u0027t yet gotten that paying gig (awwww).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal in creating this Patreon is to help me live off my writing (pay bills, student loans, the occasional sandwich and coffee) until I get an agent/book deal. By you joining this community, I can do that. I can be the writer I want to be without going back to my 9-5 accounting job. And I \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0don\u0027t want to go back to accounting...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m in the process of writing a novel-length fantasy/sci-fi story. This will be a series that spans at least three novels (probably more like 5-7 novels if I\u0027m honest...). If you want to get a little taste of the magic, \u003cstrong\u003ego to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://syumiyamamoto.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Microsha Series\u003c/a\u003e website!\u003c/strong\u003e I promise it\u0027s worth checking out \u2764\ufe0f\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I post articles on\u003ca href=\"https://vocal.media/authors/yumi-yamamoto\"\u003e Vocal\u003c/a\u003e writing movie reviews and commenting on social and political issues, which is cool and free to read!\u00a0 Buuuuuut, I want to have the freedom and time to write things that AREN\u0027T the novel or opinion articles. I started out writing short stories and character pieces, which sadly aren\u0027t the things that make you money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese smaller projects are the things I hope I can write with your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo me, stories are more than words on a page. They live and breathe in the reader\u0027s mind, form thoughts and emotion, inspire action and spark change. They are the things we tell ourselves, our friends and family, and our worst enemies. They create colorful worlds using 26 letters in black and white. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThey. Are. Magic.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope I can make you laugh, give you advice, or make you think about things in ways you might not have thought to before. I want to keep in touch with my patrons, get your\u00a0opinions and suggestions, and build excitement over stories of all kinds (not just mine, though those too!). I want to be able to support other creators who, like me, just want to get their work out in the world. I spent part of my time as a graduate student teaching, and if you have questions about writing, the process, or what we all have to go through to make the story work, PLEASE become a patron so we can have those chats! I\u0027ve set up a Discord channel just for that \ud83d\ude01\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey, if you\u0027ve read this all the way through, thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you liked\u00a0me or my stories, please share this page! Follow me on Twitter to get updates and randomness! Sometimes, all that keeps me going is a little \"hello\" and some love \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"

As a pre-teen, I wrote Yu Yu Hakusho fanfiction, then graduated to Naruto fanfiction, and then (as an adult) grew into my own fantasy novel that kind of looked like urban-fantasy with a sci-fi twist. I was an avid reader of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes and J.K. Rowling, both of whom were the inspirations for me becoming a novelist. Later, I was introduced to \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0on HBO, and George R.R. Martin became another major inspiration for my world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have lived in California, Hawaii, Texas, and London, but I am still a Southern California girl. I love the beach and the ocean, but I\u0027m happy to sit with my laptop in a coffee shop sipping my fourth (erm, fifth) latte. My schooling consists of a BA from UC Riverside and an MFA from Kingston University, both of which were Creative Writing degrees... I kind of really love writing \u2764\ufe0f\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon is here to help support me as a write, and possibly so that I can publish my novels by myself.
