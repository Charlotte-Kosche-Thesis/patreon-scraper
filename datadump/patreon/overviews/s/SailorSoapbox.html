    "summary": "Hello, and thank you for checking out my Patreon! I am SailorSoapbox, a.k.a. Hotaru, a.k.a. Myrna, and I love animation and have many opinions about it. My chief love is Sailor Moon, to which I have devoted over 20 years of my life. In addition to the Sailor Moon content I contribute, I also write a lot about Disney - for the past few years, I have been watching \u003cem\u003eevery\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0feature-length Disney animated feature and writing short, humorous reviews for each one.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Various Projects/Sites/Blogs/Etc\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://overanalyzinganimation.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Art of (Overanalyzing) Animation\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e The home of my longer, more formally written articles. On that site is my \u003cstrong\u003eThe Best and Worst of Disney\u003c/strong\u003e project, my analysis of the animation work of Sailor Moon character designer Ikuko Itoh, and the \u003cstrong\u003eSetting The Record Straight \u003c/strong\u003eseries in which I use lots of research and analysis to answer questions that Sailor Moon fans have pondered over the years. One of those articles, \u003cem\u003eHaruka\u0027s Gender \u0026amp; The Prince Uranus Scandal\u003c/em\u003e, is one of the most popular pieces I\u0027ve ever written. There are also some older pieces on this site that I wrote for the feminist film blog\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.btchflcks.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBitch Flicks\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/sm.mooniverse/posts/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSailor Moon: The Mooniverse\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eI have been the manager of this Sailor Moon fan page for over 5 years. I am fortunate to be part of a team of administrators who absolutely love Sailor Moon and work extremely hard to give it the thoughtful content it deserves. We also value the work of other fans, and have a strict policy of always crediting creators for their hard work. My primary responsibility as \"Hotaru\" is posting the daily trivia questions (which always includes beautiful fanart contributed by other fans), as well as designing animated GIFs, \u0026amp; posting breaking news (we\u0027re also very careful to only post news that can be easily verified).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://sailorsoapbox.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSailorSoapbox (Tumblr)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThis blog was originally intended as a home for the \u003cem\u003eThose Wacky Shittenou\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0sprite \"comics,\" but morphed into something much bigger. In addition to being one of the homes of my Photoshop edit projects \u0026amp; short written pieces, I accidentally stumbled into becoming a primary source for news, info and resources for the mobile game \u003cem\u003eSailor Moon Drops\u003c/em\u003e. I provide animated GIFs, avatars, and transparent PNGs of the characters, advice on which characters to use in the game, and explanations of the game mechanics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soapboxinggeek.deviantart.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSoapboxingGeek (DeviantArt)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eFinally, my deviantART account is the home of my extensive archive of Sailor Moon wallpapers and manga colourings. I started making wallpapers for myself just for the fun of it, but quickly found that many people liked what I designed and wanted to use it for themselves. I design wallpapers for both desktop and mobile formats, and strive to include as many different characters as possible.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why Patreon? Well, I\u0027m disabled. I have fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis, and the chronic pain and fatigue that both conditions cause has made it impossible for me to work at a regular job. However, I still have my brains, and I can still write and Photoshop. Thus, I will contribute to the world in the best way that I can. Patreon is one way to help supplement my limited disability income. If you like what I do and wish to contribute a little bit to this Patreon in thanks, I\u0027m extremely grateful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll of the content I currently post will remain free\u003c/em\u003e. However, there will be certain Patreon exclusives I will offer, depending on which donation tier you lovely people decide to contribute towards. Want to make me your personal puppet and pay $10 for me to watch and discuss something? You got it. Want to just say thanks? Thanks to you too! And while it\u0027s a cliche to say that even a $1 pledge helps a lot, in my case, \u003cem\u003eit really does\u003c/em\u003e. Either way, thanks for being here!\u003cbr\u003e"
