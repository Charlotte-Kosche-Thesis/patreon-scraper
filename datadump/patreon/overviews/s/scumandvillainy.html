Since then, we\u0027ve tried to put out podcasts with high audio quality and a consistent release schedule. We plan to continue, but we could use some additional cash to help make the show be even better. Our current hosting provider can\u0027t support our traffic, better audio software would decrease production time/difficulty, and we\u0027d like to have a new custom logo. Past that, we could maybe see some vassal tournament prize support, helping host community sites like Lady Luck and List Juggler and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. If you really enjoy the show and want to give something back, please consider becoming a patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for listening to our show and good hunting out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
