Your contribution helps us pay the rent and it shows the need for this mobility device. With your support you can help us to accelerate the development of the Scewo and be the first to get updated and new information about our progress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout us\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a team of enthusiastic master students from ETH Zurich and Zhdk and we have made it to our mission to develop the wheelchair of the 21st century.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/398daNY.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThomas studies industrial design at the Zurich University of the Arts. He made thousands of sketches so far and will continue to produce more. The collaboration of designers and engineers is what makes this project special. Together we develop a product that looks great but keeps all its functionalities and robustness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/EV9jm9R.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/wawupluxxgv8i9i/Beni.JPG?dl=0\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eBasil is doing his apprenticeship at ETH. We got to know him during the development of our first prototype. He is always eager to test the newest features even though they are not quite ready.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/SJtJPeT.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeni is the initiator of the project.

He is also responsible for communication with sponsors and partners of the project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/LJL2DX5.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePascal is our expert when working on hardware-software related issues. He designed many parts in CAD, routed the PCBs and did all the electronics for the chair. He has no limits when testing new stairs with our wheelchair and has a lot of experience crashing into walls.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/k6ylISk.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSandro and Maxim are doing their bachelor, respectively semester thesis on the project. Sandro is working on an improved position controller while Maxim is automating the transition on and off stairs with a sensor system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Hjwq1I8.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJosep our second fearless test driver. He was the pilot at the Cybathlon competition and knows the wheelchair best. He and Basil are both paraplegic and can give us direct feedback regarding the chair. Josep studies now at ETH as well and helps us test the wheelchair.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
