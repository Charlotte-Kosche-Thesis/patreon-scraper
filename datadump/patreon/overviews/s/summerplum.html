    "summary": "I believe flavor and smell are all about experiences and the memories they bring us. The ones we create around them, the ones they bring up from the past, and the ones we hope to make for the future. We use food and drink to create connection - not only to each other but to the past and future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my twenties, I had a tea business with the tagline \"a taste of happiness.\" My goal was to give people that moment of stillness, or warmth, or calm, or contentment, or joy with friends, in a cup. When I developed a caffeine allergy due to overexposure from hand-blending, I had to close it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have spent the last several years working towards finding a new path. I\u0027ve moved to Boston, and settled into a great community. I have my own small garden to tend. I take long walks and have started foraging locally.\u00a0I want to explore using the same blending skills I used in tea to create syrups and bitters with these harvests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Charlotte we had an amazing community around my tea business, and it was delightful to share events and tea with those people regularly. I love that Patreon offers a way to share that experience with a wider audience. As my Patron you will share in the experience of building a new business (a thing I have a fairly good handle on since I\u0027ve run one before), developing recipes, possibly samples and - I truly hope - gathering in person for events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor your monthly pledge* you\u0027ll get access to pictures, posts, and the process. At the top tier you\u0027ll get to Hangout with me on Google Hangouts and talk beverages and making! I\u0027ll also share my experiences eating \u0026amp; cooking, how to expand your own palate, notes from other tastings that I attend (I go to several others regularly), and cool food and beverage things I know are going on. I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll talk tea and coffee as well as mixed drinks and homemade sodas. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me and let\u0027s make new memories together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*If you\u0027re new to Patreon, the deal is this: you pick a pledge level (that amount or more if you want), every month they charge you that amount, sending me 90% of it. (They keep 5% and the money people keep about 5%.) Then I post things you have access to when you\u0027re logged in. Patreon magic!"
