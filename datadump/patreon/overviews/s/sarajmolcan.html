My studio is in the \u003ca href=\"http://www.artsfactorysociety.ca/\"\u003eArts Factory\u003c/a\u003e, just off Main \u0026amp; Broadway. I mainly create figurative abstraction work, but also dabble in colour studies. \u003ca href=\"https://saramolcan.com/\"\u003eMy full portfolio is located on my website\u003c/a\u003e. My work revolves around sex, memory, trauma, and identity. I\u0027m fascinated by manipulating colour to evoke different reactions in my viewer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I\u0027m extremely grateful for the popularity I gained during 2016 through Instagram, I started to become dissatisfied and frustrated with my art practice feeling overly commercial. I spent most of 2017 feeling lost and confused about why I even make art. I finally settled on a series of work I\u0027m excited to create. I\u0027ve been on Patreon since 2014 (whoa!) during my undergrad at Emily Carr University of Art + Design, and it feels like an appropriate platform to make work I am passionate about on a continuous basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(204, 193, 217);\"\u003eA little about Patreon\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a crowdfunding platform designed to help compensate creatives for the content they are already producing. Unlike Kickstarter or Indiegogo, Patreon is a recurring donation in smaller increments, designed like a tip for the work that you love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I create a painting, you\u0027re pledging to tip $1, $5, $10, (etcetera) per month I create work. In exchange you get small rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon only processes your charges on the first day of every month.
