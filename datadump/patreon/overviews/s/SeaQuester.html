    "summary": "Hello everyone and thanks for looking. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the artwork I create tends to be a bit shocking to most, and I\u0027d like to explain why I do it...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me first say that I do not believe in hurting or causing any pain or suffering to women, nor do I think it\u0027s alright for others to do it either!!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why do I create pictures like these? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since I was a teen, images of women in peril, stressful situations, pain and even dying, have fascinated me. One of my first girlfriends and I enjoyed a rich fantasy life, and we used to role play out fetish scenes that sometimes involved pretend death and surrender. She loved to play with prop guns and fake blood, with rough and (simulated) forced encounters, erotic asphyxia, and I certainly enjoyed playing along.\u00a0These kinds of images take me back to some of the fun things we did together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess it made an impression on me, because even though we went our separate ways many many years ago, I\u0027ve always looked back on our young sex life as some of the most fun and adventurous parts of my young life. Ever since, the sight of a beautiful woman playing dead or in mock peril has been a secret fantasy I\u0027ve had ever since. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral years ago I started playing with 3D rendering programs as a hobby, and began posting my artwork on one of the many sites dedicated to the craft. My pictures tended toward pinup art, since that type of work seemed to get more attention, views, and likes from the other members.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter posting an image with a slightly darker tone, one of my viewers told me about a large online community that caters to this particular fetish. After a quick search online I found that I wasn\u0027t alone in my interests, and found a group of folks whom I could share my ideas. I started creating images for some of those sites, and consider myself lucky to have many people who\u0027ve told me they enjoy my work, so I\u0027ve been doing it ever since.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m sure the general public feels death fetishists are one step away from being the next big serial killers, but for me, nothing could be further from the truth. The images I post are intended to be 100% fantasy and for mature audiences only! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know this work isn\u0027t for everyone, and I apologize if it offends some, but this hobby allows me to create and express the darker aspects of my imagination in a safe and creative way, and shares it with others who appreciate and enjoy it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re one of those folks who enjoy my artwork, I can\u0027t tell you how much I appreciate you, your comments, and your feedback. Please feel free to let me know what you like, or what I can improve, to make my artwork better and more interesting. Thank you very very much for looking in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eTom \"SeaQuester\""
