I started getting serious about it some where in middle school. It was in the dawn of high school when I wanted to be an animator, I did just that in college and now what I want to do is draw and make some stories; stories that are just burning inside me waiting to fire out. I still want to animate, but for the moment it\u0027s economically more exhausting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to spend days on end creating, but due to my current conditions, I don\u0027t have time, I\u0027m easily distracted, and I am a heavyweight procrastinator. The job market is being a bitch to me on frequent occasions and don\u0027t have much on my name. But I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY WANT TO CHANGE THAT!!!!! If you support me, it\u0027ll give me a good smack on the head and tell me to do something productive. Even if it\u0027s one person that\u0027s supporting me, that\u0027ll be enough motivation for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDeviant Art: Laborde91.deviantart.com\u003cbr\u003eE(x)hentai: Look for Skillet\u003cbr\u003ePixiv: \u003ca href=\"http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=14458933\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=14458933\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTumblr: Skillet91art.Tumblr.com/\u003cbr\u003eHentai Foundry: \u003ca href=\"http://www.hentai-foundry.com/user/Skillet91/profile\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.hentai-foundry.com/user/Skillet91/profile\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFuraffinity: \u003ca href=\"https://www.furaffinity.net/user/skillet91/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.furaffinity.net/user/skillet91/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMAKE ME PRODUCTIVE\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThey are subject to change.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWork will I be producing:\u003cbr\u003eToo many too count; Anything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e.......
