    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHey everyone! Ever since discovering shamisen in 2004, I\u0027ve pursued learning the construction and playing of the instrument with a passion. Not just for myself, but dedicating the past 11 years to develop educational resources, striving to make shamisen accessible for anyone in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA small sampling:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2008\u003c/strong\u003e: Authored Shamisen of Japan - the world\u0027s first detailed guidebook with step-by-step DIY instructions for building and playing shamisen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2011\u003c/strong\u003e: Founded \"Bachido,\" the world\u0027s first International Shamisen Community. Bachido focuses on bringing shamisen enthusiasts together from around the globe and provides them with resources, information and a supportive community to further their shamisen studies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2011\u003c/strong\u003e: I produced a free shamisen crash course and a whole line of very affordable shamisen video courses so anyone in the world could learn even without a local teacher. Later on, I collaborated with several like-minded professional shamisen enthusiasts to create a Shamisen Schoolhouse with a wide variety of lessons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2011:\u003c/strong\u003e I started a weekly video blog (The Bachido Blogcast), providing shamisen enthusiasts with entertaining episodes relating to shamisen, Bachido and meeting new shamisen enthusiasts. This series ran for 102 weekly episodes, most all of them filmed and edited my myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2013\u003c/strong\u003e to \u003cstrong\u003e2014\u003c/strong\u003e: I brought a team of Bachido members to Northern Japan to compete in the national shamisen tournament, winning 1st place (in 2014) and showing the Japanese shamisen world that international players are serious and dedicated to the instrument.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2015\u003c/strong\u003e: My shamisen partner Masahiro Nitta and I hosted the world\u0027s first intensive shamisen workshop called ShamiCamp, which brought together the best players in Japan to share their wisdom with shamisen enthusiasts from around the world. An event like this had *never* been done before, even in Japan!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2016\u003c/strong\u003e: I continued ShamiCamp by flying shamisen instructors to California in April ( \u003ca href=\"http://bachido.com/blog/shamicamp-california-a-look-back)\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://bachido.com/blog/shamicamp-california-a-look-back)\u003c/a\u003eas well as collaborating with \u0027Shamisen Berlin e.V\u0027 to bring ShamiCamp to Berlin in June (\u003ca href=\"http://bachido.com/blog/shamicamp-berlin-a-look-back).\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://bachido.com/blog/shamicamp-berlin-a-look-back).\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDedication: The required force\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExcept for the Bachido Store and the Minyo Collection (by TenTen), almost everything in Bachido is developed on my own. Being the main content producer at Bachido, the continued creation of new materials and content directly depends on my personal time and attention to make them. Since the beginning, I realized I had to invest my heart and soul into Bachido for it to grow into a strong community. So I\u0027ve dedicated 7 days a week to spreading the joy of shamisen. It\u0027s definitely a labor of love, and anything earned through Bachido goes directly towards investing in new Bachido projects or events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a few new projects I would like to start, which everyone involved in Bachido would enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e1. Starting FREE Live shamisen lessons using Facebook Live! (Free to the public, with tips being greatly appreciated)\u003cbr\u003e2. Producing new in-depth Shamisen Courses! (complete with notation and step-by-step chapters) \u003cbr\u003e3. Producing a brand new Monsters of Shamisen album!\u003cbr\u003e4. And more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are interested in shamisen and Bachido has touched you in some way, please consider making a small donation. Your generous contribution will directly help get these new projects off the ground!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBachi on!\u003cbr\u003eKyle Abbott\u003cbr\u003eFounder of Bachido\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
