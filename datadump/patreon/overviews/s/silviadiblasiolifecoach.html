When I\u0027m not working as career/life coach or workshop facilitator or consultant, I write: I love writing! (and reading)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I write about? I write about life and values, decision-making and choices, inner and social permaculture, transition, true resilience and sustainability, soulcraft and ecopsychology, career choices and life design.

I also believe that our answers are not to be found either \"out there\" or \"in here\" but in a combination that includes your ego, soul and spirit and as such, a combination of Nature, what you call \"I\" or \u0027me\" and the others humans and more-than humans (other species) around you...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI run a couple of \u003cstrong\u003eblogs\u003c/strong\u003e and support groups for people who want to re-connect with themselves, others and nature through soulcraft, nature-connections and holistic life coaching.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe all our planetary and social issues have one source: disconnection from ourselves, each other and the Earth. The grief from this disconnection is the source of all our addictions, anxiety, depressions, dysfunctional relationships and choices and, at the collective level, the source of inequality, waste, pollution, resource depletion and wars, among other things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal with this website and the monthly ebooks is to share tools and resources, exercises, activities and deep questions to help you to re-connect and heal the world, one person at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that no amount of life or career changes or activism will do enough if we don\u0027t work on our inner and relational world first. If you are curious about this, I invite you to step in and share this path with me...\u003cbr\u003e"
