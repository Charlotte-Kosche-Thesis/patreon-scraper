So I\u0027ll tell you up front that while I am today an award winning investigative journalist, I arrived in this role through a pretty unconventional career path -- one that led through Capitol Hill, insurgent political campaigns, Al Franken\u2019s radio show, a successful big city radio show of my own and most recently a hilarious \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjZ2R3f3bA0\"\u003erecurring role on an ABC prime time family sitcom\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eT\u003cimg src=\"http://davidsirota.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sirota-Bernie-015-300x238.jpg\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003ehe abbreviated highlights: 17 years ago I started out as the chief spokesperson for Bernie Sanders and went on to work on political campaigns. I then wrote wrote a trio of books that in succession exposed how \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hostile-Takeover-Corruption-Conquered-Government/dp/0307237354\"\u003ecorporate money shapes our political debate\u003c/a\u003e, spotlighted a growing \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Uprising-Unauthorized-Populist-Scaring-Washington/dp/0307395642/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\"\u003epopulist uprising\u003c/a\u003e against Washington and Wall Street, and then kinda sorta predicted that a \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Back-Our-Future-Now--Our-Everything/dp/0345518780/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\"\u003epolitics shaped by 1980\u2019s pop culture\u003c/a\u003e would become a huge political opportunity for a 1980s pop culture icon like Donald Trump.

After a terrific 4-year run, I moved on to becoming a full-time reporter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, I\u0027m an investigative journalist who covers the intersection of politics, money and big business. Over the course of the last few years, I have won \u003ca href=\"http://www.ithaca.edu/news/releases/independent-journalists-naomi-klein-and-david-sirota-share-annual-izzy-award-39431/\"\u003eawards\u003c/a\u003e, broken stories prompting legislation and government investigations, and been publicly attacked by politicians in both parties (most famously, Chris Christie melted down while delivering a press conference diatribe against me). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt such a critical time in history, when real journalism is under assault and yet so desperately needed, I hope you will become a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/sirota\"\u003emonthly subscriber to my podcast\u003c/a\u003e.
