    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePhantoms in Middleton Park\u003c/strong\u003e (P.I.M.P.) is a visual novel that is currently in development that is primarily set in Kim Possible and Danny Phantom show universe. You play as a man fresh from high school entering his freshmen year in college at Middleton University. Life has been mundane at best and because of that he is seeking for the college dream experience. Things quickly change for the player as he meets his new roommate Ron Stoppable and a unforeseen incident with Dr Drakken\u0027s new transportation invention.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisclaimer:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eThis project is a fan-based parody. All Shows used in this project are owned by their respected creators and/or companies. Shiza is not affiliated in any way, shape or form with these legal entities. All Characters have been aged up to 18 and take place in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project is currently developing a free demo for people to play. We highly recommend bookmarking this page and checking in later for a link to the demo. We have people who want to become early patrons for this project so the ability to donate a small amount to show support is available. Patrons will not be charged a monthly rate until we are confident in creating a decent amount of content on a monthly basis.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy should you support us?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support and the support of others we can make this passion project a reality. Everyone involved with this project has a drive to create and to show their talents off to others; no matter how lewd or obscene their work may be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now we will only have small amounts for patrons to contribute since we are still developing a demo. Once the demo is released to the public we will introduce more rewards tiers for patrons to choose from.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow far is the demo in development?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now we have the script, backgrounds and as much code that can be done with the available assets. The only thing left to work on is the Sprites and CG\u0027s. Once they are done and the project has been thoroughly tested for bugs we will release it to the public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would a typical update look like?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach update will either focus on the main story or a particular character(s). We do this so that each update will have a greater sense of progression and prevent updates seeming thin. A story update will be episodic in nature with elements of the main plot in each update to tie them together. A character update will focus on the relationship the player has with a given love interests and the characters that are associated with said love interest.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of sexual content will be in the finished game?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul style=\"\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eStripping and other forms of foreplay\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003eVanilla Sex (handjobs, blowjobs, etc)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnal\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCheerleaders\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTeachers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVillains\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSex Toys\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePublic Sex\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExhibitionism\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVoyeurism\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eShibari\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBDSM\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGroup Sex\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSpanking and other forms of impact play\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFire Play\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSpectrophilia (sex with ghosts)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
