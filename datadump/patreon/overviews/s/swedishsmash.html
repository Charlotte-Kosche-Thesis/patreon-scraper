    "summary": "Hi!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re a group of passionate tournament organizers that are in love with one specific franchise - Super Smash Bros.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe organize several events a year, including several monthly/weekly local tournaments throughout the country and put in blood, sweat and tears to make the tournaments as good as we possibly can. We do this for one sole reason - We love the community \u0026amp; the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, other things in life such as school, work or other duties more often than not stand in the way for us to host as many tournaments as we want to. There is no formal income for anyone involved with working with organizing smash tournaments and there is little possibility to receive respectable pay even for major smash tournaments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why we\u0027re here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor us to keep hosting high quality smash tournaments, making it a job is a dream all of us have. This means we can spend much more time on the administrative and practical work required for each tournament. Sometimes, hosting a major requires the equivalent of a full time job in working hours. All of this without gaining any economic compensation for the time we put in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNevertheless, we keep hosting the tournaments. We spend our time bringing the game, the community the best possible tournaments we can. If you love the hype, the upsets, the knees, the rests, the shines, the gimps and the scene, please consider helping us economically. In return, we bring you more tournaments. We bring you majors, continuosly professional streams, fantastic players and more of the game that you love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money you contribute with will be used to compensate each TO for the work they put into a tournament. We decide together how much a TO should be compensated\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e/Tristan \"Reverb\" Jakobsen, Filip \"Flippy\" Tengwall \u0026amp; Viktor \"VJ\" Johansson\u003cbr\u003e_____________________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow will it all happen?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money you contribute with will be used to compensate each TO for the work they put into a tournament. We decide together how much a TO should be compensated for each event. All of the payouts to TO\u0027s will be public and fully accounted for when asked about. We are very keen on making sure the scene stays trustworthy \u0026amp; alive.\u003cbr\u003e"
