    "summary": "Art in its various\nforms, whether sculpting, sketching, painting or photography is about\nself-expression. It gives the viewer a glimpse of the current stage of life the\nartist is in. As I travel through my different stages, currently it is outside\nthe box imagery. This normally includes beautiful bodies, mostly female, with\nthe occasional dash of males when they are available. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://subtle-shades.com/images/portfolio/onlocation/glamour-shoot-oklahoma-city.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith all the\ndiversity art has to offer. It is not for everyone. I believe that art should\nbe shared to only those interested. The female form is beautiful! Throw in out\nof the box concepts, props and different lighting techniques then you have a\ncompelling shot that tells a story. There is no right or wrong way to interpret\nan image. It is personal; it is unique. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you believe that the female body is\nbeautiful, if you like to look at images that are sexy and try to interpret the\nemotion captured, then I believe you will like my photography style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://subtle-shades.com/images/projects/best-body/best-body-parts-1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Tyme Cich, owner of Subtle Shades Photography. Although I work full time as a small business consultant. I spend most of my free time doing photography. Photography like any art is about capturing themes and subjects that interest me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs with any artist, I initially started shooting the very things everyone else did. Well it got boring. So I started focusing on content that peaked my interest. At the time I was living in Europe, Italy and Germany, so the subjects I photographed were sexy and glamorous, being it is a more accepting community. Now that I have moved back to Oklahoma, some of the artwork I produce is sometimes frowned upon.  This means a large number of my artwork never sees the light of day. What is art if I cannot share it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI built this Patreon page to have the opportunity to share my work with those that are interested in my particular style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://subtle-shades.com/images/portfolio/fashion/fashion-photographer-oklahoma.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I shoot?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMainly fine art nude work. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I keep everything tasteful, fun and artistic.  I accompany most of my images with erotic stories to help give my images depth. *Please note the stories attached to the images do not represent the actions of the models. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also frequently putting together themed projects to fine tune my skills as a photographer and experiment with different lighting setups. Some of my past projects include covering people up in liquid latex, placing seafood, Octopus/Lobsters on the bodies of beautiful women and have even tried making a zombie sex toy catalog. Like I said, not readily accepted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://subtle-shades.com/images/projects/fire-ice/fine-art-nude-oklahoma-9.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere will the contributions go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of these projects come at a cost. Constantly upgrading camera gear and equipment, props, lighting and hiring models quickly drains the budget. With the help of Patrons, like you, I\u0027m able to acquire the necessary things to continue these projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on your level of support, the rewards range from digital to physical. \u003cbr\u003ePhysical rewards:\u003cbr\u003e12\" x 18\" two-sided poster with erotic story\u003cbr\u003ePrinted erotic story with accompanying images (6-12 pages)\u003cbr\u003eEmbossed Limited Edition prints\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDigital rewards:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFull access to lingerie and cheekier photosets\u003cbr\u003eAccess to previous photo set archives\u003cbr\u003eDownloadable images\u003cbr\u003eDepending on demand, if you would rather have a digital copy of booklets.

(IE: If you signed up for a $25 tier on January 5th, you will not be charged until February 1st, making you not eligible for the January rewards.)  I understand every month may not be the same as the last, and not everyone can be consistently subscribed, therefore missing sets that they may have wanted.
