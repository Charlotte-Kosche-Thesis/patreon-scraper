Now I work with sheet metal, cutting it down by hand to bring out the piece I imagine. As I finish my college degree in Jewelry and Metals I have had the opportunity to show my work in local, regional and international shows. But more than anything I want to make jewelry for my living. I am hoping this will help me reach that goal!",
