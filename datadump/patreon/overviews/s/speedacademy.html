    "summary": "Hello Patrons of the digital arts, connoisseurs of the internal combustion engine, and lovers of modified cars and grassroots racing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe time has come for us to ask for a little help, because the struggle is real and so is the frost bite. As you may know from watching our videos the past 2 winters, our shop space is unheated, plus the ceiling is too low for a lift and the washroom doesn\u0027t have a fan (Peter has a very high fibre diet). Oh, and without 240v power Peter can\u0027t show off his mediocre TIG welding skills properly either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re not looking to equip a Formula 1 quality shop with your money. We\u0027re just hoping you like what we do enough that you\u0027d like to see us work out of a shop that doesn\u0027t limit our productivity or motivation to build badass cars and shoot fun and informative videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s our primary goal here, to find enough Patrons that we can afford to rent a better work space. But before that, we\u0027re looking to rent the storage unit next to our existing work space so that we can clear out some of the mess and have room for a couple of new and exciting projects we\u0027ve got planned for the summer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless, we\u0027re going to keep on wrenching and documenting the motoring mayhem, but we\u0027d be eternally grateful if you decide to pitch in a few bucks to help us keep on living the dream and sharing the experience with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xat1/t31.0-8/11051773_1654696224761461_1752066344711136110_o.jpg\"\u003e"
