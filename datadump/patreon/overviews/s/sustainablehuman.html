We use this information in order to figure out how we can best meet our physical, emotional, and communal needs. Depending on the dominant story that is told, people will behave in radically different ways to do what they believe will better meet their real or perceived needs. Sometimes our efforts succeed and we experience true bliss and contentment. But if our story is too limiting to provide outlets for its members to meet their true needs, the entire society will eventually break down. The takeaway here is that every human behavior, whether benevolent or malevolent, is an attempt to meet either a physical or emotional need and that the stories we believe greatly impact our ability to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Kind Of Thinking Is Causing Our Own Extinction?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eModern civilization is based on a kind of thinking that believes that human beings are separate from Nature. This story, which is reinforced through religion, economics, and science says that Nature is basically dead matter with no inherent purpose of its own which allows us to do whatever we wish to it without remorse. Because we don\u0027t see ourselves as part of Nature, we think that any harm we cause to it won\u0027t affect us. We treat Nature as a limitless supply of raw materials to fuel our economy with a limitless capacity to absorb our waste as we aim to keep growing the economy indefinitely. This story of separation is not new. It has been with us since the birth of agriculture some 10,000 years ago. It\u0027s only been in the last century that our impact has gotten to large for the planet to absorb. From this story of separation, anything that inhibits growth of the crop (or the economy today) is bad or evil and must be overcome. In this narrative, environmentalists become progress or growth inhibitors. All of this stems from this fundamental belief that humanity is separate from Nature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Kind Of Thinking Is Necessary To Prevent Our Extinction?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need to shift this underlying story to one that is based on the truth that humanity has always been and will always be part of Nature. We are dependent on the sun to provide energy to grow food. We are dependent on the air to live which is created for us (for free) by tiny little organisms in the ocean. We are an integral part of this community of life with the ability to observe and replicate healthy patterns that help life in all of its diversity to thrive. When we realize that Nature is also part of us, we will easily see that when we destroy it, we also destroy ourselves. Ecocide is just as illogical as suicide because they are one in the same. When we live from a story in which humans are part of Nature, we will become not only sustainable but regenerative. Because our current stories tell us the opposite, many people living today do not understand this simple truth that all life is interconnected.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Can We Change The Way We Think?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis really is the most important question. Past conquerors have used the method of \"believe my story or die\" but I don\u0027t think that will work too well with modern humans. We kind of like our freedom to choose. Often, we will even rebel against ideas that are good for us if we receive them by force. The only way to change the way we think is for us to individually and voluntarily choose to think in a different way. Think back in your own life at a time when you changed the way you thought about something. Usually, we have some kind of experience that our old way of thinking can\u0027t explain. A new way of thinking was required to understand what happened to us. Our global story changes when enough individuals can no longer accept that story and begin living from another one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn many respects, the story of separation is crumbling all around us. The more the economy grows, the more isolated and lonely we become, and the harder it becomes to participate. The story loosens its grip over us and we become open to alternatives that are better able to help us meet our needs. Humans are social beings. We need to feel like we belong, like we matter, and we need to feel loved. This is a core human need. When these needs aren\u0027t met, we will engage in really weird and potentially destructive behaviors to try to meet them. The new stories we tell need to be grounded in the values of empathy, compassion, cooperation, and love so that people can meet these core human needs without being conned into buying some new fancy product or service.\u003cbr\u003e"
