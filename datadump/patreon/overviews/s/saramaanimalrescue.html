    "summary": "My name is Laura Miller.\u00a0 I started volunteering in animal shelters many years ago as something to do in my spare time.\u00a0\u00a0 I had no idea that walking into a shelter the winter of 2003 would change my life forever. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was taken back at how many animals were in shelters, how many more needed rescue and how many were being euthanized because no one adopted them.\u00a0 I was also saddened by witnessing the stress the animals go through when entering the shelter and sometimes, their mental deterioration when being kenneled too long. These animals were being judged unfairly and sometimes ended up either living their life in a kennel or were euthanized.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter working and volunteering in different shelters for over a decade, I, along with my co-founder Diana Seoane set out to create a rescue that developed a program for these animals that were being overlooked for adoption because they were stressed out in the shelter environment and also programs that prevented people from surrendering their animals in the first place when possible.\u00a0 And Sarama Animal Rescue was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, our rescue has grown a lot. In addition to our adoption program we have developed our Sanctuary Program.\u00a0 This program is for animals that due to special behavioral challenges (sometimes from being kenneled too long though that\u0027s not always the sole factor) or medical needs remain under Sarama\u0027s care in a foster home where they receive individualized attention and can live out their life in a comfortable home instead of a kennel. We have also developed many preventative programs to reduce the number of animals coming into rescue and shelter such as a TNR program for community cats, Community Outreach (providing food, supplies and basic medical care for owners going through a difficult time), a Behavior Program where we provide free consults and training for animals and their owners who are experiencing fixable or manageable behavioral\u00a0 issues. We also have a Humane Education and\u00a0 a sanctuary for farm animals program in the works. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout your support, none of this would be possible. Many of our animals have extensive medical needs or need long term behavioral management. The costs can add up very quickly. Becoming a Patreon will help us have a steady flow of income to care for these animals that have no other place to go and also give us the confidence to help more animals.\u00a0 You can make a difference in the lives of animals by donating just $1 a month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe cannot thank you enough for your support. Thank you for helping save these animals and making the world a more compassionate place. \u003cbr\u003e"
