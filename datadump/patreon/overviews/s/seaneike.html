    "summary": "Hello! My name is Sean Eike and I am an Illustrator, painter, designer, storyboard artist, and sometimes writer. I\u0027m from Des Moines, Iowa but am making the beautiful Central Coast of California my base of operations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have spent years trying to work a 9 to 5 job(s) while hoping someday to put my artwork forward. Well, it\u0027s time to stop wishing and start doing. What your patronage will do will give me the most valuable thing... TIME. Time to do my work instead of picking up an second shift so that bills get paid. Time I don\u0027t have to spend with my creditors asking for more time to pay a bill... because I can pay the bills on time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, so I\u0027ve done a lot of work since 2004 but a vast majority of the world has never heard of me. It\u0027s fair to hold your reservations. That\u0027s why I\u0027m making the initial investment in me so cheap... just $3.00 a month. With that you\u0027ll see the comic strip that I was going to make anyway. It\u0027s called \u003cstrong\u003eKIT WARNING\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and it\u0027s about a space adventurer who has to stop Nacht from taking over the known universe... but what else stands in her way? It\u0027s in a magazine comic format, 8 pages per episode and will have a 12 month run.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe bigger the patron pool, the more work I am able to get done. It\u0027s just that simple.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to view my Patreon. Your interest in the arts is inspiring. I think you\u0027ll like what I have planned because for the first time in my career, I\u0027m doing something straight from the heart and I hope that it will continue throughout all of my other work."
