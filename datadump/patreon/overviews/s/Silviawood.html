    "summary": "I am a multi-medium artist who uses vegan and cruelty-free products as a form of animal rights activism. With your support we can encourage the education of animal rights issues and the use of cruelty-free/vegan products in the artist community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started my professional art career I wanted to align my morals with my passions. As an animal rights advocate, I needed to ensure the art materials I used weren\u0027t the product of cruelty. I researched how various art products are manufactured and I quickly became aware that numerous products contained animal ingredients like natural hair, charred bones, gallbladders and boiled skin. I had never known any of this before, and I knew I didn\u0027t want to support it any further. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo my relief, alternatives are plentiful and easy to find. Not only is there a plethora of cruelty free and vegan options within popular brands, but there are also entirely vegan companies dedicated to producing products for artists.  Although this information was easy to find, it is not generally well known. Most people aren\u0027t aware of the cruelty that takes place in the manufacturing of art products, let alone the idea of having other options to choose from. I decided that making the change for myself wasn\u0027t enough. Companies dedicated to animal-free products weren\u0027t getting enough exposure, and the brands that had options were focusing on promoting other products. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI replaced all of my old art products, and started recording myself making art with every vegan medium I could find. The more art products I could veganize, the more people I could share this message with.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLooking forward I hope to foster a community dedicated to creative expression without need for cruelty. I will strive to educate others, and act as a resource for informative and inspiring content. I hope you will join me on this journey. I am Silvia Wood and art is my activism.\u003cbr\u003e"
