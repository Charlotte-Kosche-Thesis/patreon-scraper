    "summary": "I\u0027m Jon F. Zeigler. I\u0027ve been writing science fiction (and occasional fantasy) for over twenty years now, but to this point it\u0027s all been on the basis of other people\u0027s original work. I also worked as a freelance author for the tabletop roleplaying game industry for over a decade, writing and editing books for publishers like FASA and Steve Jackson Games. More recently, I\u0027ve been writing fan-fiction for games that I like, and also writing and working to sell original fiction. My \u003cem\u003ecurriculum vitae\u003c/em\u003e to date \u003ca href=\"https://sharrukinspalace.com/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecan be found here\u003c/a\u003e, if you\u0027re interested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough most of my original fiction goes to the traditional markets for sale first, I\u0027m also beginning to produce a few stories for self-publication. Furthermore, I\u0027m currently working on a substantial book-length project, which is likely to be self-published.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings me to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a mechanism that allows you to support the work of artists, musicians,\u00a0and writers who might want to earn a living with their creative work . . . but in many cases they aren\u0027t quite there yet, and in fact some of us may \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e get to quit the day job. (That\u0027s me. Most definitely.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s the deal. As I prepare stories or book chapters for self-publication, I\u0027ll make them available here for you. Eventually that material will be published elsewhere, with more polish and a price tag attached, but for now they\u0027re free. Enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf things go as planned, then about once a month I\u0027ll release a fair-sized piece of new material. Some of this material will be based on real-world science. Other pieces will be science fiction or fantasy, at the short-story or novelette length.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re wondering what kind of fiction I\u0027m most fond of? Space opera, historical fantasy, and similar adventure-filled genres. Authors whom I\u0027ve considered a significant influence include Poul Anderson, Steven Baxter, Gregory Benford, David Brin, Larry Niven, Mary Renault, Alastair Reynolds, and Roger Zelazny.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce a month, on the average? Maybe I\u0027ll get really inspired one month, who knows? As a patron, you can always put a cap on how much you\u0027re willing to spend on me per month. I promise that won\u0027t make any difference to when or how I work. I\u0027m not going to write too quickly or try to hold back, just to squeeze a few more dollars out of our relationship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, as a patron you\u0027ll be getting to see stories and other material in production. I want you to be as involved in my writing process as you like - and if you have any feedback for me, great! You\u0027re likely to have an influence on my evolution as a writer as a result.\u003cbr\u003e"
