I\u2019m a Czech alternative model currently residing in York, mainly focusing on modeling latex. In the short time I do latex\nmodeling I had an opportunity to collaborate with amazing brands like Inner\nSanctum, Bondinage, Lovely Latex, Yummy Gummy Sheet Latex, Kurage, Catriona\nStewart Clothing and many more.  I worked\nwith photographers like bommi, \u00c1lex P\u00e9rez, Phoebus Kalista, Damien Thorn\nPhotography, Karolina Ryvolova Photography, Danny Worm Photographer and others.\nAnd I have been published internationally on several occasions in magazines\nlike Kultur Mag, Bedeseme, Cynical Fashion Magazine or\u00a0most recently in Femme Rebelle Magazine March Issue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also started my fitness\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://satoriafitnessblog.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Satoriafitblog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e where I post\ntraining lists and food plans weekly and plan to post more about motivation,\ninspirative people, own recipes, videos from my trainings etc in the future...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \n\nBut, \u003cstrong\u003ewhy should you support\nme\u003c/strong\u003e? Besides the fact that you will get some awesome perks in return from me,\nthis is an amazing way to support me as a model and help me make my dreams come\ntrue. It\u0027s a chance to be a part of a change in the alternative industry, where\nmodels are still mainly seen as unworthy of pay as most of the magazines,\nphotographers, brands etc. is now used to run the bussiness the TFP way and\nmodel\u2019s salary is supposed to be the promotion she might and might not get or\nthe photos only. \u003cstrong\u003eWith your help\u003c/strong\u003e I\ncould do more for my fans and meet more of them at the international events\nthan I can afford to visit now. With your help my dreams as traveling or taking\nmy modeling to a next level would be possible.\u003cbr\u003e \n\nHaving a Patreon ensures that I can continue to do what I\nlove, providing you with not only content, but actual physical items such as\nthe\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003esigned\nprints \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eand with your support\nhopefully other merchandise soon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nPlease, consider backing me! xxx\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll the beautiful cover photo images were taken by NEWO Imagery and can be seen on mine or her FB page in full \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003eDesigners: Mystic Thread, Creations by Liv Free, Wyte Phantom, Erica Court Couture, Zhyon, Hysteria Machine, Gemma J Millinery, Misty Couture\u003cbr\u003eMUAH: me and Chloe Louise Gorton\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
