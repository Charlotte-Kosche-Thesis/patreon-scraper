    "summary": "Autumn 2014, friend and colleague\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.unlockastrology.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSamuel F. Reynolds\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eco-created \u003cstrong\u003eInternational Society of Black Astrologers\u003c/strong\u003e (ISBA) in response to Ferguson. And otherwise\u00a0to locate and connect more black astrologers with one another. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn tandem to ISBA\u0027s creation, I observed \u003ca href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FAstroDatabank.com%2F\u0026amp;h=gAQHMgmwg\u0026amp;s=1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAstroDatabank.com\u003c/a\u003e - perhaps the world\u0027s best and largest birth data set - has only tagged some of its entrants as African-American (AfAm) or Black. Some of those entries have since been updated accordingly, while a good few others need similar updates. And still,\u00a0a great number of black names are absent from AstroDatabank. For example, multi-talented Grammy-award winner \u003cem\u003eJill Scott\u003c/em\u003e is not entered whatsoever, yet\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Roberts,_Jett_Hamilton\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eher six year old son\u003cem\u003e Jett\u003c/em\u003e is\u003c/a\u003e. Superstar \u003cem\u003eJanet Jackson\u003c/em\u003e is entered, though with two different birth times. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this got me thinking:\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ehave m/any famous black folks even been ASKED for their actual birth data (time, date and place)?\u003c/strong\u003e Is this an opportunity to give both #astrology AND #blacklivesmatter greater visibility? And why haven\u0027t more people - black and otherwise - been asked for their birthdata with so many ways these days to ask them?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeemingly they have not been asked. And there is a great opportunity here to show how astrology is useful in one\u0027s life journey using famous folk\u0027s stories as examples for others to observe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll that in my mind, the idea to pull together this project,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://vegand.net/digest/category/astrology/starshine/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStarshine 2020\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, emerged. This project aims to collect quality birthdata for at least 2,000 famous \u003cstrong\u003eliving\u003c/strong\u003e black people through calendar year 2020. Each person collected will receive a write up formatted for inclusion on astrology wikis. Some entrants will receive a year ahead forecast written about them on a blog post \u00a0that will be pushed out through social media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNoting black here includes all people of African descent, whether they\u0027re from the U.K., Japan, Australia, Canada, the Caribbean or certainly Africa itself. Of course, black also includes African-Americans. \u003c/em\u003eIdris Elba\u003cem\u003e, for example, is Afro-British or such, not African-American. Likewise with singer-actress \u003c/em\u003eRihanna\u003cem\u003e or the iconic \u003c/em\u003eGrace Jones\u003cem\u003e\u00a0can be considered Afro-Caribbean. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo foster commitment and quality, plus gauge interest from both a general audience and the astrological community worldwide, this community project is being crowdfunded. Initial results and experiences will be shared in a live presentation at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/117579958580897/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eISAR\u0027s 2016 Symposium in Costa Mesa, CA\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting up this project proposal, presentation, and Patreon pitch page leaves me wondering \u2014 what if U.S. Senator and rising politician \u003cem\u003eBarack Obama\u003c/em\u003e had been asked for, and shared, his birth time with a requesting astrologer well before all the birther hoopla. How might that have been helpful to him, and to the often under appreciated usefulness of astrology.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[cover image by \u003cem\u003ePriya Kale\u003c/em\u003e of \u003ca href=\"http://www.cosmicdiaries.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCosmic Diaries\u003c/a\u003e]\u003cbr\u003e"
