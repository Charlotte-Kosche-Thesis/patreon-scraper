    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWHY ARE WE ON PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf it\u2019s not obvious from our streams, our technology isn\u2019t the best. Star experiences issues with her computer shutting down constantly (#savelaptop), and not having the power to run editing software well, while Vade lacks acoustic foam and other soundproofing to get a rich sound quality. Both of us honestly love voice acting to death, and we want to bring you the best quality content we can. Any sort of donation at all would help immensely, and we would appreciate every penny. Since the Thought and big projects similar to that were received so well, we want to be able to bring you bigger and more ambitious projects, even to release original productions of our own one day. We love you guys so much, so we just want to be the best for you all that we can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOUR GOALS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we\u2019re in need of new equipment, there\u2019s another, perhaps larger part of our team that needs support as well. For those of you who don\u2019t know, there are several people that are part of the Starbot Dubs team that, without their support, there\u2019s no way we\u2019d be where we are today. The first we need to mention is Max Allen, or Max Out Of Ten, the creator of Asriel\u2019s Awakening. Max is a person who is incredibly talented at editing and animation, is passionate, hardworking, and wants to make the best content possible for all of you. However, he\u2019s had some trouble with university, and because of this he\u2019s found himself with little time and motivation to maintain a regular upload schedule. It\u2019s our goal that, if our Patreon reaches $3000, we can pay Max a full time wage and allow him to work on his personal projects and to help us on the channel full time. This\u2019ll mean he can make a new episode of Asriel\u2019s Awakening much quicker, completing an episode a month alongside helping us on the channel with his mysterious talented birdlike ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT NEXT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we reach that goal, the rest of the overflow will go directly to our other two artists, Cat and Hawker. They have their own Patreon pages, but the life of an artist in college is a tough one and they each need as much help as they can get. Furthermore, if the money starts getting CRAZY we\u2019ll have more funding to start organising fan meetups, going to conventions, and hopefully starting some larger scale projects that we hope you guys will really enjoy. We want to do our best to make all you guys happy and here\u0027s the chance to make it happen. Thanks for reading, and we hope you consider taking part!\u003cbr\u003e"
