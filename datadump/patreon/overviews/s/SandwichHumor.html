    "summary": "For over four years now, the Sandwich Humor Team has been bringing weekly podcast episodes of Truth-Time Theatre to a ravenous and appreciative audience via iTunes and Stitcher as a proud member of the HearUsTalk Network. In the beginning we were dedicated to constant involvement from our loyal listeners via emails, message boards and social media. Lately, we have strayed from that and we want nothing more than to return to those roots. But there\u0027s a catch. As we\u0027ve progressed as a show over the years, the costs of providing high quality weekly content have gone up. Studio costs, new gear, bandwidth, domain fees and a new remote set-up are not free, but our show still is. Thus, your help is needed and much appreciated. By becoming a pledging patron, you will be rewarded with some brand new content, personalized on-air involvement, Truth-Time Theatre gear and much more. We want to bring our listeners back into the mix and this is a great way to rejuvenate that very interactivity.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Additionally, we aim to venture back into film making and producing more online digital media and web series\u0027. These new ventures will require your help as well. We hope to provide an abundance of entertainment in multiple formats to continue to build our brand and we hope you all would like to be a part of that trip with us."
