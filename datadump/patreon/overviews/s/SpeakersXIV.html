The video series takes a lot of \u003cem\u003etime\u003c/em\u003e and the work that\u0027s put into it is hopefully apparent in the end products. However, due to the trainwreck that is YouTube\u0027s ad system at the moment, most of our content is demonetized from the second it\u0027s uploaded, meaning we earn disturbingly little on our work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe number one complaint we recieve on our channel and videos is:\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\"I love your videos, but you don\u0027t release them fast enough!!!\"\u003c/blockquote\u003eAnd that is absolutely true. We don\u0027t release our videos regularly. We have finally caught up on the podcasts, and the video series are now running on a schedule. But what people often forget to think about is this; it\u0027s not our job. We really wish it was.
