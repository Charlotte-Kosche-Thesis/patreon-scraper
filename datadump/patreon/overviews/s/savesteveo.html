    "summary": "\u003ch4 style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWe invite you to join us in our quest to #SaveSteveo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSteve Robles is a 49-year-old man with a terminal illness: end-stage renal failure. In order to stay alive while waiting for a new kidney, Steve endures dialysis sessions four times a week.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eLike many, you probably don\u2019t know much about dialysis or the process involved in getting a new kidney. Steve wants to raise awareness around kidney-related medical care issues and shed light on what limited options exist for someone in his position. Steveo, as his friends know him, has been battling this disease on his own for years and now his friends are coming together to ask for your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin us to help #SaveSteveo\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re not familiar with dialysis, a good intro is to watch the recent \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw_nqzVfxFQ\"\u003eJohn Oliver expos\u00e9 on for-profit dialysis centers\u003c/a\u003e. Steve\u2019s chances of survival decrease the longer he\u2019s on dialysis. After five years, the dialysis patient mortality rate is 65%. Steve has been on dialysis for three years. His health problems even led him recently to collapse from heat exhaustion, something so serious\u003ca href=\"http://fox40.com/2017/09/03/extreme-heat-car-theft-may-have-triggered-medical-emergency-for-man-attending-chalk-it-up-festival/\"\u003e it ended up on local news\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe key to surviving end-stage renal failure is a kidney donor. Currently, there are over 93,000 people on the kidney transplant waiting list. The wait to receive a kidney from a deceased donor is about 5 years, and in some states it\u2019s closer to 10 years.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003ePatients are prioritized by a variety of factors, but 80% of people on the waiting list are those undergoing kidney dialysis. The longer a person is on dialysis before receiving a transplant, the more grim the prognosis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn average, receiving a kidney transplant can double someone\u2019s life expectancy. Steveo needs a kidney in order to survive. Steve has been told he may have to wait as long as six to nine years more for a transplant at this rate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSteve is on one waiting list to potentially receive a kidney. What you may not know is that not all waiting lists are equal. Organ donation is organized by geographic region and some regions have more demand than others. Overall, a shortage of kidneys exists due to our nationwide epidemics of diabetes, heart disease, and opioid abuse.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThe key to getting a donation sooner is to work with multiple donation regions. But getting on each list is its own individual process, with individual requirements, and individual costs. It\u2019s expensive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDialysis is a painful and debilitating process that leaves the people undergoing it drained and  needing recovery time. Before the diagnosis, Steve was at the top of his career, working two great jobs at once: a writer, a DJ, and the kind of guy who was the life of the party--always happy to lend an ear in a crisis.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eSince then, Steve has been unemployed, on disability, needing in-home care, and the pile of bills (both medical and non-medical) continues to rack up. On his own, Steveo isn\u2019t going to make it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut you can help #SaveSteveo\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re raising funds to get Steve on multiple donation lists. We\u2019re also trying to help him get back on his feet by offsetting all the uncovered expenses that come with fighting this condition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne-time donations are greatly appreciated. But monthly recurring donations will make a world of difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e$5/month buys Steve a day\u2019s meal. He gets $40/month in food stamps, but that isn\u2019t enough to cover it all.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e$10/month pays out-of-pocket costs that fill one of Steveo\u2019s medications for the month.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e$20/month helps Steve cover transportation costs for two trips to dialysis.

A basic necessity the rest of us take for granted.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA month of internet service so Steve can stay in touch with friends and keep his spirits up.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e$100/month or more goes toward the cost of helping Steve get on another donor list. Each list\u2019s assessment process costs $1500.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge of support helps #SaveSteveo. He can\u2019t do it alone, but together we can keep Steveo fighting for his life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll donations are truly appreciated no matter the size. If you\u2019re unable to provide financial support, you can still help by sharing his story and rallying additional support to #SaveSteveo.\u003cbr\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re not comfortable donating via this platform, you can also send contributions in the name of Steve Robles to Postmates or Lyft.
