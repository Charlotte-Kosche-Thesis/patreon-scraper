I was a teenage welfare mom. \u003cbr\u003eI had\nlearned pretty early on that life was about struggle.\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\nwas no room for art. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut\nArt continued to call. I finally answered and my life has changed in\nso many ways. \n\u003cbr\u003eYou see, I\ndiscovered that art had the ability to completely alter my inner\nlandscape, to open me up to possibility, and help me make sense of my\nplace in the world. \u003cbr\u003eIt became my way of prayer.\u003cbr\u003e\nAs\na result, I have been creating mixed-media paintings, paper clay\nart dolls, and online workshops for the last 5 years. \u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to\nhelp you discover the ways in which art can change your life. My art\nand workshops are designed to inspire you to dream, to remind you of\nall that you already know, and to help you discover the best parts of\nyourself. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\ncan\u0027t imagine doing anything else with my life. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow\nI want to do more and I\u2019d LOVE for you to be part of it with me.\u003cbr\u003e\nThrough\nyour subscription to my Patreon page, I will have the resources to\ncreate more art and more content (think ongoing workshop series,\ntutorials, vlogs, books!). And you my friend, will have access to as little or as much as you want. You decide when you select your subscription tier!\u003cbr\u003e\nI\nwant to create community; a space where we can spread our creative\nwings together. I want to share the ins an the outs of this messy and\nbeautiful journey and I want inspire you on your own.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe\nability to create isn\u0027t reserved for the special. It is for all of\nus.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYou\nare Divine. You are Sacred. You are Love and Wisdom personified. Your\nsoul knows this. Your mind has forgotten. My work aims to remind\nyou.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e"
