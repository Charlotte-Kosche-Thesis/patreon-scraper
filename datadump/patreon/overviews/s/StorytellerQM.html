    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Storyteller. I write interactive fiction (quests) and stories over at anonkun.com, usually with fantasy and lesbian themes. I\u0027ve already written a really long (too long), complete story called The Evoker, and I like to think it was pretty okay. You can read it here, if you like. It\u0027s got magic, romance, adventure, and plenty of excellent fanart from some wonderful fans. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://anonkun.com/stories/The-Evoker-%28-u--Fantasy-CYOA%29/f4780fce-e00d-44e4-a97f-9ebbeca466c9\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://anonkun.com/stories/The-Evoker-%28-u--Fanta...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d really love to write more stories for those who enjoyed The Evoker, or anything else I\u0027ve written, and also for anyone else who happens to pop in for a read. Unfortunately, life has a habit of getting in the way of that sort of thing, and this is one of those times. Without going into much detail, while I\u0027d very much like to get back to writing full-time like I used to, I really can\u0027t afford to be doing that without help. With just a bit of support from generous readers, I can start writing my next big quest, and possibly even juggling more stories and content depending on what you guys want. It\u0027d mean the world to me to be able to write comfortably without having to worry overly much about my bills and money situation as much. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I\u0027d love to start writing the next chapter in my Evoker universe, Ember\u0027s Edge, but I need your help if I\u0027m going to do that! \u003cbr\u003e"
