    "summary": "Metal band Second To Sun was founded by its guitarist and mastermind Vladimir Lehtinen after leaving his previous black metal project Utenomjordisk Hull in 2011. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014, Second To Sun acquired their first full line-up consisting of Vladimir Lehtinen (guitar), Alexander Burlakov (guitar), Anton Danilevsky (bass), and Theodor Borovsky (drums). This was the line-up with which the band released its first EP \u2013 \u201cThree Fairy Tales\u201d. This release helped determine the further direction of the band \u2013 specifically, delving deeper into Scandinavian black metal influences and implementing ethnic musical instruments and motives of Finno-Ugric people. This EP quickly reached the top of Russian iTunes and Google Play metal charts and held its position for almost a month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond To Sun\u2019s idea of lyrics is rather peculiar, as, unlike most other bands, they communicate the concepts behind their songs using unique artwork and extensive backstories for each individual track. These stories are usually rooted in mythology, all kinds of fiction, or real historical events. All artwork for the band is created by Aleh Zielankievi\u010d from Belarus. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015, Second To Sun released their album \u201cThe First Chapter\u201d with the line-up consisting of Vladimir and Theodor. This album stayed at the top of Russian iTunes and Google Play metal charts for a month and a half and was released in both digital and physical format. In some countries this album was criticized for its insufficient length, however the album still sold several thousand digital copies in CIS countries and all physical copies were sold out in less than one week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016 band releases multiple covers of songs by classic black metal acts, as well as a cover of a song by Bones. In the middle of the year, the band re-releases its first album - the release is called \u201cGal Agnostiske Dr\u00f8mmer\u201d and is a conceptual album with vocals similar to those of classical \u201craw\u201d 90-s black metal. On November 16th, band presents instrumental album titled \u201cBlackbound\u201d. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017 the band starts working with a vocalist \u2013 Gleb Sysoev from Siberian black metal band \u201cUltar\u201d. The band releases two instrumental singles and announces two albums, one of which is the reissued version of \u201cThe First Chapter\u201d with vocals. On July 29th the band releases a compilation of covers titled \u201cMiscellaneous Covers: Volume 1\u201d, and on August 21sr the group presents the new vocal edition of \u201cThe Frist Chapter\u201d in digital format and on CDs \u2013 remixed, remastered, and with new arrangements and artwork."
