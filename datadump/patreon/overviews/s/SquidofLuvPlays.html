I enjoy creating guides, tutorials, ship reviews and gameplay videos, trying to not only discover everything that Star Citizen has to offer but also help other players. Star Citizen is more than a game though, is a Universe with rich lore and history, full of Alien races and mystery, something that fascinates me a lot!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn my site \u003ca href=\"https://squidoflove.com/\"\u003ewww.squidoflove.com\u003c/a\u003e you can find many ship reviews and guides about every aspect of Star Citizen. My plan is to create a little place on the internet where you will be able to find anything you need to have fun in this amazing game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInitially i started uploading videos on YouTube, as a hobby, a way to spend my day and have fun. Quickly after that, i realized that creating and uploading content on a platform like YouTube, was something very fulfilling. What started as a hobby, turned into a way to express myself, my opinions and an attempt to help others. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eWhat i enjoy the most though, is interacting with my viewers, reading your comments, hearing your opinions and talking to you.\u003c/strong\u003e I dare say that this type of interaction is the best part of my day and i am always excited to read a new comment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Creating videos on YouTube is something more than a hobby to me now and part of my everyday life. But unfortunately trying to make it on YouTube is not that easy. The cost to maintain a high quality channel and a decent equipment can be really high. \u003cstrong\u003eThis is why your support is very important.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me on Patreon, you can help me make the channel self sustaining and focus on creating more and better videos. Patreon is a subscription system, like an ongoing kick-starter campaign and it gives you the opportunity to support me and my channel. By pledging and becoming my patron you give me the ability to continue creating my content without any fear for the future, without being constantly stressed about views and YouTube\u0027s ad revenue. Even 1$ per month is a huge help. With your ongoing assistance i can focus on creating videos and work into improving their quality faster, it will be also easier to perform very important for the channel upgrades. \u003cstrong\u003eOf course i want you to pledge only if you feel comfortable and can afford to do it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Thank you very much for your support.\u003cbr\u003eSquid.\u003cbr\u003e"
