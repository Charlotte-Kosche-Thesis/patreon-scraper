    "summary": "Thank you for joining my page and I hope you enjoy the photos I take. I am hoping to establish myself so when I retire I can use my photography for income to supplement my life. Photography has always been something I\u0027ve enjoyed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been taking photos as long as I can remember but really got into my senior year of high school when I took and actual class. It was only for B\u0026amp;W photos but I learned so much and still love taking B\u0026amp;W photos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI even have a collection of old and even antique cameras. I have been experimenting with the older ones learning to take pictures with them. Which is harder than you would think for as you would be amazed how much you get used to digital photography. I am planning at some point when I get some actual good photos with either of them to share those with you but it may be a while as the file is expensive so I do not buy it very often.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis is my first try in actually going somewhere with my photography but if you do not give what you love a shot you will never know if you could do something with it so here I go giving it a shot. Join me on my journey if you can every dollar helps so if you can only give $1 that is still helping me out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for having faith in me\u00a0"
