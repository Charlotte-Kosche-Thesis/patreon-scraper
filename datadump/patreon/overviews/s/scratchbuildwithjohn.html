My name is John Dutton and I have been developing ScratchbuildwithJohn\npassionately for 8 years. I have built, and am building some cutting edge\nmodels some of which cannot be found elsewhere. \nI have a U-Tube channel and of course a web page\nScratchbuildwithJohn.com. I have over 400 videos on my page. It is unique and\neverything is free. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have created this page as I need funding.  Last year I became very sick. I have a brain\ntumour and I am pleased to say I am doing well, but this will not last. It is\none of those.. I am not working and find great pleasure in my modeling. But, I\nam not working. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI realised this was a problem when I was making the movie set\nfor \u2018newbies.\u2019 I was describing my every day tools and suddenly found myself at\na blank. Couldn\u2019t remember the name of a saw. When I got to Hospital the doctor\nheld up a pen and said \u2018what it this?\u2019 I said it was a table, but followed that\nup with \u2018I know what it is!\u2019 \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo I am over all that now and enjoying a late summer. \n\u003cstrong\u003eThe\nissue is that I cannot work in my old profession.  I have a family and for\nthis reason I am looking to Crowd fund my beloved hobby to help us stay\nafloat.  It doesn\u0027t take much!\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to keep building models and make high quality videos\nthat explain how to do what I do. The work I do is exciting, skilful, peaceful,\nand therapeutic. My plans are listed below \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePledge one\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you want to support me, pledge $1 per month.

It hurts no-one, brings people together around water sources such\nas lakes and ponds, and helps them connect with each other and with ducks.\nThat\u2019s it. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledge\nfour.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the\nmost important one.
