ASMR is a pleasant tingly feeling usually beginning in the scalp and later spreading throughout the body in response to certain visual, audio, or tactile stimuli. I make videos with the intent of triggering this nice feeling.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I\u0027ll be able to afford better equipment, which means better content and more tingles for you. I\u0027ll be able to make higher quality sounds and overall, better quality videos. I\u0027ll also be able to devote the most time possible to ASMR because this is my job and main income! I love making you guys feel safe and relaxed and if you do pledge, I can do that job even better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOTE:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Monthly streams will always be on the last Sunday of the month at 2pm PDT / 3pm MST / 5pm EST!"
