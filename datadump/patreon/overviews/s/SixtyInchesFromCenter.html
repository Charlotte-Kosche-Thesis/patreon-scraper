Through arts writing, events, and collaborations we uplift the work of our region\u2019s artists while also archiving their words and ephemeral materials digitally through our website and physically through an ongoing partnership with the Chicago Artist Files at the Harold Washington Library--the largest repository of Chicago artists in the country.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince we started, we have had \u003cstrong\u003eover 60 writers of all experience levels\u003c/strong\u003e contribute regularly to our platform, have added to and created \u003cstrong\u003eover 600 artist/space files for the archives\u003c/strong\u003e, and have generated \u003cstrong\u003eover 1,000 articles\u003c/strong\u003e, essays, interviews, reviews, podcasts, and videos featuring local artists and spaces. Of those writers, about \u003cstrong\u003e70% are writers of color, LGBTQ+, and/or women\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe that the stories of contemporary artists, curators, organizers, advocates and writers who do work along the margins are key components to understanding history and need to be preserved and promoted simultaneously.
