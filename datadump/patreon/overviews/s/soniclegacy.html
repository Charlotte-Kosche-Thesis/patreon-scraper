The idea to make a comic series was brought up by one of the staff to lead a project that non-animation artists could be involved in! The project follows a reboot of the franchise, starting from the first game onward, with new lore and characters as it goes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy a Patreon? A lot of talented artists and writers put time out of their days to contribute to the project, and we want to be able to compensate them for their time! We understand that nobody will see a lot of return with the project, but even a few dollars helps out some people!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you pledge to the Patreon, you will only be charged for each issue that is finished and released, so any other posts that we make here will not be paid posts! You are not paying for the comics or merchandise, but simply supporting the artists who spend time working on the comic!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
