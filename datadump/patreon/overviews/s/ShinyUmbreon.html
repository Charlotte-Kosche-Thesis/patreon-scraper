And well, two-ish years ago I decided to combine the two into a series about a psychotic killer clown, who sucked at editing and just wanted to play games. And well, after a unfortunate incident I\u0027ve had to start over on YouTube. And in that time I\u0027ve grown into myself more as a woman in order to bring better content, and not completely just use that crazy voice that is Laughing Jack. I wanted to bring more and more content to the people who were, and still are coming to my alarmingly fast growing content. But many hitches have since come into effect.
