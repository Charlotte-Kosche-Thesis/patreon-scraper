    "summary": "****\u00a0Additional information about the gifts ****\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have completed a rather difficult Scale-a-Ton project, which exhausted me financially as well as physically :) As the project was mostly financed by the donations of my Patreon supporters, I have decided to give the three Gustav models as separate gifts to my supporters. As I only have three models to give, I tried to make the conditions as fair as I can. Each of my Patreon supporters can join the Gustav Give-away raffle in return for a donation of $1. This means that if you donate $10, you will have 10 raffle entries. For now, the number of my supporters is low, so I will write all names on paper, put them in a bag and pull one name out - the classical style. The raffle will be recorded on video and published on my channel on the first week of each month. Once the donation cycle for the related month is completed, the raffle will take place. During the raffle and the video publishing period, all donations will be turned over to the following month (according to Patreon rules), so if you decide to join at that moment, you will have to wait for the next month\u0027s raffle. \u003cbr\u003eLong story short: on April, I will give-away the Zvezda Gustav, on May it will be the Tamiya Gustav and finally on June it will be the Eduard Gustav. I thank all my gracious followers for their support. \u003cbr\u003e*************************************\u003cbr\u003eHello! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Rahmi. I am the person behind the camera for my channel \"Scale-a-Ton\", which was established to \"share things, not try to teach them\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e As scale modeling took a lot of my daily life, I didn\u0027t invest a lot of time or resources to my channel at first. I just recorded what I did and shared my work when my projects were completed. In this case, I could only record the projects I was comissioned to work on and I did not have the luxury to choose what to build. After a while, my channel became more and more popular and I decided to build newly released kits that people would like to know about. This created a dilemma: I didn\u0027t have time to work on everything at once, so if I built kits for my channel I didn\u0027t have time to work on my comission builds and could not finance myself. I created a Patreon account, so that if you want to see a new (and rather expensive) kit built, you can help me finance my channel so that I can obtain the kits and devote my time to them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I don\u0027t plan to make a living out of that :) This is an attempt to make my channel finance itself, so that it doesn\u0027t create a burden on me. I am aware that I should produce something specific in return for your support. I will prepare a short video and build blog specificly for the Patreon page. Also, in time, O plan to create a large support package and will make a raffle among the contributors to present the completed model to the winner. In summary, please support me if you can :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers and happy modeling!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScale-a-ton \u003cbr\u003e"
