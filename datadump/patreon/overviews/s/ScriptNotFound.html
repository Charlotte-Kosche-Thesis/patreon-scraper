We are a group of best friends looking to make improv more accessible on the internet. Our goal is to post new shows every week for all of you so that improv can become as much a part of your lives as it is ours. For every show, we aim to get a special guest that has inspired us through their presence in the digital community! So far guests have included Alexis G Zall, Tyler Ward, Ally Hills, MacDoesIt, Jordan Doww, and MilesChronicles!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow you may be thinking to yourself, \"Okay! But why do you need MY help?\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh you sweet, anonymous, critical thinker you! I\u0027ll tell you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make these shows look and feel professional as well as enjoyable, our cast, camera crew, editors, directors, sound mixers, and house managers have to put in countless hours of hard work which at this point in time is entirely volunteer work. With each donation, we hope to make these shows more professional and simpler to create so that we can throw more content towards you, the viewers!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a little bit about each of our cast members:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMason (23) is the coach, director, and co-founder of Script Not Found.
