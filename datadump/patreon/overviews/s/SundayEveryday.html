I am also aware that\u00a0for as many people that are members of religious communities there are twice as many who are either disenfranchised with the church or who are just too time poor to attend. \u00a0Who is connecting with them?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write about issues that effect humanity and faith. \u00a0Issues that inform and educate to enable us all to minister effectively to the needs of a postmodern world. \u00a0Issues on theology, depression, sexuality, grief, social issues, addiction, art. \u00a0I interview people and tell their stories. \u00a0In general I speak honestly about things I\u0027m passionate about, and it seems that many of you share the same thoughts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me through Patreon, you will be able to tangibly partner with me as we continue to have important conversations about stuff that matters. \u00a0You will be contributing to created work that you enjoy and believe in, by pledging a monthly gift. \u00a0This enables me to research, interview and write about the topics that matter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also appreciate your support through prayer. \u00a0It\u0027s going to take everyone of us to build a better community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLisa\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
