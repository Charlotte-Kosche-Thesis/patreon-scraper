What you see in the attached images is my Studio evolving as an Installation / Environment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work in a wide range of media and techniques that span from drawing, printmaking, sculpture, painting to photography, video and digital sculpture as well as writing. That make my projects very diverse and interesting to follow. They evolve in parallel, intermingle and the results are surprising and gratifying.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn spring 2003 I was diagnosed with Early Parkinsonism. After the initial shock contrary to any expectations my medical condition had a pozitive impact on my work. It was a challenge and I was competing with myself. Empirically I have discovered that when my mind was in a creative mode the Parkinson\u0027s symptoms were practically disappearing. It was a logical decision to dedicate as much time as possible to any creative activity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFifteen years after my initial diagnosis, I am still a productive artist, 100% independent and score 80-90% in efficiency of motor execution. It is my belief that art and my creative process has greatly contributed in stemming the advancement of my disease.\u00a0I have been spokesman at The First Symposium: Fine Art and Dance as therapies in Parkinson\u0027s Disease, shared my experience with PhD candidates at a leading research institute and have been featured in medical publications.\u00a0I am inviting you to join me in this crowdfunding campaign \u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\"Creativity vs. Parkinson\u0027s\u00a0\u003c/b\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eDisease\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e: Sasha Meret\u0027s Journey with Art as Therapy\u201d. \u003c/strong\u003eThis is a multi-media exploration of my daily creative process in the studio; and how I am convinced that this is instrumental to suppressing the progression of my Parkinson\u2019s disease. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support of my crowdfunding effort will secure my studio space where I will document my creative process along my medical condition.  I want to show those afflicted with similar diseases how when I am immersed in a creative activity, my Parkinson\u2019s symptoms vanish for the duration of the creative session. While this cannot be construed as scientist research, I believe that such documentation will inform further research in Parkinson\u2019s and other types of similar diseases.  It is my deepest wish that my journey with art as therapy will motivate those afflicted and motivate their care-givers to experiment with art and the creative process to help them cope, function, and create while dealing with such debilitating diseases.\u00a0\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u201c\u003cstrong\u003eCreativity vs. Parkinson\u2019s: Sasha Meret\u0027s Journey with Art as Therapy\u201d \u003c/strong\u003ewill inform not only the scientific community but society that art is fundamental to our well-being.\u003cbr\u003eThe crowd funding will be hosted on Patreon, a membership platform that makes it easy for creators to get paid. Another special thing about it is that  the artist gets 95% of your contribution.
