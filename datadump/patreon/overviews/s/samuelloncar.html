    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my Patreon page. So who am I, what am I up to on Patreon, and what can you expect?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e A Human\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe there is a way of life we all want to walk: the way called human. But we don\u0027t know how - we struggle, fail, and even our best successes are colored with failure and sadness. So my life and work are summed up in one word: love - loving the path that can bring\u00a0humans together, loving the fragility and beauty of life. That\u0027s why I am a\u00a0philosopher, a lover of wisdom: wisdom is the art of living well, so if we love life, we love wisdom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhilosophy is not about boring guys in beards but the love of life itself. The mystery of human life is that we are do not have what we need - wisdom - to be ourselves, but if we walk the path of love, we may find it. \u00a0On that path, I\u0027ve found my home as a teacher, scholar, writer, and editor. I am completing my Ph.D. at Yale and serve as the Editor-in-Chief of the Marginalia Review of Books, where I get to read and publish the world\u0027s smartest people on the most important subjects. You can learn more about me and my work at my website: \u003ca href=\"http://www.samuelloncar.com.\"\u003ewww.samuelloncar.com.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOn Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I on Patreon? For two reasons: One, because I believe in experimenting with new technology to build a better society. The internet is a great tool for democratizing value, but the economics surrounding the web do not compensate value-creators. Instead, they capture value and give it to a minority of businesses that are positioned to extract that value without paying for it. That\u0027s wrong, but it\u0027s hard to change. Patreon is trying to solve that problem by taking the chance to support artists directly to the people who appreciate their work; as a writer and editor, I love that. I truly believe most people would gladly pay to support work they enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo, patronage is the past, present, and future of creative culture. Capitalism, for all its virtues, did not evolve to make art or truth financially viable. Artists and scholars have always struggled to make money. \u00a0Why? One reason is that art and scholarship make the future possible, but that makes them often seem dangerous, pointless, or worthless to those who fear change (that\u0027s all of us, at least sometimes). Artists and scholars build the future because they discover the truths and visions we haven\u0027t yet seen: they take the old world and make it new. It requires vision and faith to support the people doing that. We don\u0027t invest in businesses because they all succeed. In fact, almost all start-ups fail. We invest in them because business is a good idea and we believe they have a chance. The same is true at a deeper level about art and scholarship: not only are they good ideas, they create the ideas and visions that change the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor the Love of Life\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat can you expect by supporting me? \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAn Examined Life: \u003c/strong\u003eSubscribe to my media ventures, including Incomplete Humans Radio, and get other updates, including upcoming events and projects, travel notes and sneak peaks, sent right to your inbox. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEssays\u003c/strong\u003e: to cut through the noise and say something today that will still matter tomorrow - about elections, art, God, and everything in between: that\u0027s my goal in the monthly essays.
