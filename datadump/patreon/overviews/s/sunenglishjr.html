    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWe are at a pivotal moment, and it is our responsibility to heal the collective soul wound brought on by white supremacy, patriarchy\u003cem\u003e, \u003c/em\u003ecapitalism\u00a0and hompophobia. What does this mean? The kyriarchy must be demolished, and people must be free. People need to feel seen now more than ever. I invite you to support our shift into the world of humility, love and respect.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Sun English Jr., and I have been passionate about mythological stories since as early as I can remember. Those stories have taught me many lessons and eventually lead me to the study of energy and meditation. \u003cstrong\u003eThrough my study and experimentation I have found WAYS to be free; but it is often hard to find SAFE SPACES to be free as a gender-free POC. To move towards solving this problem, I am creating that safe space with a program named Liberation Seed; a multi-faceted program based in Oakland, CA centered around building community and collective liberation from all binaries and normalities. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thought of a community that is unpoliced; hunger-free, crime-free, hate-free, and love-lead is beautiful to me. I believe that vision starts with community building through ritual and storytelling. I want you to join me on this mission for justice and freedom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I believe community is? I believe it can be summed up in the values I\u2019ve been taught along my journey:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnity of spirit\u003cbr\u003eTrust\u003cbr\u003eOpenness\u003cbr\u003eLove and caring\u003cbr\u003eRespect for the Elders\u003cbr\u003eRespect for Nature\u003cbr\u003eHonoring of the Ancestors\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a hard time; I invite you to live wild, connected, and lovingly. Great pathways of pain lie carved in our bodies; we are living to feel and are channeling our love towards freedom. Liberation Seed programming will create spaces where all can come and expect to be witnessed fully and comfortably. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI would love for you to be a part of this movement towards liberation for every-body.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe will begin small with community Moon Gatherings every New Moon, and gradually move into more, and larger events: nature walks; screenings; exhibitions, poetry readings, dances for freedom, and fundraising for important causes ie. School Lunch, School/Work Uniforms, Life after Incarceration, etc. \u003c/strong\u003eIt is the ultimate vision that this gathering will grow into a place where the greater Oakland community can organize, share resources, conversation, solve problems, and truly become neighbors. Through this compassion may this community become a seed of liberation for the world abroad and the Earth herself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour donation will allow us to hire speakers and musicians to help bolster education, movement, and healing events, beautify and make the space more comfortable, help us create and sustain a website and blog for organizing, collaborate with other programs and foundations fighting the good fight.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Where ritual is absent, the young ones are restless or violent, there are no real elders, and the grown-ups are bewildered. The future is dim.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"A true community begins in the hearts of the people involved. It is not a place of distraction but a palce of being. It is not a place where you reform, but a place you go home to.\" \u003cbr\u003e-Malidoma Patrice Som\u00e9\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!
