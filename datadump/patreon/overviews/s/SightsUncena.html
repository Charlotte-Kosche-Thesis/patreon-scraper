    "summary": "Hello and welcome to the Patreon page for Sights Uncena! The First, Only, and (God Willing) Last Wrestling Podcast on The Internet! We\u0027re your host\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/JetGrindFuture\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJetGrind\u003c/a\u003e (the guy who watches Smackdown), as well as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ZenScissors\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eZenScissors\u003c/a\u003e (the guy who watches RAW) and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Kobuddy_\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDup\u003c/a\u003e (who watches nothing). Together the three of us will watch WWE, and then spend two hours talking about basically anything else because it\u0027s funny, and also eventually recap what happened that week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo who are we? We\u0027re three pals who have been hanging out for half a decade now and have finely tuned the way we make each other laugh, but for some more details then:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJetGrind\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is your host (despite the fact that he watches the B show), and thinks he\u0027s way funnier than he is, but is the most technically knowledgeable about the business as a whole and generally better at following up gags than making his own\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eZenScissors\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is the eternal goofball of the group, he\u0027ll often equate what\u0027s going on in RAW to something else because he finds it humorous. Usually the reason the show gets off on tangents, yet still the funniest in the group, even on a bad day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDup\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0doesn\u0027t know that much about wrestling, and is the closest thing to the voice of reason that we have. They\u0027ll usually be the one attempting to steer the show back on track, even though we\u0027re always drifting sideways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso hey, you should check out our cool and amazing editor\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Rachel_Destross\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDes\u003c/a\u003e, who does a way better job than Jet ever did at A) getting this thing out the door and B) making it listenable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile you can support us on Patreon, and it would be neat if you did so we have a reason to spend the extra time to do our silly ideas for goals, but we promise not to make any Patreon exclusive content. If you want to be a fan of Sights Uncena, you get everything. We\u0027ll put out a new episode every Sunday (barring any disasters), and you\u0027ll get it for free at the same time as everyone else. We\u0027re not comfortable paywalling people here, we appreciate every one of our listeners the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey, you made it to the bottom of the page, congrats! Thanks for checking us out and make sure to tell your friends, neighbors, dog, and mortal enemy about Sights Uncena, The First, Only, and (God Willing) Last Wrestling Podcast on The Internet! See you for the next episode!\u003cbr\u003e"
