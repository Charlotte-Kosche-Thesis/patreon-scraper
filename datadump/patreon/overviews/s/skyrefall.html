Or when confronted by ghoulish Necrid, corporate soldiers, and world class mercenaries will their differences prove irreconcilable? SKYREFall tells a story of personal discovery, overcoming differences, and grand adventure in a place where your convictions define you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can follow the journey through SKYREFall, a narrative podcast that releases chapters weekly. It is a scripted, narrated, and edited experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\"Who are you?\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\nWho am I?\"\u003c/h1\u003e\nI am Al Queue, creator of SKYREFall. For almost a decade I have been storytelling, behind the head of a table, behind the computer screen, and even notebooks when I\u0027m out. My interest in it goes beyond making works as a hobby, and drives who I am. Truthfully, SKYREFall will go on even if no support comes forth, but it is a special story to me. And with the help of noble patrons as yourselves, I hope it can be a special story to many more.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI love doing this and want to devote as much of my time and work as I can to it, and so here I present this Patreon. With your help, I can not only devote my time to the SKYREFall podcast, but improve on its quality in almost every aspect. I have gathered the impressive skills of people I am lucky to have around me already, such as a composer, web designer, artist, and even voice actors.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to keep them around and reward them for their work. They have each given something to the world of SKYREFall already, where we all hope to give something to you as well.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCan I listen to SKYREFall before I pledge?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely!

The idea for it has been with me for nearly a decade, and I have the confidence now to tell the story the way it deserves to be told--a weekly narrative podcast!\u003cbr\u003eI have always enjoyed sound work, and thought voice acting would be a lovely way to spend my time. Combined with my love for storytelling and writing, this seemed the best platform for me. It is my fervent hope that SKYREFall comes to mean as much to others as it has meant to me, and that with its success I will find myself making many more tales like it in the future.\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking me out!",
