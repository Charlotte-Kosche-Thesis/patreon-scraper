I am a New Media Engineer and game developer. Among my accomplishments I have a BFA in Film Production from Penn State, I worked with a few tech startups, and I have had my art games featured in multiple exhibitions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor over twenty years\u2014since I was playing in sand at my father\u0027s masonry company job-sites\u2014I have been dreaming about being a game developer. In middle school, I spent hundreds of hours using a software called RPG Maker. I programmed my first game on a TI-83 graphing calculator and also tried my hand at C++, Flash, web design, and 3D modeling while in high school.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShinyMotive is the embodiment of everything I have been through. It is my official declaration that I am ready to execute this ten year plan I have for developing games and releasing new media content. As the founder of ShinyMotive, I am committed to adhering to regular live-streaming schedules. My plans include gaming, programming, art, design and political segments. In the next few months, I will be rolling out a series of web apps and services\u2014after which ShinyMotive will transform into an all-hands-on-deck video game development studio. I look forward being part of the creation of a series of unique multiplayer and single player video gaming experiences. I really just look forward to sharing with the internet-enabled meme-machines.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon...?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon suits my desire to grow my New Media Production Studio in an organic way. Since I intend to distribute my content across multiple social media platforms in addition to my own websites, Patreon serves well as a centralized location to reach my supporters directly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLegacy Credit Rewards...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUsing a subscriber model allows me to throttle how quickly supporters can accumulate Legacy Credit. Subscribers will be rewarded with monthly Legacy Credit according to their subscription tier. Think of Legacy Credit like a non-transferrable investment. Instead of earning monetary returns according to the size of their investment, supporters will earn returns in the form of free or reduced cost apps and games, unique in-game content, and related ShinyMotive content perks.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd Thank You :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am embarking on a quest that I have been training for for two decades. Under no circumstances is failure an option in this mission; however, the early days are going to be tough no matter what. That is why every single subscriber is important to me. I give the internet my word that ShinyMotive\u0027s early supporters will reap delicious rewards over time!\u003c/div\u003e"
