    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eHello! I\u0027m Skriy! (or Skriytoons if you\u0027ve followed me through Facebook.) After having spent the last few years working in animation production and editing other peoples Youtube videos, I\u0027ve decided that I really want to start shifting my focus to my own work. I want to use this space as a place to bring my stories to life and build a community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether your here because your curious about how I develop my Animations, Speedpaints, and Videos or are just here to watch a sleep deprived fruit loop. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support in becoming a Patreon. By doing so you\u0027ll be included in conversations and polls helping me pick out topics for my videos as well as be in the loop on my latest projects!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile a majority of my work won\u0027t be initially perceived to have a mature rating, especially because of my cartoonish style and attempts to omit spoilers. I am not afraid to include darker or more mature themes, such as death, war, grief, portrayal of hetero and queer relationships, or depictions of cultural and social injustice in my storytelling. I am aiming for my audience to be mid to late teens and up so I am organizing the story aspect of my work not unlike a that of a young adult novel. Hopefully with a lot less cheesy tropes and stereotypes. So please tread carefully and read any potential warnings if and when they occur.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve managed to survive this massive wall of text and still decided to stick around. Thank you again for all of your support!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
