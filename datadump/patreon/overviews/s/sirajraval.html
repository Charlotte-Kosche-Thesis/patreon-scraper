    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhere your money goes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work out of a coworking space in San Francisco. I currently do all the programming, technical writing, editing, lighting, shooting, and marketing myself. It\u0027s a lot of work and I love it, but I can only output 1 video a week (and I work on this stuff every day, including weekends). The money will go towards hiring people to help me with video production and editing, so that I can focus on the technical writing and output more than 1 video a week. My goal is to get to 4 high quality educational videos a week, and for that I\u0027m going to need a solid amount of help from a team.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/57/28/4b/57284bc517595c41fb6e49e771970052.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe remainder I have after finding a team will go towards my own living expenses. I do this full-time and currently don\u0027t have any income coming in. My runway is fast shrinking and I really want to continue making awesome technical videos for you guys. Any amount helps :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInterested in a more immersive business partnership? Email me at hello@sirajraval.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn Example of my work:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S_f2qV2_U00\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQs:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e1.\u00a0Do I have to pay in US Dollars?\u003cbr\u003e NO - Pay in any currency! As this is US based website, everything is written in Dollars, but you can use any currency and it will be automatically converted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. How many videos will you release a month?\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I can only do 4, but if I\u0027m able to reach my Patreon goal, i\u0027ll be able to double that to 8 a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. I don\u0027t have much money, can I still become a Patron? \u003cbr\u003eYes, please only sign up to donate what you can easily afford. Even $1 per month will make a huge difference and would be greatly appreciated. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. Can I stop donating in the future if I can\u0027t afford it? \u003cbr\u003eYes of course! If you can\u0027t afford to donate in the future, or you need to donate less that\u0027s absolutely fine. You can just log in to change or cancel the account whenever you want\u003cbr\u003e"
