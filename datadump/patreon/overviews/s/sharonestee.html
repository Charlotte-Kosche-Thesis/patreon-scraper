I grew up\u00a0classically trained in piano for 13 years, violin for 8 years, flute for 2 years, and learned ukulele, guitar, Javanese Gamelan, and organ along the way.\u00a0 I eventually started\u00a0singing and playing for fun on my first YT channel - @sharonswt. \u00a0\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eIn 2012 I decided to start fresh on a new channel @SharonEstee to brand myself\u00a0as a serious artist. Now I want to do whatever it takes to live my dream and inspire others. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow to Help:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWith Patreon you can support me with\u00a0$1 or more to each video I make (covers and originals)! The more you support the more rewards you can unlock (see below). \u00a0\u00a0I will try to produce 2-4 videos a month (never over 4), and\u00a0you can set a max so you will never go over budget. \u00a0I\u00a0have basically been putting all of\u00a0my music out there for free\u00a0since foreverrrrrr! Also I\u0027ve mostly been doing it all on my own. \u00a0However I realized that I\u0027ve spent so much time and money that I will\u00a0need added support to help me progress as an artist. Every little bit\u00a0helps! \u00a0With your support, I hope to be able to purchase better equipment, revamp my website, create a team, produce more professional content, and effectively market my music. \u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m eternally grateful!

Being able to play 7 instruments (of which also include guitar, ukulele, organ, and gamelan), Estee is always passionate about furthering herself creatively and musically.

Through this outlet she managed to reach over a million views and 7,000 subscribers. In 2012 she decided to partner up with Fullscreen and she decided to start fresh on a new channel \u201c@SharonEstee\u201d to brand herself as a serious artist.\u00a0She hopes to inspire others through her music so that one day people will come up to her and say \u201cbecause of you, I never gave up\u201d.",
