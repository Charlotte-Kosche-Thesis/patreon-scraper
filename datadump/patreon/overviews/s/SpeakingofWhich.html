And with your help we can improve this run of the mill podcast and make it a real Cinderella story for the ages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePretty much with this Patreon page\u00a0we\u0027re trying to give\u00a0ourselves a chance to earn something more than just your respect, but a little for each person on the podcast since we all work jobs and pay\u00a0bills like the rest of the world and could use a little extra incentive to be more creative with our podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page will also include any of our other podcast\u00a0projects that we will introduce in the future like Speaking About Springfield, a series were The Rupel and Joe talk about a random episode of The Simpsons and the soon to come Adventuring of Which our special Pathfinder recordings that we all hope you enjoy!"
