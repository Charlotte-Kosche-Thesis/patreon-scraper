Whether about love or loss, joy or fear, what they all have in common is an honest voice of the human experience. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019re living in a time where the differences between us are magnified. I believe that what starts as a simple act of listening can be a profoundly transformative experience. Exploring the lives of the people we share space with every day shows us how wonderfully human we all are.

When I started the project in 2009, I only had a small sign inviting people to stop and share along with a few sheets of paper and a handful of pens. Now, over eight years later, these stories fill up entire buildings, travel to new communities, and reach tens of thousands of people every month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIf you believe in this mission\u003c/strong\u003e, your pledge of any amount will keep this project going.
