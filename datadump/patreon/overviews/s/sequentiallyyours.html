    "summary": "Thanks for finding your way to our Patreon. I bet you\u0027re wondering who we are!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a lot of review shows out there, but very few that treat comic books like \u003cem\u003eliterature\u003c/em\u003e:\u00a0a medium that should be taken seriously and addressed like other forms of art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where Sequentially Yours comes in. This is a series dedicated to raising awareness of the importance and artistic merit of comics by treating them as literature deserving of close reading. Our goal is to help people get more out of their comic books and related media like movies, video games, TV shows, and novels. Add a little snark, some yelling, and a dash of testicular torsion and you have a fun, interesting way of impressing your friends the next time a comic book movie hits theaters, or a great new way to enjoy an old hobby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe currently have four sub-shows we run:\u003cbr\u003e1. \u003cstrong\u003eMain Show \u003c/strong\u003e- A deep look into a given subject related to comic books. This is histories of comic companies or characters, analysis of comics, and looks into what makes comics such a fantastic storytelling medium.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. \u003cstrong\u003eInitially Mine\u003c/strong\u003e - Every week I read every comic I can get my hands on with a #1 on it and review them as first books in a series, focusing on how to kick off a comic line.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. \u003cstrong\u003eCinematically Ours\u003c/strong\u003e - This is a team effort with my wife to review comic book based films. Right now they are vlogs, but we will implement scripted ones if we reach a specific milestone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. \u003cstrong\u003eEditorials \u003c/strong\u003e- This is everything from my opinions on comic book related events to interviews with professionals in the industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me is supporting a creative endeavor to educate the world about comic books and their literary merit while being as entertaining as possible. The money you donate will go toward production, better equipment, music licensing, and collaborating with other professionals. You\u0027re also helping me to focus on creating more high quality content. \u003cstrong\u003eIn exchange, you get behind the scenes videos, bloopers, access to the community, a voice in future content, and so much more\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your patronage!\u003cbr\u003e"
