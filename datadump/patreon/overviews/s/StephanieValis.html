She utilizes explorations of visual fine art, writing, and acting as a means of storytelling to search for a deeper understanding of what it means to be human. Heavily influenced by a study of philosophy and varying cultures around the world, the common repetition of shared experiences, thoughts, and emotions are what Stephanie strives to capture. Through repeating designs and highly contrasted works of art, as well as the study and expression of the human condition through her writing and her acting, Stephanie seeks to create art that evokes a deeply emotional response in the viewer by sharing the evolving story of her own experiences.",
