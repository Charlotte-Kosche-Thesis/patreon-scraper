    "summary": "Hey Friends! Thanks for visiting our Patreon page! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Us\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSkunkfrakker and Veelicious, a husband and wife duo, have been members of the Furry community since the mid 1990s. We deeply respect and care for this community, and love producing content for it. Skunkfrakker is a well known community artist for the Brony and Furry communities, and is mostly known for making adult-oriented 3D CG cartoons and for starting the VR simulation project now called Besti.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe both have skills that apply towards this project in unique ways. While we are both artistically inclined people, Veelicious has a background in after-sales support management, small business administration, accounting, and humanitarian work. She holds two degrees focused on literature and writing. Skunkfrakker has a background in mid-level management in the technology industry, public education, and software/hardware development. He has a degree in liberal arts, a degree in American history, a year in university for electrical engineering, and a year in university for secondary education.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Besti\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesti--a game for adults with an inclination towards the Brony and Furry fandoms--is the main focus of of this Patreon campaign. Besti is an ambitious project that is working towards the prospect of everyone owning the equivalent of an affordable sex robot, or just a nice cartoon character to spend time with. It is for Steam VR devices (Vive, Oculus, etc.) Android phones (requires Android 4.4 or better with a Gyroscope) and for Windows computers with a monitor. You can learn more by visiting\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://besti.love\"\u003ehttp://besti.love\u003c/a\u003e, or by becoming a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSkunkfrakker and Veelicious do a livestream show on Picarto most Thursdays and Saturdays, and Skunk tries to attend pony/furry conventions in the Pacific Northwest whenever possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal in this is to create a wonderful platform where content creators can design and sell fantasy simulations to interested parties, and to create an ecosystem of content that fulfills as many interests and desires as possible. We have made great strides towards making that a reality, and are currently on revision 8 of the software. New features and scenarios are added regularly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesti contains no assets or concepts owned by any large corporations that you may or may not be thinking of due to our association with the Brony fandom. All characters included with the software are either original characters with parody/referential color schemes, or original characters owned by their respective creators which are used with permission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBenefits of becoming a Patron\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting our work you help make the following happen:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou cover the costs of production\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e Computer hardware and electricity is expensive, and we need both in abundance to make this content. Rendering a single animation often takes more than a week on expensive hardware with multiple GPUs running at 100% the entire time. When it comes to development, a game can only be as pretty as the computer creating it, so we need the best.\u00a0In other words: no one is getting rich, over here. The money you contribute goes directly into improving Besti.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou fund development of Besti,\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0a VR simulation for adults that we feel is the most robust and advanced offering out there. We hope it changes the human perception of sexuality, and we work hard to make it real.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou gain access to extra content.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Higher bit rate versions of content, content that doesn\u0027t make it to sites for one reason or another, and occasionally, early-access to content that will. You can also gain access to beta and development versions of Besti, plus Skunkfrakker posts something new every day. Sometimes that\u0027s text, sometimes it\u0027s video, and sometimes it\u0027s a game download.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou help us achieve our goals\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. We have busy lives. Skunkfrakker produces content every day full time, and Veelicious contributes part time to non-technical aspects of the project. We\u0027re trying to change the world, here, and take this very seriously and handle it professionally. If you want to help, we would love to have your support. Check out our support tiers for more information to see if one of them interests you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for coming over, and we hope you stick around!\u003cbr\u003e--Skunk \u0026amp; Veelicious \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpdated 3/9/17: Now with 100% less accidental gambling and the addition of Veelicious as a part-time contributor\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
