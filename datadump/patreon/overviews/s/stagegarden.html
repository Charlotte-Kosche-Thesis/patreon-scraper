    "summary": "Hey Tribespeople! I\u0027m so excited to be developing my first Rock Opera and can\u0027t wait to share the whole journey with you - from a behind-the-scenes creative process to the stage!\u00a0 For those of you who are just finding me, I was born in Salzburg, Austria and later grew up in California. I was a New Yorker for over 16 years, dancing, singing and working my butt off at the \u003cstrong\u003eMet Opera\u003c/strong\u003e and performing in places like \u003cstrong\u003eCarnegie Hall\u003c/strong\u003e. I was lucky to\u00a0have such an awesome career, but not everything came without a price. I also have a dark and harrowing tale to tell about the Road of Shadows that I had to walk to get here. Now I am turning my story into a \"Gesamtkunstwerk,\" or \"Total Work of Art.\" The opera is inspired by the \u003cstrong\u003eMayan Goddess, Ixchel\u003c/strong\u003e, and chronicles the life story (my life story) of a young woman escaping domination, violence, and control. \u003cem\u003eIf I can inspire just one woman find the strength to get out, I will have achieved my dream.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m blessed to live in the most beautiful place on earth: Playa del Carmen, Mexico, where I started my tribe, my artistic collective called StageGarden. We don\u0027t just play music, we engage the local community in new works of art that also encompass dance, theater,\u00a0and visual arts. In the land of cover bands and hotels, this is super exciting! My music spans countries and generations, from Medieval and Renaissance tunes from old Europe, to brand new compositions that I have written myself. I\u0027m also choreographing and training dancers, actors, and musicians locally. I\u00a0would love for you all to walk side by side with our tribe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my patron, you will get exclusive behind-the-scenes access to rehearsals, new poems and songs, my visual artwork, private online concerts, and the general musings of a philosopher Renaissance woman living in a world of specialization. We are working to raise $1,500 to professionally record our first album. Thanks so much for helping us to get there! I can\u0027t wait to share our\u00a0journey with you!"

Together with Jesse Peckham, Vanessa built KHORIKOS, an a cappella vocal ensemble, into one of New York City\u2019s finest a cappella ensembles, with international tours and performances in the greatest concert halls, like Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center.\u003cbr\u003eWhen Vanessa arrived in Playa del Carmen about one year ago, with only this idea in her head, she met Rachel Perry De Schrank, who instantly became her partner in crime, and together they began building the tribe.  The band, currently has 7 members, but is constantly growing and changing.  Vanessa scoured the archives for Medieval, Renaissance and ancient folk music from around the world, all with  beautiful, melancholy and lilting melodies, and reworked them for modern instruments including banjo (or bantar), accordion, djembe, recorder, handpan, and hurdy gurdy.  Songs are sung in ancient French, ancient Swedish and even Latin.  All of the artists in the band have contributed their own vision and talent to the musical arrangements. Jesse Peckham, in addition to being an orchestral conductor, also has a degree in music composition, and has contributed many musical ideas and talent to the show. Vanessa is eager for the other members of the band to proffer their own projects, and hopes that the StageGarden project will become a source of regular, high quality performing arts presentations from a wide range of talent. We are creating the tribe, so that the tribe can become the vehicle for expression.  The Tribe continues to grow organically at every rehearsal and collaborates with a wide variety of artists. The roster of performers is typically different from show to show. Currently, for the educational branch of StageGarden, Vanessa is also hosting performing arts classes for kids. Classes are based on the City Conservatory curriculum she developed in New York City and include music, theater and dance in every class. We are all friends and we work together in a multitude of ways. We are like family - this project is a way of life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
