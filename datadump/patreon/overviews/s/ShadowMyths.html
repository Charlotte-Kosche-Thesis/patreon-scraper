    "summary": "Ozul... a world of elementals, people, and wizards.\u00a0 Hi... I\u0027m Selik and, fortunately or unfortunately, this is the world that I live in.\u00a0 I was born in a small village called Greywell and this is the story of my life.\u00a0 What you see here will be my thoughts about the people and the world that I live in.\u00a0 Some people say that it\u0027s pretty scary or unnerving.\u00a0 I don\u0027t know about that.\u00a0 For me, it just is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be talking about the various elemental that I encountered, my human friends (the ones that are still with me and the ones that were lost) and things that made my life enjoyable... or painful. This will be my journal and I hope that, by the time that I\u0027ve left this world, you have a better understanding of me and the people who live here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I know that you have some questions, so let\u0027s go over some of the basics:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Why ShadowMyths?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEverybody says that they are just cards.\u00a0 When I first came across them, I thought the same thing, also.\u00a0 I was thinking that they helped me come up with new and interesting stories for my book.\u00a0 It wasn\u0027t until later that I realized that they were a lot more powerful than that.\u00a0 In fact, they were reality-influencing cards. Through the use of the Artifact, I could actually change what was going to happen based on how they were laid down.\u00a0 I soon started distributing them so that no-one person could have the full deck and the awful power that they gave.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike many people who live in similar worlds, money is the currency that allows you to be free to to pursue your goals.\u00a0 I can use it to help elementals and humans with their own problems.\u00a0 I can use it to help me attain larger goals.\u00a0 More importantly, patronage allows me to free up my time to learn more about our world and how I can make it better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Can you tell me more about who lives in this world?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are three main players in this world: humans, elementals and wizards. The humans, like me, went busily about their daily lives and thought that we were kings of the world. Did whatever we wanted and didn\u2019t care about anyone but ourselves. I can believe that. Many of the people that I have met in my life were pretty selfish and really didn\u2019t like those who were different. Just like the Elders in my town.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe elementals were all around us but we could never see them. They lived in the trees, rocks, water or air. They could be everywhere but, unless they wanted to be seen or you knew how to look for them, we didn\u2019t notice them. Like people, they had jobs and families. They were kind and nice or petty and jealous. They thought that they were better than humans but, in reality, had many of the same faults. They just didn\u2019t see that in themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen there were the wizards.\u00a0 Through the use of books and training, anyone could become a wizard and see or communicate with the elementals, in the case of a person, or people, in the case of an elemental. They just had to have a strong mind and, most important, the desire. The wizard was more like a scientist. His job was to study the world around him and the easiest way to do that was to talk with elementals and piece together their answers. With his experiments and this knowledge, he would study the mysteries of life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: I hear that Death is an active player in this world.\u00a0 Is this true?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes... Death is the great controller of Ozul.\u00a0 He is there but not there.\u00a0\u00a0What most humans and elementals don\u2019t understand, though, is that Death is not the end. It is, actually, just another phase in life. When a human died, Death transmuted his soul and the human is reborn as an elemental. Same thing happens to elementals. Their souls are transmuted into humans. This way, there is a natural balance of humans and elementals. Never too many or too few. With one exception, the souls never knew what they were in their past lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWizards are special, though. Because they walk both the human and elemental world, when they died, their souls are transformed but their memories are still intact. They may choose to still be wizards or, not wanting to deal with the loneliness any more, give up the wizard life. It\u2019s their choice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDeath\u00a0is also the judge, jury and executioner. Elementals or humans that have caused tremendous grief in their life met a fitting ending \u2014 if only temporary.\u00a0 When Death transformed the soul, he may decide to transform them into a Shadow Elemental. Shadow Elementals are cursed souls that can no longer interact with the physical world but are part of it. They live in the shadows and are torn apart in light. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf they are destroyed by light, they are continuously reborn until Death has determined that they have paid for their sins. The only way that they can really bother someone is through their dreams. Even then, they can\u2019t physically touch you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
