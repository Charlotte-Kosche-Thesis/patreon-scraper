    "summary": "Thank you so much for supporting me on Patreon, where I\u0027m so excited to offer you a much deeper and richer exploration of the themes I often present on Facebook and youtube: specifically the divine feminine, sacred sexuality,\u00a0healing of trauma and love/sex addiction, sovereignty, natural beauty, authenticity, shadow work, shamanism, soul retrieval, and how to bring in the new paradigm of Heaven on Earth that I know is available to us ALL. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHO AM I: I am a Berkeley-trained neuroscientist and writer, wife and mother of two, an advocate of self love, authenticity and natural beauty, and the author of SHE IS ONE: a memoir that tells my personal story of divine redemption from the deepest and bleakest childhood, breaking through against all odds to a life of great joy and success (\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/She-One-Feminine-Journey-Wholeness/dp/1544626711/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\"\u003ehttps://www.amazon.com/She-One-Feminine-Journey-Wh...\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBorn to two \u0027mentally ill\u0027 parents and steeped in a childhood of poverty and abuse, I was led through shamanic initiation and miraculous rebirthing/re-coalescing into wholeness and and divinity by a number of angelic guides who brought me through harrowing and life-threatening circumstances to find deepest personal fulfillment and true, loving divine union with my husband of now nearly twenty years. My husband was also initiated into shamanism in the course of our life and work together, and now helps many people to heal from trauma, breaking deep cycles of pain and ancestral wounding to support a return to liberation, joy and wholeness. As a divine union team, we also help those in sacred partnership to navigate the waters of intimacy, communication and togetherness in order to resolve challenges and draw closer in a sustainable, grounded way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be offering an array of multi-modality options here, from live Q\u0026amp;A, to interactive guides and calendars, to a podcast with Hanan on divine union and sacred partnership, to interactive courses designed to take you right into the heart of the divine feminine experience. I\u0027m truly excited and grateful to be able to connect with you in this way! THANK YOU so much for being here \u0026lt;3"
