It was\u00a0started as a service to those entering the world of Star Wars fandom as well as die-hard fans of\nyears past. Spoiler-free reviews on every officially-released canon\nfilm, TV show, book, comic, or video game will be right at your\nfingertips, as well as a comprehensive timeline for their\nchronological placement within the universe. Our aim is to be as\nstreamlined and simple as possible to give consumers a proper idea of\neach individual \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e media product before purchasing them. This website is not-for-profit and not affiliated\nwith Disney or Lucasfilm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContrary to popular belief however, websites\nare not free. A domain has to be purchased yearly, the domain has to\nbe hosted on a reliable server which incurs fees, and if we\nwant to begin releasing regular videos and podcasts of quality, we\nmust first have the time and resources to do so. That\u0027s where you\ncome in. Through Patreon, you can donate as little as $1.00 a month\nto our website, get rewarded for your involvement through early access to our reviews and blog posts, discussions on our Discord server, and possibly even participate in future interviews\nwith Star Wars authors or podcasts! Help\nus keep the continuity straight, and donate today. May the Force be with you...always.\u003cbr\u003e"
