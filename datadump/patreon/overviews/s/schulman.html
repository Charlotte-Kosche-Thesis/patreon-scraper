It enriches people\u2019s lives and I can not imagine a world without music.  Can you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThanks to you\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, making independent music is possible for those who are not signed with a major record label or producer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are thousands of musicians, like me, who may never get a major record label to help them reach more people with their art.  So first, let me thank you for visiting my Patreon page and I invite you to join my exclusive music community as a team member.   There are several ways for you to join our team, explained below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eA little about me:\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a small kid, I fell in love with music when I started clunking away on my mom\u2019s piano.  Followed by years of playing the trumpet, other brass instruments and the guitar, my passion for writing music and sharing it with others continues to grow.  My mother was my #1 patron as a kid, investing in a trumpet and music lessons through high school.  And, for more than a decade, my wife has encouraged and pushed me to continue to grow, produce and share more of my music.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow it\u2019s time for me to multiply these investments and encouragements for the rest of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eOur\u00a0#1 goal here\u003c/u\u003e. . .\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. . .is to build a real relationship with fans like you while we partner together in publishing more beautiful music for the world to enjoy.  When I listen to beautiful music, it has the power to cut through the hectic and stressful challenges our world hurls at us, and go straight to our hearts, where we can experience peace, restoration, rest and for some, deep healing.  More people need to experience peace, restoration, rest and healing through music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhy I believe music is SO important:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI think almost everyone has experienced those stressful days, feeling overwhelmed by life, when a beautiful melody pierces through the heaviness and captivates the heart and soul so much that they are swept away from the issues, and given a brief period of peace and restoration.  That is the heart behind my music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo me, the Internet has changed everything for the small artist, and Patreon is the future of the music business. By cutting out the middle-man, I can use most of the funds from fans / partners like you to focus on creating more beautiful, restorative music for you to enjoy and share, instead of paying the bulk of it to billion dollar record label companies and signing away my creative rights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eThat is where you come in:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a part of my exclusive music community, you will get to help me shape the music that will go out to the rest of the world, while you get access to my virtual \u201cback-stage\u201d pass and meet with me on a monthly basis, provide feedback, introduce me to other ideas, so I can continue to grow in this art and produce great quality, instrumental music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are several levels at which you can become a member.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eLevel 1-  $3 per month - Grass Roots Member\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e - A great way to start is by clicking the $3 Reward, which allows you to download all my music every month in mp3 format! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eLevel 2- $8 per month - Grass Roots Plus Member \u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e- Because it\u0027s SO important to recognize the individuals who make my work possible, I\u0027ve also created the $8 Reward.

His personal music also has a Christian / inspirational / spiritual heart behind what he produces, and most of his songs carry a story or theme.\u00a0 His hope is to one day create books and even videos or small movies that will use his music compositions and melodies for the themes.\u00a0 Thank you for reading, visiting and being a Patreon Patron!",
