How to Human is an online record of my attempts to improve myself, my life and the world. It sounds ambitious but I expect it\u0027ll be more messy than grand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Content\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe self-improvement does not have to involve self-hatred. I like who I am already. I am a recovering perfectionist and my first priority throughout all my projects is to not fall off the wagon. This is why self-care and good mental health will feature heavily as the underpinning for everything else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving said that, here\u0027s an incomplete list, in no particular order, of things I would like to work on:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eGo vegan\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBecome zero-waste (could take years)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBe a minimalist (could take decades)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThink more rationally/critically\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDevelop bullish business skills\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStart a meet-up group about\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEffective Altruism\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSpeak in schools and universities about Effective Altruism\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHave sturdy social boundaries\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDo regular meditation\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo not give a flying fluff about what others think of me\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHave better financial hygiene\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStart fun new work-outs (e.g. jump-rope)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Format\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment I don\u0027t know which method will turn out to be my favourite, so I\u0027m using them all. I also don\u0027t know how frequently I\u0027ll be producing stuff.

Good mind maps are webs of thought made visible, so that could get interesting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also really keen to try my ear as an interviewer. I\u0027m not sure who I\u0027ll interview yet, but in my other life I am a writer with some training as a counsellor, so I hope I might be able to uncover people\u0027s stories. I\u0027m sure everyone has something to teach about how to human better. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for having a look at my page, and if you decide to become a Patron, you have my humble gratitude and appreciation forever.

It means that, through the internet, anyone can find their favourite artist and chip in to support them. Each person\u0027s contribution of a small amount per month or thing accumulates until we have crowd-funded a career! Artists and audience can live in cozy symbiosis, with the happy side-effect of reducing the control of big companies over the creative industry. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a quick (one-minute) video with more detail about how Patreon works, please click here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH-IDF809fQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/watch?v=wH-IDF809fQ\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd for an eloquent explanation of the philosophy behind crowd-sourcing in general, I highly recommend Amanda Palmer\u0027s TED talk video:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMj_P_6H69g\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/watch?v=xMj_P_6H69g\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Hi! I\u0027m Sally. :) I\u0027m just about old enough to remember the sound of an internet dial-up tone and music tapes. As a kid, my superpower was spelling. It set me up for a lifetime of academic success (eventually I went to Cambridge), but did less than nothing to help me get along with my school-mates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am addicted to reading and finished writing my first novella when I was 12. It was a tripartite saga for my younger sister starring her favourite toy travelling the world with our hamster. Writing took rather a back seat to music after that (I play violin and piano), but I rediscovered my calling to become an author through NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) in November 2013.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI identify as a straight, cis-gendered, polycurious nerdfighter-feminist. I try to be a good ally to all discriminatees, and I am open to reminders when I need to check my privilege. I wish I had more time to save the world from injustice and global warming, but I\u0027ve decided to take one thing at a time for the moment. Star Trek gives me hope that our species might yet make it.",
