     "about": "\u003cstrong\u003eTaken from my website bio:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the name Suli Breaks is mentioned, one or all of three of the following words spring to mind; charismatic, controversial and conscientious.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lover of the written and spoken word, Suli Breaks is a visionary undaunted by the restrictions found in conventional poetry, leading him to push boundaries in a bid to inspire and inform a generation. An artist, speaker and writer, Breaks is often considered an inspiration by those who have met, watched or listened to him.\u003cbr\u003eUnbeknown to most, the controversial poet has a Law degree from the University of Sheffield \u2013 albeit unused. Upon leaving university, with fewer job prospects than when he had started, Breaks decided to pursue a career in poetry, fuelled by his disbelief in our current formal education system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFive years of consistently performing in local venues and universities within the UK provided the solid foundation on which Breaks has built his fan base. Realising the power of social media and using his initiative, Breaks harnessed the power of the Internet to spread his work further afield and thus established a global following of all ages and backgrounds.\u003cbr\u003eNotwithstanding the years of groundwork, Breaks\u2019 extraordinary rise to the top came as a direct result of the unprecedented success of spoken word piece \u2018Why I Hate School But Love Education\u2019. It provided the much needed breakthrough that Breaks had been hoping for. Irrespective of past BBC1 coverage, competition success, interest from American blogs and a DVD in 2012, the 7 million people that have viewed the video so far are evidence of Breaks\u2019 notoriety, in addition to the thousands of appreciative comments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBreaks accolades now include being awarded second place speaker in Mastermind Talks and event which featured the likes of Tim Ferris and AJ Jacobs, being a guest speaker to Joe Polish\u2019s 25k Group Genius Network in addition to being featured on the Huffington Post, Washington Post, the Guardian, The independent and numerous other popular youth blogs and sites such as Worldstarhiphop and\u003ca href=\"http://upworthy.com\"\u003eUpworthy.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe is arguably one of the most popular spoken word artists in the world  and hasbeen hailed by many high-profile individuals as a new-school pioneermost notably by Will Smith, Daphne Wayans, Tisha Campbell, James Altucher and most recently Rio Ferdinand.\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013, Breaks recently released his debut audio project an EP entitled \u2018The Dormroom\u2019 2013, which debuted at Top 20 in the Spoken word Charts in ITunes, and his spoken word piece \u201cI will not let an exam result decide my fate\u201d was ranked Top 3, on the spoken word charts only behind \u201cBomfunk MC\u2019s\u201d track \u201cSpoken Word\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m the bandit\u201d from the popular TV show \u201cMy Name is Earl (Album). All of these accolades in tow, coupled with an 2 appearances on the prestigious Tedx House Of Parliament, it is clear to see why he is frequently grouped in the upper echelon of the current generation of inspiring people, set to take the world by storm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRealising the power of social media and using his initiative, Breaks has managed to harness the power of the Internet to spread his work further afield and thus established a global following of all ages and backgrounds. Breaks\u2019 YouTube Channel boasts over 12 million views and has over 250K subscribers to date. Whilst this was a big success for Breaks, in hindsight this achievement would prove to be only the beginning of his career. An entrepreneur came across Suli Breaks and wanted to help spread his message further. Their relationship ultimately led to him undertaking a trip around the world. The trip was loosely based on the popular book written by Jules Verne, where a scientist, Phlieas Fogg, set off in a hot air balloon to prove one could circle the globe in 80 days with only \u00a320,000 in order to prove the institution of science wrong. The book as well as the trip was aptly titled \u201cAround the World in 80 days\u201d.  During this journey he performed to crowds in venues, attended local radio stations and TV channels, namely Choice FM Ghana, Joy FM Ghana, Power FM and Shift TV South Africa. The main goal of this trip for Breaks was to use all these experiences to fuel the completion of his album, which is due to be released summer 2015 and will be entitled \u2018The Dissertation\u2019. Following this album launch, he will also be releasing the footage from the tour\u003cbr\u003e2014 also saw Breaks breaking into new boundaries by writing and performing on Kasabian\u2019s number 1 album \u201948:13\u2019 as well as performing an outstanding rendition of the famous Bob Marley track, \u2018NO WOMAN,NO CRY\u201d\u2019, on the BBC 1Xtra Trevor Nelson show. It is no wonder that his message resonates with everyone, anywhere in the world.",
