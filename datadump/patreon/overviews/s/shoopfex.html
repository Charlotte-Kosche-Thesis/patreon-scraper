    "summary": "Thanks for listening to my music!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA number of people over the years have asked how they can donate to the channel. However, I\u0027ve always turned down donations, because I felt - and still feel - that accepting money for the work of somebody else isn\u0027t right. Even though I created my mashups with as much time and care as an original track, adding my own brand of unique embellishments and production techniques, I still felt that 90% of the finished product did not belong to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs many years as I\u0027ve been making mashups, I\u0027ve been working behind-the-scenes to improve my skills as a solo producer. I\u0027ve always wanted to post the original stuff I\u0027ve made to the channel, but I kept preventing myself from doing so\u003cem\u003e,\u003c/em\u003e unless I produced a track that sounded as professional as the artists I sampled in my mashups.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSetting this limit ensured there was to be no noticeable difference in quality for subscribers, whether I released a track produced by myself, or a mashup featuring legends like Madeon, Justice or deadmau5\u00a0 - whatever I released, subscribers will be tuning in to professionally-produced electronic music with a unique anime flavour.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve made this Patreon because I believe that I\u0027m almost at my goal. In January 2018, I released \u003cem\u003eAwakening\u003c/em\u003e, the first track that - to me -\u00a0 felt embodied in the aforementioned inspirations that I struggled to emulate for years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next track I\u0027m producing, \u003cem\u003eGrand Tour,\u003c/em\u003e is an adventure through many of my musical inspirations, featuring numerous melodies and motifs from the \u003cem\u003eFate\u003c/em\u003e franchise - specifically \u003cem\u003eFate/Grand Order.\u003c/em\u003e To me, it\u0027s a story of conquering - my fears and anxieties as a producer and otherwise. I hope you look forward to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future, I hope to release many more of these anime-inspired original works and remixes. Receiving support will allow me to focus more on producing music, and upload much more frequently. Depending on the volume of support on this page, I would love for Patrons to influence where I take the channel. For example, what anime and songs I remix could be up to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, this page exists as a means of supporting to the channel without relying on donations. I would like very much to give back as much as I receive, and donations are not a great model for that. If you still want to support me, but don\u0027t like the Patreon model, please consider purchasing from my Bandcamp page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to continue making great mashups and remixes for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Shoop\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
