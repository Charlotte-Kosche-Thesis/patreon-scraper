    "summary": "Hi,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Tim Norman, but I usually go by \u0027Stormo\u0027 on the internet (It\u0027s a long story involving the original Gulf War and one of my high school teachers). I\u0027ve been playing video games ever since I got a Commodore 16 (we weren\u0027t rich enough for a Commodore 64) for Christmas one year. I mainly grew up on 1990s arcade games, as well as whatever NES titles I could afford from my paper-round money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a wide and eclectic taste in games, happy to dive into the latest big budget adventure (I\u0027m right into \u003cem\u003eThe Witcher 3\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0as I type this) as I am into an arcade shooter (I\u0027m a big fan of the DoDonPachi series).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy plan for my channel is to reflect this variety by not just making \u0027let\u0027s play\u0027 type videos, but also videos that go in depth on particular games, be they new-release indie games on Steam or big-budget console titles on the PS4. I would like to expand into covering older titles as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d also like to expand into doing more documentary-type features, talking about the history of games and the technology behind them, and even into interviews with developers (both current and past). Ultimately, I hope to be able to present a mix of live-action footage alongside in-game footage, and my intention is that my channel is more than just another \u0027let\u0027s play guy\u0027 on Youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you think this is a noble goal to have, then I would appreciate your support. I currently intend to offer one video each weekday, but if I reach my funding goals, this will increase up to a total of two per weekday (so 10 videos a week). I\u0027m currently sorting out what I want to do with the additional videos, and I\u0027ll get that information out as soon as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for reading this, and I look forward to your support."
