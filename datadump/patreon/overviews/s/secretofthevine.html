    "summary": "I am writing my 3rd novel! I explore connections between ideas, culture, and people. I am very analytic by nature, left brained so to speak. I observe existence from outside of the frame, and I see the picture, and the patterns within it. Shifting dimensions is done within the mind, not from an external event. If all is thought, and all is language, then learning to shift context is one method of accessing an entire alternate dimension of reality hidden right beside default human awareness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere beneath the surface of each of us lies a dormant, and entirely new perspective into reality. This can be summoned and awakened within those who truly seek to do so. One can access this place beyond imagination, and encounter rather abstract things such as archetypes, which also lie dormant in the mind, awaiting the moment they are triggered by a curious traveler or a significant experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e The internet bombards each of us with many ideas and conspiracies, but the main conspiracy afoot is the primary model of reality. The inside world, or the outside world, which is primary? There is only one way to know for sure, to push the limits of ones own experience and lift the veil. I have been documenting my own experience for years with alternative models of reality, and patterns in language, music, art with regard to context. I write articles intended to assist the reader to evoke a deeper personal understanding of the mysteries of creation and perception.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have spent the last 6 years traveling Latin America, visiting \u0026amp; studying historic sites, and piecing together some of the ancient spiritual \u0026amp; medicinal techniques long lost to the modern ancestors of such traditions, and never known to the first world view of the western populace. I have been blessed with enough good fortune to be able to assist those who desire to rediscover Nature\u0027s mysteries in doing so. I feel that I am among a select few who are engaged in deprogramming those I come across, in much the same way they were programmed by those who came from Europe hundreds of years ago teaching a hollow Catholic false dogma convenient to the rulers of that age. What I teach is not religion, or superstition, for the truth of the matter lies somewhere in between. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe truth reconciles the ancient practices, and the wisdom that was to follow, and dispenses with the dogma and superstition that was added over the centuries to benefit those who changed the text or the context of the original understandings once bestowed upon those who when into the medicines and sat with the spirits who taught this in the first place. Although I illuminate the true meaning of scripture, mythology, and superstition, these were never the sources for my conception. I too convene with these same spirits, and each time, they allow me to see a little further, and know a little more of who, what and where we are, and why we are here. I have truly written more books than I have read in the last 20 years, I don\u0027t need books to learn these things, for I have discovered the book of life. Your assistance allows me to continue my work and share my discoveries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate goal is to create a center for learning and healing with plant medicines and diet adjustments. If anyone would like to get on board and share something as profound as this with the world, or even just read what I have written for their own personal journey, I would be deeply honored to have you along! Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
