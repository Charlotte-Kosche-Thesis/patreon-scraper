My name is Sam and this, is my patreon page! The best place to support my channel and help improve every aspect of it\u0027s existence.

Ad revenue is unpredictable and unreliable.\u003cbr\u003eDespite how much time and effort put into a project there is never a guaranteed pay day. Nor is it the same with the more videos released. Not everyone knows how ad revenue works and I feel if you were to hear me out, you might just be a little bit more open to the idea of fan funding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a sure fire way to gain support / funding from fans and viewers. A much more secure funding system.\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon campaign allows me to offer up rewards and benefits to fans who decide to pledge, such as awesome (and exclusive) giveaways, early access and a broader relationship with the things I do with being able to commune with me on a very regular basis.\u00a0 Youtube does not allow for such things...\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eSo? Why Should I pledge? No one is forcing you to make videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eDo you know what? You\u0027re absolutely correct. No one at all is forcing me. However, making these videos and connecting with you all has really opened my eyes to a dream, that just might, come true. I\u0027m not asking for you to \"give me all your money\" I only ask that you look at this Patreon page with an open mind and what great things could be done. This entire thing is optional to you all, to the fans who want to go that step further and support what I do via funding. I love making content for you to watch and enjoy, and I know that you love watching! Together we have already built such a strong community and it drives me to keep going, further and further.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never expected we could make it this far... but now I know that we CAN go further! Together.\u003cbr\u003eSWTOR Central isn\u0027t just me as a person for I am Sam, your darksided pleb. SWTOR Central is a place, a location, a community of thriving gamers! To answer the question above, you should only pledge IF you REALLY want to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhat will my pledge go towards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eA many number of different things. It\u0027s hard to predict what might come up in the future or any decisions that may or may not be made, so let me list off some things that patreon has funded so far.

We\u0027ve made a big dent into the transition of a casual content creator to a professional one.\u003cbr\u003eAll of these things have DRAMATICALLY improved the quality of videos which is evident from the videos themselves. Go ahead, cycle back a few months on my channel and compare the difference. That, is the kind of difference this patreon campaign fights for. Everyone who decided to pledge has my word and my promise that all pledges will go towards these kind of things and never wasted on the morning coffee that\u0027s way too expensive from that one store on the way to work.... *Sigh. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy latest and current plans with patreon funding is \"Road to fibre\". This goal, is a very complicated one. As of right now, I stream on Twitch using 4G data sourced from a Mini WiFi box that costs \u00a364 per month. In addition, I also pay \u00a345 per month for my actual broadband connection. The reason I use this Mini WiFi box is because my actual broadband connection does not have the required upload speed to be able to stream.\u00a0 Now, this 4G data has a cap of 64gb per month. Which usually lands us around 8 - 12 streams a month, depending on how long the streams last. When the data runs out, I have the option to buy an add on, which costs an extra \u00a315 to receive 10gb of extra data. As you can no doubt see, this is VERY costly. The \"Road to fibre\" goal is to help pay for those costs and also help save up for installing fibre. Long story short, there is only one ISP in my area, they won\u0027t give me fibre until potentially, 2020. However, there is the option to pay a premium of \u00a32,000 to have it installed early. Why is this important? When I get fibre, it is very likely I\u0027ll be able to take up Twitch / Youtube full time as my one and only bottleneck will be eliminated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhy don\u0027t you pay for this stuff?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood question. If you didn\u0027t know already, I do in fact, work full time. Most weeks i\u0027ll work an average of 37 hours which does not include time spent on content creation. I make money, enough for me to pay my bills and feed my kids. I have actually spent my own money on upgrades and more often than not i\u0027ll put towards the next project too. But my family comes first, with my monthly wages I pay all my bills, buy food, travel expenses and all the other IRL garbage we all suffer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike I said, my family will always come first no matter what and my main goal in life is to give my children a life that I never had, a warm home, a secure home, toys and holidays and whatever else they may wish for along with the necessities of life. A good education and a future in this world that is meaningful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where my post will end....\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you for taking the time to read this, it truly does humble me that you might consider pledging to this silly pleb! Whatever you decide, have fun out there and remember, it\u0027s always about to get awesome!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
