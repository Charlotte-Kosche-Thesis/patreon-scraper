My mission\nhere at Shanakey is to create stories, characters and art that are genuinely\nentertaining, intriguing, and showcases the beauty of the truth. I take immense\npleasure in what I do, and I thank God for giving me this language. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe one reason\nwe are so drawn to adventures and other worlds is because there \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e another world and an ultimate\nadventure we\u2019ve all been called to pursue. I believe that what we see is more\nthan what there really is. That what we know and understand is only the brink\nof reality. I believe there is a God who created us, and wants to have a\nrelationship with us. I believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God, as He claims to\nbe in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John in the Bible. Thus, Jesus is God. He says He\nloves us (Romans 5:8) even though we humans are selfish and messed up and have\nlost a relationship with God. Because God is just (Deuteronomy 32:4) and does\nnot let evil go unanswered for, He will punish us when we die and see Him face\nto face. This punishment is what generations have called \u201cHell.\u201d However,\nagain, He loves us, and wants us to be with Him. So He did something to satisfy\nHis justice while giving mercy and forgiveness to all those who ask \u2026. I\nbelieve these truths of sin, redemption, hope, love, forgiveness, justice,\netc\u2026.are the foundation of the world, and all stories say something about them,\neither by talking about them, showing them, or denying their existence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContact Me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you ever have any\nquestions, comments, ideas, insight, or feedback, please feel welcome to\nmessage me here or on Facebook!
