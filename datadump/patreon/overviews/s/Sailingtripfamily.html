Maryline, my wife is a professional singer and I have been in the Navy for 16 years. \n\n4 years ago we decided to change our lifestyle. \u003cbr\u003eI fisrtly started to talk to my wife about this crazy project to circumnavigate the world for 8 years, and of course her reaction was instantly No !!! \u003cbr\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to sell our house and more than everything, she didn\u0027t want to stop her job and leave her friends. I had to find good arguments to convince her ;-)\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat did I say to convince her ? \u003cbr\u003e\nThat is the question ;-) ....  \nI just told her she wouldn\u0027t loose her job and she would sing abroad everywhere and it would be a good opportunity for our daughters to grow up like this, traveling around the world. \nAbout friends, it would be also a good opportunity to them to travel to visit us.\nAbout our house, I just said it was just a house, something material, nothing important to say no to this project....\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd after few days thinking, she said let\u0027s go and here we are ! \u003cbr\u003ewith our amazing 40ft catamaran called L\u0027Eclectik.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe left France in 2015 and we already spent 2 years sailing around europe and carabbean islands. The next step will be the pacific and we decided to share with all of you this amazing experience.\u003cbr\u003eThanks for supporting us and to make our dream coming truth.\u00a0",
