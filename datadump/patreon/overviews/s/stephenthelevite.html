    "summary": "What up! I\u0027m Darrell aka Stephen the Levite and I\u0027ve been pushing content driven lyricism through classic east coast Hip Hop since 2001. But after 2 1/2 years in Brooklyn, I\u0027ve determined a few things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. It\u0027s expensive to live here. Because of that, I\u0027ve been working 50-60 hours a week doing work other than music to take care of my family. I\u0027m not complaining about it. As a Lyft driver I\u0027ve met (literally) thousands of people who live here and are experiencing the same struggle, working even more hours, sleeping less, and also pushing their creative ventures to the side so they can pay rent. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Music is my calling. What I do is unique. There aren\u0027t many artist trying to do what I\u0027m trying to do. But I\u0027m not the only one who wants to hear an artist making the kind of music I do. So I can either complain about the lack, or do something about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Hip Hop is one of the few art forms where so much free content is expected that artists like Chance the Rapper have determined to make most of his money from things OTHER than music. That works for some, but music is the thing I\u0027m really good at. I specialize in bars. Not beats. Not t-shirts. Not hats. You may get those things from me, but they all require me to go to other people. I believe artists should be paid for their art. Not just the peripheral merchandise and such. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. Work has also kept me from participating in the local church we moved here to be a part of. Providing for my family is a priority that validates my character and witness in the church, but only if I\u0027m there. Not only that, much of my music has focused on the need to participate in the local church. It\u0027s still something I expect of myself, my family and others. Therefore I need to find a way to prioritize the time it requires. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn light of those things, I see Patreon as a possible solution to these problems. If this works, it\u0027ll afford me the time to do music, actually get paid for it, and provide for my family, while serving the mission we believe we were sent here to do with our church. I also see it as a means to reward those who\u0027s support goes beyond the typical. I\u0027ve met those over the years that pay more for CD than they should, expressed the impact my music has made in their lives, or bought extra so they can share. I\u0027ve always wanted to do more for these kind of fans and this is a way to reward them differently. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thanks for your time. I look forward to sharing, not just early releases, exclusive music, discounts, etc., but also my journey as an artist from this point forward. Grace and Peace"

     "about": "\u201cI started writing just to get good enough to battle a rapper in my high school that I felt was disrespecting the craft.\u201d \u201cI was into the culture \u2013 the four elements \u2013 B-boying, MCing, Graffiti Art, and DJing he was into getting attention/showing off\u2026I guess you could say he was into rap and I was into hip-hop.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e36-yr-old Darrell Bell, better known as Stephen the Levite (STL), is a husband, father, community leader, and Christian emcee. The California native is a son of the hip-hop movement, a student of the culture, and a leader in a new genre of underground hip-hop music with a Christian message. Growing up in the era when Gangsta rap and East Coast/West Coast rivalries were dominating the urban music scene, STL was a bit different from many of his peers. Taking the time to delve into the origins of hip-hop with his Asian-American, Latino and Caucasian friends while in high school, fleeting music trends didn\u2019t sway STL \u2013 his passion was tied to the core tenants of the genre.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHeavily influenced by some of his favorite rappers at the time \u2013 Heavy D, Wu Tang Clan, Mob Deep, Common, and others \u2013 STL drew more and more into the music. Never one to freestyle in battles, STL began writing consistently at the age of 15 to hone his craft. The ruggedness, artistry, and competitiveness of hip-hop captivated him \u2013 suddenly the music had become an innate expression of who he was.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpon graduation from high school, after getting saved in his late teens, STL enrolled in Calvary Chapel Bible College. It was there that he begin rapping in a group called Redeemed Thought, spreading the knowledge he gained from his classes to diverse audiences. From the beginning of his career, Stephen the Levite chose to be direct about his faith in his lyrics. After seeing a musical group perform which did not disclose their faith as a driving force behind their music, STL determined that he would be upfront about his musical intentions to his audiences. STL became engrossed in the music that Philadelphia based Christian hip-hop group Cross Movement was doing \u2013 the group\u2019s work would become his standard for excellence and a model for his own career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter feeling led spiritually to move to Philadelphia, Stephen the Levite along with his group mate muzeONE set out to make the city of brotherly love their new home town. It wasn\u2019t long before Stephen the Levite became a part of the Christian Hip-Hop movement, linking up with fellow lyricists, singers, producers, and more. He soon signed to Lamp Mode Recordings and quickly made a name for himself both in the city and around the nation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStephen the Levite has a burden on his heart for this generation. \u201cI want to see the family get straight. It all starts with men being responsible, taking care of their kids, being a part of churches and living as upright men. Those are the building blocks of a healthy community.\u201d When asked why the name, Stephen the Levite his answer is simple \u2013 \u201cStephen, the martyr is my hero \u2013 he didn\u2019t have a title or prestige, but he stood up for God and people responded to the message he delivered. That is the type of person I want to model, the legacy I want to leave.\u201d",
