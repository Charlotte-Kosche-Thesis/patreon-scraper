    "summary": "Hello, dear reader, and welcome! I\u0027m so glad you stopped in, and hope you\u0027ll stay and make yourself comfortable. I am at heart a storyteller, and what\u0027s a story without someone to hear it? It\u0027s a pure sweetness to share stories and time with you. As a poet, my goal is to see the world with new eyes, unearth new stories, and then tell them. I hope what you see, hear, and read gives you pleasure and fills your mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a singer/songwriter, and half of a duet called Sparrow. Sometimes the poems I write become songs, thanks to my genius partner Rabbit. He and I enjoyed a small but dedicated fan base \"back in the day\" as Waltz of the Wood, but then took an extended hiatus. It warms me to get messages from fans even now about the old music, and gives me great joy to be making new music with Rabbit again. That I will also share here on Patreon, as Sparrow. (Look at the Rewards offered to see how you can get early, and ongoing, access to it!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhilosophically, I keep it simple: Go with the flow, watch for fairies, dance to whatever music you hear, and PLAY. Never let yourself be too old, too tired, or too dignified to just play. Oh, and fill yourself up with love until it fills everything and everyone around you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll leave you with a video of one of those \"back in the day\" pieces. The lyrics to it will be my first poetry post here."
