    "summary": "In 2008, Naaim had an idea. Coincidentally, he bought a laptop earlier that year, and thought the microphone was really great. Thus the Real View Mirror was born and had a successful 3 episode run. Unfortunately, it did not meet Debmar-Mercury standards for renewal (especially since it never reached 10 episodes) and was cancelled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6 years and 18 podcasts later, Naaim had the same idea he got back in \u002708. And then he changed the name.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMovie Freaks \u0026amp; Sprocket Fiends is a Chatrealm-Award-Nominated glance at the media we consume akin to looking into a car mirror as you try to switch lanes. It offers witty host banter and discussions based on truth, justice, and the American Way. We are exactly the sorts of people Steve Rogers would want us to be. The show features a \"rotating panel of hosts\" who all bring their unique experiences and media consumption habits to talk about that media critically and comedically. During the month of November 2014, we finally satisfied the standards for Debmar-Mercury syndication, and successfully produced a 30-episode daily podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope to upgrade our podcasting equipment as well as move from podcasting semi-professionally to professionally. Also, you fund that kid who choked on skittles for a bit once.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show currently streams on diamondclub.tv on select Fridays (announced beforehand via Twitter) and is hosted on \u003ca href=\"http://mfsf.website\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://mfsf.website\u003c/a\u003e and on Kuhan\u0027s YouTube channel.\u003cbr\u003e"
