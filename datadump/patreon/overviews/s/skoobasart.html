Hence why I think something like Patreon is so important and a great place to feature my art. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLet me say that I still want to \u0027give it away\u0027 on every social media outlet I possibly can, for those who can\u0027t afford to pay or don\u0027t have as much as someone else might. It\u0027s much easier to stay afloat asking 1,000 fans for a dollar than asking 100 fans for ten dollars each, as crazy as that might sound. Some people will want to give more, but some of us don\u0027t have even that much to give. So imagine if you\u0027re favorite band constantly uploaded new material online for free...awesome! Great!....now imagine if they couldn\u0027t pay rent and had to go back to flipping burgers like I do...the music, that art...is gone. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I want to share my art with all of you, however, I need to be able to pay rent to do so. So every little dollar helps. I don\u0027t want to hide my art behind a tier like a VIP club, I want it out for everyone to be able to enjoy (or hate...it\u0027s not that great after all :) but I want to be able to keep creating everyday. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo all of my links are on this page. Enjoy them, share them, color my lineart, whatever you want to do. If you can give a dollar or 5 each month, I\u0027m forever grateful. If you can\u0027t, I know how you feel, I\u0027ve been there, most likely as you\u0027re reading this, I still am there...and I dont want you to miss out on something because of your financial status in life. So please, follow me and enjoy what I create, regardless of the fact that you can or cannot donate. And if the funds come in heavy enough, I do have some personal projects I\u0027d like to spend more time on that I can share more freely on here, with all of you, rather than if I were working for a bigger company and had to contractually hide certain things.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m hoping this philosophy takes off and everything works out for the better. Thank you all for your support and even just checking out my art.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPeace\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Skooba\" Steve Myers\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://darthskooba.deviantart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://darthskooba.deviantart.com\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
