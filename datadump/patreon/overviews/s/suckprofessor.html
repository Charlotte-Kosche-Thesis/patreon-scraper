Welcome to SuckProfessor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly after multiple viewers requested it did we even think about doing a Patreon. Honestly, it\u0027s nuts. Strangers were literally disappointed they couldn\u0027t give us money. CRAZY, RIGHT? And flattering too. We\u0027re proud of the \u003cstrong\u003epositive, open-minded community of heroes\u003c/strong\u003e we\u0027ve developed over the years and are grateful to anyone who offers support at whatever level, even if it\u0027s just a kind word and a pat on the ass.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut this is about more than compliments and ass-patting, this is about incentive. Your support will keep us accountable and help us continue to provide tv show, movie and video game reviews and discussions; \u003cstrong\u003eshot-by-shot breakdowns\u003c/strong\u003e and to further the \u003cstrong\u003eanimated adventures\u003c/strong\u003e of Hank and James, as well as more and more consistent \u003cstrong\u003elivestreams\u003c/strong\u003e. You deserve consistency and we intend to deliver.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is your opportunity to help our channel grow. As Spiderman\u0027s dad said: With a bigger audience comes bigger possibilities. Including: Putting ourselves in front of the camera one of these days, travel to nerd conventions to interview fellow dweebs and film cool stuff, the ability to take calls during livestreams, an animated cooking show, who knows!?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat you get:\u003c/h4\u003eFrom Innocent Bystanders to Immortal Being, we\u0027ve got a wide range of levels.\u00a0At the Bystanders ($5) and above, you get access to our patreon-only podcast.

Second: everything else. Stuff ain\u0027t cheap and running a youtube channel takes a lot of stuff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComputer upgrades -- graphics cards, hard drives, RAM, monitors, monitor wipes and the like. Games, shows, movies and software -- movie tickets, rentals, streaming services, video game purchases, video game systems, general computer software, etc.\u003cbr\u003eProduction software -- Adobe Creative Cloud alone is $50 a month, others as needed, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eRecording equipment -- microphones, cameras, capture devices, wires, chairs, headphones, etc.\u003cbr\u003eAll the rest -- rent, electricity, burrito-related diarrhea pills, new pants, pants consultants, etc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eOur Goals\u003c/h4\u003e\u25cf Have fun\u003cbr\u003e\u25cf Be honest with our audience\u003cbr\u003e\u25cf Be available and responsive to our patrons\u003cbr\u003e\u25cf Reach more people\u003cbr\u003e\u25cf Enjoy the process\u003cbr\u003e\u25cf Financial independence*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Our ultimate goal is to set aside the day jobs and do this full time. Financial independence would completely change our ability to produce videos. That would be awesome. A channel can dream...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNot ready or too broke?\u003c/strong\u003e That\u0027s okay, too. We\u0027re grateful for anyone who rewards our work with their attention, their likes and subscriptions. Another non-financial way to support is tell a friend or share a video on social media or other platforms. Write your grandma a letter. She\u0027ll love it (the letter, not SuckProfessor).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNot familiar with SuckProfessor?\u003c/strong\u003e We\u0027re Hank and James, a comedian and a regular human. Based in Los Angeles. We love games, shows, movies and nerd crap. Ours is a light-hearted, positive approach to enjoying the things we love. We\u0027ve been on YouTube since 2013. Our original mission was to be our authentic selves and have fun creating [hopefully] funny and entertaining videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho is Hank? A comedian and comedy writer -- also a professional video editor -- Hank started his comedy career in 2009 performing stand up in Chicago where he became an expert at publicly humiliating himself, something he has never stopped doing. With an unfiltered style and a quick mind, Hank is prone to oversharing and instant regret. In addition to stand up, he has made short films, acted in various roles, produced sketches and parodies; has been on the radio as a political commentator in LA, NY and other markets; hosts podcasts (Winners and Losers Show) and a web-series (Infinite Clicks); worked as a video producer/editor/writer for The Young Turks; animated the 10-episode series Blair on TBS dot com and is somewhat tall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho is James? The nicest man to ever exist. He won\u0027t swear. It\u0027s weird but he won\u0027t. He can\u0027t. His brain won\u0027t let him. Hank tries to get him to swear using lies, trickery and deception but no matter what, James\u0027 decency prevails. It\u0027s amazing! James has a day job with a day cubicle but loves playing games, watching shows and seeing movies. His facility with the finer details is only matched by Hank\u0027s ability to forget them. Sometimes Hank worries James is funnier than Hank. It freaks him out a little, so much so he has to write in third-person in order to even communicate about it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s it! You read to the bottom! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eHank \u0026amp; James\u003cbr\u003e"
