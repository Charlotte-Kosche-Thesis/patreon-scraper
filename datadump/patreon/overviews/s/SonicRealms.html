At $10,000/month, I will be able to open a recording studio devoted solely to capturing roleplay sessions and cranking out Hypercuts. A central beacon where role playing games start to spill out into the real world. Anyone can make an appointment, drop in, play a game, and have a hypercut made shortly after. Or, if the studio is too far, microphones can be shipped to players all over the world.",

I have a really cool idea for how to present these adventures on the big screen, but it\u0027ll be costly to do these stories justice. \u00a0The $50,000 would probably be used as a down payment for a massive loan, and paying off said loan as the production rolls along. Hopefully these can be true films for fans, because with your corroboration, we can keep greedy studio execs at bay and create stories that don\u0027t adhere to predictable Hollywood formulas, they adhere to unpredictable RPGs. I fully intend to keep a close ear to the fans wishes. It\u0027s because of you that this dream would even be possible.",
