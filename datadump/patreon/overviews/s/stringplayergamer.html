    "summary": "Hey there,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Diwa a.k.a. the String Player Gamer from Youtube. \u003cstrong\u003eMy channel is all about my two biggest passions: music and video games.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMario, Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy and Chrono Cross are among the top favorite game franchises I love to cover, but that\u0027s just the tip of the iceberg. You can also find some obscure VGM covers among my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a professional composer, arranger, music producer and live musician and have been at it for almost 20 years. I also apply this professional level of experience and creative quality to my VGM covers. \u003cstrong\u003eMy covers range from orchestral, acapellas, violin, guitar and a combination of all four.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a working dad to my fast growing daughter who apparently has inherited my love of games. I juggle between Youtube, music production, family life and gaming. So far it has been exciting to say the least. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had my solid taste of life as a successful film, television and commercial composer, and I have travelled around the world performing live in various music festivals. But as my Youtube channel grows, I\u0027m closer and closer to turning it into a full time job. This is my end goal. And with your help and support, we can make this happen faster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny financial support that you give me will immediately go to my various expenses involved in my Youtube production such as violin strings, guitar strings, electricity bills, internet bills and equipment upgrades such as better microphones, possibly a better camera and more external drives to store my ever growing collection of Youtube HD video footages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly music videos will be charged. I upload one music video every week, or sometimes every other week if my schedule is loaded. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVLOGs, announcement videos and mini covers won\u0027t be charged. You can choose to stop sending money anytime you wish with no repercussions. \u003cstrong\u003ePledging is purely optional, but If you choose to support me, then you are awesome and I thank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
