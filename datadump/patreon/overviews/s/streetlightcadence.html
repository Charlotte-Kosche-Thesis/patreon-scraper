If you didn\u0027t know, Streetlight Cadence started as a sidewalk band, performing for complete strangers in Waikiki. \u00a0In the process we made friends, fans, and even a career for ourselves as live performers. \u00a0Fast forward a few years. \u00a0We moved to Los Angeles to see if we could conquer the music industry. \u00a0We are hustling everyday, accepting odd gigs, street performing, and taking every opportunity we can to try and get our band to the next level. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a world where music is streamed on Spotify and Youtube for free, the return on investment for creating and releasing new material is next to nothing. \u00a0Because new material doesn\u0027t necessarily draw income, its hard for musicians like ourselves to keep creating. \u00a0We spend most of our time performing to pay rent, but we really want to spend more time making new material. \u00a0This is where we need you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to create and release up to one new song a week along with a simple music video for youtube, but we need your help to do it. \u00a0Consider subscribing as a Patron, and help us create new music and share it with the world. \u00a0You can become a Patron for as little as $1 per project, and we promise to do our best with whatever you can offer. \u00a0Its almost like tipping us on the sidewalks again, but now you can tip us for the new content we make. \u00a0Plus, there are plenty of cool rewards to show our thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you like the idea as much as we do, so we are just gonna go for it, and hopefully you will join us for the ride!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
