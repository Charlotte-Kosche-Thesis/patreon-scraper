    "summary": "Born in Mauritius, raised in Canada, Mohammad Ali is one man who\u2019s been forced to walk two directions. An artist, an activist. Whether in the studio or in the picket lines, Mohammad has blended the raw energy that made hip-hop the global cultural force that it is, with a rock solid commitment to grassroots social justice activism for over ten years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith his second album, Labour of Love, Mohammad ups the bar on protest music with a hard-hitting selection of workers\u2019 anthems, spoken word poems and gritty frontline labour narratives designed to instil new energy in the movement for workers\u2019 rights. Moving labour struggles beyond the \u2018acoustic guitar\u2019 and onto something original for a new generation, the Socialist Vocalist is redefining how his generation views political music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past decade, he has shared the stage with artists such Talib Kweli, Wu-Tang Clan\u0027s Ghostface, and hip-hop royalty KRS-ONE. He has performed at rallies from Parliament Hill (Stop SPP) to Queen\u0027s Park (Stop C-51) to Toronto City Hall (May Day; Stop Rob Ford) and headlined the 2007-08 nation-wide \u201cNot in Our Names\u201d tour, which combined with his \u201cSuch a Long Journey\u201d album. These efforts helped to raise funds and awareness for US soldiers fighting for refuge from militarism. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMohammad\u2019s unique voice and perspective as a bridge between the worlds of hip-hop music and social activism have afforded him the opportunity to speak and facilitate workshops at various colleges/universities in Canada, all atop his concurrent tour schedule. To his own right, Mohammad created and curated the Hip-Hop \u0026amp; Empowerment Conference from 2011-14.  Mohammad Ali has been covered/ interviewed by such programs/outlets as: \u201cThe National with Peter Mansbridge\u201d (broadcast across Canada), The CBC Nightly News in Toronto, \u201cCBC Metro Morning\u201d (Radio broadcasted nationally) and \u201cThis Magazine\u201d (national syndication). \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI love Mohammad Ali \u2013 a powerful voice for justice and great music.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\nCharlie Angus (NDP Member of Parliament since 2004)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFor booking inquiries or more information, please contact \u003ca href=\"mailto:socialisthiphop@gmail.com\"\u003esocialisthiphop@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting Mohammad\u0027s Patreon page will allow him to produce progressive, socially conscious albums every year, produce accompanying cinematic feature music videos, and continue to produce radical journalism focused on issues relating to arts, culture and resistance.\u003cbr\u003e"
