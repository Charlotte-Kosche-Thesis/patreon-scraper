Your donations make it possible for me to continue as an independent author, and to try things that others might not want to publish. My own personal views, as always, will be brought to you unfiltered. Once a week I\u0027ll post a blog discussing what I\u0027ve been up to, and talk about writing.

Anyway, \nsummed up to its basic core, I would say Autonomy means \u201cleave me alone,\n and I\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d This does not imply that I wouldn\u2019t help \nothers. Certainly if I were to encounter someone in need I would assist.\n But I feel that essentially we are all in charge of our own lives. We \nare free to make our own mistakes and our triumphs are our own to \ntreasure. We should be able to rely on friends, family, or partners, but\n let us not force others to care for those they do not know. This isn\u2019t \nto say that one cannot offer help, or accept help from others; just no \nforce should ever be involved. I find this particular philosophy most \nimportant about myself. Other philosophies are available; please feel \nfree to peruse them as well. But autonomy is a strong subject in my \nworks and will be seen often.",
