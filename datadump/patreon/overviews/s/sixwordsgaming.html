    "summary": "Six words gaming is a collective of queer feminist game designers, artists, and illustrators working together to make games and related art, all centering around our want to change the world and make it better. We all come at games from different perspectives, and love it in our own different ways, but we\u0027re all eager to share this with the world and help shape the world around us with it in the same stroke. And we\u0027re hoping you want to help us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, we have a snood-like adventure that\u0027ll make you question your existence (or at least distract you while you poop) called Overwrite on the Android store. We have also written a paper RPG that is an even mixture of lighthearted comedy and existential horror, set in our world just forty years later in the American Empire. Time is meaningless, existence is a lie, and you\u0027re stuck in the void. Fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to say thank you to the people who have supported us, both on here and to the people who we\u0027ve met in person or who have watched our videos or played our games. We\u0027re still starting out\u00a0 but we\u0027re eager to get our games in front of people and show the world what we are going to make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmy is a many-hat wearing digital demon queen, having worked at a variety of video studios and on a number of different projects. She\u2019s worked at Bose as a technologist, as a video editor and motion graphics artist for JoVE, and worked as an animator, editor, and motion graphics artist for HBO, Food Network, Boeing, and more. Having worked on interactive projects and a fair amount of UI design, as well as spent years writing and developing several concepts for the games present, she\u2019s leading the vision for the team as the Creative Director. She\u2019s a capable creative in a variety of areas, and has helped guide all of the projects from their inception to where they are now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeta is our newest street artist, apprenticing under Punch.Back. She\u0027s worked for a few years as a print designer but is taking those typographic and layout skills and pushing. She\u0027s an incredibly capable artist who is a person of few words but whose input in physical assets and helping with the organization of the back end has been invaluable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAndria lives, breathes, and sweats games. She entered the world of game development first as a fan, then moved on to drawing characters of games she loved to animating what she\u0027d drawn and everything has sort of spiraled from there. Her artistic style is based partially on her experience with modern, adult animation, much of which is versed in a long history of animation. Her personal tastes when it comes to writing and projects tend to be on the lighter side compared to some of the darker creative forces on the team, and her extensive experience in the game world gives a good perspective for us to build from. Andria has proven herself well versed as an illustrator, a developer, and as a jack of all trades creative who is the kind of person who you throw at a project whole heartedly. When she isn\u2019t our COO and Lead Creative, she\u2019s playing the types of games that make her break controllers. We know because she often plays on a throne of old, broken controllers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePunch.Back is a street artist, lending her hand to help generate assets and build/finesse huge parts of the code for the games we\u2019re creating. Because of the nature of most of her work, she\u2019s going to have to remain hidden. From a technical perspective, she works in a number of different languages and largely engages in activist work with Carberp and Social Engineering. We have a deal that we won\u2019t give too much identifying information about her away, but she\u2019s a graduate of both art school and has engineering degrees, and she normally works by using her digital medium to make traditional art in a variety of different forms. Her style is very much her own, mixing elements of Banksy-styled cartoonish postmodernism with a love for pop culture and pop art in equal measure. She has dedicated her life to making the world better through creative pursuits and we are happy to be a part of that in the small way we can. When she isn\u2019t changing the world, she\u2019s a wife, foster mother of three, and defines herself as \u201cthat queer autistic girl you\u2019re probably ignoring at the grocery store.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are creatives and professionals who are obsessed with every aspect of gaming. We make games. We discuss gaming culture in videos. And we believe firmly in the power of games to make change. We\u0027re making the kind of games we want to see in the world, and talking about the games that are already here - how they impact things, how they miss the mark, how they do things well, what moves people. We\u0027re always looking for creatives who want to get involved in our projects and that would be a good fit.
