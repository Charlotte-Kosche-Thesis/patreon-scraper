    "summary": "\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\tBorn in Washington State in the early years of the 1970\u0027s, Eleri Hamilton has been a denizen of the Pacific Northwest ever since. She is a woman of varied talents, having worked as a florist, an actress, a doula, and a salad bar attendant; as well as working and running conventions, planning events, developing puzzles and games, writing, making things, doing website and graphic design, painting and generally juggling more things than she really needs to be!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tShe can usually be found herding cats, teaching \n\t\u003cem\u003eBirthing From Within\u003c/em\u003e childbirth education classes, reading and/or generally being awesome; all while living in an oft discombobulated home north of Seattle, WA that she shares with her spouse, one of her kids, and a menagerie of pets.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\tYup. That would be me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up in a house full of books, and spent my childhood reading and doing theater, so the love of storytelling soaked into my bones early. Now I find ways to let my storytelling bones sing out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI write.\u003c/strong\u003e Not in the All The Writers Workshops, OMG Another Rejection Slip sense- I\u0027m not aspiring to be a professional writer, those people have way more gumption than me! \u00a0I have stories (usually of the SF/F type) in my head, and they want to come out, so I open up a word processor program and I start writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI tell stories in the oral tradition.\u003c/strong\u003e Oral storytelling is, in some areas, a lost art. The weave and flow of the words, the cadence and pitch of your voice, drawing in your listeners so that the story finds them on a personal level- so that they can see themselves reflected in what you are saying.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI do voice work.\u003c/strong\u003e I read existing stories and scripts, I embody characters that will only be heard, or seen through digital media.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, being a childbirth educator is not a particularly lucrative or self-sustaining career, as much as I love doing it. And, while I am blessed with a spousal income that keeps a roof over our heads and food in our belly, things still get snug. Add in that my physical health renders me unable to hold down a Real Job (and our society is being stubborn about Universal Basic Income), and it means I sometimes feel like an noncontributing member of the household.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus (after wresting with \"I\u0027m not a \u003cem\u003eREAL \u003c/em\u003ewriter/storyteller/voiceactor, why would people pay \u003cem\u003eME\u003c/em\u003e\" internal judgement BS), here I am- sharing my creations with you, my glorious patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the written word-\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ethey are raw, unedited, proofread by computer.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0CE types will probably find their eyes twitching. I empathize, but I can\u0027t afford you...yet ;) \u00a0\u003cem\u003eNote: Fanfic type stuff will be posted publicly, because. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the spoken word- They are as clean as I can make them with the equipment I currently have! More patrons = better mic!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u0027ll enjoy. Thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Eleri\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
