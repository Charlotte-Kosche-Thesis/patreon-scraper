I\u0027m Shaun. I make videos for the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s my real name. I never actually intended to actually talk about politics or feminism on YouTube, or I would have used a\u00a0nom de plume. That horse has bolted now, though, I suppose.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT DO YOU DO\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make videos about whatever takes my fancy. I used to make sub-par let\u0027s-play videos, because I didn\u0027t know anything about sound recording, sound editing, lighting, camerawork, video recording, video editing, performing, video games, or anything else. You name it, I didn\u0027t know much about it. But I learned a lot during the process of making those videos, and I now know at least 4 things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLately, I\u0027ve been making video responses to videos put out by various anti-feminist/alt-right youtubers. I watch their videos and check out their sources and arguments, and I throw in the odd joke every now and then to stop people from falling asleep.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really like doing this, it turns out. I find it fun \u0026amp; I think it is worthwhile. I\u0027d like to keep doing it, and get better at it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT WOULD MY SUPPORT GO TOWARDS?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, supporting me helps me to keep putting videos out while not dying, which is something that has always been very important to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore excitingly, though, your support enables me to get better at what I\u0027m doing. The more time I can dedicate to this, the better I can make it. \u0026amp; I want to put out the best videos that I can. I also need better equipment. O Lord do I need better equipment. You wouldn\u0027t believe the shoddy setup I\u0027ve got going on over here, honestly. Shameful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHOW OFTEN WOULD I BE SUPPORTING YOU?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be releasing \u0027big\u0027 Patreon-able videos at a rate of 1-2 per month, to start out, at least.\u00a0Smaller videos - channel updates and the likes - I won\u0027t be asking for anything for. Don\u0027t worry, I won\u0027t start releasing daily tiny videos and charging for them like SOME PEOPLE WHO SHALL REMAIN NAMELESS. Ahem\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d also encourage anyone to make use of the monthly limit option, to make sure I don\u0027t go ripping you all off with a bunch of spam videos \u0026amp; fleeing to Tijuana.\u003cbr\u003e"
