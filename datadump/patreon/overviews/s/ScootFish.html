    "summary": "I started YouTube viewing it as a career. I am always striving to improve and make better content as it should be with any career. I started off barely getting a video out a month with the goal of making videos daily. Through hard work and effort I have made that a reality. My content quality has also improved, and I feel like my viewers have seen this progression.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 It\u0027s time to take\u00a0the channel\u00a0to the next level. With the help of my most loyal fans I\u0027m hoping that I can do just\u00a0that and continue to make enjoyable/informative content. With your contributions to the channel I can upgrade equipment and keep it in working order, purchase the latest games and hardware to keep relevant, and travel, amongst many other things. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 My promise to you as a Patron is to always\u00a0use that money for the channels well being and progression, to provide multiple videos a week videos, and to never stop striving to produce better and better content. If you\u0027re my Patron you mean the world to me and it would break my heart to let you down.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 As a thank you to all my Patrons I have set up rewards at different commitment levels. As the channel grows, so will my ability to give back to you. These rewards may change with the growth of the channel and the needs of the Patrons, so expect to see more rewards and adjustments along the way. I promise that I will do my best to reward patrons that are present during any of these changes."
