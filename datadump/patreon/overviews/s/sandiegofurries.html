The furry fandom is a close-knit community by nature, but we feel that we have enough experience in having good, clean fun, that there\u0027s no reason we can\u0027t share it with the public!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe San Diego area is full of wonderful sights, attractions and activities for us to explore, so this Patreon was created to help us fund our adventures together! \u00a0We as the Meetup Organizers, Alex Train \u0026amp; Aulii Keaweehu (Chance the Dragon \u0026amp; Fenrisulfr) want to expand our horizons and activities across much larger venues, but doing so requires money that we just cannot afford ourselves. \u00a0So, as we accumulate funds from donations and pledges, we\u0027ll be able to schedule bigger and better meetups for our furry friends!"
