I would very probably shrivel up and die without being able to draw and write my own work, and consequntly the logical step is to endeavour to make my own work my professional living! There is also a rather real possibility that I will not be able to draw for the rest of my life, as the joints in my fingers are affected by the condition and will likely get worse as I age, so the sooner I can focus all my energy on completing my stories the more likely I will be able to before it gets to that point. I\u0027ve been very lucky with the people who have helped and supported \nme thus far, and I can\u0027t imagine how I could have done as much as I have\n without my family and friends. This is the next chapter, and while it \nis a frighteningly big step it would be churlish to put aside what they \nhave already given me without at least trying to make a go of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I am able to reach minimum wage with Patreon, I will be able to commit 100% of my time to working on the stories you guys want to read! I will also be able to do more exercise to prevent my body from falling to pieces, and I will be able to plan research trips to make the art I create that much more accurate and pretty! I will also be able to structure my time more efficiently, so that when I\u0027m taking a break from the comic I can write something instead, or put aside a few hours to do a livestream of my drawing process! I will also be providing step by steps of how I make some of my work, and if you support me you can always put in a request of what kind of pictures you would like to see a \u0027guide to\u0027 version of. Who knows! If all goes well I may be able to start visiting conventions in other countries, to visit you and give you access to physical copies of the work that you\u0027ll be helping me to make!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that while most of my rewards will be posted as they occur, the larger rewards of the signed books and character cameos can only be received after payment due to the work required!\u003cbr\u003e"
