How will we do this? \u003cbr\u003eFor our short films and original content that means re-investing in new\n film equipment, being able to afford filming locations, supporting our \ncast \u0026amp; crew and basically take our videos to the next level.For our cosplay videos that means being able to make more - travel to new conventions and pay for the song licenses.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027ll also help us finish a couple of much over due projects that we are currently working on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOur Goals:\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve kept this really simple for now because we want any support you guys give us to go directly into improving our content.
