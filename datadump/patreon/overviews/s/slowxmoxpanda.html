    "summary": "MAY 2018 UPDATE: I have given all I can to promoting this Patreon page, even had several \nreally popular Twitter users RT \u0026amp; Like my Patreon posts recently, \nbut for some reason, STILL no more supporters... I\u0027ve decided that if I \nstill can\u0027t get anyone to donate at least $2/month towards my channel, \nmy survival, etc. by my Birthday at the end of July, this page will be shut \ndown. I have not had any donations on my GoFund in months either, and \nthe benefactor who saved my ass from losing power more than once has \nalso been MIA for quite a while. \u003cbr\u003eI am finding it very hard to have any \nmotivation, with health getting worse (as chronic \u0026amp; terminal illnesses going largely untreated will tend to do) \u0026amp; still being forced to deal with trolls 98% of the time whenever I\u0027m trying to sell stuff for bills, up to 40hrs a week. YouTube has also been cracking down on \nWeedtubers, so I have a new account at the new website TheWeedtube.com \n\u0026amp; plan to start uploading to it as soon as I can get a semi-decent \nquality video out. I will keep my YT channel as long as I can, but this \nwill be a backup. Find the link on my Twitter or in an announcement \nvideo soon.\u003cbr\u003eSome of my video content will be vlogs where I talk openly and 100% REAL, about my health problems, progression of chronic \u0026amp; terminal illnesses, my medical cannabis \u0026amp; other med use, and my biggest interests: recently becoming an atheist \u0026amp; religion, humanism, etc., activism in climate change, Cannabis legalization, LGBTQ \u0026amp; animal rights, human rights \u0026amp; poverty, TYT (Young Turks on YouTube), being a Bernie supporter, my obsession with Game of Thrones, sci-fi, fantasy, decor, crafts, geeky stuff, etc. I provide as much useful content as I can, and have uploaded dozens of cannabis tutorials, stoner budget tips, edibles tutorials, and much more. You will be getting your money\u0027s worth!\u003cbr\u003eIf this page ever does happen to miraculously take off (which to me would mean simply reaching my $200/mo goal) my dream is to have stability in my basic survival needs, so I can then afford to get a monthly subscription box sent, which I could then unbox/review on my channel, and create several surprise boxes to send to other medical cannabis patients who also cannot afford their own supplies or gifts. \u003cbr\u003eI can only imagine right now, how much more time \u0026amp; energy I\u0027d have to provide you with lots of awesome videos, if I didn\u0027t have to spend hours a day trying to make a few bucks a week, by selling off everything! Your help (including sharing my channel/patreon) could be what finally gives me a reason to keep going.\u003cbr\u003ePlease help make this a possibility by checking out my simple 2-tier donation selection, and thanks for your time!\u003cbr\u003eSee my YouTube channel for video updates \u0026amp; vlogs, and daily posts on Twitter. Any donation and/or share is another step in saving my life! Thanks all!\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "This is my story, the story of an American Refugee, trapped in the hell I\n was indoctrinated since birth to be terrified by, and that my family \nhas kept me trapped in, like a stifling cage only they have a key to. My \nfeeble efforts may seem pathetic compared to the genius \u0026amp; budget of other \nchannels on YouTube, on Weedtube, Game of Thrones \u0026amp; other shows, atheism/religion, politics/activism, etc. but the \nquality of content is limited only by my complete lack of budget, \nequipment, editing software, or anything more than a 4 year-old LGG3 \n\u0026amp; 2 failing 6+ year-old laptops. I have the creativity, desire, time, and \nwillingness, to produce tons of great vids for you all, and make my dream of unboxing/reviewing, hosting giveaways (sponsored by cannabis product companies, hopefully!) and putting together a few surprise Christmas boxes for other low-income cannabis patients!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a struggling vlogger \u0026amp; weedtuber, a single millennial with lots \nof health battles, including debilitating chronic pain \u0026amp; terminal \nillness, MS, Fibro, Endo, Chiari-I, Chrons, Interstitial Cystitis, \nTMJ/Trigeminal Neuralgia, Degenerative Disk Disease, Spinal Stenosis, \nsevere depression \u0026amp; anxiety with stress-induced heart failure. I was\n born into a country where, if you get sick or are disabled before you \nare an adult, you\u0027re expected to exist on 1/3 the national poverty level\n (which is $30k per year). Apparently, the govt expects the family of \nthe disabled to help them survive, but nobody gives a crap enough to \nmake sure I have any transportation, or can at least afford my basic \nsurvival needs, and I feel like I\u0027m trapped on death row.\u003cbr\u003eMaybe too \ndramatic, but I have been stuck in a toxic HUD apt. in Michigan for 8 years, with \nzero transportation beyond my mother taking me with her to the store, or\n to my once/mo Dr. appts (which I have to pay gas money for). This apt \nis so toxic, it\u0027s likely the cause of my nightly seizures, constant \nburning skin \u0026amp; other unexplained symptoms. I have begged my family \nfor 2 yrs to help me get out of here, after I had sold everything I own \nthat\u0027s worth much of anything, and I can no longer keep my own head \nabove water, with $400/mo left for all expenses after critical meds are \npaid for, and my energy level no longer allowing me to spend hours a day\n trying to sell the stuff I have left, basically yard sale type stuff, \nand if lucky, making $20/mo on that.\u003cbr\u003ePATREON is the least invasive idea, and I even\n tried offering the idea to my own family, that they could just each \nsend me $5/mo, I would have enough to cover my bills, and not have to go\n into panic \u0026amp; anxiety attacks almost daily, but not a single one has\n even done that much. I\u0027m told I am being way too selfish, expecting the\n same people who told me my whole life that \"Family means everything\" \nand \"Family is there when you really need help\", to actually act like \nthey are there for me. Emotionally, if not financially and physically. \nIt\u0027s almost as if they expect me to be an escort or something, even \nthough my health would never allow for it. I am severely limited \nwith options, and nobody can tell me WHAT TO DO.\u003cbr\u003eIf all I can do is just barely survive, I will still fight \u0026amp; work my ass off to \nprovide content you will all be happy to support. If you are generous \nenough to drop a few bucks a month my way, let me know what you\u0027d like \nto see a video on, and if it\u0027s not too hard, I will see if I can get it done!\u003cbr\u003eThanks much to anyone who still considers the invisible, alone, desperate single people who are seeking a way to survive, worthy of their time \u0026amp; support, in this day of daily mass shootings or disasters, each calling for more funds... Happy Holidays!\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "GOALS UPDATED MAY 2018: I started my YouTube channel \u0026amp; GoFund over 4 years ago with the dream of some day raising enough support to get a vehicle I could live in, and escape this toxic MI HUD apt I\u0027ve been stuck in for 8 years. After a few years of hard, near-daily promoting \u0026amp; networking, making as many vlogs as I could manage, only led to a few donations that kept my lights on \u0026amp; made it possible for me to survive this long, but never got to the point of acquiring a way out of here.\u003cbr\u003eI started to realize my dream of getting to a state I can afford to survive in, get the medical help I need, and be able to experience anything in life, was clearly never going to happen. All the donations \u0026amp; support are going out to people who have lived a good, well-off life, and just suddenly are hit by a natural disaster, or victim of a mass shooting. I\u0027ve been fighting for support for almost a decade (since my very capable, well-off, healthy family won\u0027t do anything) and since I\u0027ve never had a chance to be important to anyone, to show what I could contribute to humanity, nobody cares to waste their time/money.\u003cbr\u003eSo, the least I can possibly hope for, is that I can keep the power on, phone bill \u0026amp; groceries paid for, and maybe some day it will get to enough support that I can focus on trying to get out of here. I\u0027m exhausted from trying to sell the few things I still have worth anything, including things I never wanted to sell, and end up making maybe 10 cents an hour. I need to focus on getting healthy enough to get out of here, at any cost...\u003cbr\u003e",
