Much of the video history of the movement however exists only on old analog tapes in the closets, drawers and garages of the volunteers who recorded it. I have been part of the movement since I joined the L5 Society in 1986 and from 1990 until 2007 I volunteered my time, skills and resources to video tape the National Space Society\u2019s annual International Space Development Conference as well as events sponsored by local NSS chapters. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe NSS is putting together a digital video archive for access by the society leadership and researchers. The physical media is then sent on to a Museum in New Mexico for long term storage. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile some of my footage has been transferred to DVDs and donated to the archive, the process has been slow and video tapes do not last forever. Money is needed for supplies and maintenance of aging equipment to speed things up so this footage can be preserved before it is gone forever. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting this Patreon Campaign you will be providing the funds needed to digitize this footage and prepare it for long term storage, preserving this record of the pro-space community. \u00a0If the project reaches full funding the videos can also be uploaded to YouTube for easy access by all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I attended my first International Space Development Conference in 1989 in Chicago. \u00a0 In 1990 my cable company was offering classes for those interested creating local programming and I jumped at the chance, borrowing one of their cameras and taking it to that year\u0027s ISDC in Anaheim where I also did my best to organize other videographers. \u00a0Some of this footage was then used in a show called The Many Roads To Space. \u00a0Acquiring my own equipment I headed out to document all but one subsequent ISDC through the year 2007 when aging cameras and lack of funds forced my retirement from the pursuit.\u003cbr\u003e",
