That\u0027s why we co-founded a comedy theater here (\u003ca href=\"http://www.tnmcomedy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe New Movement\u003c/a\u003e), and why we\u0027ve spent the last 6 years making our careers here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we are not performing at The New Movement, we are touring. \u00a0Recent stops include SF Sketchfest, Chicago Sketchfest, a run at iO West, Moontower Comedy and Oddity Festival, and a 10-day tour of the East Coast. We have been featured on Upworthy, Bustle, and Splitsider and have been recommended as a must-see group by The Chicago Tribune and the Wall Street Journal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurtainup.com described us as\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u201ca comedy ensemble that mocks and makes fun of everything you always wanted to laugh at, but were afraid to start.\" \u003c/em\u003eAnd we think that\u0027s pretty right-on. \u00a0We love satire.

The result: our\u00a0video budget shrinks even as our imagination and ability grows.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what if it didn\u0027t have to be that way? This last video shows the potential of what we can do with a larger production budget. If even a fraction of our fans threw in a dollar for every sketch we make, then we would be able to raise the type of money to make our sketches even more elaborate. What if we could film a World War II scene complete with costumes and dirt and explosions? What if we could film the inside of an alien ship or animate the members of our group getting trapped in a video game? Oh, the possibilities! \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO, HERES THE DEAL\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 We will keep making each video every month even better than the last.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 These will always be free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 We will use Patreon to give our fans a chance to help us build the kind of budget for each video that allows us to do things we\u0027ve only previously dreamed of.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0"
