    "summary": "Hi! Firstly, thanks for going out of your way to check out this strangely titled Patreon channel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to share with you this thing that I call a \u003cstrong\u003eSong Fart\u003c/strong\u003e. It\u0027s a wonderful little musical creation I make quite often. It always sounds different, and it\u0027s never very planned!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e----------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started Song Farts about three years ago as an experimental challenge. I was having problems identifying myself as an artist. I didn\u0027t know what kind of music I was willing to make a career, or band, out of. So, I decided to explore. Musically. I thought, maybe if I could indulge in any genre, for a few hours, and write a silly little song about whatever popped up in my head that day, I would be able to \"Get it out\". Maybe I could see if that was the type of music that really struck a chord with me. If nothing else, it was a fun little project, honing my skills as a producer and... I use the term loosely here, film editor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt ended up being way more fun than I anticipated, and I made about 15 in the span of a couple months. I started showing them to my friends, made a little YouTube corner of the world. You know, nothing big. But I loved it, and that\u0027s all that mattered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong story short, my house was broken into, and everything I had to make Song Farts, (computer, instruments, cameras) were stolen. That was October 2013.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to now. Life kept on, jobs came and went, and now I\u0027ve got the stuff to get farting again. It\u0027s not the best.... YET! But it\u0027s enough to have a great time and make some great music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think it would be a wonderful experience if you helped me make some. You don\u0027t have to be a musician to do this. You just have to have ideas:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePut a funny phrase down. It could be something you thought up, and always knew it could explode if it just had some creative juice behind it. Maybe it\u0027s an inside joke. Maybe it\u0027s something you\u0027re pissed off about. Or passionate about! Or maybe you just threw some words together with fridge magnets. I don\u0027t care, let\u0027s inspire each other!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e----------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow It Works!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSimply sponsor at the pledge value that suits you, and you\u0027ll get the ability to be a part of my Song Farts! Each pledge value has a different level of participation, so read the descriptions carefully.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a dedicated email address for Song Farts, which you\u0027ll gain access to when you sponsor me. I\u0027ll take your requests through there, and put them in my extremely ingenious Song Fart Picking Device.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt lease five times a month, I\u0027ll be picking Song Fart ideas out of this jar. Every time I pick one, I\u0027ll film the results and post them up here... for dramatic purposes. Every Song Fart idea goes in the jar, and none of them get taken out!* \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat means every month, your chances of getting picked only increase! You can re-submit the same idea, or give me a new one. It\u0027s totally up to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith higher levels of sponsorship, you\u0027ll be able to submit genre ideas, in-the-style-of\u0027s, and lyrics! If your Song Fart idea gets picked, and you\u0027ve submitted any of these, they will absolutely go with your idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Duplicate votes from higher tiers will be removed when that idea gets picked!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e----------------------------------------------------------\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere is an Example of What To Expect:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IcHS_pztGF0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdd my ability to green screen now into the mix, and that\u0027s what you get! Five times a month at the least!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e----------------------------------------------------------\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Your Sponsorship Provides\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvery single dollar made here will work dutifully towards making Song Farts better. That\u0027s it. I love doing this, and your support of me doing this will only want to make me do it better. It\u0027s an entirely reciprocal deal. If it gets to a point where I can pay my rent, then my dream is achieved and I love you all forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can tell, my video game needs a bit of upgrading. First on my order of things to purchase is a proper camera.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom there, I\u0027ll be looking into special effects lighting, props, costumes, instruments... anything than can expand the Song Fart universe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf it really skyrockets to big baller world, I\u0027ll rent a studio where I\u0027ll have all my gear, and an amazing green screen setup. This will be a place to really go wild. And not just with Song Farts, but with any audio/visual project at all. My ultimate dream is to be able to provide an amazing space for creative sorts to actualize their visions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e----------------------------------------------------------\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn Closing\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThank you so much. You\u0027ve read to the very end of my verbal barfing. You\u0027re a very special, attentive person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I feel there is nothing more fulfilling than expressing oneself in the way you \nwere born into... and I also feel there should be nothing holding you back \nfrom doing that. This is my cause. I\u0027m striving to make my expression a source of love, stability, and happiness. Not just for me, but for everyone involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour sponsorship will make Song Farts better. I think I\u0027ll be doing this for a long time, because maybe this IS me finding myself. Maybe I\u0027m supposed to create all types of music, for everyone, about both nothing and everything. It feels good, and I\u0027m happy. I just want to share this with anybody who may feel happy hearing it.\u003cbr\u003e"
