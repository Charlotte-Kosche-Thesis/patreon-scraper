From the first issue of SLICE magazine published in 2007 (funded\nby cupcake sales and house parties) to our 7th annual writers\u2019 conference hosted last September, SLICE exists to bring people\ntogether around our shared love for literature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince launching, we\u0027ve seen writers publish their first work in SLICE\u00a0and then connect with agents who found them in our pages. Those writers have received honorable mentions in \u003cem\u003eBest American Essays \u003c/em\u003eand\u00a0the Pushcart Prize Anthology and landed book deals with some of the world\u0027s top publishers. At our conference, writers have also connected with agents, built communities of peers to support one another, and been mentored by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://slicelitcon.org/performers/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epeople in the book world\u003c/a\u003e whom they\u0027d otherwise never have met. Every milestone, whether it\u0027s a book deal or a new friendship forged between fellow writers, contributes to bringing new literature into the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhile we\u0027ve come a long way, our community\u2019s contributions still play a huge part in sustaining\nSLICE\u2019s programs. Whether you can pledge $3 a month or more, your support will\nhelp us to:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEdit, design, print, and distribute two issues\nof SLICE magazine each year \u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003ePay the writers, editors, and designers who\ncontribute to each issue\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003ePay the panelists who speak at the SLICE\nLiterary Writers\u2019 Conference\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eOffer scholarships to students experiencing\nfinancial hardship to attend the SLICE Literary Writers\u2019 Conference for free\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eFilm the panels at our conference so that those\nwho can\u2019t make it to New York can still benefit from our panelists\u2019 wisdom and\nadvice\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eCover other exciting operating expenses like\ninsurance, bookkeeping, web hosting, etc. \n\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHere is the full, more\nofficial backstory on SLICE:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSLICE was created by two book\neditors who wanted to champion new voices. We\u2019d seen firsthand how difficult it is for emerging writers\nto break into the publishing world. So we decided to create a space where new\nvoices were just as important as famous voices, a space where those two groups\nwould strike up all sorts of conversations. We invited people from the\npublishing industry to join in, too. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince\nlaunching in 2007, we\u2019ve published twenty-one issues of SLICE and\n600+ emerging writers; held more than 50 readings and other literary events\naround the country; and hosted seven writers\u2019 conferences.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSure, we are publishers. But perhaps even more than that, we are connectors. We\nwant to see what happens when two renowned writers sit down and talk about the\ncreative process. We want to give emerging writers the opportunity to ask\neditors what it\u2019s really like behind the scenes. We want readers to witness the\nconversational spark that flies when a story by a beloved voice appears\nalongside one they\u2019ve never heard before. We want to cross borders, to hear\ndiverse voices from the U.S. and around the globe, and to bring them together,\nwhether it\u2019s on a panel at our annual conference or in the pages of our\nsemi-annual magazine. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSLICE supporters are part of a community that\nbelieves emerging writers are critical to our cultural conversation. We are\nunited by our love for storytelling and our fierce passion for nurturing\nunheard voices. On the page and off the page, at Slice we forge connections\nbetween agents, editors, acclaimed writers, and new voices. You\u2019re invited to\njoin in, too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOur supporters are at the heart of our community.\nYou are readers, writers, and publishing professionals. You are here to talk,\nto connect, to learn, to discover. And by helping to sustain our programs, you\nplay an active role in nurturing the next generation of great\nstorytellers.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\nfriends, for the last ten years of SLICE\u2014and for the next ten. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYours in bookish\ncamaraderie, \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMaria\nGagliano \u0026amp; Celia Johnson\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCo-Founders/Publishers\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSLICE\nLiterary, Inc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://slicemagazine.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eslicemagazine.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://slicelitcon.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eslicelitcon.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
