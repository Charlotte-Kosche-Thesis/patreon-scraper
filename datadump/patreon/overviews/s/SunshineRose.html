    "summary": "A video version of this may come at a later date, but just to get started now, I\u0027d like to tell you a little bit about myself. (This has always been my downfall, so please bare with me) I\u0027m a mother of five little girls who are my world. I give these beautiful little creatures my everything, at every moment, every day. I\u0027m a mom first and foremost. But I\u0027m also an artist. Time and money are two things I don\u0027t have a lot of \"and that\u0027s okay\" I find ways to make it happen when I can. But for a while now I\u0027ve had this almost nagging feeling I need to do something more. I don\u0027t have an education, nor do I have experience in the art world. In turn if you choose to take this journey with me, you will be witnessing me doing a lot of firsts. That part is what I\u0027m totally in love with. Creating without having any idea of what I\u0027m doing and sharing as I go along. I\u0027m not just a painter, or a sculptor......i want to learn to do it all! I\u0027ve always had this dream of just creating randomness as it comes to me. Just to let go and let it all flow from me until it\u0027s a realization. A literal sense of what I feel in a solid form in front of me. I want to be an example for my children, that their dreams can become the reality they choose to create. That they don\u0027t need to wait for the right time or when they can afford it.....i used to tell myself that... \"Oh I\u0027ll just wait until they\u0027re grown a bit more, then I\u0027ll make time to do something with my art\" but I can\u0027t wait! I need to create! I need it like I need water, and I always have! To lose yourself in your passion is one of the most important ways of taking care of yourself. That is something I have pushed off for far too long. My girls need to see me succeed. I realize that now. I need to see myself succeed \u00a0in whatever path my art takes me, I\u0027m open to it with my whole heart\u2764\ufe0f"
