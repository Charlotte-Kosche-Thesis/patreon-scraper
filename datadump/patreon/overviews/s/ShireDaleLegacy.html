You know, the old ones. The ones that have been around forever and helped make the world what it is. And because we were in a position to do something to help, we looked for something to do. Something special. Something we\u0027re inviting you to share in.

To bring out into the world something that not a lot of people have seen before. The Dales have such a perfect personalities, and can be used to ride and drive equally well. I personally love how they move!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we can\u0027t do all this alone. This is where we need you, Patreon supporters! While we get busy and create magazines, videos, podcasts, and merchandise to show the world how great the Dales Pony is, we are inviting you to come alongside on our journey.

Who knows, maybe someday you\u0027ll want to take home a pony of your own! In the meantime, look around, ask questions, learn, and discover, and delight in the experience. We\u0027re glad you\u0027re here, and can\u0027t wait to get to know you better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill you join me as we trek down to the barn?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKristine \u0026amp; Dale Hansen\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.shiredale.com/\"\u003eShireDale Legacy Ranch\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003ea 501c3 (pending) dedicated to conservation \u0026amp; preservation of endangered Heritage Breeds\u003cbr\u003e"
