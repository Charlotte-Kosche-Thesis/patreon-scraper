Here encamped, I am in the pursuit of beauty; in studies of a timeless condition and unfettered nature. Ally yourself with this campaign to achieve something great, something lasting, something beautiful for our time here. Together we can write a future\u2019s history where our abilities of perception and craftsmanship were not lost to an age besieged by a faith in nothing. Join me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an American painter, I have a fascination with the old world and so cultivated an academic connection to The Venetian School. I have studied with living masters in Norway and in Italy. I have travelled to Germany, France, and England to learn from the ghosts in museums. However, it is here in frontier country where we carry the torch! With your support, we light the way forward!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe pictures that I make are not for a season but for a century. They are slow paintings\u2013\u2013anachronistic and figurative oil paintings of the Venetian School; depictions of classical beauty, comparative mythology, and continental philosophy; a continuum from Antiquity, the Renaissance, the Romantic; the study of ever-living fire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledge your support and learn about a craft that has guided humankind from our earliest days and deepest roots. Pledge your support so that we might save our oldest surviving language from falling into obscurity and obsolescence. Painting began by the light of fire, in the hands of shaman; it grew and blazed to console the wisest of philosophers with its brilliance; it has guided all souls seeking what depths might be written on its surface. If we do not keep this flame it will go out. Pledge your support\u2013\u2013that our children and theirs may know what we can achieve together. All is fire.\u003cbr\u003e"
