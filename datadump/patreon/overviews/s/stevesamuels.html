I\u0027ll keep doing them regardless, but I\u0027d love to have some help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBasically, everything I do is designed to accomplish three things:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo promote God\u0027s work in Niagara\u003c/strong\u003e.

If non-Christians see us being, ultimately, united in Jesus-- despite differences-- they may be more open to Jesus.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://faithnewsniagara.com/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFaith News Niagara\u003c/a\u003e is the main vehicle I use for this. All the content on that site (stories, videos, \nblogs, etc.) is created with those three goals in mind.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThen there\u0027s \u003ca href=\"http://onechurchbeamsville.com/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOne Church Beamsville\u003c/a\u003e. While working for a local youth ministry, I connected with pastors and started a monthly ministerial meeting to pray and discuss how to serve God, each other, and our community. Even after I left that youth ministry, I kept serving those pastors, most recently by creating this online presence for the group.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere\u0027s also my \u003ca href=\"http://stevespassion.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epersonal website\u003c/a\u003e, which is also the online home of the Faith In Niagara podcast (which is based on the three aforementioned points).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(Down the road, I will add a fourth online ministry to this list, one focused on youth.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn short, I try to do things that \u003cem\u003eadd value\u003c/em\u003e to the Internet. If you\u0027re reading a Faith News story or a \u003ca href=\"http://faithnewsniagara.com/s-s/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSteve Shares\u003c/a\u003e blog post, or listening to a \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/faith-in-niagara\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFaith In Niagara\u003c/a\u003e podcast episode, or watching a \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4RFWLOlrR0H9Z-ekSPbopA/videos\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evideo\u003c/a\u003e I created... I want to impart something of value to \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e, the recipient of the online content I create.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon, the site you\u0027re reading this article on, acts like Kickstarter in that it helps people raise money-- but not one-time-goal-type money. They help people raise monthly-salary-type money. And like Kickstarter, the recipient of this support (in this case, me) is encouraged to give back to its donors by showing their appreciation in a tangible way.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon suggests setting up a series of tiers-- the more you give in support, higher your tier, and the more I give to you in appreciation. So here\u0027s the thing: I\u0027m going to set up only one tier \u003cem\u003eto start with\u003c/em\u003e, because 1) I really feel many of you will consider the\u00a0perk associated with that tier to be pretty valuable (more on that in a moment), 2) I don\u0027t have have solid ideas for second and third tier perks yet (feel free to pass any along!), and 3) I\u0027m afraid of spreading myself too thin by adding too many layers at this stage of the game.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd then there\u0027s this possible fourth reason: I\u0027m still kinda in \"experimental mode\" both with Patreon, and with the community of people I am appealing to. Because the one thing I am realizing, more than ever, is that I don\u0027t really know my audience the way I\u0027d like to just yet. But we can change that! Patreon also enables me to connect with you, my potential patron, if you want to, right here on this very page. I\u0027m really looking forward to taking advantage of that. And of course, there\u0027s the other tried and true methods as well. Whatever your preferred one happens to be, I hope it results in increased dialogue, and increased trust.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo this is where the rubber meets the road...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo as I get this thing up and running, I\u0027m going to ask the faithful and consistent consumers of content on the above mentioned sites, to consider supporting me, initially, at a minimum of $1 a month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAre you still reading this?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAssuming that didn\u0027t scare you off, let me explain the logic here. As I said, I\u0027m feeling out the commitment level of these communities. Combined, it\u0027s a pretty sizeable group! So much so, I think I can see 50 of you (actually, quite a bit more than that, but we\u0027ll start there) stepping up to the challenge. Doing so means I\u0027d have help paying for web hosting for three sites, and gas (the Region is pretty big, I live in its farthest corner, and I drive quite a bit to cover some stories). I also have other expenses, like coffee with pastors I interview, and rising podcast fees. I\u0027d like to upgrade my equipment over time as well. And further down the road... it would be great to earn a living wage doing what I love doing... something that I think is needed in Niagara...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut let\u0027s cover gas and coffee first.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBack in the day, the weekend paper-- with the comics, travel section, TV listings, and feature articles-- cost a buck, at least in my native Montreal. that\u0027s four dollars per month. I don\u0027t produce the same amount of content as that paper, but I\u0027m not asking for the financial equivalent either. I hope a loonie a month seems reasonable to many of you reading this.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA few other things: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eif you don\u0027t want to give, no worries. All that content will still be available, for free, online. And I\u0027ll still love you. I am, and forever will be, grateful for the interest you show in Faith News when you read and share stories.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m not (thankfully) on the verge of financial ruin. Let your giving be done without feeling that if this Patreon campaign falls short, Faith News goes offline. This is not the case. Faith News\u0027 future does not hang in the balance. I\u0027m simply looking to see if you will help defray the costs for my efforts. Hopefully you feel, as I do, that this worker is worthy of his hire. I am \u003cem\u003ecommitted\u003c/em\u003e to serving those of you who go to the Faith News, One Church or Steve\u0027s Passion sites. I\u0027ll keep on going; I just wanted to invite you guys to be a part of it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eif you think you\u0027d like to give more than $1, you can. Someone told me they thought $5 a month didn\u0027t sound outrageous, and another person said $10 a month seemed reasonable. I\u0027m grateful for people who feel this way. Patreon has suggested $1, $2, and $5 tiers-- and that\u0027s definitely in the cards-- but if you give just because you see value in the content, and not for anything you get in return, I\u0027d be grateful for that as well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eyou are free to start or stop, increase or decrease, your giving at any time. Customize the particulars according to what \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e want.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u0027s the perk? What do you get when you give?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll my donors will have access to exclusive content that will only be found on this Patreon account page. I\u0027ll upload videos there that will be seen first by contributors, and in some cases, will be seen only by contributors (it won\u0027t be available anywhere else). Some of those donors-only videos will have me sharing thoughts and ideas with you, throwing out questions, getting feedback, etc. Others will be videos explaining in detail how I create everything I create. I want to show you that it\u0027s actually easier than you think, to do what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy? Because if you get inspired, and then decided to do something inspiring yourself, THAT WILL BE AWESOME! Because one thing I want to do with these behind-the-scenes videos is give people hope. Maybe you\u0027ll think that crazy, way out there, utterly unattainable dream of yours is more attainable than you thought. Maybe you\u0027ll walk away from a video thinking, \"if Steve can do it, maybe I can too.\" I would love to help you change your thinking from \"it\u0027s too hard to try\", to, \"well, if Steve can figure out how to get his thing done, surely I can figure out how to get mine done...\". It\u0027s that \"adding value\" thing again, you know.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m like a lot of you out there, reading this: I\u0027m just a guy with a dream. If you\u0027ve found yourself stuck in a ditch on the road to your dream, maybe I can be your tow truck. A number of my past Faith News interviews became moments when I could encourage my subject to begin pursuing seemingly long-dead dreams; maybe that will happen to you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo if you\u0027re a faithful consumer of anything I produce online, if you find enjoyment or inspiration in what I create, or if you believe in any aspect of what I do online or offline, consider contributing to my Patreon account. And whether or not you choose to, would you also consider sharing this page with your friends? Maybe someone you know will want to help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks so much,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSteve\u003cbr\u003e"
