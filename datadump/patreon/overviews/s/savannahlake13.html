    "summary": "Heyo! Welcome to my Patreon, thanks for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a newbie cosplayer, I say my official beginning was Halloween of 2016, when I wore my Misa Amane cosplay as I handed out candy and watched Aliens. I would have called it a basic costume but I had spent so much time working on it, \u201ccostume\u201d didn\u2019t fit right. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAround the same time, I began to make a staff for Morrigan from Dragon Age, and my corset for my original steampunk Harley Quinn design. For some time, those three were all I had in my cosplay closet. I wanted to make so much more but despite my love of cosplay, it was a minor hobby. At my first convention, Denver Comic Con, in July of 2017, I got a lot of attention as Harley and Morrigan, and I realized I wanted to make this a more serious hobby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to make this Patreon because I hope to have help to create and have a platform to share what I create. I\u2019ve found amazing friends within the cosplay community - I\u2019d go so far as to call them family, even. I\u2019ve become so very fond of the people within cosplay, and I adore the medium. I get to combine working with my hands with a bit of my years of stage acting, and it is the most satisfying, enjoyable thing I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve found a deep love and passion for cosplay and want to continue improving my work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment I don\u2019t have much to offer by way of rewards compared to many creators on Patreon, but that is changing day by day as I grow and create more to make content with! As I gather up more that I can give as rewards, I have set up tiers and rewards, I just ask for a bit of patience while I get it all in order!\u00a0I\u0027d love to see you hang about a while!"
