    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHello, and thank you\u003c/strong\u003e for checking out my Patreon page! My name is Sal! Many of you know me as the furry artist \u201c\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/spelunkersal\"\u003eSpelunker Sal\u003c/a\u003e\u201d, mostly known for some sweet, sweet rule 34 action, which of course includes (but is not limited to!) the comic \u201c\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/roommates\"\u003eRoommates\u003c/a\u003e\u201d that I do with my husband, \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/dreamous\"\u003eDreamous\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s no secret that I love drawing. Art is my first and favorite passion. I\u2019ve always drawn my favorite characters as well as my own original characters ever since I was a kid. It\u2019s how I got interested in art and improved in the first place! I would love nothing more than to just draw and draw and draw for hours on end, every single day. In fact, I already do a fair bit of that in the form of \u003ca href=\"http://goo.gl/jqxdL\"\u003ecommissions\u003c/a\u003e (gotta pay the bills)! As much as I appreciate every one of my clients who personally commission me, I do yearn for the days that I can sit and draw my own ideas, be they original characters, fan art of my (and probably your) favorite characters, or just simply experiment with cartooning, anatomical work, or painting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u2019s where you come in.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon I can create more original content that I\u2019ve always wanted to do but never had the time because I\u2019m doing commission work all the time. If you\u2019re one of my followers on \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/SpelunkerSal\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, you\u2019ll have noticed that I sometimes post up a \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SpelunkerSal/status/628636728983588864\"\u003erandom sketch\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SpelunkerSal/status/594259413210300416\"\u003eWIP\u003c/a\u003e. With the additional support I get from Patreon, I can do that sort of thing way more often and be able to post content more consistently! This means more character designs, more fan art and rule 34, and pinups! Themed folios are also possible with enough support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you like Roommates? Well I like working on it!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the main focus of my Patreon is my personal art, this Patreon also includes the \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/roommates\"\u003eRoommates comic\u003c/a\u003e! If you\u2019re a supporter and/or fan of the Roommates comic, then please consider becoming a patron! Roommates has been a long on-going project since 2008 or so. It started out as something simple that Dreamous and I meant to begin and end as quickly as it came about. However, it snowballed into something much, much bigger and more ambitious, and with my amazing friends \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/treiii\"\u003eTreIII\u003c/a\u003e\u0027s and \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/captainnikko\"\u003eCaptainNikko\u003c/a\u003e\u2019s help we expanded HEAVILY on our little Roommates universe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019d like to continue to do so, and with your support I can keep on working on it on a consistent schedule, as I have been for the last few years. On the off chance that I get a TON of consistent support,\u00a0I can also start working on expanding the universe and developing the characters more. However, as it has been for the past couple of years, I\u0027m at least able to continue making the main arcs at a consistent rate and schedule. :) So thank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut, Sal\u2026 What about commissions, and posting?!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot to worry, my friend. This Patreon does not mean I will stop taking my \u003ca href=\"http://goo.gl/jqxdL\"\u003eslave stream commissions\u003c/a\u003e, nor does it mean I will stop posting art on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SpelunkerSal\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/spelunkersal/\"\u003eFA\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://spelunker-sal.sofurry.com/\"\u003eSF\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://inkbunny.net/spelunkersal\"\u003eIB\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://beta.furrynetwork.com/spelunkersal/\"\u003eFN\u003c/a\u003e, or \u003ca href=\"https://www.weasyl.com/~spelunkersal\"\u003eWsl\u003c/a\u003e. I will still happily accept new commissions from anyone who wants one, and I\u2019ll continue to do business with all of my current and future clients, like I always have, and still post artwork.\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e Posting on any of my public galleries will remain the same as it always has, since even before I made this Patreon\u003c/span\u003e. So while successful crowdfunding here might have me focusing a bit more on Roommates, pinups and personal art, and my patrons, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll stop commissions OR posting! \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eBeing a patron simply means you get to see art FAR earlier than non-patrons, as well as get to interact with me more directly in the making of my artwork.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour support can help me out with this stuff!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eErotic pinups of Roommates and Rule 34 characters voted on by you, the patrons!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEarly viewing to new art far earlier than I would post on my galleries!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFULL size pages of completed Roommates pages (4000 pixels tall)!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAn archive of every WIP on Roommates pages as they are made WITH early dialogue.

If there is more time after they\u0027re done, I\u0027ll work on personal stuff.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStreaming exclusively for the benefit of my lovely patrons. These will be called Patron Power Streams. They\u2019ll be set for a number of hours at scheduled times for Patrons only! This will be for pinup sketch requests!
