The majority of them are teenagers.\u003cbr\u003eThe statistics of\nHealth and mental health center in Lithuania show that young people choose\nsuicide as a last solution to end the bullying at their school grounds.

By taking a hanful of\nsleeping pills and suppressing drugs they leave the goodbye letters behind, in\nwhich they express their disappointment and the supressed will to live by the\ncommunity. These young, full of ideas, goals, dreams and ambitions people, who\nwould have given so much to this world, in the end choose to cut open their\nveins.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs it really that hard to at least try to\nunderstand other person, instead of judging?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy, why is it still kept in silence?\u00a0\u003cspan style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eWhy are all of the\ninstitution\u2018s doors shut in front of the young person who is looking for a ray\nof his last hope?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs it true that a young persons life is\nworth so little in our societies eyes?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u2018t want to be silent anymore. I clearly\nsee the results of being silent. Young person, who lives between our insanity,\nalienation, just doesn\u2018t see the reason to stay. Opressed in school\nhallways, and after experiencing physical and psychological violence, they try\nto search for answers, a solution, a way to change and to become\n\"normal\", and in all of this they feel like they aren\u0027t worthy to\nstay in our group.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to talk, because I am healthy, who can\nlove, smile, be happy of lifes every moment, eat like everyone else does and\neven sleep on time, I have to be thrown at with rocks. I was forced to feel not\nnormal. I was forced to be afraid of my every own move. I was made to feel like\na pervert.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe discussions in social\nmedia which were there for the last few weeks pushed me to sit down in front of\nmy desk and to talk about how I imagine love. That the love for me isn\u2018t just a\nphysical contact with other human being. That the love is necessary\nfor us like air, water, propulsion material. That you can\u2018t choose who to love,\nbecause love doesn\u2018t have gender. That you can love yourself, life and everyone\naround you, even if they don\u2018t always love you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis video recording is representative video\nabout what was happening in Rum\u0161i\u0161k\u0117s - in Lithuanian folk and household\nmuseum.

About parents who disown their daughter only because of her\ndifferences. About societies view of different oriented people. About an\nillness, which on how to cure electricity is still used. About that it was a\nreason to be killed. Society talks, about that this is only a problem to the\ntwenty first century, although I would like to apologize, that in nature\nhomosexuality was always there, though people remained silent on this topic.\nThey were scared of the reaction of others, scared of that will be dealt with.\nPitiful that it is still a not talked about topic even in our times. That it is\nstill comparable to a disease.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI dare to name that this\nis an illustrated novel about a full of purpose life which chose the path of\nfree and different love, leaving behind old stereotypes which we get from the\nbirth. One person has told me, that this piece is the love litany. That it can\nbe all kinds of love. That when you love someone, sometimes you\u2018ll pray to God\nand sometimes you\u2018ll curse the God. That when you love someone you can do\nanything, even resist for yourself. To do more than you have ever thought you\ncan do. To feel more than you thought you can feel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to all the girls\nwho walked together with me in this mission to wake up the hearts. To force\nsomeone to hear and to ask themselves... Do we really need to punish others\nbecause they love differently?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoreover, we are searching\nfor everyone who wants to support us with monetary amount or any other way and\nhelp us to publish \u201cTo love is (not) forbidden\u201c.

I don\u2018t want to hear any bad\nwords and disgust about my own country when I\u2018m abroad. I don\u2018t want Lithuania\nto be labeled as the Third World country.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEncourage everyone to\nlight up with life.\u003cbr\u003e"
