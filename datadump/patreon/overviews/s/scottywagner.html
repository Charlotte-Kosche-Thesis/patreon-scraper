    "summary": "Hi!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a writer and performer creating surrealist, sci-fi comedy stories about how technology shapes our existence in the 21st century. Here is the \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/231447974\"\u003eTRAILER\u003c/a\u003e to my latest epic, \"Trial Child: Nurture a Better Nature,\" about a couple who attempt to teach self-control to a robotic replica of their own would-be child. Beginning in January of 2018, I will be an Artist in Residence along with my collaborator \u003ca href=\"http://www.baileyhikawa.com/\"\u003eBailey Hikawa\u003c/a\u003e at \u003ca href=\"https://www.moca-tucson.org/artists-in-residence/\"\u003eMOCA Tucson\u003c/a\u003e. The subject of this work-in-process is the Vlogosphere, the Youtube trend where someone self-publishes their \"everyday life.\" While relatively unknown to the general population, vlogging has become wildly popular among young kids and teenagers around the world. As part of this project, I have created my own vlog, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5N7WTjxeuDooMzAQW6SyZw\"\u003eScotty\u0027s Life\u003c/a\u003e, which I will use to document the creation of this new work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI aspire to fully support myself from my creative work. At present, my creative work is one aspect of my income. Jobs in other fields and assistance from public institutions are as well. Because I feel strongly about making videos and performances that are accessible to the general public, Patreon, a platform that aggregates small contributions, is well suited to that purpose. Your support would significantly free me up to spend more time working on what I do best, which is making art about life in the Technosphere. If you are more interested in making a one-time donation to my current project about vlogging than a monthly commitment, you can do so on my website \u003ca href=\"http://www.scottywagner.info/Info\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would be eternally grateful for your support in that process and the ongoing work thereafter! And you can check out more of my projects \u003ca href=\"http://www.scottywagner.info/\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.trialchild.com/\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e! Feel free to reach out using the email below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003eScotty Slade Wagner\u003cbr\u003escottyslade[at]gmail.com"
