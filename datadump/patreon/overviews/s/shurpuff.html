    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello there!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePay no attention to the distractions to your right, or to the left. Come on in and have a seat, right there. Don\u0027t even mind this little can here--let me just put that away for now. We\u0027ll come to that later. Here; I\u0027ll pour you a mug. Whatever suits your fancy. Imagine us settling in at this table; I take my place here, as your host, and opposite me is you, oh weary traveler.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere. Now that\u0027s settled. Sit back, close your eyes and let this humble craftsman regale your tired, hungry mind with morsels from a thousand different lands.\u003cem\u003e Of oaken ships careening through a starlit emptiness. Of warriors dueling at the very edge of eternity. Of simple people like you and me, swept up in nefarious plots thousands of years in the making.\u003c/em\u003e There are countless such worlds, and equally limitless stories to be gathered. I, in my humble capacity as storyteller, now offer it to you, free of charge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany others have done the same thing, some quite successfully. What I can only offer is my own, simple \"brand\". \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Shurpuff Brand\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. My own typical, peculiar brand of writing, which has brought entertainment to many. As time went on I have enjoyed being the entertainer, of bringing joy and substance to the people who read my works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a patron here, by putting even one small coin inside this can, will only serve to place me in your debt, to make me sing to the high heavens of your most gracious generosity. It will add fuel to the kindling in my heart, it will churn the engine in my mind. I will continue to write, and write, and write; if coins end up gathering in my can, then that will only induce me to write, and write, and write some more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, patrons will be able to personally witness the methods by which I craft my worlds, and bring them to life. From the writing process, to my personal views on how best to tackle an idea in one\u0027s head: it will be of interest to any who wish to create their own worlds. I shall certainly be able to dispense what advice I can provide, should it be needed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo come and join me in this journey into the depths of creativity. Have a glance at the right, and then the left. Or not, don\u0027t worry about it. I am content to let my works speak for themselves. I am already fulfilled, like the earnest cook, when one samples my craft and finds it delicious. Having someone become a patron is a bonus, the icing on the cake.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for listening, and have a nice day. May we reach the greatest vistas of imagination, together.\u003c/strong\u003e"
