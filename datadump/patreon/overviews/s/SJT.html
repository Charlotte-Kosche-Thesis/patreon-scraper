    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eHi There!\u003c/h2\u003e\nHey, we\u2019re a group of experienced game developers, and we\u2019re working on our first collaborative project, written by eroge/visual novelist Dan \u2018SKoW\u2019 Henson, and we\u2019re calling it \u201cServer Jacked: Transformation\u201d. It\u2019s an erotic text-based RPG, inspired by people like Fenoxo and Savin.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn this Shadowrun-esque world, technology has advanced, corporations are king, and most people prefer to escape their reality, and live out their lives as avatars on the net.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat starts as a mystery abduction becomes an exploration of all manner of world-servers, themed from High Fantasy, to Hard Sci-Fi and more in-between. You can have customisable companions, and there are all manner of places to see, monsters to fight, and people to vigorously copulate with.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can check out a sneak peek of the game following\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fede.softguild.com.ar/pinkProject/testStory.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis link\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFeatures\u003c/h2\u003e\nOn top of the typical RPG combat, advancing stats, and gaining skills, there will be an overarching storyline (that can endlessly expand). A companion system will be implemented, transformation items will be coming out of your ears, and just about everyone and everything can be fucked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNPCs will get portraits, locations can be explored, maybe some puzzles can be solved. Even we have no idea how much we can cram in, but the first step is getting the UI, stats, equipment, and the first explorable zone up and running; the First Fantasy Server.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMajor Release\u003c/h2\u003e\nA major release consists of new content \u0026amp; some new features. Occasionally, these releases will be focus on just pushing out new gameplay that will later be expanded as development moves forward.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can expect a new major release every month or two. We will give you a heads up about what is coming so you know what to look out for.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019ve decided to choose the Major Release contribution model so patrons are only contributing their pledges when there\u2019s tangible progress on the development of the game. This gives you a fair deal and us the ability to manipulate the development schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePledging\u003c/h2\u003e\nWe want to make this project work, so even the smallest amount will help us out a great deal. If the SJT project becomes self-sufficient, the writer will be able to make it a full-time job, and the programmers will be able to more frequently bug-fix and improve the system. Right now even paying rent is a challenge!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd there\u2019s more; if you meet the tier requirement, we can write your avatar into the game, and the longer you stay pledged, the more fleshed out their scenes will be. We\u2019ll fix up any writing and hopefully bring your Persona a little more to life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSubmissions\u003c/h2\u003e\nYou don\u2019t have to be a pledger to submit anything, but we reserve the right to be a lot choosier! That being said, once the first stage has been initiated, and we have a place to put people, you can submit characters, or scenes for characters that are already in the game. You can submit transformation items, or special equipment you would like to see.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe No-Go Zone\u003c/h2\u003e\nThere\u2019s going to be some content we don\u2019t agree with. So far this list involves underage sex, hard rape, and scat. But this list may be expanded if we get some particularly unsavoury submissions we hadn\u2019t thought about. Otherwise it\u2019s fair game, go bloody crazy.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Team\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nDan \u2018SKoW\u2019 Henson\u003c/strong\u003e - Hey, I\u2019m the writer for this project, and I\u2019m a member of Lupiesoft, I\u2019m helping with the SFW series that is The Reject Demon: Toko, and the NSFW series that is The Menagerie!
