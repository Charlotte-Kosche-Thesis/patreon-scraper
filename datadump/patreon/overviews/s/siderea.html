She is bent intently over the sketchbook in which she\u0027s working, such that you can\u0027t see her eyes. Surreptitiously, you glance at the page beneath her hand. A few quickly sketched studies, a grocery list, a technical diagram, a few lines of musical score, a post-it note. She straightens and stretches, and as she sips from her cappuccino, you sneak another look.

And, to a first approximation,  when I do, all the people who pledged are collected from.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo this raises the obvious question, \"Siderea, how many things are you going to write per month?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have no idea.  Fortunately for you, Patreon has a solution for this: patrons can set a dollar limit per month.  You can decide to pledge $X per post, with a maximum of $XY per month.  If I write more posts than Y, you aren\u0027t charged for the posts in excess of Y.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027d like to write a lot -- and I\u0027m pretty hungry -- but I have no real sense of what\u0027s realistic.  Trying it and finding out is the only way.  \n\u003cstrong\u003eI very, very, very strongly encourage all my patrons to set a bearable monthly contribution limit, lest I and my muse accidentally break your bank account.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNote that \n\u003cem\u003ewhat\u003c/em\u003e I write will be affected by the total per-post level of patronage I get.  If I am funded at a high enough rate, I\u0027ll be able to take more time on each post, and write longer, more deeply researched pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n* * *\n\u003c/div\u003e"
