The Gamma Gals graphic novel is almost complete! As you have no doubt noticed, I have been uploading pages of Issues #5 and #6 to the Patreon! I am currently in the process of finishing up colors for Issue #6, and then the graphic novel will be finished!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what does this mean for Patreon subscribers?! A few things, including changes to the content in the Patreon going forward. First things first, however. For Patreons subscribed to the $20 or more tier, they will receive a physical and digital version of the graphic novel when it becomes available on August 30th.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, I will continue to upload artwork for any upcoming projects I am working on after a short break upon completion of The Gamma Gals Volume 1 trade paperback. I have a few projects in the pipeline, including the announced title, \"Lynch,\" which follows the exploits of freed slave, Cassius \"Lynch,\" as he travels the old west on a journey of revenge with his companion; a mute 4 year old girl who has mysterious ties to his missing wife. Unlike The Gamma Gals, Lynch is not an all ages book, and will contain a \"Mature Readers\" logo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s about all for this update, and I am very excited for the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e01/09/2017 UPDATE:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello everyone!\u003cbr\u003eI have an important update for you guys.

Not much. \u003c/strong\u003eI will still be uploading each and every page of The Gamma Gals to Patreon for subscribers. I will also be uploading PDF copies of Issues #1-#4, and the bonus issues #5 and #6 for supporters as well. For higher tier subscribers ($20 or more), I will still be supplying a physical trade paperback for those tiers, and digital version of the trade paperback for $10 tiers). It will be in PDF form as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon supporters will also still receive all of the other odds and ends I produce for The Gamma Gals (and other secret projects, tee hee) that they\u0027re used to receiving.

It has been an absolutely joy and challenge to work on this Mini-Series, and I am so proud of it! But don\u0027t fret! This isn\u0027t the end of The Gamma Gals! I am still working on two specials that will round out the Graphic Novel. Issue #5 is a Halloween story, and Issue #6 is a Christmas story. These two tales are not tied to the Zero G story arc that is Volume 1 of the Gamma Gals, but are just fun additional stories that flesh out the world, but also set the stage for \u003cstrong\u003eVolume 2\u003c/strong\u003e of The Gamma Gals: \u003cstrong\u003eThe Syndicate of Ruin\u003c/strong\u003e! But that\u0027s not all! I am also working on some smaller projects, as well as one larger project that I will have more information on in the future. Needless to say, I will be a busy beaver, and this patreon is not done yet! As always, supporters will be the first to know about all the new stuff I\u0027m cooking up! Thanks so much for stopping by and showing your support of my work! Stay tuned!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOriginal Mission Statement:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey, everybody! My name is \u003cstrong\u003eStefano Terry\u003c/strong\u003e, and\u00a0I\u0027m an artist/writer residing in Los Angeles California! I\u0027ve been drawing for over 30 years. My passion lies in comic books, storyboards, video games, reading, and writing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I\u0027m working on my first \u003cstrong\u003efull color\u003c/strong\u003e graphic novel, \u003cstrong\u003eThe Gamma Gals\u003c/strong\u003e. It follows the exploits of three teenage girls who gain superpowers after a gamma irradiated electrical storm hits their home town of Brightstone. The girls then take it upon themselves to protect Brightstone from a growing menace of super powered beings, sea titans, and even aliens! The first volume is 4 issues long, and runs about 92 pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Gamma Gals is a bit of a passion project for me, as it\u0027s been a desire of mine to see more strong, fun, \u003cstrong\u003ekickass girls/women\u003c/strong\u003e in various mediums like film, television, literature, and comic books, of course, without the egregious \u003cstrong\u003eover-\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003esexualization\u003c/strong\u003e of the women. The Gamma Gals aren\u0027t supermodels, or walking \u003cstrong\u003ePlayboy Centerfolds\u003c/strong\u003e. My hope is that I\u0027ve managed to create some relateable, likable, and funny heroines that girls (and boys too, of course), can look at and say, \"Holy crap, Sue is so like me!\" or, \"Harriet is disabled, but she still kicks ass and takes names, and isn\u0027t defined by her disability!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, \u003cstrong\u003eThe Gamma Gals\u003c/strong\u003e is a comic that I\u0027d love to read, and that I\u0027d like my sisters, nieces, daughters, friends, etc, to read. It\u0027s not exclusive to girls, but it\u0027s a comic for girls. A comic for girls that like to see a bit of themselves in the characters they read about. A comic for girls that like video games, comic books, \u003cstrong\u003eStar Wars\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/strong\u003e. Which pretty much describes the vast majority of women and girls I\u0027ve ever encountered in my life. The Gamma Gals is for \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd boys too\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to use this patreon as a means of producing not only \u003cstrong\u003eThe Gamma Gals volume 1\u003c/strong\u003e, but to ideally continue \u003cstrong\u003ebeyond the initial graphic novel\u003c/strong\u003e and into a \u003cstrong\u003efull blown series\u003c/strong\u003e. In addition to The Gamma Gals, I will be sharing other art, including various \u003cstrong\u003eFan Art \u003c/strong\u003efrom some of my favorite \u003cstrong\u003egames, movies, and cartoons! \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ll also be producing other comics and short projects over the course of this patreon, and in between volumes of The Gamma Gals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always aiming to grow and improve, and I\u0027d love to share that growth as an artist with every one of you! Thank you, and I hope you find this journey of mine as worthwhile as I do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what will you be getting from this Patreon on a regular basis, you ask?\u003c/strong\u003e Answer: Art! Lots and lots of art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs I work on the Gamma Gals volume 1, I will be uploading work from various stages of the development of the comic: layouts, pages, character concepts, covers, etc, etc. For being an awesome supporter, you will have access to these pieces of work, as well as access to the completed Gamma Gals pages as they are finished. From time to time, I will upload work completely that is completely free, and available to all, supporter or no.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t express to you all how excited I am to move forward with the Gamma Gals on Patreon!
