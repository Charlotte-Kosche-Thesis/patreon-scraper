    "summary": "I like old videogames. I like new ones, too, but something about the way old games were designed and constrained by the technology of the time really draws me to them. One of the most fascinating things about old games is that often, a game would come out on multiple platforms and turn out totally differently. This could be either due to a different developer or just differences in hardware. This is so interesting to me that I decided to take my film school dropout education (I switched from film to theatre) and make an entire show dedicated to it. You can see the latest episode right here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BOmqvzos-NA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like that, and want to see more like it, consider throwing me a couple bucks a month. If enough people support, I\u0027ll be able to do episodes of this and the other two shows I do, Obscure Old Games and Five Reasons, more regularly. I should also mention, all of these shows are 100% FUNDED BY PATREON SUBSCRIBERS. That\u0027s right! No ads! All viewer support! Thanks for your support!"
