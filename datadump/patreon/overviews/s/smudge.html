I\u0027m Christina \"Smudge\" Hanson, comic artist, 3D animator, writer, and all around geek girl!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve started something new again, dang it! But when the muse hits, she hits hard~\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eLumeria\u0027s fate was sealed at the age of ten when her and her brothers \nwere kidnapped by a hive of monsters. Now, long after their rescue, they\n are all discovering that those monsters did more than just take them \nfrom their homes. Visions of past and future collide as Lumeria \ndesperately tries to change her fate into the destiny of an Empire.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently in the design phase as well as busily shaping up the first\n draft of this prose story. Whether the final remains in prose is \nanother matter yet to be seen. But this is the fastest way, and easiest \non my hand, to get the plot out of my head and onto paper. I\u0027m also \nsketching out different character designs so I know what folks look and \nact like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be releasing the prose in scene chunks, serially, only to \u003ca href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.patreon.com/smudge\"\u003ePateron\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.smudgemarks-engelwerks.com/\"\u003eSmudgeMarks \u0026amp; EngelWerks\u003c/a\u003e\n for Patrons/Subscribers. It\u0027s a first draft, it needs to stay locked \nuntil it\u0027s in shape to find a publisher.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd constructive comments and critiques are always welcomed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy other \u0027BIG\u0027 project is a 3D animated short, tentatively called \u0027Online Questing\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Online Questing\u0027 is a small tribute to one of my favorite form of computer gaming, MMORPGs. Arhun (the prototypical type/class toon I tend to play) and E\u0027Lara (James, my longtime gaming buddy\u0027s avatar) are off on yet another adventure! This is a lot of work and a lot of re-finding old skills that are in sore need of shaking the rust off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou also get to see all the other work I\u0027m doing in-between working on my current \u0027big\u0027 projects, like commission works in progress, stories (both comic and prose), and occasional sewing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo wanna come along and follow what I\u0027m working on as I write/draw it?
