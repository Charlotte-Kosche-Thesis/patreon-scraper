My work often focuses on the feminine experience in the western world, and is connected to my activism.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI love Patreon because it allows artists, like me, and creators alike, to really focus on building strong supportive communities around shared interests.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1 style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eHow Does Patreon Work?\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1305.photobucket.com/albums/s560/shelaghcully/pet_commission_by_shelaghcully-dap5k2a_zpsmtdekeo7.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my patron, each month you would contribute to helping me grow my art and in return you get access to lots of behind the scenes artwork, videos and blog posts.

I recommend starting at $5 to get an idea of what I\u0027m all about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI aim to post new artwork daily, usually in the form of works in progress (wips) in varying mediums. I also post finished work available as high res downloads for certain patrons, and much more. I also try to post new videos every Saturday evening EST. Some videos and artwork are accompanied by blog posts, which are for Patrons only. I of course have a lot of free content available as well, and I promise I will always offer free content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so glad you\u0027re interested in becoming a patron of mine and I can\u0027t wait to get to know you! :x\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"

I remember wanting to be an artist at 5 years old after seeing Night Hawks by Edward Hopper (look it up I know you\u0027ve seen it before). I came to Patreon because one day I see myself being a full time artist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so happy to have you here and that you\u0027re interested in becoming a patron of mine! As my patron you\u0027ll get access to artwork and videos before they go live as well as some exclusive patron only work. You\u0027ll see examples of my process as its happening, and we\u0027ll hopefully get to spend some time together in a future live stream! I can\u0027t wait to get to know you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxo",
