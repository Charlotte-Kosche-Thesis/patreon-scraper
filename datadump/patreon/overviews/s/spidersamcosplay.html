    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eNEXT CON: TBA\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy cosplay journey started out fairly recently, I\u0027d maybe say around the fall of 2015. It was my first Comic Con, and it was New York Comic Con to be exact. I could hardly contain my excitement, as I couldn\u0027t wait to be surrounded by like minded people like myself who enjoy art, video games, comics, and collectibles. I stood in the painful queue for over an hour for my tickets, but I eventually got my Sunday pass. I was relieved, but I needed to prepare. I thought to myself, \"This is my chance. This is where I can start planning out my cosplay.\" My\u003cstrong\u003e first cosplay\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0ever was \u003cstrong\u003eMary Jane Watson.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I even brought it upon myself to dye my hair red, and it has stuck ever since. I think of it as a reminder as to how far I\u0027ve come, because I never thought in a million years that I would be making my \u003cstrong\u003eOWN ARMOR\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ePROPS.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0The feeling of embodying the characters you absolutely adore is a feeling I can\u0027t describe. It makes cosplay all worth while, and I love what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwo years later, \u003c/strong\u003eon top of being a full time student and working, I still try to ensure that the cosplay I put out to my followers and to the community is well above standards. I have spent endless amounts of hours on minor details because I value the work I put into my cosplays. Bringing a character to life is not only an extensive creative process, but it is also a \u003cstrong\u003ecostly\u003c/strong\u003e one. Supplies aren\u0027t cheap, and I want to be able to provide content to you guys with quality materials.\u003cstrong\u003e To be absolutely clear, nobody is obligated to donate.\u003c/strong\u003e I will still be posting occasionally to Instagram/social media.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut,\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0the difference between Patreon and Instagram is that patrons get \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive access\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003esneak peaks\u003c/strong\u003e to whatever I may be working on, it could be a cosplay or two, or who knows, maybe a boudoir shoot. All patrons will get to know what I\u0027m working on that month before social media does,\u003cstrong\u003e and that\u0027s not all. \u003c/strong\u003eI intend to use Patreon to the fullest extent, and I want us all to be able to connect and talk about gaming, cosplay, comics, anime and much much more. I want your input and feedback, which is why my patrons will get access to \u003cstrong\u003epolls \u003c/strong\u003eso I can get an idea as to what you guys would like to see more of!!! I\u0027m always open to your cosplay suggestions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBUT WAIT, there\u0027s MORE. -Billy Mays voice-\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, here is where it gets even better. Like, for real. If you, my friend, become a patron, (and depending on the tier) you will get exclusive photosets (10-20 photos) every month, polaroids, selfies, and even my GAMERTAG so we can game together!! Aw yeeeeee.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you read all of this, thank you. If you support my work, THANK YOU. It means the world to me when I see people\u0027s smiles as they recognize my cosplays at conventions, and maybe one day I can travel across different states and go to different cons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
