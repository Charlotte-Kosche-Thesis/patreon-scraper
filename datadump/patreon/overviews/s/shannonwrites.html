    "summary": "UPDATE 5/2/17\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello Patrons and other interested human life forms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreetings from my little corner of the internet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to post an updated and less TL:DR version of why I\u0027m here and what I\u0027m doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReady?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho I am:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Shannon. I\u0027m a genderqueer, weirdo writer from Seattle. I turned 40 this year. I have a dayjob and a partner. My family is tiny (it is just the two of us) and I am the breadwinner because my partner is disabled and disability money is not the business.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I am doing here:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, y\u0027all should know that I am terrible at being a freelance writer and that is a large part of why I started a Patreon page. The funds I raise on Patreon, are close to (in the 50-150$ range)what I could make doing 1 or so pieces of freelance work a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoing freelancing in a way that would be profitable for me, is just not in my wheelhouse because I write slow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here we are.\u00a0I am here on Patreon giving you the reader an up close and intimate look at my first urban fantasy novel(la) in progress. This is a naked, unedited you are sitting on my shoulder while I work look at me trying something that has been on my creative bucket list for years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I showing people first draft work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am doing things this way because when I was a baby potato writer, I needed to see this. Not only did I need Magical Black and Brown people to read about, I needed to see the process of creating their world. Representation is something that is deeply important to me as both a creator and a lover of art and literature. I am about that life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I don\u0027t believe that writers have to hide away the stuff that sucks. I\u0027m not ashamed of my process or of my growth. I don\u0027t want to emerge fully edited and shiny and perfect because that is not who I am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I am giving Patrons:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month between the 5th and the 8th I deliver to my patrons a full PDF of the Daiyuverse as we call it round these here parts. The update includes a loveletter of some sort. Most often the letter has to do with the process, sometimes I talk about things I find problematic in my own work and how I deal with it. When I say you get a real raw look at the whole thing, you really are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes I post stories that take place in the Daiyuverse but aren\u0027t in this iteration or timeline. \u003cbr\u003eI also offer other goodies on occasion. A peek at the spreadsheet where I\u0027m keeping track of my characters, their magic and relationships.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also working up to do some author chats.\u003cbr\u003eYou will get for a dollar or more, at least 3 thousand new words in the Daiyuverse, a letter from me to you about the verse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does the future look?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eY\u0027ALL...I don\u0027t know. Maybe when the current arc of the verse is getting close to an end point, I\u0027ll wrap it up and start a new one. I have this wackadoodle idea to release it as an ongoing novella series. Maybe even, a whole Daiyuverse of stories, writing prompts or classes who knows!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe financial breakdown I will post probably next month while I rebudget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo there you go.\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support. I will say that those who are patrons, whether it is 1 dollar or five, you are making a real actual difference in the quality of my lived life. If you ever wonder about how to use your resources to make a real difference, this is it right here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, I appreciate your time and thanks for visiting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
