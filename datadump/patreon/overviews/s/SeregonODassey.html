     "about": "I am the writer/director of Absynthia. \nI\u0027ve been an actor for most of my life and in the process of working in \nthe Film/TV industry I have fallen in love with the process of creation \nthat happens behind the scenes. I\u0027ve always been a writer, but have made\n the decision to make the next step in creating my own work. Although \nthis is a massive undertaking I am confident this will be a fantastic \nproject, since the screenplay for Absynthia has won several awards, \nincluding:\n- Northeast Film Festival \u2013 Best Unproduced short screenplay 2015\u003cbr\u003e\n- Hollywood Hills Screenplay Competition \u2013 Best 1\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;st\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt; Scene 2015\u003cbr\u003e\n- Brightside Tavern Film Festival \u2013 Best Script -March 2016\u003cbr\u003e\n- StarGate Intergalactic Scifi/Fantasy Film Festival - 2016\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition, the screenplay has been accepted into and nominated by the following festivals:\u003cbr\u003e\n- Back in the Box Screenplay category \u2013 2015\u003cbr\u003e\n- Eyecatcher Film Festival - 2015\u003cbr\u003e\n- Newlife Film Fest \u0026amp; Screenplay Competition 2016\u003cbr\u003e\n- Hang Onto Your Shorts Film Festival - 2016\u003cbr\u003e\n- Selenite Film Festival (Finalist) - 2016\u003cbr\u003e\n- Southern California Film Festival (SoCal) \u2013 Semi-Finalist \u2013 2016\u003cbr\u003e\n - Cannes Latitude Film Festival (Finalist) - 2016\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have met amazingly talented and \nwonderful artists over the years. I\u2019m lucky to have some of them as cast\n and crew of Absynthia. \u003cbr\u003e\nWe aim to make an eye catching science fiction television show with \nSteampunk elements, intriguing story lines, tragic events, flawed and \ndynamic characters, and strong female characters that make the audience \nquestion the idea of good, evil, and perspective.\u003cbr\u003e\nAbsynthia is the marriage of science fiction\u0027s exploration of various points of view, within a drama story.\u003cbr\u003e\nFunding Absynthia will give you an opportunity to see science fiction\n that has unique story-telling, flawed yet interesting characters, and \nan action packed yet thought provoking drama that will keep you guessing\n from beginning to end: the kind of science fiction you WANT to see! \nAbsynthia also brings the steampunk genre to the screen. Steampunk has a\n large following with little screen time or attention. YOU can help \nchange that, and bring steampunk elements into a dynamic and compelling \ndrama! You will also be giving us the freedom of independence, and \nability to think outside the box from the creation process to the last \ndetail of editing.\u003cbr\u003e\nHelp us make Absynthia a reality: a TV show you would want to watch! We can\u2019t do it without your support, please join us.",
