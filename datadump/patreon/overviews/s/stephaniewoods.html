I\u0027m \u003ca href=\"http://www.stephaniewoodsbooks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStephanie Woods\u003c/a\u003e, author of two full-length novels, \"Earth Angel,\" and \"Angel on My Shoulder.\" These are the first two of a planned five books in my Angels and Seers series. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m planning an urban fantasy fiction series after this one, and am currently doing research for a historical novel (with a time travel element) set in 1680\u0027s New England. I\u0027ve got a lot going on, fiction-wise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHere are my first two novels.

I\u0027ve always been a writer. It\u0027s who I am. From the time I was in elementary school, I was writing short stories, usually ones that involved talking animals. In middle school, I began entering and winning short story contests. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA compilation of my stories was published and added to my school\u0027s library, I won numerous gift cards to local businesses in high school and town-based writing contests, and even won a Creative Writing scholarship to college in a statewide contest my senior year of high school. If you asked me in high school what I wanted to be, I always said, \"Novelist.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLife, of course, often gets in the way of plans, and it certainly did with me. Not only did I have to support myself after graduate school, I also unexpectedly had to support my husband, who was injured on the job and could no longer work, as well as my step-son, who lived with us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I became a teacher. I taught school for many years, both high school and college. I even taught elementary school for a year. I tried writing novels during this time, but there was just never any time to finish them, and I ended up with a hard drive full of half-finished books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWas I happy? Not exactly. I wasn\u0027t miserable, but I wasn\u0027t following my dream. We\u0027ve all got to follow our dreams to be true to ourselves. So, I eventually transitioned into freelance writing from home, writing advertising copy and blog posts for businesses. I\u0027ve been doing this for the past eight or so years, and while it IS writing, it isn\u0027t very fulfilling writing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, in spite of long days of pounding out repetitive copy, I managed to find time to also write and publish my first full-length novel, \"Earth Angel,\" in October of 2015. In October of 2016, I published its sequel, \"Angel on My Shoulder.\" In between writing those two books, I won another short story contest, this one a historical story contest sponsored by my local archives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I\u0027ve written and published two full-length novels, I know in my heart that I\u0027m doing what I\u0027m meant to be doing. I want, and NEED, to be writing in a creative way all the time. It is so hard for me to go back to writing for businesses. I still need to do it to pay the bills, though, but it leaves me with less time to write novels and short stories than I would like. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve made money selling my first two novels, and it is now time to turn my high school dream of being a working novelist a reality. I\u0027ve tasted the joy, and I can\u0027t go back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI couldn\u0027t go back even if I wanted to. With both a juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and an anxiety diagnosis, and two surgeries to replace my knees, working outside the home again is no longer an option. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting for businesses is soul-crushing, though I don\u0027t have to leave the house to do it. And, my husband still needs me to support us both. Soon, it will be the three of us, all depending on me, as we have a child coming. Yes, I\u0027m going to be a mom, at long last! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe step-son who lived with us when I first got married is grown with kids of his own now, by the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, Why Do I Need a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will help me pay my monthly bills, so I can concentrate on writing more novels and short stories, without having to work another job to make ends meet.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey will also ideally allow me to be able to invest in professional development as a writer, get better writing software, hire top quality editors and book cover designers, and eventually go to fan events to sign books and meet my readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBetter fiction is produced when one can concentrate fully on one\u0027s writing, knowing the bills are paid. One can also write more fiction this way. It\u0027s time I devote myself wholly to what was always meant to be my career....being a novelist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat Do I Want Out of This, Exactly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTime to write. I\u0027ve got many writing goals and not enough time to complete them all if I\u0027m working any other job but writing. Some things I want to accomplish just this year alone include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFinish Book Three of the Angels and Seers series\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWrite a historical novel that involves time travel, which I\u0027ve already outlined\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWrite more short stories \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEnter more writing contests\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRevamp my author website\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHire a professional editor and book marketer\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePitch literary agents and traditional publishing houses\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGo to at least one writing conference\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake enough money writing fiction to pay my bills and give my new child the wonderful life she deserves\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of these things will help me be a better writer.
