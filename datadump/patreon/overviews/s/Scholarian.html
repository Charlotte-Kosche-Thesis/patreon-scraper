As many of you know I don\u0027t currently have any income so anything you pledge here will be helping out with my needs, as well as allowing me to do things I would otherwise not be able to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month I will update charts showing exactly where your money (total not individual) is going. These will be divided between needs, which will be as specific as a feel comfortable sharing, extra, which will be things that are needed to expand my projects and help me create more content and, hopefully, better content. The final chart (for now) will be a wants chart, where, if both other charts are met within reason, a small portion of the funds will go to personal endeavours. However, if any pledgers are uncomfortable with this then they may request their value of funds are never used for it (and that goes any way, you many choose within reason where your money goes, assuming my needs are met first so I don\u0027t resort to eating software and Flames of War tanks).\u00a0"
