    "summary": "Back in 2014 I launched\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://waldenlabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWalden Labs\u003c/a\u003e, an initiative where we together explore self-reliance, permaculture, and the beauty in small scale living. Resilience through decentralization and the fragility of our high tech civilization has been another big focus of mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWalden Labs is about spreading the knowledge and tools that help you produce, or in other ways secure, your food, water, shelter, energy, security and income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWalden Labs is also the home of\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThe Self-Reliance Catalog\u003c/strong\u003e, a carefully curated collection of the best in self-reliance and resilience. It\u2019s 100% free, and to date thousands of self-reliant individuals and families from all around the globe have accessed it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of \u003cem\u003eThe Self-Reliance Catalog\u003c/em\u003e is to help you know better \u003cem\u003ewhat\u003c/em\u003e is worth getting and \u003cem\u003ewhere\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e to do the getting, whether that \u201cthing\u201d is a plant, a tool, a book, or even a design for a shelter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is what makes Walden Labs and The Self-Reliance Catalog possible and what allows me to keep it 100% free and open to all mankind. By becoming a supporter of my work you become an integral part of our worldwide community and get access to the Patreon-exclusive feed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy Pursue Self-Reliance?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eThe necessaries of life for man\u2026may, accurately enough, be distributed under the several heads of Food, Shelter, Clothing, and Fuel; for not till we have secured these are we prepared to entertain the true problems of life with freedom and a prospect of success.\u003cbr\u003e- Henry David Thoreau, Walden\u003c/blockquote\u003eIn the end, if Henry David Thoreau taught us anything, it is that life is too valuable to spend most of it working to buy material stuff \u201cwhich moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through and steal.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe New Era of Self-Reliance Is All About Systems\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThe average 18th century woman spent a lot of her time washing clothes in the river. Hours upon hours of backbreaking work, sometimes in freezing temperatures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know what we do today? We put them in a machine, press a button, and we\u2019re done. I\u2019m not going to chop up a hole in the icy river this winter to wash my clothes, nor any other winter for that matter. And neither should you. That\u2019s not what living \u201coff-the-grid\u201d is about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust as the washing machine has freed up immense amounts of time for women around the world \u2013 there are other kinds of high-tech, low-tech and entirely natural systems that can do the same thing for us and provide us with food, water, energy, shelter, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe right systems, knowledge and tools can free up your time and make your life easier. This is what Walden Labs is about, and I\u2019d like to invite you to join me as we explore this more abundant way of living, and build a better world for future generations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to support my work I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart. If you don\u0027t, I hope you still continue to be a part of this movement. The future belongs to our children. Let\u0027s make it great.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
