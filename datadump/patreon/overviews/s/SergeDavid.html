Well I\u0027m here today, not today for you but today some days in the past when I wrote this up, begging for money. Well I\u0027m not really begging but I do want some.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince around 2014 I\u0027ve been hosting a M.A.V. server, a teamspeak for it, and website related to it.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also made several guides both on youtube and off it like the quick start one / how to handle recoil / role type overviews / setting up a server / etc. I\u0027ve also been very busy in the community such as the bombdogstudios forums / steam forums / facebook group / sub-reddit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally more recently I\u0027ve been working on several different tools relating to M.A.V. such as a stats signature you can use to show off on the forums, a part comparison tool to see how they stack up against each other in an easier way then what\u0027s currently in M.A.V. and the most recent project that hasn\u0027t currently been released is a Build Designer which lets you theory craft builds based on part weight and energy consumption so you can fine tune your build ideas while your not in the garage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePretty much I\u0027ve been busy and I\u0027d love to continue to do so by reaching out to all of you who use my tools and videos to donate to the pizza fund. For just as little as $_ _ _ _._ _ a day you can keep a hungry SergeDavid fed or at least help fuel his addiction to impulse buying of M.A.V. gift codes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyhoodles what can you expect if you back me? More content on youtube! Better edited content on youtube! Twitch Streams! Drunk (or at least buzzed) Twitch Streams! Better Looking Rak Sal Industries Page! Your own item included into the Rak Sal Catalog! Incentive for me to work on the website and all these things! Pizza, think of the pizza!\u003cbr\u003e"
