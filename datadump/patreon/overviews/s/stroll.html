    "summary": "STROLL is a by-sex worker, for-sex worker outreach, education, and community strengthening project. It\u00a0is our goal to provide the information and resources needed to make more informed decisions, personally and professionally. Using the pioneering work of the now-defunct Danzine as a model, we are filling the service gap left by Danzine\u0027s dormancy. \u00a0As the Danzine retrospective at the Portland Art Museum said, \"Danzine\u0027s risk reduction mission is timeless and its energy resurfaces as health organizations nationwide take cue from its efficacy and sensitivity to those it served.\"*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis Patreon is for the funding of the \u00a0supplies we need for our weekly outreach and meal program:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHealth kit supplies:\u003c/strong\u003e bags ~$30, condoms ~$100, mouthwash ~$100, deodorant ~$215, wipes ~$500, tampons ~140, energy bars ~$670, heating pads ~$500, water bottles ~$450\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeekly meals:\u003c/strong\u003e ~$50\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are also hoping to raise enough money to cover printing for \u003cstrong\u003eWorking It\u003c/strong\u003e--the longer and more inclusive it gets, the higher printing costs get, without factoring the $25 we pay per submission (one time rights use)\u003cbr\u003e~$600\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~...~\u003cbr\u003eSTROLL has been funded by the Portland-centered Cascade AIDS Project to offer safer sex supplies, hygiene supplies, and a limited amount of home HIV testing kits to street based sex workers and survival sex workers in Portland, Oregon. Due to rising rents, the stress of CAP moving offices, overworked case managers, and overworked volunteers, we will not be funded by them in the next fiscal year and will be relying more than ever on grassroots support and donors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePortland is dealing with a housing crisis that is only worsening with every year that goes by.  In 2016 57 people died of exposure or exposure-related reasons. \u00a0That\u0027s over one person a week! In 2017 houselessness in Multnomah county went up by 10%. We know that the wait to get into the family shelters alone is months long, with over 800 families on it. In the winter of 2017 5 houseless people died directly of hypothermia while countless others died in hospitals of what should have been preventable complications of exposure. \u00a0We are currently beginning a summer of record breaking heat, and more people will die. \u00a0There are no cooling shelters and hydration stations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSTROLL understands that people whose basic needs are taken care of and who feel that they have some options are less likely to feel forced into survival sex work, while people who are engaging in survival sex work are less likely to consent to things they don\u0027t want to do if their immediate physical needs are met.  Recognising this, we want to mitigate the pressures of poverty as much as we can through offering meals at local houseless camps, hygiene supplies, and resource referrals along with our safer sex and hygiene packets. \u003cbr\u003eDespite the overwhelming need for these resources, the local and state government have not responded, instead gutting tenant protections and protections for vulnerable houseless people.\u003cbr\u003eFive dollars covers one meal for two people, or two meals for one person, and one bottle of water. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003ePlease share, and check out STROLLPDX.org for news and more ideas on how to get involved.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSTROLL also hosts regular popup clothing giveaways, Hussy Tales and Whorer Stories, a quarterly story telling event, the annual Sex Worker Art Party, the March 3rd Red Light Revolution benefit, the annual Stripper Field Day, a memorial for Trans Day of Remembrance, and a memorial for December 17th: International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*http://www.portlandart.net/archives/2005/06/danzine_at_the.html\u003cbr\u003e"
