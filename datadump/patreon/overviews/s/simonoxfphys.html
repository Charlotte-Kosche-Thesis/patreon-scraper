    "summary": "Hi, thank you for checking out my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Simon and I have been a video creator on the internet since 2010. Originally I started a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/simonoxfphys\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube account\u003c/a\u003e to help students from disadvantaged backgrounds apply to prestigious UK universities, giving the advice that I wish I\u0027d been given when I successfully applied to Oxford University to study physics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have stayed in academia since then, earning my masters degree in physics from Oxford, and currently working towards my PhD in theoretical atmospheric physics from the University of Exeter. Along this journey I kept making videos, and found that not only did I enjoy the creative challenge of writing, producing, and releasing educational videos, but people seemed to enjoy what I made! I branched out from videos about university applications to cover my lifelong passions of science, music, and books. In particular I\u0027ve made long form videos about the physics of the atmosphere and cryosphere, shorter videos about relativity and brains, and a long series of vlogs about life as a young researcher.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zU46kdTtlUk?ecver=1\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis has always been a side-quest that I\u0027ve done for free, but with the end of my professional academic journey looming I want nothing more than to continue to make educational, entertaining videos. But full time, as my main quest-line, rather than squeezing editing in between 9pm and 3am!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this page for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently earn a small amount of money from YouTube\u0027s monetisation feature, but this is nowhere near enough to support me as a creator - while I work on my own and have very limited expenses (food, warmth, and internet, basically!) I still don\u0027t earn enough to cover them, especially now that my funding as a PhD student has run out. I\u0027ve been fortunate in life to follow my passion for science through to the highest level. With your help, and to your benefit, I can use this Patreon to pursue my passion for creating videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFuture projects that I want to create for you include: ever-better vlogs, a series on underappreciated scientists from history, videos connecting maths and music, huge-scale practical demonstrations of physical principles, and about a million other ideas that I\u0027m desperate to make reality. In addition to funding these projects, if enough money is raised through donations then my videos can be improved by, for example; hiring an artist to replace my childish scrawls, a designer to improve my infographics, and local musicians to record bespoke music for big productions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can I help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to support my video work then you can do so by donating a set amount per month - the number of videos I upload in a month can fluctuate from three to as many as ten, but no matter how many videos I upload your pledge will not be increased.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are various Patreon perks available depending on the amount you are willing and able to donate. In particular if you donate more than $3 per month you\u0027ll get access to my Patreon feed, which will include classified discussion of future projects (on which I encourage your feedback!), updates on projects outside of YouTube, and at least one exclusive (silly) video per month - probably involving fan favourite \u003cem\u003eDan\u003c/em\u003e. I have ideas for further rewards, but I don\u0027t want to run before I can walk!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this far! A brief summary of the above is:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eI am a scientist who has a passion for making geeky videos\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis page exists to allow me to pursue video making as my full-time job, working for you, the audience\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you would like to support my content then you can do so by donating a set amount per month, in exchange for rewards\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eI\u0027ve consistently been blown away by the generous support I\u0027ve received from my audience. I hope that if you choose to support my work too that I can create videos that will educate, entertain, and inspire you. It would be my pleasure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSimon\u003c/em\u003e"
