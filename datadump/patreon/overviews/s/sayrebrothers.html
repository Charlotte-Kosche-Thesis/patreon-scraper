That\u2019s why we\u2019ve launched a Patereon and require your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut \u003cem\u003eyou knew that\u003c/em\u003e because you are here. So you\u2019re probably more interested in learning more about us and our long-term goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho We Are\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSayre Brothers\u2019 Games was invented to help inspire today\u2019s board gamers and tomorrow\u2019s board game developers. We want to help you create, play, and have fun along the way.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur company is founded by real brothers \u2014 brothers with a rather unique story. One founder, Jeff Sayre, is 53 years old. The other, Michael Sayre, is 22 years old. Most people make the mistake in assuming we are father and son. But we are indeed brothers!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are both very inquisitive and creative and have been making all sorts of things since we were very young. Of course, when Jeff was young, he could only make things out of stone and air. The invention of the wheel was fascinating to him. Michael\u2019s early inventions, on the other hand, could take advantage of modern-day technologies.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere is also another, even older brother involved in the company. But he is currently invisible, hanging out with his Neanderthal brethren at our secret Sayre Brothers\u2019 gaming lair.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOur Inspiration\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe play all sorts of games from board games, to disc golf, to games we invent on the fly. So starting a gaming company didn\u2019t seem like much of a stretch. In fact, as brothers with a (very) large age difference, we\u2019ve done a number of crazy things together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can\u2019t quite recall how it started, but at some point during a Settlers of Catan game, we started creating additional rules and proposing ways in which the game play could be improved and enhanced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat led to discussions on different configurations for a game board. Eventually we realized that we could create individual board game units that would allow players and board game designers to leverage their own imagination and creativity. They could assemble boards in many shapes and sizes by connecting identical units.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, we thought that instead of simply creating a new type of physical game board and then a unique board game utilizing that board, that we should also create a gaming system that would benefit other makers and creators. It would allow them to flex their creative minds and design their own worlds! This idea we call the PentaHex Gaming Platform.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, for those just wanting to play tabletop board games, and who aren\u2019t interested in becoming board game creators, we realized we would need to offer a few complete, unique games using the PentaHex Gaming Platform. That way, they could have fun right out of the box!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhere We\u2019re Going\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell we\u2019re in the final prototyping phase of the PentaHex Gaming Platform. Prototyping occurs in four different areas: the board game units (the actual 3D-printed PentaHex Board Units), the board game pieces, designing and testing the gaming mechanics of our first two games, and the game creator\u0027s manual (see \u003cem\u003eThe PentaHex Gaming Platform\u003c/em\u003e below).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen we set out to develop our new board game system, we knew that in order for it to gain early adoption, that we would have to offer a full-fledged game or two that can be played right out of the box \u2014 using the PentaHex Board Units (PBU) and default game pieces. We\u2019re currently creating two unique games that will be included with the initial boxset.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo not only are we conceptualizing and designing a new board game system, we\u2019re also creating a few original games using that new system!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are fans of a number of board games, such as old-school board games like Clue and Monopoly, new civilization-building games like Settlers of Catan, and a few RPGs (role playing games). So our initial game ideas revolve around those concepts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut before we are ready to launch, we need to complete our final prototype design. We\u2019ve been through three iterations of the PentaHex board game unit so far. All three have been 3D printed. Prototype 4 of the board game unit \u2014 the actual hexagonal piece that is used to assemble as large of a physical board as you want by adding more board game units \u2014 is almost ready to send off to the 3D printers. We think that this version, or the next one, will be the production version used for launch.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur goal is to launch officially via a crowdfunding campaign, either Kickstarter or Indiegogo. Something that we decided early on was that unlike a number of crowdfunding campaigns for games, that we wanted to already have the prototyping complete and an actual physical product in our hands before we launched. That way, people who support us will know that this is not a pipe dream, that the product has been in development for some time and is actually ready to be manufactured.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut there are a number of key steps and milestones required to get us to that stage. And your support as a Patron is what will make the difference!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease see the Goals section below to learn about our milestones and how you can help us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe PentaHex Gaming Platform\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have much more to share. So if you\u0027re interested in learning more, please take a couple of minutes and read the page we\u0027ve created on our website \u2014\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.sayrebrothers.com/pentahex-gaming-platform/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhat is the PentaHex Gaming Platform?\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can learn even more by watching this brief introductory video, \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/Wqk_H1aEFp4\"\u003eIntroducing The PentaHex Gaming Platform\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQuick Note About Our Goals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently we have 8 goals listed -- also known as milestones. The default Patreon display option is to show one goal panel at a time. So scroll through one at time or simply click the \"View all\" option at the top of the goals panel!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGoals on Patreon are on a per month or per project basis. So when you look over our goals, you\u0027ll see they are listed as a per month goal. We will be running our Patreon on a per month basis -- hey, the electric bill on a secret gaming lair is expensive -- but each of our goals is a one-time need.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat does this mean?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat means once we hit the listed dollar amount of the first goal, we can immediately get started on brining that goal to fruition. Then the next month\u0027s donations will be put toward the next goal on the list. And so on, and so on...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn other words, we will keep collecting funds each month until we can fulfill the next goal\u0027s needs. Then move on to the next goal on the list!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eStay In The Loop!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe of course will periodically be posting updates for all of our Patrons on our Patreon.

For PentaHex, the playing surface is made up of interlocking PentaHex Board Units (PBUs).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\u2019ve been working with several 3D printing services to help us prototype each iteration of the PentaHex Board Unit. Currently, it costs us $29.39 to print out a single board game unit prototype! That is basically $30 per PentaHex Board Unit.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAt the low quantities we are printing, that is the lowest discounted price we can get!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYou see, whereas we are all onboard the maker craze and love 3D printing, currently the costs are too prohibitive to use 3D printing for mass market products. Even if the cost could be driven down to a few pennies per unit, the amount of time it takes to print out each unit is a deal killer. So we cannot consider using 3D Printing for mass production.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBut it is an indispensable tool for prototyping!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eP4 Or Not P4 \u2014 That is the Question\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur next iteration of the PentaHex Board Unit (PBU) \u2014 Prototype 4 (P4) \u2014 is almost ready for printing. We will be purchasing several copies of P4 for testing purposes. We believe this is either the final prototyping iteration, or very close to the last one, before we finalize the design of the PBU.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe plan to 3D print seven (7) copies of this advanced prototype. This is the bare minimum needed to fully test the interlocking HexRing design. At $30 per print, this will cost us $210 excluding taxes and shipping.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf we\u2019re happy with the results of P4 testing, we will authorize that as the final iteration and make it version one of our PBU design. From that point, only minor changes will be made to the design if any at all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe estimate this stage will cost about $250 for 3D printing, taxes, and shipping.\u003cbr\u003e",

The six outer cells can hold a maximum of 18 PGPs (6 cells x 3 levels) whereas the inner three cells can hold a\u00a0maximum of 6 PGPs (3 cells x 2 levels).\u00a0That means a fully populated PBU will have a potential to hold 24 PentaHex Game Pieces (PGPs)! Multiply that by at least 18 PBUs that will ship with the standard game boxset, and we will need at least 432 (18 x 24) PGPs!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eRight now, we only have 27 game pieces that we\u2019re using for testing.

We plan to produce 1000s, and eventually tens of thousands, of PentaHex boxsets. But for mass production, we cannot manufacture the PBUs and PGPs via 3D printing and laser cutting. At this time, the economies of scale are not favorable using these technologies. So, we have to go back to the basics -- we need to rely on plastic injection molding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we\u2019ve finalized prototyping of the PentaHex Gaming Platform, we will seek competitive bids for creating the plastic injection molds for the various components \u2014 PBUs, PGPs, character figurines, and all special game pieces. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut having molds created can be a very, very expensive proposition. However it is necessary as it is the only practical way to significantly reduce the retail price per unit of each component.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAs an example, instead of tens of dollars per PentaHex Board Unit (PBU), with plastic injection molding, the price per PBU can be drastically reduced to pennies on the dollar \u2014 if we order many thousands of PBUs at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eNeeded Plastic Injection Molds\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e1.

We will also require a plastic injection mold for the manufacturing of the PentaHex Game Pieces (PGPs). Laser cutting is currently not fiscally practical at production scale \u2014 thousands of boxsets. It\u2019s great for prototyping but not for mass production. Estimated Cost: $8,000\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e3. We will also require a plastic injection mold for all special game pieces. Estimated Cost: $8,000\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e4. Finally, we will need to have a plastic injection mold created for production of sets of the unique, six characters. Estimated Cost: $10,000\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe estimate total costs of this stage to be about $40,000 for design and manufacturing of all plastic injection molds.
