I was a \nmerit scholar at the Mind Builders Creative Arts Center where I studied \nVoice, Ballet, Modern, Tap, African and Hip-Hop. Since the age of 6 I \nhave studied dance, vocals, acting and figure skating at various \ninstitutions including the Alvin Ailey School, Harlem School Of The \nArts, TADA!, Figure Skating In Harlem and The Rosetta Lenoire musical \ntheater program AMAS. My favorite genre of music is a mixture of \nrock\u0026amp;roll, pop and contemporary r\u0026amp;B but I can sing anything if \nneed be. My musical influences include but are not limited to Tina \nTurner, Ella Fitzgerald, Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury, Duke \nEllington, Ethel Merman, Patti Lupone, Barbra Streisand and The \nSupremes.",
