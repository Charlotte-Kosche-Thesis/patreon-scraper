While I\u0027m not being commissioned I\u0027m producing free content for anyone who likes art and anyone who likes roleplaying games, specifically Arthurian and also the sci-fi game, 2300AD. I don\u0027t charge for these and give them away freely but map making is my sole income at the moment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to do a \u0027Map of the Month\u0027 where patrons get a new and random map each month for their own personal use. You can pin it on your wall, use it in your roleplaying games, or even just use it as inspiration for your own game world or maps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving patron support will enable me to keep giving away content, producing free magazines (submissions from writers and artists prohibit me from charging for them) and also enabling me to continue as an artist. As i work freelance as a cartographer money is up and down and being supported by folks who like my work will enable to me to set aside some worries and produce more of it and, in turn, hopefully find more commissions. I have some great rewards available so take a look!"
