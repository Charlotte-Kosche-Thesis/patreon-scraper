     "description": "When I reach $200 per month I will be able to upgrade my Broadband to the super fast fibre. This will mean much shorter uploading times for my YouTube gaming videos. A one hour video currently takes nine hours to upload to YouTube! A thirty minute video takes half that time but is still way too long! Alot of times my uploads fail with my current Broadband, meaning that the video has to be uploaded a second, or third time. As you can imagine this is very frustrating as a YouTube Content Creator. Playing games online will be much better and I will be able to \u0027Share Play\u0027 games. I should be able to Live Stream too if my Broadband upload speed is more than 5mb per second. My current upload speed is only a maximum of 700kb per second, although I am sure it is more like 200kb per second! My current broadband is unlimited, so at least I don\u0027t have to worry about that.\u003cbr\u003e",
