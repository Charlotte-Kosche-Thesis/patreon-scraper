It is a litero-game, which means that it\u0027s literary a \"game\", a specific type of one, but you could put it in the genre of ARG (Alternative Reality Games) and I wouldn\u0027t be mad. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe and I claim (and I\u0027m not the only one who does it) that video games are the newest form of art, the 10th art! Also, for me, video games are the most important media in the 21st century. They can inspire, affect and help people become better humans, better players of their own game, which many call life. A video game should use its full potential to arouse great ideas and emotions in players, it should have the same power as a book, it should invoke the catharsis. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo prove that, we are making a litero-game, a piece of art in the media of video games, which should achieve all these high goals which separate art from plain fun. \"Litero\" in Esperanto means \"letter\". We use this word to distinguish our game from other video games, because our main goal is to make a game which can influence on people, a game which can teach you how to find purpose in your life, a game which can help us to make a world a better place, or at least have fun while trying. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can you help me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can play the game, that\u0027s a good start!\u003cbr\u003eYou can involve in spreading the gameplay all over the world.\u003cbr\u003eYou can give suggestions and proposals how to make our litero-game more efficient. \u003cbr\u003eAnd you can donate the money to this platform (which we encourage you to do), or by buying the products we have online. We need money to pay costs of producing this type of game for a wider audience and still make it completely free to play, without any pay-to-win stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis game is about you and your way of playing it, it\u0027s about us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy donating on anyway to my causes, you allow me to continue with my work as well as to support other authors. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe main goal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe aim of this game is to teach people about themselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNobody can tell you the final truth or what\u0027s the meaning of life because it\u0027s a matter of singleplayer. You have to be the hero of your life, the hero of your own game. It\u0027s fun, trust me! Litero-game \"Sobakaisti\" will teach you how to do it while playing it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
