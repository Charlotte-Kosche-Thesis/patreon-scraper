I\u0027m Sequoia the Storyteller, author/illustrator and fantasy storyteller of various mediums. :3 Welcome to my Patreon page! Thanks for coming by! :)\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere I share graphic novel pages, illustrations/concept art, and occasionally, writing snippets. :) I write and draw in a fantasy style, featuring worlds, characters, and creatures I made up (and many a dragon. :D ) Currently some of my big projects are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imaginationsflightiestescapade.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/parch-face-graphic.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e1) A dragon-based graphic novel called Accidental Elemental, which has actually been rebooted from a fan-fiction (based in Spyro) to a totally original story. As a patron you will see not only the finished pages of this but pages in their sketch and/or line art phase, effectively reading them ahead of the general public. There will also be concept art available and you may be able to see the development of stuff that others will not see and/or will not see for a long time. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imaginationsflightiestescapade.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/masky-graphic.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e2) Dreaming Esmeralda, a story series which I\u0027m planning as animated films... it will take a while for the final version of THAT one to go public but for now I do have various art and written words to build it with, which I occasionally share with the public. I\u0027m a bit more mysterious about this one than other projects, because its final form is farther away. But it\u0027s still always under construction until then, so you never know what might pop up from that. ;) For instance, I\u0027m currently making a mini-comic called \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/sequoiathestoryteller/posts?tag=Yowler%20and%20Draggin\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYowler and Draggin\u003c/a\u003e, which takes place several years before the events of Dreaming Esmeralda but is set in the same world. If you are a patron, the same applies as with Accidental pages... you will be able to see sketches of the pages ahead of their completion/release. ^_^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cimg src=\"http://imaginationsflightiestescapade.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tripoint-books-graphic.png\" style=\"float: left; width: 199px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e3)\n A series of fantasy books called The Torian Tri-Point, of which two are\n complete and published on Amazon.com as e-books and paperbacks (links \nbelow if you\u0027re interested).
