Throughout his life he seeks to be loved, but there is much more at stake than he\u0027s aware of at first...The \u003cstrong\u003eTale of Courage\u003c/strong\u003e takes place at the turn of the 19th century, 1899. It follows the tale of a boy with a chip on his shoulder and not much left to lose. When he\u0027s given as a squire to an assassin, his courage, tenacity and very life are put to the test.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a full-time job, but thus far I\u0027ve managed to update twice a week without fail. My ultimate goal would be, like most webcomic artists, to do this full time. Regardless, I would love to be able to put more time and effort into this and create more content.
