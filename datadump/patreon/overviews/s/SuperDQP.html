    "summary": "Hello! I\u2019m George \u201cDQP\u201d Hyde, I create YouTube videos about video game analysis and Steam Controllers, and I\u2026 am poor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, you can help me not be poor, and in exchange, I can offer you more content since I\u2019d be working on this channel full-time instead of whenever I\u2019m able to in my spare time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003eSo what do you create on this YouTube channel, hmmmmm?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started out making simple game reviews as a way to boost my video production skills during college, and it\u2019s since grown into\u2026 lots of stuff. Let\u2019s start with why you\u2019re probably here in the first place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003eMastering the Steam Controller\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015, I picked up a Steam Controller and thought it had a long way to go before it could impress me, but one year later it had grown on me and become my de facto PC gaming controller. I thought it would be a fun idea to release a \u201cone year later\u201d video documenting the games that had helped me learn the controller in the hopes that other people would find it useful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had no idea that that video would become my most popular video by an insanely large margin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than two years on (as of writing) the Steam Controller remains a fascinating piece of kit. Every time I use it it feels like I can do something new with it. So I turned Mastering the Steam Controller into a series in the hopes of helping people learn specific genres and functions of the controller. However, in March of 2017, I decided to put the series on the shelf in favor of other projects that I felt needed to be worked on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut those projects are now over with, and I can get back to making videos about playing certain games and using certain functions with the Steam Controller.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003eThe Favorite Games Project\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Favorite Games Project started as a simple \u201cTop Ten Favorite Games\u201d list, but it eventually exploded into a massive miniseries that analyzes my favorite games in-depth. That miniseries then graduated to a regular series as I still had a set of \u201chonorable mentions\u201d I wanted to talk about; I still have a list of games to make Favorite Games Project videos of. If my Nier: Automata video is any indication, that list will continue to grow as more excellent games come out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn comparison to the Steam Controller videos, Favorite Games Project videos take much longer to write and produce, and they don\u2019t get as much attention, but I really enjoy making them. I can\u2019t wait to make more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003eOther editorials and stuff\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy content isn\u2019t just restricted by those two series, though; I\u2019ll also post content about certain games or topics that don\u2019t apply to MtSC or FGP. (I\u2019ve got a LOT to say about The Last Jedi, for an upcoming example.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003eWhat\u2019s in it for me if I become a patron?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make one thing clear: everything I put on YouTube is and will forever be freely available to everyone. This comprises the vast majority of my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I do want to offer rewards, I want to offer my content to everyone no matter how much they want to chip in; it doesn\u2019t matter if they chip in a buck or fifty, patrons going to get everything I produce; videos, blog posts, all of it. I want you to fund me not out of a desire to earn a sick reward, but \u003cem\u003ebecause you want to fund me in the first place\u003c/em\u003e. I feel that my content must be worthy on its own terms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that being said, I plan on starting a patron-only blog here on Patreon where I\u2019ll post about topics that may or may not fit a video setting, or that the vast majority of my viewers would not care about. Think things like short reviews, follow-ups on Favorite Games Project videos, and other miscellaneous things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, no matter how much you chip in, I will also throw you in the credits of every video I produce. If you\u2019re funding me, you deserve a shout-out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, since there are literally thousands of games that you can play with the Steam Controller, I\u2019m sure many of you have specific games or genres that you want to learn more about. I want to learn with you! Patrons who chip in $5 or more can request Mastering the Steam Controller episodes on whatever they\u2019d like me to cover.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003eWait a sec! Don\u2019t your videos have ads already?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell\u2026 yes. I do need to eat and pay rent, and in the past, ad revenue has helped me supplement my income so I\u2019m not just living paycheck to paycheck. Not by a lot, because AdSense, but every little bit helps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if funding reaches a threshold where I can live off of it, my videos are going ad-free. I will promise that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLiving in Anchorage costs a lot, and so does moving out of town. I hope you understand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003eSo\u2026 you\u2019re independent?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCompletely. This channel is a 100% DQP operation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003eAnything else to say for yourself?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think that about covers it. I\u2019ll bring anything else up as it comes along, but aside from that, that\u2019s about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeriously, though, even if you only chip in a dollar, you\u2019ll be helping immensely, and if you don\u2019t want to pay, that\u2019s fine too! My YouTube channel is free for all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut by becoming a patron, you can help this channel sustain itself and hopefully grow. You can help me learn more about the things I love and make a living off of skills and hobbies that I\u2019m passionate about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether or not you actually decide to fund me, thank you. Thank you for being here."
