I am Seviria Cosplay from Canada and I am 21 years old! I have been cosplaying since January 2015! That was when I made my very first cosplay, Snowstorm Sivir! I went to my first convention in August of 2014 and I fell in love with the entire scene. When I saw the amazing things people were creating from some of my favorite games and TV shows I couldn\u0027t help but want to join in on the fun as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://imgur.com/e7uyTyZ\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imgur.com/mCSuhdF\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/mCSuhdF.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI went into this hobby with 0 crafting skills, I had never made a prop before, I had never sewn before. A friend taught me the basics of sewing, and I used a sewing machine we found at thrift store. I was hooked from day one!\u00a0The list of things I want to do continues to grow every day, and I am always full of new ideas. I would love to have the time to make all the things I want to make, but on top of being a full time student year round, I\u0027m not left with very much free time. Currently I\u0027m in my third year and working towards completing my bachelor degree.\u003c/div\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/15181387_602272663314649_8703962507213132616_n.jpg?oh=e5653d505636412778aa34ca95feec58\u0026amp;oe=59A957F1\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NB6jx7t.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do I cosplay?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI cosplay because I love having a creative outlet, and being able to create anything I want, no matter how crazy! \u00a0Another reason I cosplay, and this is really the main reason, is because I love the design of so many fictional characters.  I love their personalities, their attitudes, everything about them! I\u00a0have an innate want to bring those characters to life in any way that I can. I am so so grateful that I have the ability to do this, and that I have such wonderful people in my life who support and encourage me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14947469_595419617333287_3886533697507724025_n.jpg?oh=414ff31cb719a1ad2cebdcee93a6cf3f\u0026amp;oe=59B399B5\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was hesitant to embark on this journey into patreon for a few reasons. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) I highly agree with the statement that cosplay is not a privilege, it\u2019s a hobby.  If you can\u2019t afford to pay rent and make costumes, then you shouldn\u0027t be making costumes. Your hobby should never come before your basic needs for survival. While I\u2019ve never had to sacrifice any \"real life\" necessities, being a student and working is exhausting.  I make enough money to support this hobby, but just barely. Being able to have extra funds would simply mean I could travel to more places,make more cosplays and have the ability to make more elaborate cosplays, with access to better (and more expensive) materials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://imgur.com/6c94e80e-50d2-4b26-9496-dbf54eceec98\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6jAIFOU.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e 2) \u00a0I never want to take away from what I am giving to my fans, and all the people who support me. I was under the impression for the longest time that having a patreon would deprive the fans who support my work outside of patreon of content. But that\u0027s not the case, Patreon isn\u0027t a place that takes away from what artists are sharing with their fans, but actually pushes creators to go above and beyond what they are currently doing to create separate content for both channels. So you can do everything you normally do for your fans, and you also can create special content specifically for those who want to see you do even greater work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/18425101_686364234905491_562266272870734858_n.jpg?oh=5a2ea0121cace6b3405526bb373a1b81\u0026amp;oe=59A9B3DF\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/BpNRG4Y.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) I see my friends who have Patreon working so hard so that they and their supporters are happy.  From what I can see it\u2019s totally doable - but its very time consuming. Not being able to keep up with this was another one of my fears.  Since Patreon is an incentive based system, I want to be able to offer rewards that I think are fair, but also that are doable for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor those reasons I was hesitant to jump on board, but after some gentle nudges from friends and fans I was ready to take on that responsibility, and everything else that comes with it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12294623_454832978058619_1783104053100475615_n.jpg?oh=124b003ddb9c14088b6cf99130949db6\u0026amp;oe=59AD5F11\" style=\"background-color: initial; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/H36xr7s.jpg\" style=\"background-color: initial; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you pledge?
