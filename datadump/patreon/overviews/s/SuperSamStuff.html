    "summary": "I have no idea where to begin here, so I guess I\u0027ll start AT THE DAWN OF TIME. IN THE BEGINNING THERE WAS no never mind, that\u0027ll take too long.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Sam, and if that was dumb enough to make you smile maybe you\u0027ll like it here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re new: Hi! I\u0027ve been making vlogs\u00a0for three years now, usually once every two weeks.\u00a0I try and keep my videos videos engaging, or at least amusing. Growing up in the modern age is strange to say the least. I want to share my experience of it, with all the twists and turns that come along the way.\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not new: why did you just read all that? You already knew, remember? Why are you still reading this? You\u0027re just embarrassing yourself now. MOVING ON.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what I do, firstly, thank you! Having people engage with the stuff I do, even if it\u0027s from a distance, means the world to me. Secondly, it\u0027s not going anywhere. As I hit my twenties (and they hit back, \u003cem\u003eoh boy do they hit back\u003c/em\u003e) these videos are something I want to give more of myself to. I want to be able to spend more time working on them, with higher quality work on a more regular basis (weekly videos are the dream). This is a place where you can help me do that if you\u0027d like to!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be making film recommendation videos a regular occurrence on the channel, and now you can be a little more involved in them as well as the other things that I get up to. Here, you\u0027ll be able to find (hopefully) more comprehensive thoughts and opinions, as well as the topics that I\u0027m planning to center videos around.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also been asked a few times (exactly 29.3 times to be specific) if I\u0027m going to be doing more music, and while the answer to that is a strong \"maybe\", I\u0027ll be uploading little bedroom covers here every now and then. If I drop them on the channel it\u0027ll be a few days after, if not they\u0027re just for you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo to recap: IN THE BEGI... sorry, bad habit. Videos coming more regularly. The channel isn\u0027t doing any drastic changing, but this is a place where you can be more involved in the stuff on there if you\u0027d like to be! I hope you enjoy what\u0027s on it\u0027s way.\u003cbr\u003e"
