It\u0027s me, \u003cstrong\u003eS. Qiouyi Lu\u003c/strong\u003e, your friendly local sinner. All kidding aside, I\u0027m a writer, editor, narrator, and translator; I mostly create in the science fiction/fantasy/horror (SFFH) genres, but I\u0027ve stepped between and across genres as well. I\u0027m also a big advocate for fandom and transformative works\u2014they\u0027re where I honed my writing skills, after all, so you\u0027ll see me unashamedly talking about fanfic here and elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI stand at the intersection of many marginalizations and identities, all of which show up to some degree in my art. Here you\u0027ll find queer Asian-American badasses, many of whom probably deal with mental illness and the aftereffects trauma. But I\u0027m not super into writing tragic stories or things that rip your heart to pieces\u2014I mean, I can and do write those stories, but I\u0027d just as much like to see fluff and happy endings for the rest of us, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h1\u003e\nLike most writers, I have a day job. If you follow my Twitter at all, you\u0027ll know that my day job also comes with a hell commute (usually around three hours of my day, on top of the nine hours I work most days because of my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://workfamily.sas.upenn.edu/glossary/n/nineeighty-work-week-definitions\"\u003e9/80 schedule\u003c/a\u003e). All this, plus the necessary time each day for self-care and additional errands, means that I have little time on weekdays to devote to creative projects. I still need to see my family and friends sometimes too, so that takes up some of my weekend time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been struggling more and more to balance these various priorities. No matter how many organization apps I\u0027m using or how granularly I divide my day, the truth of the matter is that, as things currently stand, I just don\u0027t have enough time or energy to do everything I want to do.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo that\u0027s the dream: supplementing my income enough via Patreon to cut back on my day job hours and maybe quit my day job altogether someday so I can focus more on my art.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA secondary focus for my Patreon is to provide a market for my smutty fiction that pays me a fair rate for my work. Charles Payseur\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://quicksipreviews.blogspot.com/2017/06/mapping-smutty-sff-part-1-getting.html\"\u003ehas previously discussed\u003c/a\u003e the gap between \"pro\" SFFH and smutty SFFH. Before opening this Patreon, I had been compromising with my desire to write erotica alongside what actually sells in a pro market by giving myself permission to write smutty fanfic when it\u0027s in a non-speculative setting, but to file the serials off and tone things down if the story had a speculative element and I wanted any chance of selling it to a pro market. I suppose I could have kept in the erotica and sent it to an erotica-friendly market\u2014but even Circlet Press, perhaps the most well-known name in speculative erotica, only pays $25 per short story. And that\u0027s just not sustainable for me given my limited time and energy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBesides, people have told me that they like my smut, so if they\u0027re going to throw money at me for it, who am I to deny them that? \ud83d\ude07\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhat You\u0027ll Get\u003c/h1\u003e\nI primarily write short fiction (usually flash or short stories, but I\u0027m doing my best to branch out to novelette and novella length) and poetry. For samples of my smutty short fiction, visit\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=\u2713\u0026amp;commit=Sort+and+Filter\u0026amp;work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at\u0026amp;work_search%5Brating_ids%5D%5B%5D=13\u0026amp;work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=\u0026amp;work_search%5Bquery%5D=-feels\u0026amp;work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=\u0026amp;work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=0\u0026amp;pseud_id=millihelenic\u0026amp;user_id=millihelenic\"\u003ethe explicit tab of my Archive of Our Own page\u003c/a\u003e (you typically don\u0027t need to know canon to understand the fics). If you\u0027d like an example of my erotic poetry, you can read my poem \"\u003ca href=\"http://twistedmoonmag.com/2/qiouyilu.html\"\u003eBadwater\u003c/a\u003e\" at \u003cem\u003eTwisted Moon\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor a $1+ pledge, you will get access to at least one new smutty story or poem per month in a variety of digital formats, including audio. As you can probably tell from my AO3, a lot of my smut will likely involve BDSM, as I find BDSM both hot and a fascinating venue for exploring power, character, and how both relate to sexuality. I will provide content tags for each piece (see\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://s.qiouyi.lu/content-tags/\"\u003emy content tags page\u003c/a\u003e for examples of how I describe works); please feel free to let me know if there\u0027s anything specific you\u0027d like me to tag for\u2014doesn\u0027t have to be a trigger; you can ask me to tag for, say, cats, because you like reading stories about cats.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are additional rewards for other levels of support, including snippets of works in progress, a S.mutcast (aka my smutty podcast), live videos of my writing process, and print chapbooks/paperbacks.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for your consideration and patronage!\u003c/strong\u003e It\u0027s an honor to have you in my audience. Now, get ready, because it\u0027s time to sin.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
