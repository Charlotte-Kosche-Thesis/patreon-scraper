    "summary": "My name is Matt Sall and I grew up in Philadelphia but moved to Texas for college where I got an Electrical Engineering degree, but that\u0027s boring. I love tabletop games. \u00a0Anything from Settlers of Catan to Mage Knight, Stratego to Warhammer 40k, Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition to Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition and everything in between.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started playing board games back in elementary school.  I still have my copy of \u003ca href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1933/key-kingdom\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKey to the Kingdom\u003c/a\u003e and I think it holds up pretty well. In middle school I started playing Dungeons and Dragons, 2nd edition but quickly moved to 3rd. My first modern board game, like most, was Settlers of Catan. I honestly don\u0027t remember the first time I played it, but ever since whenever that was I\u0027ve been hooked. I have a fairly decent collection now although it pales in comparison to others I\u0027ve seen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a long time I really loved making new rules for the games I had. \u00a0More recently, though, I\u0027ve started to enjoy making my own games. I\u0027ve seen other people make ideas into reality and thought, why not me? So here I am trying to make that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find a lot of my work on my blog which is updated \u003cem\u003every frequently\u003c/em\u003e:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://nerdaphernalia.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://nerdaphernalia.blogspot.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAlso, I don\u0027t post on there much but I do have a Board Game Geek account as well:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/user/SALLstice\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://boardgamegeek.com/user/SALLstice\u003c/a\u003e"
