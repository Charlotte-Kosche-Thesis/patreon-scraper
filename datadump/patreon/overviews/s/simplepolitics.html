    "summary": "What is Simple Politics?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSimple Politics is a project that aims to make politics\naccessible and engaging to as many people as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe do that through social media, through quizzes, through\nvideos, with our website and through our education work in schools.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt was created in 2015 by me, Tatton Spiller. Most of my career\nwas in teaching, in the classroom and at Parliament\u2019s Education Service.\nThrough my work with young people, I grew more and more frustrated that there\nwas nowhere to go for clear, impartial and accurate explanations of what was\ngoing on. So, I quit my job and started Simple Politics.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe project has grown really nicely. There are now well over\n100,000 social media followers. The week of the 2017 election, the Facebook\npage alone reached over a million people. I\u2019ve been joined by the lovely Hattie\nwho basically does everything.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo far, it\u2019s been entirely self-funded. We\u2019ve made a little\nmoney from events and education work and the games we sell, but it doesn\u2019t come\nclose to covering our costs. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created a Patreon page. Patroen\nallows you \u2013 the user who finds us useful and / or support the idea \u2013 to give\nus some money each month.  That gives us\na monthly income with which to plan and build the project to reach out and help\nmore people.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat will we do with the money? Currently we spend money on\nadvertising on social media, that helps us to reach audiences much wider than\norganic growth does. For Simple Politics to be a success it has to be reaching\nout beyond the traditional people who use social media for politics. We also\nhave wages to pay. I don\u2019t plan to pay myself yet, but Simple Politics couldn\u2019t\nsurvive without the paid work that a few people do. Finally, there are costs of\ncomputer equipment, software, travel etc etc etc.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn short, we need your help to keep going. We believe that it\u2019s\nvital to our democracy that politics is accessible and we\u2019re working to make it\nmore accessible than ever before. I\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so much for your support \u2013 and thank you for even\nconsidering becoming one of our patrons.\u003cbr\u003e"
