    "summary": "When my engine broke down many of you wanted to donate money for a new motorcycle or repairing the engine. This was a nice thing of you to do! Thank You for offering!\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I was fully prepared and equipped to operate using bicycles as my tools.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBUT, lol, yes this funding would allow me to get a new motorbike (I think it might be a waste of money to have the old motorcyle repaired as it is heavily worn and something else might just go wrong). However, I will be looking into trying to repair it myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShowing a way for people that need or want to make money was one of the reasons I came to YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now here I am making a Patreon account for people to send me money...? \u003cbr\u003eThat felt a bit odd when I first thought about it, but now that I understand how long it takes to create videos and how little money small channels actually make from ads, it doesn\u0027t feel odd anymore lol.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have launched ScrapVulture.com for your use in making money for yourselves. I think ScrapVulture.com is a great idea and will be a success for all of us. \u003cbr\u003eI have been working long hours on building my YouTube ScrapVulture channel over the last 6 months at maybe a 50 cents/hour wage so that I could launch ScrapVulture.com to the proper audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the short term I am more interested in funding ScrapVulture.com and acquiring a GoPro Karma drone system for my GoPro camera than I am in a new motorbike. The cost of ScrapVulture.com is $150/month until it grows and needs room for more people. I have the Gopro camera already, so the Karma drone system itself is only $800 instead of $1,200. The Karma is more than just a drone, it\u0027s a total video making GoPro tool system which will allow me to create higher quality videos for you to enjoy. If you want to donate money only to the motorbike idea that is more than cool.\u00a0Let me know what you think.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are regional revenue sharing oppurtunities for you all by helping ScrapVulture.com get off the ground, making it your project too! You will hear about this in my upcoming videos. Thanks for watching my videos and I am excited to hear your ideas!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
