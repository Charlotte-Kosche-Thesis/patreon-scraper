First, I\u0027d like to thank each of you for being interested in the things I draw- enough, even, to come to my Patreon in the first place. \u003cstrong\u003eYou are awesome\u003c/strong\u003e. Sincerely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Britny and I love to draw, ever since I could. I draw inspiration from webcomics and video games and the people who create them. Favorites and inspirations are Natalie Hall, Loish, Suspu\u0027s Shootaround webcomic, Chiara Bautista, abd sooo many more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy biggest wish is to create my own webcomic,\u00a0but I think I need a little more practice before I begin. [pst--! When I do start, or lob ideas, Patrons will be the first to see!] I like weird creatures, ink, pencils, and awesome character designs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI knew I wanted to be an artist from the moment I could think to myself. I love traditional art; the feel of pencil on paper, and ever since I started taking it seriously I have grown a lot. I have a lot of growing to do still, especially in the realm of digital art, but I\u0027d be happy to share any wisdom and pieces I get along the way.\u003cbr\u003e"
