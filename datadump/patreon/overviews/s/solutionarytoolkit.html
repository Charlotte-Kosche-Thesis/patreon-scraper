Still,\n it is important to contend with immense responsibility of both teaching\n and protecting them. At the same time, parents have just as much responsibility to avoid pushing, cajoling or harassing their children to take up advocacy.\u00a0 This is a confusing topic for many parents and we have some thoughts share and some inspiring parents to bring to the conversation.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePHASE TWO\u003c/strong\u003e\u2014\u003cbr\u003eBringing the pages to life!

     "about": "ABOUT US:\u003cbr\u003eAidan \u0026amp; Rachel (We) met in the winter of 2014 as first responders-with-staying-power, to add strength to the eventual successful effort to stop a massive water bottling plant from being built in (and tapping) our community. Since then, our journey has been incredible. We went from \"Hi How are you?\" to Partners In Solution right away and set out into our community to see how we could put our passion and energy together for the benefit of others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe were an unlikely team\u2014Aidan, the president of the environmental club at her community college, and Rachel, a mom in her forties with a standoffish approach to civic engagement\u2014but the intergenerational exchange turned out to be more awesome than we could have imagined. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFocused on Youth Leadership, social and environmental advocacy, we found an organization that was perfect for what we were thinking about; providing a landing spot for young people to join the call to action and work toward a just and sustainable planet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe began a chapter here in our town and literally created a physical landing spot\u2014a storefront office! Over the year in the office, we gathered community support, volunteered our time to building the chapter, and inspired others as we worked across the NY region with incredible change makers, to protect the waters, lands and people from corporate colonization. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAidan went to COP21 in Paris for the Climate Talks, Rachel is now a United Nations Representative, we sat on boards, joined organizational teams, participated in workshops and facilitated others, hosted events, attended conferences, traveled, connected with, learned from, mentored and been inspired by some of the most powerful and generous people in the movement. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn that span of time, while giving our ideas, creativity and energy away, and exchanging with such amazing beings, we learned a lot! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, as we take a step back, and look at the trajectory of the last three years, there was one point that continues to ring in our hearts and neither of us can shake it off... A \u0027just and sustainable\u0027 planet it simply not enough to reach for. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat exactly are we trying to sustain? A lifestyle that is toxic to future generations? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe prefer, Regeneration... \u003cbr\u003eWith the exchange of one word, the entire conversation changes. We must build systems and implement practices that will regenerate themselves... perennial vs annual, yes? This begins right at the root of team and organizational foundation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this time, we have seen people of all ages burn out on advocacy, suffer enough losses to cash it in, and some who have found the balance to keep going despite the challenges that come with this work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we heard ourselves calling for young people to step up and out into the front lines of this flood of issues, in a time of political upheaval and social unrest, we realized we had better be honest about what it means to jump in, and how hard it can be on the heart and soul. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd also, how beautiful! it can be! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t have all of the answers, but we are learning how effectively questions can elucidate inspiration. And when you know what questions to ask, you can cover a lot of ground. We envision that, with the questions we and our friends, family and solutionary partners in action have, ideas, best practices and perhaps even some answers will arise... Most exciting is if we help anyone to take inspired action.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing we have learned, is that sometimes you have to take a step back, evaluate, restore, reconnect with Spirit and regenerate energy for the next stage on the journey. The presenting of this Toolkit is part of that process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so after three years, before we step into some more restorative practices for our ourselves and our psyches, we want to share some of what we have come to recognize, pick it apart with some of our colleagues, and share it, in an Open Source, Intergenerational Solutionary Toolkit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
