    "summary": "Hi all - my name is Shualee Cook. I write plays and musicals. Shows that endeavor to take the audience to new worlds, or shine a unique contemporary light on old ones. My latest project tells the story of America\u0027s first Women\u0027s Rights Convention at Seneca Falls, New York in 1848 - set to the propulsive, furious beat of punk rock. A Riot Grrrl opera portraying the birth of Women\u0027s Suffrage from its roots in the radical abolition movement, and how an afternoon tea party between early feminist pioneers Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Martha Wright, Lucretia Mott, and Mary Ann M\u0027Clintock spawned an idea that would slowly but surely change the country as we know it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my most ambitious project to date, and your generous support helps provide me with:\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0 travel and materials for the extensive historical research involved\u003cbr\u003e- repair and purchase of instruments and audio equipment needed to produce demo recordings of the show\u0027s score\u003cbr\u003e- rehearsal space for developmental readings and workshops, as the need arises\u003cbr\u003e- more time to pour into the most complex and challenging score/libretto I\u0027ve yet attempted!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for your interest in my project!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShualee"
