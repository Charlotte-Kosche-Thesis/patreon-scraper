I\u0027m a writer, and I\u0027m trying to save up to move into my own place. Unfortunately, that\u0027s not exactly possible right now, given my current financial situation. Fortunately, it has come to my attention that there are people who\u0027d be willing to commission me to write, or to donate here if they like my content enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best part of all this is, I get to do what I love: write. \u003cstrong\u003eI want to write, and I want to do it well.\u003c/strong\u003e This is the best way I could find to get better at writing \u003cem\u003eand \u003c/em\u003estart saving. With Patreon, you\u0027ll be giving me the opportunity to make money doing something I enjoy. Even if it\u0027s just a few short stories, I\u0027ll be able to start saving, and that\u0027s a lot more than I\u0027m able to do now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what are you getting out of all of this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eThat\u0027s a great question. And the answer is pretty simple: you\u0027ll be getting whatever stories I manage to not hate once I\u0027ve finished them, plus extra content for patrons who donate a little more, like \u003cstrong\u003epreviews of whatever I\u0027m working on at the moment, stories written just for you, and even a say in what kind of stories I write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMost of the\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003estuff I make will be written whether you donate or not, but this way the stories that would have happened anyway will be able to do more than they would have otherwise. The plan is to write at least one thing a week, so you\u0027ll get a bunch of new stories of varying length, plus extra content for whatever milestones we reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhatever you donate, I\u0027ll keep writing, and working to make something you\u0027ll enjoy reading.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
