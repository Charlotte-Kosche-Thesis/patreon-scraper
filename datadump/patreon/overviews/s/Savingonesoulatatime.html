     "description": "With the help of $500 per month it would help cover about half the expenses coming out each month leaving more funds to be able to get more spay and neuters done to give all of these sweet loving pigs a chance at a happier healthier life. Having more funds leaves for more veggies, oatmeal, and yummy treats for these well deserving pigs as well. I want to do so so much for these pigs but in reality to save pigs I need a little help from people like you to be able to be the best momma I can be. To my best of ability I spend\u00a0 every moment with them. I take them on walks daily for exercise and bonding. Though I can only take a couple at a time and having 30 pigs and counting, it can take awhile. I owe them a beautiful life, as they make my life beautiful just by being who they are.",
