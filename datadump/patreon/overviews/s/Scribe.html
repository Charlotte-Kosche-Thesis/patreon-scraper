    "summary": "For several years now I\u0027ve been producing gaming videos, mostly let\u0027s plays, on my Youtube channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I quickly learned is that I can put the spotlight on games I love - some of my favorites ever like Silent Hill, Demon\u0027s Souls, and Bayonetta - and show the world in vivid detail what it is that endears me to these games. These solo let\u0027s plays tend to involve a high degree of background research and I pride myself on making them as informative as possible. On the other hand, every now and then I get together to record with my good friend Mike, and those videos are the complete opposite - loud, somewhat immature, and focused more towards comedy as we hang out and try to make each other laugh.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been extremely lucky to find a fan base so friendly and dedicated, and to experience the rapid growth this channel has undergone in such a short period of time. Thank you all for that. The goal of this Patreon is primarily to continue making improvements to the channel and increasing the quality of videos I upload on a daily basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, at the moment I\u0027m limited by time. On a weekly basis I\u0027m putting nearly 10-15 hours into researching, recording, and editing videos before things like streaming, encoding, uploading, and other tertiary things factor in, and I do for free. I don\u0027t mind that. I can keep doing things that way until the end of time. I enjoy making silly videos about silly games. But I would like to be able to justify putting more time into the channel. I would like to introduce new on-going shows, theme months, a podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to make streams more stable, encoding speedier, and to increase the A/V quality of videos. I would like to start producing two videos a day without cutting into the quality you\u0027ve come to expect. I would like this channel to be able to sustain itself. And I need your help to do that.\u003cbr\u003e"
