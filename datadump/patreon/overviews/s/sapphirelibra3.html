Okay, it\u0027s a kids show, I get it. \u00a0But that doesn\u0027t mean that realism can\u0027t exist. \u00a0And hey, that\u0027s what fanfiction is for, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe kind of stories I focus on tend to put a more realistic spin on certain tropes in the series. \u00a0Even with fantastic stories like Inner Demons you\u0027ll find very realistic emotions and relationships in how the characters interact with one another. \u00a0Because of this my stories are more drama oriented and character driven, and at times very dark. \u00a0You don\u0027t think a story starring pastel colored ponies can be dark and serious? \u00a0Read Inner Demons, and you\u0027ll see just how dark Equestria can get.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recently decided to include works outside the MLP fandom as well, so you\u0027ll be seeing a lot of work from me for other fandoms and eventually even original works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting my Patreon, you\u0027re ensuring that I can get work out a lot faster by giving me the ability to work full time on my stories. \u00a0Sadly even I have expenses to cover, and you\u0027re donations would help me to not only cover my expenses but also continue doing what I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, you assist me in my campaign for world domination. \u00a0I assure you that ALL my patrons will receive a place in the new world, and that your families will be safe when the production of my Death Star is finished."
