But with age comes responsibility / school and bills. I would love to continue streaming and doing everything else as well. I may require some assistance I take care of a dog, a cat, tuition and bills itself. Streaming needs equipment, maintenance and actual games. These are things that can cost a bit of money. I am not charging you for my streams it\u0027s still free but I would not mind a bit of help if you are willing. Thank you for \u00a0reading and considering being a patreon to me and have a wonderful day."

As a streamer there are certain requirements to become a partner of twitch. I have not currently met them but If you are willing to treat me as a partner I would be grateful. As you can see it says 3.00 when twitch charges 5 it is because the partner would only receive half the amount you pay to subscribe on twitch. But you must be wondering why not 2.50 that is because 50 cents is given to patreon for their wonderful service.",
