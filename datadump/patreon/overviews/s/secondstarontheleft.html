This is all very new. Please bear with me.) These requests can be updates on WIPs, missing scenes from anything I\u0027m working on, prompt fics, AUs or canon compliant, and pretty much anything you can think of.

They are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Novel, \u003c/strong\u003emy very, very female led high fantasy opus. If you follow me on tumblr, you\u0027ll know I have a deep well of hatred for the Dead Ladies Club that overshadows pretty much every high fantasy series I\u0027ve ever read. Just because of that, The Novel has a Dead Dudes Club.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Winter Novel \u003c/strong\u003eis based around some of the worldbuilding ideas I established in the fic\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/works/5536988\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHold onto your hearts (if you can)\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/em\u003eYes, the worldbuilding is a little muddied behind the sad shippy things. Yes, the title is from a Kaiser Chiefs song. Yes, this is a semi-apocalyptic fic with magic instead of bastardised science, at least one female lead, and many, many disabled characters.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePeccatoribus \u003c/strong\u003eis, of course, available on AO3 - but I intend on taking it down for serious reworking and eventual publishing.

I hope to have this finished by August, for my friend\u0027s birthday.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e"
