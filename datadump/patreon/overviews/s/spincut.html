I\u0027m a queer game designer and writer, and I\u0027m here to make games! You might know some of my work, like \u003cem\u003eSummonr\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eIn Darkness, Dreaming \u003c/em\u003e(you can find the rest of my games on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://spincut.itch.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy itch.io page\u003c/a\u003e). These games have been a lot of fun to make, but I\u0027m ready to expand my scope, starting with a game called \u003cem\u003eThe Way We Are Now, \u003c/em\u003ea post-post-(that\u0027s two posts) apocalyptic queer visual novel about picking up the pieces of the past and moving on. I\u0027m very excited to create a VN that focuses on strong, relateable, deeply human characters and how each of them deals with the problems they face. More details about this game will be coming to patrons soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this Patreon for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough my plan is to do any coding and writing, there is still a lot of other factors that go into making a video game. Artists, sound designers, any consultation work I need to do need to be paid, and I only make enough money with my job to pay my personal bills. So, I started this Patreon to help me pay to make great video games!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of games do you want to make?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to start off by making queer visual novels and dating sims, but I\u0027m also beginning to teach myself different programs like Game Maker and Unity so that in the future I can work on plans I have for first-person exploration games, RPGs, Metroidvanias, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill you be making a game every month?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUnfortunately, no. I feel like if I were to try to make something like a Twine game every month I wouldn\u0027t have time for larger projects. So, I\u0027m not going to hold myself to that strict of a timeline. I will, however, strive to make monthly updates so that you all will know how my projects are coming along. Also, certain goals being unlocked allows me to spend more time making games, and more money coming in means I can pay artists more, which means that things can happen at a faster pace!\u003cbr\u003e"
