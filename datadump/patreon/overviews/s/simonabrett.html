    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough the interwoven quagmire of interconnections and the interwingulous you appear to have found your way to my humble little busking area of the web. I say interconnected because I seem to meander between the worlds of illustration, design, scifi, radio, music and just talking to people. \u00a0It always surprises me (I know that it shouldn\u0027t) how incredibly intertwined some of those things are. \u00a0You may have wandered here via my work in any of those channels, possibly not even realising how thinly I obviously spread myself sometimes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you\u0027ll see by the introductory description at the top of the page, I am, foremost, an illustrator. My regular Doctor Who artwork appears in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.starburstmagazine.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStarburst Magazine\u003c/a\u003e. My written work has been lucky enough to be found in various anthologies including\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23382352-seasons-of-war\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSeasons Of War\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://obversebooks.co.uk/product/a-clockwork-iris/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIris Wildthyme: A Clockwork Iris\u003c/a\u003e. I also have background as a designer and musician which could well creep into proceedings and I\u0027ve also presented a good few radio shows in my time, links to which will probably make their way onto my timeline.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe stark (but hopefully charming) reality...or \"Why I\u0027m here\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuffice to say, the vast majority of my work is completed for love alone (Usually with a charitable goal) and therefore I spend a LOT of time completing projects with little financial gain. I\u0027d really like to carry on doing that. I\u0027d really like to make lots of money doing that too, but these things don\u0027t always fall into place - and besides, these charity things have a habit of making a rather positive impact on this Godawful world. SO, being perfectly honest, I\u0027d really appreciate your help in keeping the ball rolling so that I can invest more time in doing the stuff I\u0027m actually pretty good at (So I\u0027m told).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBonus Beats\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a very nice side-effect to being given funded in this way. It means that I can (guilt free) spend some time creating things that otherwise may have demanded an extra slice of justification. I can create pieces of artwork which (Takes a sharp breath) have no other end function other than to just *be*. Portraits, character pieces from other franchises or genres - and these will only be viewable by patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePositively Patronising\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point in time, I\u0027m keeping things quite simple. I tend to keep myself very busy alongside a day job and family, so if you\u0027d like a little insight into what I do, some advance warning of forthcoming work or just to throw me a dollar for a cup of tea it would be very much appreciated. I\u0027d really love to offer some higher tiers and maybe one day when I have more time I will. But for now, I\u0027m just grateful for any positive nod towards what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour time\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re reading this, you\u0027ve obviously given me the gift of your time and that\u0027s a wonderful thing. Should you take the plunge to throw me some coinage then that is another thing again - thank you."

     "about": "I\u0027m Simon Brett. Or should I say, Simon *A* Brett - I\u0027ve recently found the need to distinguish myself from a certain other Mr Simon Brett who does very well thank-you-very-much as a well respected crime author. Far be it for me to take credit for his abilities (And he\u0027s hardly likely to feel the need to do the same in return) but still, you never know where confusion may set in. Especially on a Monday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWaffling aside, I am an illustrator/writer/designer/musician/general creative from Exeter, UK. I spend as much of my time as possible being, er, creative and as such, that time is limited by how much *other* time I have to spend doing other things with which to help feed my family (I have a hard-working wife doing the same) and that isn\u0027t quite the same. I\u0027d rather be spending time using whatever gifts it seems I\u0027ve had the good fortune to be born with and hearing from people who enjoy and appreciate them. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, it\u0027s very nice that you\u0027re here having a look. Secondly, it\u0027s even *nicer* that you might consider contributing in whatever size gift befits your enthusiasm to help enable me to be creative at a far greater speed and scale.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll notice that a large proportion of my work is based around the worlds of Doctor Who. This is mainly because I illustrate for Starburst Magazine on a monthly basis; as well as contribute to their successful Blue Box Podcast. It helps that I love the programme with a passion and have therefore written for a number of publications both on a fictional and essay-like basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with Doctor Who, I count Star Wars, superheroes, electronic music and many other things as being vital to my being. I would hope that you might see hints of some of these things cropping up along the way as I post to this page. Creative outpourings will, in general, be illustrations - but there might also be podcasts, writing, pieces of music, events, books and even appearances on radio shows. These have all happened before and could well happen again!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, thank you (Especially if you\u0027ve got this far through my introduction) - I hope we can be friends, or at least assert some kind of mutually beneficial arrangement. It\u0027s all good. :)",
