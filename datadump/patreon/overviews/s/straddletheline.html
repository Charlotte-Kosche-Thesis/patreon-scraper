The second, and preferred, method is to \u003cstrong\u003ebecome a Patreon supporter right through this site!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way Patreon works is a reader can donate whatever they want per month and the donation is recurring each month after that. So anything, from \u003cstrong\u003e$3/month\u003c/strong\u003e up, is hugely helpful to the cause.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027ll Use the Money For\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy initial goal is \u003cstrong\u003e$500/ month\u003c/strong\u003e. That money will be enough to keep STL going, indefinitely. Here are Straddle The Line\u0027s costs:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmail Provider.\u003c/strong\u003e I use ConvertKit for my weekly newsletter, Fired up Friday, and to email posts out to the subscription list. This fee grows as the email list grows.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHosting. \u003c/strong\u003eI use BlueHost to host all of my web content including articles, videos, and pictures.\u00a0 This host also do maintenance on the backend that is way above my head.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWebsite development.\u003c/strong\u003e It\u0027s a website, so there are always glitches coming out of nowhere and occasionally, I\u00a0add a new site feature. I have no programming skills, so I rely on Wordpress and occasionally hire help off Fiverr.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdvertising/ Pinterest \u0026amp; Facebook\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eposting. \u003c/strong\u003eAs of now I have halted all proactive advertising until I can afford to turn the switch back on again.\u00a0 In the past I have done paid advertising on Pinterest and Facebook.\u00a0 I would like to reactivate this side of the blog to help it grow.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThat\u0027s the basics.
