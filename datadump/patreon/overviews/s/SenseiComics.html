    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello friends! My name is Edmund Ray Dantes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am the creator of Sensei Comics. For as long as I can remember art has been in my veins. At an early age I was inspired by watching heroes on TV shows, in comics and in movies doing things I never could. I created my first original character when I was about 12 years old and I never let go of those thoughts. Throughout the years I expanded on that character and then ultimately created an entire universe of similar characters all living out their own lives with their own problems and stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe years have passed but I\u0027ve never felt more strongly that now is the time to share that universe with all of you. My goal will be to release multiple stories from within my universe while primarily focusing on one main storyline in the beginning. Each story takes place in the same world, but with different characters living out their day to day lives on their own, independent of the others while occasionally interacting with them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe idea is that perhaps you\u0027ll find a story or a character that you can relate to who will live on as a part of who you are. That is how I personally feel with my characters and stories and what I\u0027d like to share with the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope my works reach you soon!\u003c/strong\u003e"
