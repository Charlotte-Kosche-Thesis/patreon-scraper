During which, my life was saved by a colossal idiot called ZF\u00a0Cyanide. He flew me, by helicopter, into the northern forests to give me a blood bag and a rifle. I didn\u0027t know it at the time, but his original plan was to molest me, shoot me, then steal my stuff. But I successfully charmed him with my silky, smooth British accent and I was introduced to the rest of the Zero Fucks clan.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe original purpose of the Youtube videos were as a recruitment tool for both clan and DayZ server. And just general fun. But it turns out they\u0027re actually quite fun to make. So even after we\u0027d moved on from the dayz server, I continued to make compilations of the various moments of silly that happen as the ZF clan play\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn February 2016, thanks to your generosity, I realized I\u0027d be able to take a stab at doing this full time. So I now work 8 hours a day on Youtube editing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo any donations through Patreon keep me alive; pay my rent and buy me food \u0026amp; water (which I converted into Youtube videos and excrement in a 3/1 ratio). \u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0I can quite comfortably live on what I have now though\u003c/strong\u003e, and I\u0027m not greedy, so please only donate if you enjoy my work and simply feel like tipping me to show appreciation.
