Right now, I focus largely on fan art, but I would someday be able to create my own story and manga. I do commissions, however time is tight, and so are supplies, so I have not been able to rely on these for any sort of balance, thus far.\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in my portfolio, it can be found\u003cstrong\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://studioozkai.blogspot.com/p/my-portfolio.html\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e! You can see my works, as well as notes about each one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will definitely be a work in progress, for now, so I don\u0027t expect much from the offset, but as I learn the ins-and-outs here, I will be setting up proper goals, worthwhile rewards, and - most importantly - consistent quality content! I hope you\u0027ll stay with me as I go through this growing process!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, at worst, I\u0027m aiming for monthly content for you all, with frequent updates on pieces as I go. I still am pondering ways to balance things to make exclusive to my fellow backers while not excluding those unable to do so, so please hold tight until I have the nuts and bolts worked out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, starting early 2018, I\u0027m looking to finally hit the midwest convention scene, starting with \u003cstrong\u003eAnime Crossroads\u003c/strong\u003e in Indianapolis, IN in February (Exact dates TBD). I will definitely say safeguarding this possibility is my immediate priority, so I can finally meet some of my followers personally! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I\u0027m going to be doing a homebrew print service, as I have tried various online ones in the past and have been unsatisfied with both prices and quality, both of which is something I wish to address. This will be side by side with my above goal, as this will also give me better product to sell at said conventions! A mailing service for those unable to attend or just don\u0027t want to wait for an event is also in the works!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll update all this as I go, so without further ado, thank you for taking the time to read this wall, and \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eespecially\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e for supporting me! I hope not to let you down!\u003cbr\u003e"
