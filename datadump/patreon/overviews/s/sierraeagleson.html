    "summary": "I hope to create things that inspire others, like creating has inspired me. Creating is something we all have that is so different from one another, but made to give off the same emotions. Art is a beautiful thing, and how its instant affect on you is not anything technical, but emotional. With your support, I\u0027m able to continue pursuing these passions and getting better with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0From a young age, music has always been a big aspect in my life. Every emotion I\u0027d feel, every situation I was in, I\u0027d always find a song for it. It drove me to start singing and learning different instruments. In the fifth grade, I joined my school choir, and began singing. It was always something that I didn\u0027t know I\u0027d enjoy, but just something I lived with, and grew with as time went on. It became something I built day to day, until it spread out into learning instruments. Shortly after, I took piano lessons and guitar lessons, but eventually dropped them. A year later, I\u0027d pick an instrument back up and learn it by ear at my pace. Every day I either pick up a guitar or play the piano, or find myself humming along to my favorite song. Music continues to be an big aspect in my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 My Photography and Cinematography passion developed later in life, as I had a love for picture and motion picture, how a single photo or clip can convey so much emotion. And yes, I\u0027m still an amateur with these passions, but they are ones I\u0027d love to continue to grow with, like music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://sierraeagleson.vsco.co\"\u003ePhotography\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0All in all, I strive to continue to create. I strive to speak to others without having to speak really. With your support, I\u0027m able to do so. Even if you show support by listening to one of my songs, or liking one of my photos or videos, I\u0027m endlessly grateful for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Much love,\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Sierra"
