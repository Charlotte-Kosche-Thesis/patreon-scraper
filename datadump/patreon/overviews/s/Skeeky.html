    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eFor April I am adding the video for my next body shape set in Second Life. I hope you enjoy.\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have really tried to concentrate on making my way in the world with a normal job and life. Of course I still have to keep doing that but finally I have gotten to the point where, if i really do want to spread my wings on the web, my tools and equipment for doing so have become completely outdated.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I am often in a virtual world called Second Life. I am a minor designer and entertainer there. I wish to step up my game and I do have some of the tools to accomplish that goal. What i don\u0027t have is a way to get to you through half way decent You-tube and Facebook videos. I purchased an editing and screen capture software for example and it won\u0027t run on my vista computer even though it said it would work on the stats listed on the box. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I am here to ask for the help of any individuals out there that might have a reason to believe in someone like myself. \u003cbr\u003eMy health is not great after having had heart surgery. I don\u0027t feel well most of the time. I am still looking for work but with no education and no skills my options are very limited. I need a new computer with high end graphics and some software to produce decent videos and try to earn some money that way. I have a couple cheap cameras already no prob. there. My headset is good even though it was cheap and gives me good sound as well. I am learning Blender 3d in place of Maya.\u003cbr\u003eI have photoshop and it is my most valuable item but I don\u0027t own it. When this computer dies my photoshop work is finished. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 About me? Everywhere I go real life or the net people seem to love my sense if humor, my excitement for life and my fair treatment of other people. I am a fun and creative person that will produce real results with the right tools. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I offer to show receipts online how ever i can for any purchase i make and not one purchase will be for personal items including toilet paper or chocolate. Any money that comes from this is to build my tools and abilities.. then I will account for every expenditure matching it to my account here. Once that is accomplished I will go into the next phase and look for donations based on content I produce. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I want to thank you for taking the time to read this. I am no fool I realize this is a kind of begging. I don\u0027t honestly expect one person to help me in this but i have no choice but to try. But I have had others in Second Life sponsor me in small ways and now I am asking for new patrons in the real world to help me get back on my feet with my art and my love for people.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I don\u0027t have a Facebook account for this yet because some of my work if of an adult nature. I am working on making a seperate account but Facebook is not very cooperative.\u003cbr\u003e"
