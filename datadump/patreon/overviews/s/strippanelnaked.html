    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho Are You?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m Hass, and I create the videos. I\u0027ve had a lifelong love of comic books, and used to run IndieReviews back in 2006, which was a website looking at small press comics in the UK. Now I work as a video editor and cameraman in between busy bouts of reading comics! I also edit the monthly comics magazine,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://gumroad.com/panelxpanel\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ePanelxPanel.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started \u0027Strip Panel Naked\u0027 because I wanted to see more in-depth analysis on comics and comic art. The response has been amazing, and has already started fostering more discussion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also break down interesting comic pages on my Twitter\u00a0(\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/HassanOE\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e@HassanOE\u003c/a\u003e) as part of furthering that conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is \u0027Strip Panel Naked\u0027?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u0027Strip Panel Naked\u0027 is a video series analysing and breaking down comics art in detail.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://hassanoe.co.uk/spn/spn3.png\" style=\"width: 623px;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA lot of artists and writers in comics are often working with invisible tools. Controlling eyelines, reading speed, the way you understand character relationships and action. It\u0027s a very unique art form, because like cinema it\u0027s entirely visuals-based, but unlike cinema, you don\u0027t have as much direct control on your audience. You have to utilise a lot of clever tricks to get your audience to do what you want them to, without it ever really feeling forced.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://hassanoe.co.uk/spn/spn4.png\" style=\"width: 668px;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s what \u0027Strip Panel Naked\u0027 is all about. Each video is around 5-10 minutes, focusing on a particular issue and theme within that issue. That way we can really look in-depth at what and how the artist/writer/creative is doing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo I\u0027ve looked at topics such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbMj9f0mcBA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeclan Shalvey Creating a Good Action Comic\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqbPRTi8SN8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDavid Aja\u0027s Panel Density\u003c/a\u003e, and how\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErwykjaeyXE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eChris Samnee Controls Movement\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few times a week I also do breakdowns of interesting comic pages I\u0027ve noticed. These are found on twitter (\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/HassanOE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@HassanOE\u003c/a\u003e) but archived on this page, too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u0027t have ads on my videos, and I don\u0027t really like the idea of creating a paywall to stop people viewing them. What I\u0027m offering instead is additional content for subscribers. There\u0027s a chunk of research that goes into each video, and a lot of other notes and information I end up having to cut for time.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also get a lot of suggestions from viewers about future content, and all those notes, reading lists and research will be made available - so we can, as a community, keep the discussion going.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://hassanoe.co.uk/spn/spn5.png\" style=\"width: 669px;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhen Do You Release Content?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eAt the moment I\u0027m releasing one video a week, each Saturday. It may mean, with the extra Patreon rewards, I take a little longer in the coming months though, and work on a 10-day or fortnightly schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the twitter page breakdowns, that occurs a few times a week - and usually on Wednesday there\u0027s a bunch from that weeks new releases.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow Do We Help?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThis started because I wanted to have these kind of discussions about comic art with other people. I want to help showcase these great things that artists and writers are doing in books, and have an open discussion about understanding the medium. Hopefully, together, we can help people move from enjoying an issue of a comic, to really understanding why they did.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnything you can donate, whatever amount, goes into allowing more time to make these videos. From research, to editing, to creating the additional content. I really want \u0027Strip Panel Naked\u0027 to help foster conversation about the medium, and help myself and others get a deeper understanding of it all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCheers!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
