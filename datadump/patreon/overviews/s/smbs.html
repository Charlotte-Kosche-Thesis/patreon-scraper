We also include show notes on our website with all the links to the stories we cover during that episode. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEach show takes approximately 4 hours to hunt for the news, write up the stories, record the episode, and edit things together. Jim and Bryan wouldn\u0027t trade this gig for the world, but any support you can give us will make a major difference. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe hate ads, so we\u0027ve worked hard to keep the show sponsor free. That means we shoulder all fees related to hosting, equipment, software, and more. By pledging to our show, you\u0027ll help us cover both the costs of fronting each episode and for the time we put into it.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nJim and Bryan release an episode every Wednesday morning. Each episode will count as a Patreon paid event. Any extra bonus shows we do will be completely free.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe have one of the most engaged fan bases in the self-publishing podcast world. It\u0027s incredible, and if you pledge, we\u0027ll forge an even deeper connection with you incredible patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support! \u003cstrong\u003eGo click on the funding levels below to get started\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e"
