    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWelcome!\u003c/h3\u003eI seriously never thought it would come to this. I mean, not the writing, I expected to write myself into an early grave. But to be paid for it? That simply...astounds me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a writer and actor by demeanor, which means I was more than likely to spend a great deal of time on an empty stomach. But at the recommendation of my friends and fans...I\u0027ve set up a patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGetting paid for writing?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo...that can\u0027t be...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can never thank my patrons and my good friends enough for their incredible support. I mean it in every way when I say that I would not be here without you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMonthly Story\u003c/h3\u003eAs determined by the Penne tier and up, I\u0027ll be writing and releasing an exclusive fic for patrons, just as if it had been commissioned. The story will be about 3-6 thousand words long, and will follow the most popular suggestion of that month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll suggestions must follow commission rules, as detailed below.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCommissions\u003c/h3\u003eI do one-shot commissions at a price of 5 cents per 3 words, which is a ballpark estimate of $16 for each 1k words. There are, however, a few rules:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRWBY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t write romance between any of the women in RWBY. Or between Jaune and Ren. Sorry, the issue has a lot to do with obnoxious fans in the past, and the characters are all too near and dear to my heart. However, if you like, I can recommend other writers or artists who are willing to create content for the romantic pairings you\u0027re looking for.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, I can write friendship or platonic stories between just about any character in RWBY, save villains, which will be handled on a case-by-case basis because, as you know, they are somewhat villainous.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor romance, Jaune with just about any woman in Remnant is fair game, save Renora. Because, well, Renora is gospel. If you have any questions about what I am or am not comfortable with, PM me, and we\u0027ll talk it over. I like to think I\u0027m pretty reasonable, and as long as you aren\u0027t antagonistic about it, I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll get on fine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOverwatch and Others\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything and everything is on the table. Romance, friendship, yaoi, yuri, straight, SFW or otherwise. Pitch your story idea, I\u0027ll ask for some clarification, and then we\u0027ll make it happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eNSFW\u003c/h3\u003eI do, on occasion, write erotic literature. Whenever I do, it will be clearly marked as such, with big, bold, obnoxious warning labels, so if you stumble on it, it\u0027s really you\u0027re own fault. NSFW commission prices are the same as the normal prices, however, there are some rules here as well. The relationship restrictions follow the same as above, and there are certain kinks I\u0027m unwilling to touch, which you can PM me about."
