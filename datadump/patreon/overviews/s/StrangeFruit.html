We talk about politics and pop culture, with a focus on race, gender and LGBTQ issues (especially where they intersect!), and we\u0027ve been in production since September, 2012. Our hosts are Jaison Gardner and Dr. Kaila Story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach episode opens with what we call our Juicy Fruit segment, where we talk about what\u0027s been in the news or on social media that week. Jai keeps up with current events, and Doc gives us some more academic analysis of the systemic things at play behind the stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter Juicy Fruit, we typically do a feature interview where we speak with an artist, an activist, an educator, or someone else whose work we want to learn more about. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn late 2014, we celebrated our 100th episode. With your support, we will keep producing insightful, important, and irreverent content, and amplifying unheard voices. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat our Fruitcakes say:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"This is a great local show that is funny, witty, and tackles tough social issues. Check it out!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Y\u0027all couldn\u0027t hear me but I was screaming \u0027Yes Gawd!\u0027 all through this episode because you were bringing the truth to the light.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I always feel like Jaison Gardner and Kaila Story are in the room with me! Love that show!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Take a listen! My favorite Doctress and Social Justice Socialite have been doing their thing this week (as usual) with their show Strange Fruit!\u00a0Keep up the great work Jaison and Kaila!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"You guys rock and your podcast is awesome! Every show is on something interesting and new and it makes me think about the world around me.\"\u003cbr\u003e"
