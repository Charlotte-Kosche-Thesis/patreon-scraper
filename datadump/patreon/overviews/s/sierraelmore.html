I\u0027m Sierra Elmore, a young adult contemporary and thriller writer. I\u0027m a YoungArts alumni and focus on writing \"unlikeable\" girls who wreak havoc while fighting trauma. My stories are focused on social issues, and always include Black, queer, and mentally ill characters. That\u0027s because I\u0027m Black, bisexual, and have a heck of a lot of mental illnesses. I\u0027m also a college student studying sociology, creative writing, and gender/sexuality. I\u0027ve blogged for my school\u0027s student perspectives blog as well as their study abroad blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also a strong contributor to the young adult book community.\u00a0I edit the\nYA Pride Teen Voices column, participated in the #Ch1Con Yule Ball video Q\u0026amp;A event,\u00a0curated a book list for Queer Books\nfor Teens, and created the Diverse Book Bridge Project to benefit underrepresented teens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe point of this bio is to say: writing is my life. But at this point, it hasn\u0027t made me a living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor a while now, I\u0027ve wanted to create a space where I can share my writing with people in a lower-stakes environment. I\u0027m working toward traditional publishing but, as we know, that takes a very long time, and there\u0027s never a guarantee of publishing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see Patreon as an equal trade between the artist and creator. Though I have options for one-time donations and an Amazon wishlist (links below), I prefer to take this route because now, I can offer access to works and my process in exchange for patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do I specifically need a patreon? Loans, debt, and mental illness. Since I\u0027m in school, I work non-traditional jobs, including freelance. Unfortunately, my depression flare-ups are frequent, and can lead to decreased freelance earnings. This affects my ability to pay off debts and achieve the financial freedom I need. But creating? Creating keeps me thriving which, in turn, keeps me alive and healthy. I\u0027m working two jobs right now, one of which zaps a LOT of my time and energy. Meanwhile, writing brings me happiness. Though it\u0027s stressful, it\u0027s the good kind of stress. The stress is of a new challenge!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eWhether you become a patron, share this Patreon, or have just scrolled to the bottom of this page, I thank you for taking time out of your day to learn about my creative journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to support me but are unable to become a monthly contributor, I understand (believe me, I understand)!
