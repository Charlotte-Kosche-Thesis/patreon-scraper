    "summary": "Hopefully if you\u0027ve stumbled across me and found this site, then you know I -REALLY- want to make comic books and graphic novels. I am currently employed by -*BLEEP*- as a mechanic and as much as I love working on cars, I hate working on them for other people. It sucks... however, I love telling people stories with pictures.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf I could, I would just draw this stuff for a living... but I work for -*BLEEP*- and I\u0027d rather not ... this is my toes in the water and I really want to make my work even better for those awesome enough to stare at anything I create.\u003cbr\u003eI DON\u0027T WANT YOUR MONEY....   THEY WANT IT...\u003cbr\u003eBlame shift... I cant make things fast enough if I\u0027m fixing Aunt Sally\u0027s busted 03 VW Beetle for 11 hours of my day. In order for me to get this stuff out faster with better quality, this project will need my full attention and I will need to take your money to give to the real people who want it... THE BILL COMPANIES... people gotta eat. AND I WANT TO DRAW!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRisks and challenges\u003c/h3\u003eI honestly don\u0027t know how much I will need to fully kick my full-time mechanic job to the side. However I want to do everything in my power to make it at least a part-time job. This is just a start to get the ball rolling. The only way I will know this will become an avalanche is if I roll that snowball down a really big mountain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThis is how it works: In no way will I profit for this. Half of every purchased comic is strictly paying for just the printing costs of the physical copies and the remaining half will go towards the production materials and time (off mechanic work) for the next issue. The more money that comes in, the sooner the comic will be available digitally and ready for print. Think about it. The more money that comes in for production of the comic, the less I have to work at -*BLEEPWAGEN*- ALSO, the happier me and entertained you. \"Its help in a can, baby!\" Yes, I just made that up, and no you may not trademark that phrase... Its mine now. In order to bring you guys awesome stories weekly or hell, maybe in time daily, we\u0027d have to make some scratch from our art here and there. Something to help keep the stories flowing without delay. Nothing crazy. think of it as a tip jar.\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me, you will gain access to tutorials, demo videos, even full PSD files with layer by layer examples of my processes. And quite possibly, full resolution scans of sketches, and commission based work! So pretty much the more you pay, the more quality, exclusive content you will receive. These will include personalized sketches, or commissions based on the rules that I have set in my goals/milestones. Patrons who pledge the amount required will even receive a personal copy of each book they support!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn this link here, you can read\u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://upstreamcomics.com\"\u003eZOMBIE WORK SHOP WEBCOMIC\u003c/a\u003e  on our website.\u003cbr\u003eCheck my INSTAGRAM out \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/skoddii/\"\u003eif youre a new skag on this ship\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eor come on over to FACEBOOK\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SKODDIINK\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eand tell us what you think!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSwing by our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqU5YdpCmFImu4yZL99-ZYg\"\u003eYOUTUBE\u003c/a\u003e and subscribe, then leave a comment on how you think we are doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact you\u0027ve already given us the best tip there is, your time.
