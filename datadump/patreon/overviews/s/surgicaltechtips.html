I love my job and what I do SO MUCH I decided to start creating content for the \u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/scf8898\"\u003eSurgical Tech Tips\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eYouTube channel. I started creating this content in hopes that I could reach out to other medical professional\u0027s in the US that may need help in understanding some processes, but instead I have gotten a wonderful following of people from around the WORLD interested in the operating room. Doctors, patients, nurses, techs, and students alike the reach has gone far on these videos, and the support I read through daily amazes me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON\u003c/strong\u003e?\u003cbr\u003eI have been searching the internet trying to find a way I could support this content creation I do. YouTube being the main source of that financial support in the video creation process, it almost doesn\u0027t justify the many hours put in to creating these videos. One of the MAIN reasons I create this content is for YOU, the\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/scf8898\"\u003eSurgical Tech Tips\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003efamily. Your comments and love for the channel have helped me keep going! Patreon is now just a way for some of my most devout fans of the YouTube channel to help show their support even more. In helping me drive this channel and it\u0027s content into the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE FUTURE\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have a TON of plans for this channel. Video ideas going into the future I would like to actually visit the plants where they create some of our surgical instrumentation, showing you all the processes of how the things we use in the OR everyday are made and sterilized in massive quantities. I want to be able to highlight, interview, and cover stand-out techs and medical professionals for their work they do in their home towns. I want to be able to visit schools and talk about the profession with the young men and women of our world. I have SO MANY ways I would like to take this brand and knowledge, and I want to take you all with me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE\u0027S IT GOING?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhere is your money going? By supporting the channel, you will be supporting the creative process of all of these videos directly. I have already invested thousands into my own camera and computer equipment, but eventually I would like to upgrade the equipment that I have to something that is more professional. I would like to be able to take trips to interview with surgical companies, businesses, foundations, and medical professionals to tell their stories!\u00a0If you have ever found that the content I make for free on YouTube has helped you in any way and you would like to really help drive this content further into something MUCH MUCH bigger, please think of supporting."
