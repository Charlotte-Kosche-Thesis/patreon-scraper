These videos take a lot of time to make and youtube ad revenue tends to be all over the place so that is why this Patreon exists. Becoming a Patron is a great way to help keep me full time along with getting to know me and my community personally! Not only does pledging guarantee more content, but its also a great way to directly effect videos, win prizes, get special sneak peeks and make friends and memories. So slam that pledge button and welcome to the Buns Brigade!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

As most of you know, I\u2019m an aspiring\u00a0youtuber that mainly focuses on creating comedy basic beginners guides for people who don\u2019t know crap about certain video games. Now, I\u2019ve been doing this Youtube thing for about a year now and the channel has grown drastically. However the amount of time it takes to make quality videos, while juggling work and the channel, prevents me from getting out videos at a speedy rate.\u00a0So why give me money? Well, youtube doesn\u2019t exactly bring in the big bucks and with your help I can focus on making more content and eventully reaching the high and mighty \u201cFULL-TIME YOUTUBER\u201d status. Its also a great way to be a part of my videos directly and to engage ya real hardcore fans! So please, give the bun some love and I\u0027ll give some loving back!
