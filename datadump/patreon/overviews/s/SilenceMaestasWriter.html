    "summary": "Greetings! I\u0027m Silence Maestas, an author, artist, and educator enthusiastic about sharing information about contemporary polytheism, devotional paganism. and ecstatic magical practice. For years I\u0027ve stolen time away from my day jobs to work on the projects that are most meaningful to me, but the demands of holding down multiple jobs leave me with very little time to produce work for polytheists, pagans, and magicians. I\u0027m excited to work on loads of new projects for these and other vibrant communities. I hope you choose to support the production of new books, lessons, audio content, and religious items made especially for people like you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve been a professional writer for many years, producing content for editors in many different industries in addition to authoring books and articles specifically for the pagan communities. Working for other people has left me with little-to-no time to work on the projects that are most meaningful to me - and probably to you, too. Supporting me through Patreon is the very best way to speed the publication of new books, new online lessons, new in-person classes, new audio books and lectures, and new artwork that speaks directly to polytheist religious concerns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money raised through Patreon is going to help me maximize the value of my time so more of it can be spent working on the books and articles you most want to see. The more money pledged, the more time I can spend working on these projects. Supporters will be treated to exclusive looks at forthcoming books, previews of articles and lessons, free downloadable content, and even samples of new artwork. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat kind of projects will you be supporting? Here are just a few specifics:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-A follow-up volume to Walking the Heartroad (tentatively titled Further Along the Heartroad)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-A book on Santa Muerte\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-A revised and expanded 10th anniversary edition of Walking the Heartroad\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Audio book versions of Worshiping Loki, Walking the Heartroad, and all forthcoming titles\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Electronic versions of Worshiping Loki and all forthcoming titles\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Audio and video versions of my past sessions at PantheaCon, Many Gods West, and other conferences\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Essays and articles on ecstatic religious practices, altar building, personal temple design, building personal religious idols and icons, and much, much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see, I have multiple in-progress books as well as other writing projects, audio projects, and other creative efforts lined up just waiting for me to work on them. You can help by pledging even one dollar a month -- everything helps!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to give more? I\u0027ll find something great to give you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
