    "summary": "First off, let me thank you for taking the time to look into my patreon campaign! My name is Emily Petiya and Spacey Designs has been a passion of mine since College. \u003cbr\u003eThe original passion that lead to me starting Spacey Designs and studying fashion was cosplay. I always loved being able to embody another character and strive for screen accuracy in real life. One of my favoritet cosplays was Edna from Tales of Zestiria. I loved her sass and her hidden love for all her teammates. I loved making her dress and her umbrella prop especially!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/15032064_1033208436806694_5402394838604378391_n.jpg?oh=4202684ccffe53538764bda7f9c2288d\u0026amp;oe=5AF16741\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/15032064_1033208436806694_5402394838604378391_n.jpg?oh=4202684ccffe53538764bda7f9c2288d\u0026amp;oe=5AF16741\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI attended Colorado State University in Fort Collins Colorado for their Apparel Design and Production program and I ADORED studying there. I had already been sewing for many years when I went there and being given the opportunity to study something that I truly loved is something that I am always going to be grateful for.\u003cbr\u003eWhile in school I focused my efforts into studying the differences in plus size design. I have always been overweight and never been able to find clothes that looked good or felt comfortable at any size. I believe that everybody should feel stunning in their clothes no matter what size, shape, or weight they are. I now work with all sizes but still try to focus my efforts into highlighting plus sized figures as much as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/19441733_1260266284100907_2190214082263758959_o.jpg?oh=c37793380e03425029cccb5f87293015\u0026amp;oe=5AFA0F8A\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpacey Designs started as my cosplay pseudonym but it has grown for me over the years. It grew from being about me and my art to being about how clothing and costume can make a person feel. I specialize in plus size design and costume (but also create clothing for straight sizes) because so often plus size individuals don\u0027t feel at home in their own clothing and especially in cosplay. There are so many more intricacies to working with plus sizes and I want to highlight those intricacies and make them shine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13592224_1073131356112961_439370005055924644_n.jpg?oh=3567bd33a89ebae4402ea7ab9c505987\u0026amp;oe=5AF15465\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out my support tiers to see how you can help me thrive and get some behind the scenes goodies for yourself. =) There are all sorts of things over there that help me get what I need to be successful and help keep you involved in my process.You can support me and become one of my Space Cadets for as low as $1!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso make sure you check out my Etsy shop!\u003cbr\u003ewww.etsy.com/shop/SpaceyCosplay\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
