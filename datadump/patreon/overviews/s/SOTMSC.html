    "summary": "Shakespeare In Hospitals, is a project that is exactly what it sounds like.  For the last five years we create new shows, using Shakespeare\u2019s words, designed specifically to bring to patients in hospitals across the GTA, like Mount Sinai, Sunnybrooke and CAMH and more.   \nBut why do we do this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u201c\u2026A man was lying in a bed, looking like he had been through a lot, with a woman about his age \u2013 maybe his sister or his wife- sitting next to him and holding his hand\u2026.When we were done, I looked over, and he was sitting up\u2026 and he was smiling. And as I often found, the person in the room with him seemed to have brightened just as much. It\u2019s often to the companions of the patients that I feel like we\u2019re giving the biggest gift\u2026.to be able to do something for the person they love, however small, when they feel like there\u2019s nothing that they can do.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u2014 Emma Burns, SIH alumn\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe best part of this? It comes at no extra cost to the hospitals or patients. That\u0027s right, we perform in cafeterias, private rooms and common areas \u003cstrong\u003eABSOLUTELY FREE.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis year, we\u0027re focusing on \"a common language\". We\u0027ll be looking to make our show even more accessible by incorporating different languages in our repertoire, in an effort to find a way that Shakespeare can be enjoyed by all. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u201cThe most unexpected thing that has happened has got to be.\u2026 [We] approached a patient\u0027s room and were told she didn\u0027t speak English but was very interested in seeing a performance\u2026..this tiny, frail woman erupted into the most joyful laugh which continued for the entire [performance]. Her face was transformed- it was the most beautiful reaction to any piece of theatre I\u0027ve ever seen.\u201d \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u2014 Natasha Ramondino, SIH alumn\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe love doing what we do, but we can\u2019t do it alone. Every donation helps us bring some excitement (and hopefully some laughter!) to a patients day in the hospital. And we\u2019ve come up with some pretty exciting gifts to show you just how much every donation matters.
