Here, we ask ourselves three simple things: \u003cem\u003eWhat is it, why do we hate it, and how do we fix it?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginally, this started out as a simple review channel, if only for the sake of me finding an outlet to talk about video games. However, over the course of making videos, learning new editing skills, and meeting a bunch of other content creators, the focus has shifted away from reviews and steered in the direction of critical analysis. As things are right now, I try to produce content at a relatively decent rate, ranging from 20-minute-long video game breakdowns, to 5-minute-long studies on specific game elements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNonetheless, I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy making content. More than that, I enjoy breaking down video games, and talking about the different aspects that make them tick. The support that I\u0027ve seen from completely random strangers regarding my videos has been humbling, and more than anything, inspiring. However, as much as I\u0027d like to continue producing content for you guys to enjoy, there\u0027s only so much I can do with the way things are now. Between having a day job for the sake of basic necessities, and having to attend and pay for college classes, my time and money is extremely limited. As such, no matter how much I\u0027d like to fully dedicate myself to content creation, I can\u0027t go at it 100% unless I either leave school or quit my job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you guys comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made this Patreon page at the request of some fans, and honestly, I was against it at first. I didn\u0027t like the idea of people parting with their hard-earned money to pay me for something I already do for fun. However, between my growing love for these videos, and the massive outpour of love from the fans, I\u0027ve realized that if you guys even so much as CONSIDER becoming a patron, it would be because you made a conscious decision to support my content. If you guys choose to become a patron, it would be because you BELIEVE in me, because you BELIEVE in what I\u0027m doing. And it would be my utmost honor to not let you guys down, and keep making the videos you love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever you decide to do, thank you for even checking out my Patreon page. No matter what comes from this, every single one of you has had a profound impact on me through all your likes and comments. Patron or not, the videos will continue, just like they always have. And with that, this is Super Games Buster, and I\u0027ll see you guys later!\u003cbr\u003e"
