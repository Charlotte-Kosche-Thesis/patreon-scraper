    "summary": "Like many of my fellow screenwriters, I want to ensure a future where we can promote our work for free and filmmakers don\u0027t have to be part of an elite club to view it.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.scriptrevolution.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eScript Revolution\u003c/a\u003e is our chance to make that happen and I can\u0027t thank you enough for your consideration in supporting this movement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow many screenwriting competitions, directories, and evaluation services are we going to be expected to pay into for a fleeting chance to be read? How many low income, financially vulnerable creatives are going to fall below the cut-off line where they stand no hope of being able to share their work with the World? This may sound somewhat overly dramatic but it\u0027s the way things are headed for us and generations that will follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScript Revolution is the light at the end of the tunnel. I built this platform with a simple mantra - \u003cem\u003e\"Always free \u0026amp; always fair\"\u003c/em\u003e. No cost \u0026amp; no elitism. An ethos all about discovery rather than promotion. Random listings so there\u2019s nobody paying their way to the top, soliciting votes, or using any tricks to get ahead of others. Plus, credit where credit is due with a true do no harm favourites system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides indexing an entire writer\u0027s portfolio at zero cost, Script Revolution is the only script database correlating scripts with their respective awards. The only script database where individuals can\u0027t have their work down voted or sandbagged. That\u0027s why it\u0027s growing fast and I\u0027ve been working hard to deliver new features on a monthly basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s time to step up a gear and I know many of you want to be a part of that. You want Script Revolution to be more secure, to gain exposure, and become the sophisticated platform the industry deserves. You also know there\u0027s only so far one man can take it with limited programming skills, a finite amount of time, and little in the way of resources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a great way to get involved. A low but regular commitment that makes a huge difference and might just lead to the revolution we need."

     "about": "Having started writing in 2012 and with over 20 script options in 5 countries, I now collaborate with filmmakers all over the world. Three things motivate me; ambitious teamwork, strong friendships, and a drive for equality. If you share these values, I\u0027d love to join forces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing, which has been spotlit by Amazon Studios, The Blacklist, Simply Scripts, and Shootin\u0027 The Shorts, has a down and dirty tone and often features strong female leads. If that appeals, then you can read my scripts right now by using the menu at the top of the page. Please note, I also offer my short scripts for free to help support up and coming talent. Feel free to reach out and connect with me on any platform, and be sure to check out my guest blogs on Stage 32.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016, I started a script hosting website called Script Revolution, offering most of the benefits of sites such as the Blacklist and Inktip but with none of the costs. The site is now the fastest growing script database on the net with an average of 100 scripts uploaded by writers and 200 scripts downloaded by readers per month on average.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m based on the UK, very open minded, and I\u0027m all about the love. It doesn\u0027t matter to me if it\u0027s Tarantino or Twilight, I always try to look for the good in everything. When I\u0027m not writing, I like cooking for my girlfriend, working on cars, and gardening. We house share with two cats called Cookie and Java, the former of which has ironically become a diabetic while the latter goes by the internet moniker Thriller Kitty.\u003cbr\u003e",
