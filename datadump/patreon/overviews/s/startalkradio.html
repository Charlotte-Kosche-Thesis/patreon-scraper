An idea that we could blend Science, Comedy, and Pop Culture and deliver\nit to the public in a commercially viable way. We did not want to be bound to\nthe Public Radio model, in which funds must be raised seasonally to operate.\nBut we learned quickly that our show concept was so different from anything\nelse in the marketplace that no sponsors were interested. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProceeding with the courage of our vision, we applied for a\ngrant from the National Science Foundation to test the concept. They approved a\nmulti-year grant that fades to zero as our commercial support rose. After some\nfollow-up \"bridge\" support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, we\nfinally broke even in 2014. Today, StarTalk supports a free-lance staff of a\ndozen people, and we routinely break the top 20 of all podcasts downloaded from\niTunes. In fact the first week of March 2015, we were Number 1. (Yes, that was\na \"Holy Shit!\" moment for us all.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we learned along the way is that the marketplace of\nsponsors is risk-averse. No surprise, in retrospect. But we still have creative\nideas on how to grow our reach further -- on different platforms, with\ndifferent demographics, in different media, using variations of our show model,\nand so forth. In nearly all those untested pathways, no sponsor awaits us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we create this page, humbly asking your support of our\nongoing experiments in bringing the Universe down to Earth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRespectfully Submitted\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson, Astrophysicist\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u0026amp; co-creator of StarTalk Radio\u003cbr\u003e"

Time and place TBD, as is the wine and guest list. To keep this reward exclusive and intimate, if we have too many Patrons at this level, we\u0027ll hold more than one event. Plus, all the rewards above.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn order to be eligible for this unique opportunity, you\u2019ll need to be an active $500 Patron for a full year. But if you haven\u2019t been a Patron that long, never fear: you can pledge the missing amount as a one time pledge, and reduce your pledge back to $500 the following month. (For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019ve been a Patron for 3 months. Pledge $4500 for the next month, and you\u2019re eligible, and then reduce your monthly pledge to $500 the following month and start getting ready for next year\u2019s event!)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
