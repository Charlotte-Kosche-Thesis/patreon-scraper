He currently hosts two other podcasts besides Screen Fix. He worked in tv and film production in the early 2000s. He is also writer and filmmaker. \u003cbr\u003eGreg is a former actor and a current impressionist comedian. He is also an avid writer. \u003cbr\u003eKaity is the lady one. But really she had guested on various sports podcasts and it became apparent she needed a vehicle for her big personality and second love - movies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019d love to keep the show going with some patrons as well as collect enough to open a one-screen indie theater in St Pete, FL where we can host the podcast and film events.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

And it\u2019s our dream to open a one-screen independent theater to serve as a podcasting base and a place to show indie and classic films. We\u2019d like to do even more with film, like ukulele bands play all the music over a film or have comedians come in an razz the worst films in cinema. We want you to be able to get your Screen fix on your podcast app AND in person. Anyone who donates more than $100 will get a lifetime pass to see a free film a year for the life of the theater. Thank you so much!\u00a0",
