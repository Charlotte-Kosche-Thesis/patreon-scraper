    "summary": "I\u0027ve been creating QUANTUM VIBE, a slightly-mad science-fiction web-comic, since January 2011. I love writing and drawing this 5-day-per-week comic, but it\u0027s a full-time commitment and to keep it going I\u0027m going to need more help keeping the lights on, the rent paid, and maintaining my tools. This is where you, my readers, come in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know you\u0027re out there, Google and Project Wonderful tell me so. However, most of my advertising income goes right back into paying for promoting the strip elsewhere, and book sales are good but not enough yet. So, I\u0027ve turned to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows fans to easily donate a small amount of money on a monthly basis, and if there are enough of you donating, I won\u0027t have to abandon the strip or cut its frequency way back while I do other work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I understand people like to have incentives to donate so I\u0027ve come up with a few that should encourage readers to help out. Incentives are listed below, and cumulative milestones (total donations per month) are listed in the side-bar on the left.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
