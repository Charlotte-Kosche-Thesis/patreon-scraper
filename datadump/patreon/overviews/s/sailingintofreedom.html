Even if you don\u0027t become a Patron from here, you are still interested in the blog and that is what keeps it going. \u00a0Good on ya mate!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you haven\u0027t already seen an episode, the blog is about my sailing life, the people I meet and take on as crew, the dramas we go through and the places we see. I don\u0027t make life too easy on the boat for myself and the crew. I buy little and eat very simple food. I try to hunt and gather where I can and there is always a food challenge on. KISS - keep it simple sailor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to expand our videos and give you more content. With your help we can really take Sailing into Freedom to the next level, but, as you have probably seen on the youtube videos, I lost my Catamaran Long Reef and now I am in a bit of a trouble trying to get a 41 year old boat seaworthy to continue on with the dream.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar counts and a pledge as little as a dollar will help to keep the dream alive and reward you with\nexclusive behind the scenes. By joining the crew you will have access to\nPatrons feed with news, travel plans, pictures and bonus videos. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAs part\nof the crew, we share more with you, you get more rewards. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also support\nthe blog by:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaking one time\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/Plukky\" target=\"_blank\"\u003econtribution\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eSubscribing at \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/sailingintofreedom\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/sailingintofreedom\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out our website to read more about the blog and the boat: \u003ca href=\"http://www.sailingintofreedom.com/\"\u003ewww.sailingintofreedom.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust know that whatever you provide will help keep the videos coming to you so that occasionally you can forget about the world for a while and perhaps smile and wonder.
