    "summary": "Hi! You can call me SoulGook. Or Jason. Or that guy with the Vietnamese instruments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor over fifteen years, I have been studying a Vietnamese instrument called \"\u0111\u00e0n b\u1ea7u\" that has only one string, learning the repertoire of many traditional Vietnamese musical genres like \"quan h\u1ecd\" folk songs and \"c\u1ea3i l\u01b0\u01a1ng\" opera.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I also grew up listening to the pop music of two worlds: (1) my parents\u0027 favorite Vietnamese pop songs and (2) American hip-hop and R\u0026amp;B,\u00a0the music of my youth. All these different sounds come together in my music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Music\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince February 2016, I have been releasing 1-3 videos a month to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/SoulGook\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy YouTube channel as SoulGook\u003c/a\u003e, primarily\u00a0in a series called \"\u0110\u00e0n B\u1ea7u Remix.\" The songs are performed on a variety of traditional Vietnamese instruments, \u00a0always including the rare one-string traditional \"\u0111\u00e0n b\u1ea7u,\" and they feature everything from covers of classic R\u0026amp;B like Brandy \u0026amp; Monica\u0027s \"The Boy is Mine\" as well as pop-inflected reinventions of songs familiar to Vietnamese audiences, like Anh B\u1eb1ng\u0027s \"Chuy\u1ec7n Hoa Sim.\" The channel also includes occasional recordings of \"traditional music\" as well as videos about related topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve set up this Patreon for people who want to show support for my music and for the idea that we can create connections between cultural elements across genres and cultures, from Vietnamese to American, traditional to modern, or Kanye West to Taylor Swift.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople have often told me that it is great I\u0027m \"preserving traditional music\" or \"spreading Vietnamese culture to the younger generation,\" and I\u0027m glad to do my part in those endeavors. However, these are tasks that require time, energy, and financial resources, and it is virtually impossible as an artist to do it all alone. That\u0027s why I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon, I want to create a sustainable way to make my music. That means having time to both research/practice traditional music and arrange fun, quirky covers of pop songs. Currently each music video usually takes about 3-4 days of work. That includes composing and producing new song arrangements, recording and programming all the parts, and finally filming/editing the music videos. At minimum, I\u0027m hoping to earn enough that the videos pay for themselves. Ideally, I\u0027m hoping to eventually be able to outsource things like video production and editing to someone else so I can focus 100% on music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, I\u0027ve already poured thousands of dollars into musical instruments, recording equipment, and software, and until I win the lottery, I can\u0027t keep doing that. Financial support would help me upgrade both my studio and my filming rig (which is literally just an iPhone 5S right now), as well as let me get software like the virtual instruments used in my arrangements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love making my particular brand of genre-defying music, and I hope you enjoy listening/watching enough to become a sponsor. I have so many ideas for new remixes, and I\u0027m even in the early stages of planning an album of original music. I want to share it all with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in experimenting with me in this new model of arts patronage, consider pledging a few bucks. With your support, we can #SaveTheWildDanBau.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0110\u00e0n B\u1ea7u the Mockumentary!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust something fun we put together to celebrate the new Patreon campaign.

SoulGook) began studying the Vietnamese traditional instrument known as the \u0110\u00e0n B\u1ea7u in 2002, becoming apprenticed to a world-renowned \u0111\u00e0n b\u1ea7u master, with whom he lived and studied every summer for five years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe persona of SoulGook (a pseudonym from the days when he regularly joined freestyle rap ciphers) is his performative encapsulation of the complexities of Vietnamese American identity. It hints at the multiple expressive forms that have spoken to him throughout his life, from the raw social commentary of hip hop to the nostalgia-laden melodies of Vietnamese folk opera.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u0110\u00e0n B\u1ea7u has only a single string, but through a special playing technique involving harmonics and pitch bending, it can play any melody within a three-octave range. Trained in multiple genres of Vietnamese traditional music, SoulGook applies his knowledge of the instrument to make music that brings Vietnamese folk culture together with contemporary popular music.\u003cbr\u003e",
