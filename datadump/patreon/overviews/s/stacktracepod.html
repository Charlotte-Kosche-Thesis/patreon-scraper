A big thank you to everyone who has reached out and for helping us introducing our show to new listeners!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the beginning, we didn\u0027t want \u003cem\u003eStacktrace\u003c/em\u003e to be a typical Apple news podcast. We dive deep into the technical aspects of all the new rumors and leaks that come out of Apple. We discuss how they might affect us as developers, and provide new insights and angles on news that you may have seen or heard about elsewhere before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are now very excited to launch \u003cem\u003ethis Patreon\u003c/em\u003e! Currently, we are recording a new episode of the show every second week - but the news don\u0027t stop happening during those two weeks! We already have a huge backlog of topics we\u0027d love to discuss and share with you, but there simply isn\u0027t enough time to do it right now.\u00a0That\u0027s why we\u0027re now asking for your help and support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is not about creating paywalls or\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003emaking the show \u003cem\u003e\"exclusive\". \u003c/em\u003eEvery episode of the show will remain free and accessible to everyone, regardless if you choose to become a patron or not. We\u0027re treating this more like a crowdfunding campaign - by chipping in with a few bucks per month - you can become part of this new community that together will make the show better and more frequent \u003cem\u003efor everybody\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur main goal right now is to start doing the show weekly. By becoming a patron you can help us reach that goal. After that we\u0027ll set up new goals to continue expanding the show - to make it the best it can possibly become. We hope you\u0027ll join us on this adventure, and if you have any questions, feedback or just want to say \u003cem\u003eHi\u003c/em\u003e - you\u0027re always welcome to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://stacktracepodcast.fm\" target=\"_blank\"\u003econtact us\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks a lot, and we hope you\u0027ll want to become a\u00a0\u003cem\u003efriend of the show\u003c/em\u003e! \ud83d\ude0a\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Sundell \u0026amp; Rambo\u003cbr\u003e"
