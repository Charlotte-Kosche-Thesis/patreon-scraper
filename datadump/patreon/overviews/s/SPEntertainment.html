Thanks for visiting and taking the time to get to know \nus. We\u0027re looking forward to getting to know you better as well. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sp-ent.com/Portals/1/Patreon/Who_Is_SPEnt.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\n are a pack of friends and family based in Albuquerque, NM, but with \nteam members located across the Southwest. We develop electronic games \nfor various platforms, though we\u0027ve dabbled in table top, and we hope to\n dig into other mediums as well. We just published our first game, a \nmobile game for Android, Apple and Amazon devices called K3D. Check it \nout.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.sp-ent.com/Games/Katastrogon-3D.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sp-ent.com/portals/1/Game_Card_K3D.png\" style=\"width: 320px; height: 160px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOh yeah, and K3D is free! So, download it on your favorite device and play! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sp-ent.com/Portals/1/Patreon/Why_were_here.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSP\n Entertainment is a Christian company. Now, we know that some people \nhave had some pretty unpleasant and un-Christ-like experiences with \nChristians. We strive to be different and open to all, just as Christ \nis. As for our games, they are not evangelical, but our beliefs do \naffect our game design. What does that mean? Well, it means high \nstandards of both integrity and service. We also believe that everyone \ndeserves to have good, clean, fun entertainment, without compromise or \nover commercialization. This is what we, as a company, strive to \nprovide. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs you may see, we have strong opinions about \nwhat should be in our games, and we don\u0027t want to make the kind of \ncompromises one must make when picked up by one of the big dogs on the \nblock (a large publisher) or when profits alone drive design. We want to\n make games on our terms, in accordance with our value system, and in a \nway that respects our audience more than our bottom line. That is why we\n are independent publishers, that\u0027s why we\u0027re looking for Dev Dawgs, and\n that is why we need your support.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sp-ent.com/Portals/1/Patreon/How_support_helps.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour\n support will help us cover some of the costs of business so that we \ncan continue to make games like K3D. The cost of business includes \nequipment, supplies, monthly fees for communications and internet \nservices, and the costs of conventions (cons). It also involves monthly \npayments to manage business debt. We already have more titles in \nprogress, but we can\u0027t do it on what\u0027s left from our day jobs. We need \nsome patrons, like you, to become Dev Dawgs and help us out. Check out \nour rewards to find out more about how we intend to thank you for your \nsupport. Also, check out our other titles to see more of the types of \ndevelopment (dev) you will be helping to support. We would never want to put a\n financial burden on anyone, but if you have the means and like what you see here, then become a Dev Dawg and lend us a paw in making games for pure fun. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.sp-ent.com/Games/Raptors-Realm.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sp-ent.com/portals/1/Game_Card_RR.png\" style=\"width: 320px; height: 160px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.sp-ent.com/Games/Tilt-The-Sport-of-Kings.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sp-ent.com/portals/1/Game_Card_Tilt.png\" style=\"width: 320px; height: 160px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eVIsit us around the web.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sp-ent.com/\"\u003eSP Ent.
