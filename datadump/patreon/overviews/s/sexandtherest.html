It provides the basics (like general information about you and your partner(s)\u0027s biology), tips for healthy sexual practices (such as birth control methods, how to prevent STIs, and thorough discussions on consent and how to know when you\u0027re ready for sex), and guides for exploring your healthiest sexuality possible (like how to get down and dirty with kink). Sex and The Rest also provides a platform for a broad range of individuals to share their stories, creating a dialogue about sex and relationships that resonates with a diverse community.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s no secret that mandated sex ed curricula have done a disservice to women, trans folx, non-binary folx, and queer folx by adhering to a heteronormative agenda.\u00a0This website is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e your high school sex ed class.\u00a0This is a website that normalizes and celebrates sexuality in all its sexy forms. That means no body shaming, no slut shaming, and a commitment to providing relevant information for people of all genders, sexualities, and backgrounds. It\u0027s the funny, inclusive, approachable sex ed resource you wished you had when you were a teenager.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m your typical, over-educated millennial.

Running this website is turning into a full-time job\u2014researching, writing, interviewing, promoting, creating graphics, networking, managing the platform, etc.\u2014and it\u0027s not feasible for me to churn out weekly content while holding down a 9-5.\u00a0Sex and The Rest is still a baby in blog terms, and I want to see its content and its reach grow.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf I can swing my initial goal of \u003cstrong\u003e$4000/month\u003c/strong\u003e, Sex and The Rest will be self-sustaining. Here\u0027s what I\u0027ll use your monies for:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eWebsite costs: The better the platform, the more it costs. The money I receive on Patreon will help cover domain and email costs, as well as any other incidentals that come my way.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eNot advertising: Every web user every knows how much online ads suck. If Sex and The Rest can sustain itself from funds collected on Patreon, it won\u0027t need to resort to advertising.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFood and shelter: It\u0027s hard to write good content when I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll make rent. Lucky for you, my partner and I have zero kids and we like one-bedroom apartments.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\nThat\u0027s it! If those basics are covered, Sex and The Rest will stay up and running, and you can expect new content every week.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you decide to support me, I can\u0027t thank you enough! This is probably the most fulfilling and important project I\u0027ve ever worked on, and you\u0027re making it happen! And if you can\u0027t support me? It\u0027s cool, I still love you, and I hope you keep reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay sexy, friends.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLove,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSara\u003cbr\u003e"
