     "about": "Shadow Clone is an artist born from the idea of having fun and enjoying one\u2019s self above all else. His approach is always lyrically clever, while fandom satisfying with his references and relatable instrumentals. Shadow Clone draws inspiration from music all over the world. All periods, genres, and artists have an influential role in the manifestation of the Shadow Clone sound. The content of Shadow Clone\u2019s original material is reminiscent of popular artists such as Weird Al Yankovic, Lonely Island, and Lemon Demon while the structure and crafting of each song resembles MF Doom, Ludacris, and MC Chris among other Hip Hop and Rap notables. With such a variety of influences, Shadow Clone is always able to produce something fresh for his listeners. Each performance is delivered with high energy, precision, and an intimacy necessary to ensnare any and every listener within an ear\u2019s reach. The LIVE Shadow Clone Show leaves both the listener and the performer wanting more, while satisfying the palettes of the faithful and introducing newcomers to a style of music that they did not yet know they loved.",
