I\u0027m Jenni, a freelance graphic designer/illustration-er kinda person.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI make stuff!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Sleepiest?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSleepiest Designs is a freelance business that I made late 2014. I started doing commissions for peoples Twitch channels and had the little dream of being able to run my own little shop selling stuff I\u0027ve made. I now run an etsy store, where I sell my own stickers, prints and badges that I design, print and send out myself (mostly, sometimes i need other companies to help me make the thing). I still do commissions and also have a RedBubble shop too! Alongside Sleepiest Designs, I also stream (creative and gaming streams) on Twitch 6 days a week. So I\u0027m a busy bee most of the time and I love it. I adore making stuff that makes me happy and hearing that my stuff has made them happy, like that\u0027s crazy to me and I want to do this for as long as I possibly can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the drawbacks\u00a0with working freelance is the fact that we have little idea on how much money we\u0027re going to be earning month to month. But this platform allows me to have somewhat of an idea what I can do. That means I can do things like invest in new products that I\u0027ve had in my head for months (literally) and be able to restock supplies and continue making cool stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon works on a monthly basis. So if you become a Patreon on the 5th of the month, you won\u0027t get charged until the following start of the month, which is when you become an official Patreon and get the perks. The payment works on a subscription basis so will carry on until you cancel which you can do at anytime! If you picked a perk that involves me sending something to you, things will usually arrive near the end of that month. ^3^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn which ever way you\u0027re able to support me, thank you. Whether that is just retweeting my art stuff, watching my streams, buying from my shop, becoming a patron or anything inbetween. It\u0027s all so incredibly appreciated. I wouldn\u0027t be able to carry on making stuff without it so thank you. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
