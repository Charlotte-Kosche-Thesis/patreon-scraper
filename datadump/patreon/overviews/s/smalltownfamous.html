    "summary": "Small Town Famous\u2122 is a podcast about the culture and eccentricities of \"small town living\". It is listed in the Comedy genre in most podcast directories. It can be found on iTunes or any major podcast host. The show consists\u00a0of 4 small-town guys from various backgrounds (financial planner, cop, US senator\u0027s aide, and\u00a0sawmill worker). They are entertaining and are \"experts\" at small-town life. How do we know? First of all, they\u0027ve never really lived in any place other than \"Small Town USA\" and\u00a0they talk with that slow, syrupy-sweet Southern accent that appeal to many. But, the main reason the show\u00a0resonates with so many is because it\u00a0is honestly\u00a0produced\u00a0at the home of\u00a0one of the hosts in the rural town of Taylor in Southwest Arkansas...population\u00a0554. It doesn\u0027t get much more \"small town\" than that!\u00a0 This podcast is\u00a0growing fast as demonstrated by reaching the top 100 on the Comedy podcast rankings several times after only 12 episodes. And, the guys would appreciate your help in keeping it going! STF\u2122\u00a0heavily promotes local businesses in their \"neck of the woods\". But, with popularity soaring, the reach has become\u00a0national.\u00a0Sponsors are coming on board quickly. They are\u00a0averaging\u00a0approximately 500,000 hits on \u003ca href=\"http://www.smalltownfamous.com\"\u003ewww.smalltownfamous.com\u003c/a\u003e daily.
