We believe that the social interpretations of Fem \u0026amp; Masc have helped create performative cultural expectations damaging to the individual subject and the greater global community. We seek to popularize, celebrate, and re-inform all artistic works that sheds a unique perspective on their own interpretation of these social signifiers called Masculinity and Femininity- understanding that these energies and their attributed characteristics aren\u0027t mutually exclusive with their assigned gender. We source literature, art, videography, music, and anything else from submissions given to us via social media. Basically, be who the hell you want!",
