    "summary": "Hi there! I am Shelby Bower and I create art using edible materials. My favorites being chocolate, royal icing, cookies, cake, sugar, gumpaste and fondant. I have created this Patreon page to connect with other cake artist that would like to learn from me online, this part of my Patreon will be up and running shortly. As I have ventured into teaching and competitions and away from my actual cake business this is also an avenue for supporters of art that would like to invest in my cookie boxes to help support my craft. When I say \"support my craft,\" this means helping me achieve the financial freedom to compete in as many sugar competitions as I can. I am creating content for this to be an venue for me to also share my tutorials, time lapse videos, blog articles and more. Patreon is a place where you people can come together and support artist. I will be \u00a0adding new content to my Pateron so keep checking back, and thank you for the support!\u003cbr\u003e"
