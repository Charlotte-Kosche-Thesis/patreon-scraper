I am passionate about communicating the wonders of science in a way that is accessible and meaningful to all audiences. I received my PhD in Neuroscience from Washington University in St. Louis studying walking and balance deficits in Parkinson disease, and I\u2019m thrilled to have the opportunity now to share my love of science with the world through this podcast.\u003cbr\u003eFor as long as I can remember, I have been interested in science. As a child, I went through perhaps the usual phases of being fascinated with dinosaurs, the pyramids, and the stars. However, what really got me hooked was marine biology. I would devour books on marine mammals, fish, coral, and of course the adventures of the great Jacques Cousteau. I could only dream about what it would have been like to speak to this amazing science legend and to get a view into his brilliant mind. Though my research interests shifted over the years away from marine biology and toward the dazzling frontiers of the brain, my enthusiasm never waned. By introducing you to the People Behind the Science, I hope to connect you to real people, ignite curiosity and encourage you to never stop learning, while making you reflect, smile, and laugh along the way.\u003cbr\u003e",
