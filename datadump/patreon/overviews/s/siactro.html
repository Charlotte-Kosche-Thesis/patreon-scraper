    "summary": "Hey there potential patron\nand thanks for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Siactro\n(well, my developer name) and I\u0027ve been developing games for \u003cstrong\u003emore\nthan ten years\u003c/strong\u003e now, including commercial releases on \u003cstrong\u003eXbox 360\u003c/strong\u003e,\nand of course \u003cstrong\u003ecomputer games\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently I learn about\ngames at Cologne Game Lab and work on them when I\u0027m at home.\u003cbr\u003eMy\nprojects span various themes, ranging from \u003cstrong\u003enostalgic retro\u003c/strong\u003e\ngames over to \u003cstrong\u003ecrazy experimental\u003c/strong\u003e\nstuff where I just try out new interesting ideas. Up to this\nday, my work has always been independent, so I am not financially\nsupported by a publisher. The projects I create\nare usually \u003cstrong\u003eshort entertaining\nexperiences\u003c/strong\u003e, surely due to the fact\nthat I\u0027m mostly a one-man-studio, but also to get all these ideas out\nof my head!\u003cbr\u003e\nIf I had to choose a\nguideline, it would probably be \u201c\u003cstrong\u003eGameplay first!\u003c/strong\u003e\u201c I love\ntrying out interesting mechanics \u2013 Let the gameplay tell the story!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why do I need your\nhelp?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe answer is: \u003cem\u003eM\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eaking\ngames is expensive\u003c/em\u003e, more\nthan evident at first glance. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven though I do most of\nthe work by myself in my spare time, I still end up with a lot of\n\u003cstrong\u003einvisible costs\u003c/strong\u003e that just add up over time; things like food,\nrent, internet, a computer that\u0027s remotely up-to-date so it doesn\u0027t\ncrash when I open up a game engine...\u003cbr\u003eAlso there\u0027s some \u003cstrong\u003estuff I\njust can\u0027t do myself\u003c/strong\u003e, like music and occasionally additional\narts, done by other creative people that of course want and should be\npaid for their efforts, just like me. ;)\u003cbr\u003e\nAdditionally, I cannot\nwork on my games while I am at my day job to cover these costs. Your\nsupport enables me to spend more time on game-making and less on\nworries over expenses. \u003cstrong\u003eGames will be done quicker!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSadly I had to find out\nthat having debts doesn\u0027t help with going into business. I went to\nprivate art school and paid faaaaar too much money, just to end up\nhaving even less time to still learn everything by myself. If I may\ngive you any advise, please inform yourself about the education\nyou\u0027re about to purchase so you don\u0027t need to end up like me, okay?\n:)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy wish is being able\nto \u003cem\u003elive solely from the games I make\u003c/em\u003e, but until then I need\nyour help to have the means to \u003cstrong\u003emake \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003emy\ngames as good as they need and deserve\u003c/strong\u003e to be!\u003cbr\u003e\nNot convinced yet?\nCheck out my games and decide for yourself on \u003ca href=\"http://www.siactro.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.siactro.com\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOh, and if you can\u0027t\nor just don\u0027t want to donate anything: that\u0027s fine! If you still like\nto support me, just play my games and show them to friends that might\nenjoy them, too.\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for reading this massive amount of\nbegging, if you did - you probably did if you are here \u2013 \u003cem\u003eand\nhave fun playing!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"
