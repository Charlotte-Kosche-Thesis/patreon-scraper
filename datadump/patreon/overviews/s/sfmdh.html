    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello there, what do you do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am creating smutty animations/wallpapers/short movies that could be considered rather niche; focused almost exclusively on huge breasts and butts. Whilst it certainly does not appeal to everyone, there are those of us who appreciate what has been dubbed the four B\u0027s: Balloon Breasts and Basketball Butts. I just made those up on the spot, which lends credence to my creative ability and stands as a testament as to why you should support my work. I primarily work in Source Filmmaker, but I\u0027m also slowly learning how to use Blender. My work, for all its niche focus, does not feature any futa content. What it does have is a lot of dirty men, aliens and other scum having their way with lovely ladies, often accompanied by small story snippets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat have you done previously, then?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find all of my work on my tumblr, over at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sfm-dh.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://sfm-dh.tumblr.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMy more elaborate work, with sound and such can be viewed specifically over at naughtymachinima:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.naughtymachinima.com/user/Dreamhawk/videos\"\u003ehttps://www.naughtymachinima.com/user/Dreamhawk/vi...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s up with the support tiers?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve deemed my ability (at present) to deliver on the more ambitious tiers that certain, other creators have as something that I\u0027m less likely to be able to pull off, courtesy of time constraints. As such, I sport a simple $1 tier where people are free to support my work with whatever amount they deem they can afford or they are willing to spend, and everyone will gain access to the same content on Patreon. The\u00a0$5 tier is specifically for those wanting to squeeze out a bit extra content out of me, particularly if they\u0027re already supporting me with more money than the\u00a0$1 one. Discord access with extra tidbits and being able to see unlit, discarded work that there\u0027s no room for on Patreon, check my Work In Progress dump, as well as being able to speak to me directly as a creator is the main draw there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future, it might be possible that I will open up more tiers if I can find appropriate rewards for them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get for supporting?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs listed under the supporter tier, you\u0027ll get access to material that may in fact never see the light of day on my other pages, \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eextra animations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e in the form of alternative angles of completed scenes, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ewallpapers\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003econcept pieces\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eexperimental scenes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003esneak-peeks at larger projects\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, not to mention character and scene \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003epolls\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e; both to tell me what to focus on finishing and what to create in the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn addition, you, as a patron, get first dibs on commission slots whenever they are opened, before they reach the general public over on other pages, such as tumblr etc, if they even do.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShould my support grow, I\u0027ll certainly add more rewards for you, and perhaps more intricate tiers with corresponding rewards in the future.
