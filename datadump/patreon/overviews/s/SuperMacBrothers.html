    "summary": "Hi, I am Ryan, or Mac as I am more commonly known. The SuperMacBrothers channel is primarily focused on Chris Roberts\u0027 new project, Star Citizen and I have been covering its development since 2013. taking all the latest news and information Cloud Imperium Games release each week, and compressing them into more easily managable videos. I also cover other topics along with the occasional look at other games that take my interest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChannel Goals\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eProvide consise, factual content on Star Citizen and its development.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelp people who cannot keep up with the status of Star Citizens development follow its progression easily.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreate entertaining gameplay videos showing off features, mechanics....everything Star citizen offers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelp people to understand mechanics through easy to follow tutorials and guides.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eKeep the commnunity involved and informed!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I using Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Creating videos take time to plan, record, edit and upload along with my \u0027real\u0027 jobs, it is often difficult to set time aside for YouTube. The revenue from adsense\u00a0 is a very small amount and unstable, Patreon will allow me to spend more time expanding on the quality of my content aswel as keep up with the ever increasing hardware / software demands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Community is key\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy community which has grown significantly since I begun is the most important focus for me.The support, friendship, inspiration and generosity everyone provides is overwhelming to me, driving me to keep creating and inspiring me with so many ideas. I want to grow the community even further with the inclusion of an SMB org providing a location for my community to hang out and be called upon to help with videos/streams etc! With Star Citizen on the horizon I plan to keep the community strong involving everyone in some way, whether helping me to gain more viewpoints or just joining in as crew, I want you all there. #BBC\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Content\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently I create around 3-4 videos a week depending on my work etc. Star Citizen will always be the core focus of this channel and as the game development progresses I will constantly be covering the news, tutorials, guides and information as it arises. When the time comes, I plan to include lots of quality gameplay videos using multiple camera angles and with the help of my community they can become something fun and exciting.\u003cbr\u003eOne idea I will be pursuing is locating and cataloguing all the derelict ships/outposts starting with alpha 3.0 and beyond. I would like to create a database in which anyone can submit their own finds incl. location/ship type/whether its habited or not/what was found on board etc in which myself and my team will head to the location to confirm the data. Having a team work together to help gather this info whether youre a pilot/analyst/security or escort will involve lots of fun team work and enjoyment as we watch the game come to fruition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwitch \u003c/strong\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/supermacbrothersryan\"\u003ewww.twitch.tv/supermacbrothersryan\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also stream on Twitch 4-5 times a week playing Star Citizen, playing with viewers, checking out new builds and patches as well as covering news from the week. When I am not streaming Star Citizen I play other games but my main focus at all times is talking to chat and involving the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003edo we get\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eas a \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003ePatreon gives the option to those who enjoy what I do, help me create more content and at a higher quality. This allows you to directly support my channel grow, which in turn grants me the time and hardware to give more back to my community. In return for being my patron, I will automatically give you a \u0027thank you\u0027 shout out in a video and give you instant access to a private discord channel, solely for Patrons who will get a response from me quicker than general chats. Other rewards include better Twitch access and autoclaim giveaways plus priority when I am looking for people to join me in game for videos or just for fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHardware\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving access to better hardware like \ngraphics cards, camera, microphones etc gives me the ability to stay \ncurrent, improving the quality of my content plus creating a stronger, \nmore professional style to interviews or coverage of events, to \nkeeping the videos and game graphics to the highest they can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEvents\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery year, there are multiple events such as\n CitizenCon, GamesCom along with many Bar Citizens and Studio tours. I would love to attend as \nmany of these events and provide vlogs and livestreams showing off the event from its \nheart but I would also love to interview many \ndevelopers and get their personal opinions. Attending as many as possible each year would be a dream and provide those who are unable to go the information so they dont miss out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGiveaways\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe funding provided by my Patreons helps pay for a monthly giveaway on YouTube of a Star Citizen starter package helping to not only get more players into the game but this really helps me grow my channel. As my Patreon increases I will use a section of that funding to go towards better and bigger giveaways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat happens if it\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003egoes well?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAlthough I will always try to better my channel and content, Patreon will enable me to add much more content such as start new series, keep up with hardware, devote more time to increasing the quality of my channel and videos and attend as many events as possible. It is a labour of love, but this will grant me the financial backing to give more! It will allow me to purchase better software and the time needed to learn better techniques and access to higher quality hardware.\u003cbr\u003eWhether you pledge or no, thank you so much for your continued support in watching / commenting and appreciating my videos and also for taking the time to view this Patreon page.
