Christy did freelance design work for Amina designing the logo for her business, which she partially hand lettered. We got started talking about how awesome hand lettering is and decided, why not meet once a month around Silver Spring to letter in company, and invite anyone else who wants to come! Thus, the Society was born. We outgrew \u003ca href=\"http://www.zedscafe.com/\"\u003eZed\u2019s Cafe\u003c/a\u003e in Silver Spring pretty fast, and since then have been meeting in various restaurants and hot spots around Silver Spring. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first meeting of January 2016 was held at Catylator Makerspace in Silver Spring, MD and we loved it so much that Catylator invited us back every month! In 2016, all meetings will be held in that inspiring space with the creative owner Steve on hand to show us how to bring our lettering to life.
