I picked the cello as my \u2018weapon of choice\u2019 when I was just three years old and started taking lessons with when I was 8. As a young adult I embraced the world of chamber music but was equally seduced by the world of rock\u2019n\u2019roll. After discovering the composer Dmitri Shostakovich I was inspired to build bridges between the world of classical music and as many other genres as possible through busking and community outreach. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring and after completing my Bachelor of Music at the University of British Columbia I organized two consecutive summers of \u201cFree Outdoor Cello Concerts\u201d the second of which I took on tour to 19 cities all across North America \u2013 all by bus in 45 days. My world got a little bigger, but it was still pretty small.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was presented with the opportunity to perform, teach, and share chamber music in Cambodia and Burma, I pounced. The experience changed my life forever. Music makes the world a smaller place, one in which I hope we can all become friends and neighbors \u2013 across all boarders and surrounding all oceans.\u00a0 ",
