I have been drawing since I could remember. I love illustrating and making comics and hope to continue to do so for the rest of my life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI want to create content that people love and that can inspire others. But I really need some help making that happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the funds from Patreon I hope to do quite a few things but all of life takes baby steps so let\u0027s start with the basics.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Youtube videos:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have recently started posting speed drawings and paintings on youtube! This has always been something I have wanted to do and have recently gotten some of the equipment to do just that! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery friday I will be posting a speed drawing or painting video, and once a month I will be doing a fanart review of a graphic novel. This means that I will be drawing the characters or a scene from a comic that I have read, and overlaying it with audio of what I thought of the book!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.

I will update as I go, but I hope you all understand my situation. As soon as I have my schedule straight, I would be more than happy to share my live stream experiences to my Patreons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA second comic:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOnce I reach a comfortable living from my art I will adjust my life and devote more time to creating, which in turn means more updates! I have two other comics that I have written and illustrated characters for that I would love to share with you all one day. Unfortunately with my full time job I can only devote a reasonable amount of time to videos and comics. With more time for art, there will be many more updates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAND MORE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am open to hear any suggestions from all of you.
