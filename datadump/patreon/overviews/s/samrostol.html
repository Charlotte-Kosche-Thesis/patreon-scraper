Whatever reason you have to visit me; either you are already a patreon, or you are curious about how to support me, I\u0027m very thankful for your time and consideration. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI spent 30 years eating animals\u003c/strong\u003e, and my pledge is to correct the wrongdoings of my past. Doing this while maintaining a fulltime-job is hard, so from february I\u0027m going to reduce my workload to 50%, and spend the other 50% of my time as an activist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe goal\u003c/strong\u003e of my activism \u003cstrong\u003eis to challenge the existing status quo\u003c/strong\u003e with regards to animal-consumption in any way possible, with \u003cstrong\u003erespect for the journey\u003c/strong\u003e that lies ahead of most people who do not already understand the vegan ideology. I began by starting what has now become the largest vegan discussion-group in Norway (\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/groups/Veganpreik\"\u003eVeganpreik\u003c/a\u003e, with 10k+ members), and I\u0027m constantly trying new methods to encourage people to make small or big changes. I\u0027m writing for the norwegian magazine Wegan, I\u0027m participating and organizing street-activism in Gothenburg (which we will start filming in 2018), and\u00a0in 2018 I\u0027m launching \u0027\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/movedbta\"\u003eMoved! By the Animals\u003c/a\u003e\u0027, where I\u0027m inviting people from all areas of life to simply move in support for animals. I also recently purchased one year as a vegan from an activist from the Effective Altruism-movement by offering a $600 dollar donation to AnimalCharityEvaluators Effective Charity Fund. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this Patreon as a tool to enable me to spend as much time with activism as possible. Hopefully in the future, I\u0027ll be able to do so with all my available time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-arn2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/15027800_10157517079955478_3925420788407005176_n.jpg?oh=095c10b221cd2cf77ee932ad4df95f9d\u0026amp;oe=5AB0AE9C\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
