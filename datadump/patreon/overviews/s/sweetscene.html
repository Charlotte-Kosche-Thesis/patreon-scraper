This series covers the everyday life of a trio of quirky teenagers running a business called the Treasure Fetchers. Residing in the unique, colorful city of Lollimoor, they do exactly what is described in the name of their business. They retrieve treasure for clients and battle guardians and monsters of all kinds in the process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe current pages can be read FOR FREE at \u003ca href=\"http://www.sweet-scene.com.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.sweet-scene.com.\u003c/a\u003e Please check it out!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY SUPPORT DREA HATCH?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently,my projects are simple labors of love by a stay-at-home mom who started a webcomic to help her art grow. With your support, I can do what I\u0027ve been working toward and create tons more art! Plus, you will get access to all kinds of content goodies only Patrons get to see. (And even a few real-life, in your grabby hands kinds of goodies.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT AM I SUPPORTING?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI post one new page each week to Sweet Scene and TONS of other stuff to my facebook page and personal blog. Basically, I create as much art as possible. Your contributions are made monthly, so whatever you pledge is for about four pages of Sweet Scene per month plus whatever is included in your reward tier (tutorials, original PSD files, downloads, clipart, exclusive content, etc.). With enough patrons, I can increase the update schedule to twice a week and maybe more. This gives me the opportunity to spend more time on a story/work I truly love (and possibly other original stories) and less time taking commissions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSweet Scene is entirely self-published and each issue will be available as an e-book and in print.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW DOES THIS PATREON THING WORK?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is really cool for creators like myself! It facilitates a special kind of crowd-funding similar to Kickstarter and Indiegogo, but instead of pledging a one-time amount toward a product or project you want to support, you can choose to provide recurring financial support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will only be charged for the amount you pledge (As little as $1). All other fees associated with using Patreon (Processing fees, Paypal/Stripe, \u0026amp; Patreon\u0027s Fees) are paid for on my end as the creator. So, you really only have to pledge what you feel comfortable with and you can stop your payment at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
