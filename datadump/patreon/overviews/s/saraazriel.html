    "summary": "When I was a kid, music saved my life. It uplifted me and comforted me when I was struggling and hurting. It made me feel not so alone when it seemed like no one understood me. I always wanted to be able to help people in the same way. Creating music is my service to the world, my small way of contributing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you like what I do, or it has helped or inspired you in some way, you can help me continue to create more music, more of the time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will be releasing 3 things:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n1. NEW DEMOS. Every once in a very special while, I will release a demo of a new song I\u0027m writing. These will never be for sale publicly, they will only be available here. A demo gives you a glimpse inside a song\u0027s gestation. To give you an example, here is the first demo we made of \"Be With Me\". \n\u003cu\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/sara-azriel/be-with-me-original-demo\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/sara-azriel/be-with-me-orig...\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/u\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2. COVER SONGS: I\u0027ve been wanting to do a covers project for a while. These I will likely sell publicly, but as a patron, you will get them first. I will also gladly consider your requests on the patron only stream.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n3. VIDEOS: I\u0027m one of those people who closes their eyes to listen to music as carefully as possible... my sense of sight distracts me from deep listening. But hey, I\u0027m weird, and most people like to watch people sing on youtube, so I\u0027m gonna get with the times. I\u0027ll occasionally release a video of me singing you a song -- either one of my own or a cover.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUsing this platform, I intend to release new content about once or twice a month. I will keep creating no matter what, but with your help, my gears will be well-oiled and my engine will hum. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith love and gratitude, I thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\nSara Azriel\u003cbr\u003e"

Most women dream about their wedding day, I dream about buying a piano. I am never more inspired than when sitting in front of a one. Having a piano in my home will take my writing, my practicing, and my quality of life to a whole new level. \u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "I play all of my shows with my vintage Fender Rhodes, an electric piano built in the 1970s that weighs almost 100 pounds. I bought it when I was nearing the end of my time at Berklee. It traveled with me to Los Angeles and it came with me back to the east coast. It\u0027s such a special instrument, but it hasn\u0027t been serviced in about four years. It needs some help, and reaching this goal, I will be able to get this baby into tip top shape again.",
