    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\"Sam\u0027s Channel\" \u003c/strong\u003eis a movie-themed YouTube channel that I started in 2012 which has grown into something that I\u0027ve become incredibly\u00a0passionate\u00a0about. It mainly comprises of two review shows..\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) Sam\u0027s Reviews\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is a series of entertaining movie reviews for films recently released in cinemas (an example of these can be seen above with my \"Jurassic World\" review).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) Sam\u0027s Views\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is a platform on which anything regarding movies, television, and other fan-favourite topics can be discussed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are too many things I could say about how much I love making these videos and interacting with all of my viewers that have gradually built up and supported me over the years. The encouragement keeps me going\u00a0and I could not be more grateful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides this, I am also a University student in my early twenties studying Film Production and living independently which means balancing both these aspects of my life can be difficult, time consuming, and as much as I love it, takes a lot of hard work to keep afloat. A lot goes into one video; writing, recording, editing, seeing the movie in the first place, etc. Sam\u0027s Channel, while I\u0027ve been working on it for some time now, is still very much a less-popular YouTube page, which means that the pay I earn from ad-revenue tends not to be anything substantial.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI started this Patreon page to give you guys the opportunity to help me out.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThis is not intended for an end-game, it\u0027s simply an opportunity for you guys to help support my work and keep Sam\u0027s Channel going.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePerks include receiving videos 1 day earlier than everyone else!\u003c/strong\u003e See below for details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI WANT TO STRESS THAT THIS IS COMPLETELY OPTIONAL AND WHAT EVER GETS DONATED\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eIS HIGHLY APPRECIATED.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ePlease also be aware that the videos will still be posted regularly on the YouTube Channel as usual. This is just to help me get by and I appreciate any and all support!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
