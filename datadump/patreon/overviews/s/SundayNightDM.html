It quickly evolved, to the point where I now publish material for my homebrewed campaign setting, Talomire.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter some to-and-fro on what I wanted my Patreon to be, I decided that the reward structure really didn\u0027t speak to me. I let too many people down, and left them feeling out of pocket as I felt pulled from every direction. Now, with a more donation-centric format, I am more laser focussed on what I want to get done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return for your hard earned ducats you\u0027ll gain access to the Talomire discord server (on which I hope to start a Talomire West Marches campaign in the future), as well as discounts on my digital releases as they come out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor more information\u003c/strong\u003e, check me out at the following spots:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sundaynightdm.wordpress.com\"\u003ewww.sundaynightdm.wordpress.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/chris_hately\"\u003ewww.instagram.com/chris_hately\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/SundayNightDM\"\u003ewww.twitter.com/SundayNightDM\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.anchor.fm/SundayNight\"\u003ewww.anchor.fm/SundayNight\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI7eQnlkEte3VGXXXzY5sVA\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI7eQnlkEte3VGXXX...\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1323536929\"\u003ehttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1323536929\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"

The more I create, the more I run games and the more people I meet, the more ideas I have, and the more I want to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Dungeons and Dragons, and I love nothing more than seeing the content I create help you guys run awesome games, be it a map, an adventure module, or a campaign setting!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut Chris, what can I expect?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour pledge is vital for me to build what I want to build here. The content I am, and want to continue creating falls into several broad categories: cartography, the Brew Dog Tales, and Talomire...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCartography - $1\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOne of my original loves is map making. For your pledge you will receive high resolution copies of the maps I create during my Dungeon Cartography livestreams. These are free to be used in personal projects, as well as commercial projects (with some terms and conditions. Please contact me at sundaynightdm@gmail.com for more information).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Brew Dog Tales\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI run a regular gaming group at my local Brew Dog pub. Each month I write a brand new adventure, and type it up into .pdf format. For your pledge you will receive a digital copy of these adventures, as well as being included in the Acknowledgements section of these documents. The adventures are written, originally, for Index Card RPG, but are typed up as 5th Edition. Eventually I\u0027m hoping to have .pdfs for both game systems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTalomire\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTalomire is the campaign setting I run for my podcast/livestream group, and a setting I am currently in the process of publishing. For your pledge you will receive each and every .pdf I release under the Talomire brand. This will include adventure modules, regional source books, campaign primers, and (assuming I find the time, or willing authors) works of fiction based in the world!",
