     "about": "STANT LITORE doesn\u2019t consider his writing a vocation; he considers it an act of survival. As a youth, he witnessed the 1992 outbreak in the rural Pacific Northwest firsthand, as he glanced up from the feeding bins one dawn to see four dead staggering toward him across the pasture, dark shapes in the morning fog. With little time to think or react, he took a machete from the barn wall and hurried to defend his father\u2019s livestock; the experience left him shaken.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday he lives in Colorado with his wife and two daughters.\u00a0Sometimes he lies awake beside his sleeping wife and listens in the night for any moan in the hills, but there is only her breathing, soft and full and a mystery of beauty beside him. He keeps his machete sharp but hopes not to use it.",

Litoreverse provides a visual and verbal tour through my various worlds, a stunningly designed odyssey that takes you from cylindrical space stations on which young athletes race tyrannosaurs, to far planets where vegetable people drink sunlight, to the deeps of time when our ancestors fought the zombie hordes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is to fund the design and creation of the book, as well as commission additional artwork from a more diverse array of artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll Patreon members who subscribe at $20/month or more will receive a copy of the finished book. Right now, my plan is to release the book in June 2017 (and I have a history of releasing things on time) \u2014 but of course, first we have to fund it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Vader voice* Join me, and together we will rule the Litoreverse as author and patrons!\u003cbr\u003e",
