This past week, a catastrophic severe weather and flooding event struck the north Houston metroplex. Despite the timing of the storm, Spring Happenings was here for you, from the beginning to the very end. We began with live video coverage while families were taking cover from tornadoes and strong winds, we continued with up to the second coverage throughout the storm, we coordinated the rescues of animals throughout Harris and Montgomery County.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI would like to talk about the future of Spring Happenings. It is my belief, and I hope yours too, that Spring Happenings provides a valuable service to folks living in the Spring/Klein community. It is my hope that Spring Happenings is around for a very long time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur biggest goal is for Spring Happenings to remain completely operational and devoted to the service we provide. In order for us to do so, we need to become a crowd funded, follower supported organization. You have relied on Spring Happenings for breaking news and up to the second severe weather coverage for over 5 years. Now we need the support from you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese goals can be accomplished with your support. We have launched a campaign through Patreon, where you will be able to setup a monthly reoccurring donation. These funds would allow us to stay full time, all the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we were just able to get 1% of you to donate at least $1, $5 or even $10 per month, we would be able to easily accomplish our goals. We appreciate any and every amount.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to reach out to us if you have any questions. You can send us a message on Facebook or email me personally:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:zach@springhappenings.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ezach@springhappenings.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for being apart of this great community!  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eZach Karrenbrock\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFounder \u0026amp; Creator of SpringHappenings.com\u003c/em\u003e"
