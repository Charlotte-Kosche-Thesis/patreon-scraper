    "summary": "I have been deep in the world of creative writing since January 2006. Writing is my release from the stresses of every day life. It even allows me to follow my favorite characters and fill in the gaps that canon leaves behind. It allows me to build a world that invites you in as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently in a semester long unpaid internship, which means that I will have no income until August 2018. Because of the demands of my internship, which includes traveling and lots of after school work, I am unable to get a second job for supplement income. I originally had accepted a loan to cover me for the next several months, but due to not meeting the requirement of credit hours on paper, the federal loan service has chosen to not cover my tuition, which would lead to my \"income\" with what was left, at all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate you taking the time to read this. I know that not everyone has a lot to give, but in order to me to live and be able to produce the content I love, I have decided to open this page. You don\u0027t have to give a lot, but any little bit helps.\u003cbr\u003e"
