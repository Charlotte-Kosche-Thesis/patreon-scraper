A lot of care and attention goes into creating each StreetWise Hebrew podcast episode, including researching, writing, editing, and publishing. We\u0027re a full team here, including a technical producer and sound editor, content editor, social \u0026amp; web editor, studio manager, and let\u0027s not forget our amazing graffiti photographer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e10 people-hours go into making each and every episode. We\u2019re trying to create the best, most fun Hebrew podcast out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we want to offer even more. In two years of podcasting, we\u2019ve come up with all kinds of ideas, which we didn\u2019t have the resources to realize. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the things we\u2019d love to do is film a StreetWise Hebrew video in the streets of Tel Aviv, so you can see the words you\u2019re learning in their natural habitat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what about a StreetWise Hebrew e-book, filled with beautiful Tel Aviv graffiti art and brand new lessons?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut most importantly, we want to reach a wider audience. And in order to do all of these things, we need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ll upload each episode\u2019s exclusive materials here on our Patreon page, and as a patron, you\u2019ll have access to them. They\u2019ll include things like additional translations, texts, images, and a backstage look at how we make the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as all of that, as a way to say thanks, we\u2019ve created rewards based on the level of your support. Rewards like monthly audio chats; free admissions to my Tel Aviv Graffiti tour; and the chance to come to our studios and take part in a special StreetWise Hebrew episode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo if you love the show and you want to help turn our new ideas into a reality (while getting a few sweet rewards along the way), become a StreetWise Hebrew patron!\u003c/strong\u003e"
