    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003eSister Ivy is a most \noften a quartet formed in Asheville, NC that fuses Neo-soul, Jazz, \nR\u0026amp;B, and Rock elements to carry poetic musings to the listener\u2019s ear\n on a groove-able beat. Though spearheaded by songwriter and lyricist, \nRachel Waterhouse, the band relies on the collaborative input of all its\n members\u2014everyone writes their own parts, creating a unique and personal\n conversation between the instruments and the players. Sometimes the \nband members change, and so does the music. Other times you may find \nSister Ivy solo...a.ka. Rachel Waterhouse and a loop pedal, and the \nmusic changes again. Same skeleton, different flesh.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 That\u0027s the official blurb, anyways...the big push at the moment? Album, album, album! We have some great material that needs to reach ears outside of bars and concert venues! \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So far, we have nothing professionally recorded, but there are plans to go into the studio for our first session this memorial day, May 29th. Though many advise recording an EP or single first, we really want to make the jump to a full length album: 12 songs, iconic album art, thematic transitions, accompanying music videos-- a real collaborative work of auditory and visual art. For this to be feasible, we need support! Musicians and technicians must be paid for their time and effort, mixes must be mastered, and brushes must be dipped in ink.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For me, (that would be the Rachel typing) this project will be the culmination of years of ruminations and rewrites, slashed notes, terrible laptop recordings, and many vibrant and (at times) difficult emotional roller coasters. It will also be my first finished product as a songwriter, recording artist and band leader. I sincerely hope that it will be only the first of many finished works, though I aim to approach the project as if it were the only and the last.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All that being said, Sister Ivy approaches Patreon to petition for your support. Whatever efforts you make, we promise to push back double or more. Let\u0027s make something transcendent!\u003cbr\u003e"
