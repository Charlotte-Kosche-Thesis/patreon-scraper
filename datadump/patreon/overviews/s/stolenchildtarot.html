This was totally a hands-on labor of love! Each chapbook deck was signed, numbered and packaged by me in hand cut and folded art papers resembling wood grain or green leaf material, tied with hemp cord.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe positive response to the deck in theme and content was HUGE -- requests for me to complete it with the Minor Arcana have been coming in ever since!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I would LOVE to! But I need the resources to devote myself to the large volume of work to produce the remaining illustrations. \u00a0While Kickstarter is a great option if you\u0027ve completed the artwork and are looking for help with printing, I don\u0027t feel it\u0027s the best option for the long term task of helping me get the artwork done. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a big job! \u00a0There are about 50 images needed, plus, if I\u0027m doing this, I want to do it right with a detailed guidebook to go with it. \u00a0I want the final 78 card deck to be just as fantastic and special as the limited Major Arcana deck.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://s19.postimg.org/yxek10jtf/Patron_Packdollar.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter Patreon! \u00a0You support the project by making a pledge per card I complete. \u003cstrong\u003eIt can be as little as a dollar per card and it is only collected if and when each card is completed and posted.\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0Also, you can set a cap per month so it\u0027s never more than you budget for. And if your world changes, you can stop being a pledge supporter at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patreon supporter, you\u0027ll be privy to my process blog with work-in-progress snaps, first looks at pencils and color tests and any other fun behind the scenes stuff I come up with! \u00a0If you supported the Major Arcana creation, it\u0027ll be a lot like the updates I posted on Kickstarter! \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eWhen you become a Patreon patron, two magical tabs will appear on this page: \u0027Creations\u0027, where images of the completed new cards will go and \u0027Activity\u0027 where pencils, work in progress and bits and bobs will go\u003c/strong\u003e (hopefully no cat videos, but I make no promises.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon lets you be a\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ePatron of the Arts and support creators you want to see work from - to help the artist eat, sleep and live, while the work is being done.\u003c/strong\u003e  In exchange, patrons get a look behind the scenes, images of work in progress and communication with the artist in process, as well as exclusive access to the final content. \u00a0Most Patreon pledgers give as little as $1-2 a month to keep a project going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about printed decks?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere are two BIG steps to finishing The Stolen Child Tarot:\u003cbr\u003e1) Completing the artwork\u003cbr\u003e2) Funding a printed deck and book\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon campaign is devoted to getting that first step, completing the artwork out of the way. \u003cem\u003eIt does not cover printing or shipping decks.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0But without completing the art, there won\u0027t be a printed deck!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhen\u00a0the full deck and book are finished I will run a Kickstarter for production funds to print physical copies, but that is a separate project. \u00a0With that campaign, there will be a reward level to thank Patreon supporters. \u00a0Possibly it could include a deck at cost, or a special edition deck or art print - it\u0027s too soon to say. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eMy focus right now is 100% on completing the art.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf all this is new to you, you may be wondering \u003cem\u003ejust who am I anyway\u003c/em\u003e... \u00a0I\u0027m an illustrator that loves symbols, folklore and literature.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI have a portfolio site here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.monicalknighton.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.monicalknighton.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/MonicaLKnighton?ref=hdr_shop_menu\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAnd I sell some work here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also done a lot of creative things with Kickstarter and I feel it\u0027s vital to my reputation as an artist to \u00a0create responsibly researched and budgeted projects where I can deliver on my promises in a timely manner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/projects\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCheck out my projects and track record here!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd below are all the cool pledge levels!
