It\u0027s what I always feel called to do, what I\u0027ve been doing with my resources and time since I was in high school, bringing cookies to give out to strangers in the hallways. From 2012 to 2014, I tried to give away free pie with a project called Pie It Forward, but it ultimately fizzled out because I was too afraid to ask for the money I needed to sustain the project. I didn\u0027t just need money for apples and flour. I also needed money for rent, my phone bill, food.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIronically, it\u0027s very expensive to give things away for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn December 2017, I launched my Etsy shop, Wonder Wagon Emporium (https://www.etsy.com/shop/WonderWagonEmporium). Everything I find or make sells for $5 and ships for a penny, and every item I send out costs an average of $12 to ship. I\u0027m operating at a substantial loss, but I\u0027m doing it because I know it\u0027s what I\u0027m here to do. I want to put art in the hands of people who can\u0027t afford it, the people who need it most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need help on this mission. I need money. Money to buy art supplies, scour flea markets and antique stores. Money to pay my phone bill so I can devote myself to this work full time. Money, so I can buy art from the creators who made it, who can\u0027t afford to give their own art away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading about my mission. I\u0027m grateful for any help anyone can give."
