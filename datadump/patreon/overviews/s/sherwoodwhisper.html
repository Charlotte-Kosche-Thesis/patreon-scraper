    "summary": "Hello there, I\u0027m Sherwood. I\u0027m a graphic artist, a cartoonist to be exact. I draw for kids. I love art and what I find the most amazing is a way of creating something new and unique, something that didn\u0027t exist before and that has the most positive effect on people. I finished art school and have been taking drawing practice seriously for over 15 years, with varying success. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have much authority to protect my art so I don\u0027t normally upload anything concept and I stick to fanart to express myself, entertain people who share the same interests and views with me and show my respect to the masters whose skill I respect and whose characters I love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI find no pleasure in art that is unnecessarily violent, rude, inappropriate, insulting or disturbing in any other way. Although I think there may be exceptions and acceptable perspectives on such, I generally never draw weapons, erotics, demonic creatures, bloody scenes and so on. I would love my art to be more cheerful, inspiring, energetic and heart-mending. My general goal is to grow enough skill to be capable of imagining and drawing anything I\u0027d ever want to, to create art of the same level as the one that once shocked me with it\u0027s impact, the emotions it radiated, the genius simplicity with maximal message, and inspired me enough to tell exactly what I want out of life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my DA gallery, I mostly upload MLP art but with enough audience I\u0027d love to draw more nostalgic art covering many cartoons, shows, films and games that I love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://sherwoodwhisper.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://sherwoodwhisper.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I practice any time I\u0027m able to, I mostly only draw when I\u0027m inspired. I put a lot of efforts and emotions into my art, and though that may not always be visible, I\u0027d love to develop the skills to never waste my positive charge on failing. So I cannot really call myself a professional and I rarely take commissions as driving a bargain and measuring my emotions in bills actually seriously harms my artistic capabilities, especially since customers tend to put me in a golden cage of various conditions. In other words, my own freedom determines the freedom of my pencil. Thus I cannot make big money on commissions and I decided to come to Patreon. I work as a translator and it often feels like I do what I shouldn\u0027t and take someone else\u0027s job. I\u0027d love to save up some money and maybe find a way to work as an artist full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many things I lack. My scanner is old and it takes too much time to operate it. I never had a tablet, I always notice how convenient it could be. Finally, I\u0027d love to pay for some software at last and stop sailing under a black flag. Arrgh. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI draw to share good emotions with people. It\u0027s always for free, I never wanted to charge for what I give. I\u0027d love to keep it that way. If you drive a car, eat at a cafe every day and your clothes are younger than 8 years you\u0027re probably much more wealthy than I am. So if you really enjoy my art and would like to support me - I\u0027ll be glad to any $1 donation. =D \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome artists offer rewards to donators. I don\u0027t know what I could possibly give apart from what\u0027s already online. So I think I wont promise anything for now, I wouldn\u0027t like to disappoint anyone or force the money out with some exclusive content. I suppose if you decide to donate, you already looked at the pictures and smiled, let it count. ^__^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s probably it. I upload about every week, stay tuned. \u003cbr\u003e"
