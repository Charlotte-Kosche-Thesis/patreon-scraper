I write articles about chemistry as it relates to cosmetics, research and write articles about the ingredients we use, and create recipes for bath \u0026amp; body products, all of which I share on the blog. I teach classes at Voyageur Soap \u0026amp; Candle and Windy Point Soap based on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/courses-ebooks/\"\u003ee-books I\u0027ve written\u003c/a\u003e, which include Lotion Making 101 and Facial Products. (All the proceeds from the five e-books currently go to the Rated T for Teen youth programs, which my husband and I developed and facilitate.) And I write a monthly column on cosmetic chemistry for Handmade Magazine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhy pledge a monthly subscription to me?\u003c/strong\u003e Your subscription will allow me more time to write blog posts - my goal is to have a new post every weekday - and more time to experiment in the workshop with new ingredients to create recipes to share with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a thank you for your $10 US subscription, you\u0027ll receive a monthly e-zine filled with formulas and articles, have an exclusive thread in which you can post questions, suggest products and duplications, and read my duplication with an exclusive monthly formula. We often have suppliers, like Lotioncrafter, offering exclusive discount coupons, too. (There are $1, $3, and $5 levels of subscription with different rewards, but all will have access to the feed.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePlease note that your subsciption is in American dollars regardless of country.

I want to continue to offer a blog without paid advertising, sponsored posts, pop ups, or affiliate links, and your subscription allows me to do that along with buying equipment to test and loads of new ingredients.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAs a note: The money you are pledging through Patreon is money that will go to me, Susan Barclay Nichols, and my family.

They continue to be supported by the five e-books through my blog.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of January 2018, I have a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://swiftcraftymonkey.blog\"\u003enew website\u003c/a\u003e with a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/blog/\"\u003enew blog\u003c/a\u003e, and most of what appears there will only be available to Patreon subscribers as my thanks for your lovely subscription and support of the blog.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
