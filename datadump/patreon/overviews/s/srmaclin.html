    "summary": "I\u0027ve been a writer and poet for as long as I can remember.  The earliest story I wrote was when I was 4 or 5, and was about a little blue-haired troll who was afraid of the sky.  I believe my mother still has a copy of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI majored in English and Creative Writing in college, and have a wide variety of poems to my credit, most of which can be found here: \u003ca href=\"http://thesilentpoet.livejournal.com./\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://thesilentpoet.livejournal.com.\u003c/a\u003e I do not update that blog anymore, fyi.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my goals for the new year is to get back into writing.  It\u0027s been a rough last years in finding the sources of my creativity.  Recently, I moved to a new city, and I am finding the new surroundings are helping me to find my voice again.  By using that new-found-again voice,  I hope to write new poems.  I am hoping to finally write the urban fantasy novel I\u0027ve had rattling in my head for the last few years.    \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTentatively titled, The Scholar\u0027s Mate, the urban fantasy novel features horror, mystery and just a wee bit of romance. \u00a0It features Mages (and therefore, magic), and characters who are both good \u00a0AND evil (simultaneously even!). \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will join me on this journey.  I am looking forward to producing some great writings, and more importantly, looking forward to sharing it with you."
