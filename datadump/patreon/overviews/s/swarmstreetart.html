    "summary": "Swarm is a multidisciplinary artist whose mediums include fibre, street \nart, installation, illustration, painting and printmaking. She has been \nexhibiting her work since 2014 in Montreal, Toronto, the Greater Toronto\n Area, and London (UK). Her work is grounded in anti-capitalist, \nanti-colonial, feminist and anti-fascist politics. In their work she \naddress naturally occurring patterns throughout the\n universe, reclamation of identity, and visions of the future. The most \nprominent motifs in their work are skies, star beings, portals, and \notherworldly plants. The star beings represent the artist\u2019s personal \nstruggles with corporeal experience such as gender identity, gender \noppression, being a multiracial person and consequently existing in a \nliminal state. The star beings are vaguely human in shape but are a way \nof dissociating from their body and existing as their true self, which \ngoes beyond the corporeal form. The portals she uses also convey \nliminality on a less personal level. The portals address the need for \nthe abolishment of all forms of oppression and represent the \nliminal state of our society because while we have made progress, we \nstill have a lot of work to do and need to keep pushing forward. The \nportals also exist in Swarm\u2019s work as a future method of time and space \ntravel that does not require resource extractive colonialism. \nAesthetically Swarm uses portals and star beings with the intent of \ninvoking feelings of transcendence, boundlessness and hope for the \nfuture in those who view her work.   \u003cbr\u003e"
