    "summary": "My name is Cameron McAlister, and I go by the stage name of\u00a0\u003cem\u003eKrilley\u003c/em\u003e. I\u0027m 18. I write and perform various styles of hip-hop \u0026amp; rap that carry deeper \u0026amp; deeper meanings, and I release the aforementioned music into the public from a small town in Northwest Florida. For free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, there\u0027s a slight issue with that. You can\u0027t make money off of music if it\u0027s non-profit. In fact, I spent nearly every cent I had after graduating high school, without so much as a job, so that I could produce my voice in some manner for the public to hear. Pretty dumb, right? But it\u0027s true. Then, halfway through the mixtape, \"\u003cem\u003eHELP\u003c/em\u003e,\" I had gotten one at a convenience store, but a few months after the full release, I was forced to leave that job due to not actually doing any work at all. I had zero hours for an entire month. So, here\u0027s where I tell you why I\u0027m here. I\u0027m starting this in order to bring in finances that will help me improve my sound quality and replace equipment as needed, as well as help my living situations, and therefore, motivate me even MORE to give you something more amazing back as my gesture of appreciation, and personalized way of saying\u00a0 \"Thank you for your donation.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you find or have found it in your heart to support an artist, I\u0027m truly grateful, be it me or any other out there struggling to pursue the vivid and beautiful, yet dark and dangerous world of music."

     "about": "My name is Cameron McAlister. I\u0027m 18 years of age. I\u0027ve lived with my great grandmother for 99% of that. I write \u0026amp; perform original lyrics for rap \u0026amp; hip-hop. I\u0027m setting this up because.. well.. because I don\u0027t have a job. We currently live in a trailer park, and even then, we manage to barely get by.. She\u0027s 77 and still working, and I want so much better for her... That\u0027s why I started music. I mean.. who has the heart to be carefree and sit idly by while their mom works her life away?.. And yes, I have been working and searching, everywhere I can manage, but right now, I am unemployed. I want to make her really proud of me one day, but I need to get there before she\u0027s gone.. Anyways, moving on. I also make music to relate to other people through. I tell things I\u0027ve gone/I\u0027m going through, I talk about my family, friends, my hopes and dreams -- \u003cem\u003emy life\u003c/em\u003e. I want to talk to people through my life. And right now, being broke, I don\u0027t have the money to replace the necessary equipment that broke down. Therefore, I can\u0027t talk. I have no voice. And each day that goes by is another day there could have been that one person, searching for an artist that could help them, but everything was too hype and not on the level they needed. I want to prove to everybody that has doubted me, that dreams can become reality. I want to leave my voice and my feelings behind me through a legacy with music. To be in the position to give back one day, to those in need, and show them that the world isn\u0027t just all dark rain clouds. Please, help me to help you. My name is Cameron McAlister, also known as Krilley, and I hope that you will support me in this life-long goal of mine. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
