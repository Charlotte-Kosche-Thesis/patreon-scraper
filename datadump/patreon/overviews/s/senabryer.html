Thanks for checking out my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://puu.sh/zOSF1/283075037b.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am the author of \u003cem\u003eDreambound\u003c/em\u003e, a novel series set in the near future, where a state-of-the-art virtual online game has taken the world by storm.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eDreambound \u003c/em\u003ebegan as a self-published work in 2014, but in 2018 will be re-established under\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://curiosityquills.com\"\u003eCuriosity Quills\u003c/a\u003e, and it will be those newly edited, super fresh chapters that I\u0027ll be posting here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to \u003cem\u003eDreambound\u003c/em\u003e, I am also currently writing the first book to begin an official \u0027extended universe\u0027 alongside Richard Roberts\u0027\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://curiosityquills.com/books/please-dont-tell-my-parents-im-a-supervillain/\"\u003ePlease Don\u0027t Tell My Parents I\u0027m a Supervillain\u003c/a\u003e series. Lastly, I do some work for indie video game studios here and there, most recently writing for the visual novel / kingdom management game,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/765210/Your_Royal_Gayness/\"\u003eYour Royal Gayness\u003c/a\u003e, produced by Lizard Hazard Games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://puu.sh/zOUkw/3056c719b3.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe fiction\u0027s main purpose is twofold: to speculate beyond what is possible, and to then to find some manner to tether it to our reality. For me, nothing does that better than science-fiction. Through the eyes of its wild and imaginative characters, science-fiction invites us to imagine our own futures. As for what kinds of science-fiction I enjoy writing, I love taking speculative technology and seeing how society would react to it, whether it be human-like A.I., planetary conquest, biological immortality, or whatever else our crazy human minds can conjure up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also love bringing my second love into my work: linguistics. Don\u0027t be surprised if you find words in a constructed language in one of my stories, or a sentence in Spanish or in Japanese. Language shapes the way we think, and I want my readers to think outside of their boxes in ways they hadn\u0027t thought of before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://puu.sh/zOWjF/3e0c9b2a49.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo reasons. One, the traditional way is old. Yes, there are those who purchase books the same way they did fifty years ago, and there are those who make their living entirely through such marketplace. All the best of luck to them. I however prefer to be more flexible. By adopting a system of patronage, I may also distribute my work in a serial manner, chapter by chapter, short story by short story. It also allows me to give and take critique with my fans as I am writing rather than once a work is all said and done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second reason is because bills, but I mean - c\u0027mon, we all knew that, right?"
