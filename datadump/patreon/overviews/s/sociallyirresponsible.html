We film all of our sketches and bring them to the public in special comedy shows with live comedy acts in between screened segments of our sketches. We\u0027ll be launching our sketch show on our new youtube channel in April, and will be filming our next batch right after the launch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing videos can be really expensive and time consuming. \u00a0There are a lot of people involved in making these sketches, and so far everyone has worked for free or deferred payment to make it a reality. When you watch our work, we hope you can see the passion and dedication everyone put into making it what it is. \u00a0Your support in our efforts to \"stick it to the man\" in our off brand comedic way, will be \u003cem\u003eENORMOUSLY\u003c/em\u003e appreciated and rewarded!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe joined Patreon to enable our current and future fans the opportunity to help us fund our future work.
