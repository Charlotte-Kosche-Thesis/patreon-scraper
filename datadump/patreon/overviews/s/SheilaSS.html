Creating art means nothing without an audience. \u003cbr\u003eI started my dance life as many little girls do, with ballet and tap dance in preschool. Where I went \"wrong\" was is that somewhere along the way I developed an interest in sensual arts and the power of the feminine. This combination has led me to the burlesque stage.... with a few stops along the way. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a mother, a dancer, an activist and a lover of life. It is time for my art to rise to the next level and I am working on a program that I\u0027m really passionate about. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can be a part of this!! I\u0027m thrilled to share this journey of creating with you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

It would be awesome to get to one big travel / month\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe burlesque world is chocked full of festivals in so many cities around the world. These are how we get major visibility and compete for titles... I don\u0027t tend to do these because we are not payed and they don\u0027t cover our travel costs.... Think of this like you are sponsoring someone to participate in a Miss _____ Pageant. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than festivals, I simply like to go and perform in different cities. I get to bring and share my Sex-a-Peel workshops with people. Yes, I make money, but it really isn\u0027t a whole lot, sometimes it barely covers my travel costs in the first place. then add the time away from the muggle job......\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e**I have an extra special support tier specifically for this.**\u003cbr\u003e",
