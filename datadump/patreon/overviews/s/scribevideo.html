    "summary": "\u00a0 \u00a0 Scribe Video Center is a non-profit organization founded in December 1982 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As a media arts education center, we connect and assist independent producers, emerging video artists, activists, film students and community groups all across Philadelphia. The \"Scribe\" in our name is a metaphor for using electronic recording technologies to document significant contemporary concerns and events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 We invite filmmakers to the region to give lectures on documentary film making, and host screening events for nationally and internationally recognized independent media works. We conduct multi-week workshops so filmmakers of all skill levels gain the means to create their own digital media. Our classes facilitate new approaches to visual form and language in an effort to further the aesthetics of digital media making. We assist local organizations and youth in the production of professional short documentaries through our community production programs including the Precious Places Community Oral History Project, Community Visions, Muslim Voices of Philadelphia, The Great Migration: A City Transformed and the Documentary History Project for Youth. Working with a consortium of community and cultural groups in West Philadelphia, we also co-host the community radio station WPEB 88.1 FM to serve the people who live and work in West Philadelphia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Scribe Video Center was founded by filmmaker Louis Massiah\u00a0as a place where individuals and communities learn media making and explore the use of video as both an artistic medium and as a tool for progressive social change. Since Scribe\u0027s founding, thousands of people from over three hundred and fifty community groups, have filmed their hopes, dreams, passions, and concerns with the our support. Many of these works represent visions, perspectives and understandings that have not been voiced or seen in any other media.\u003cbr\u003e"
