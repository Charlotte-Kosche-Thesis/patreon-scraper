My name is Dominic, though most people call me CM or Sammich or even Sam, pick whichever you prefer, and I am a content creator on YouTube who reviews games with a big focus on Arcade Games, lesser-known Games and my favorite \"Games that are so bad or weird that they are just plain stupid fun like Illbleed on the Dreamcast.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here, reading this and considering supporting me, you probably already know who I am! If that\u0027s the case then thank you so much for even considering it! For those of you who may not know, here\u0027s a little about me and what I do. As I already mentioned above I\u0027m a YouTube content creator and streamer. I\u0027m a one-man show meaning I plan, record, edit, and animate all of my own videos. That takes quite a bit of time but I enjoy the process a lot as it allows me to express my thoughts on video games and more, in a fun and fulfilling way. I never started making videos in an attempt to make millions of dollars or attain some sort of internet-fame but rather because I was inspired by content creators like James Rolf aka the Angry Video Game Nerd, Lindsay Degaust aka RinryGameGame and\u00a0Joey Desena better\u00a0known as Roo from the Clan of the Gray Wolf. Their content\u00a0provided\u00a0me\u00a0with hours of entertainment and always\u00a0left me with a smile, and that is\u00a0exactly what I want to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you decide to support me here on Patreon not only are you supporting my review content, but also my streams, and even other content I\u0027m working on that\u0027s still in its early stages.\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you do know who I am, want to support me, but can\u0027t afford to - don\u0027t worry. There are other ways in which you can help out. Consider showing a video of mine to a friend, liking a video or leaving a comment! Interacting with me on social media or coming to my streams is just as helpful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain thank you for taking the time to consider if you\u0027d like to support me on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHappy Gaming!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
