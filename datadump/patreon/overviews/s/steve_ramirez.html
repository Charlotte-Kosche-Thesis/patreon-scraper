    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eMy name is\nSteve Ramirez and I am a Poet-Warrior, Writer, Educator, Naturalist, World\nAdventurer, and Philosopher who has been writing and teaching for several\ndecades. \u003c/strong\u003eAlthough I\u2019ve traveled and lived around the world, the place I\ncall home is a starkly beautiful island that floats in a sea of prairie, desert\nand scrub. I am fortunate to live, learn and write in the Texas Hill Country.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u2019s no accident that I\u2019m joining Patreon on April 1st,\n2018. Just before Christmas of 2017 after a series of personal tragedies and\nchallenges I chose to resign my position as a college professor and retired my\nTexas Master Peace Officer Commission so that I can focus all my energy toward\nusing the power of words to grow ideas and inspire people to become the best\nversion of themselves. There is tremendous freedom in letting go...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve been told by my readers and former students that I am a\nthought-leader, servant-leader, learner-educator, writer-philosopher, and\nfuturist. I guess these are all good ways to describe me. (I also love to make\npeople laugh.) These same people have been repeatedly\ntelling me that I need to \u201creach a wider audience.\u201d I heard them. Here I am. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have spent the last three-decades serving my country and\ncommunity from within the established systems of government, criminal justice,\nand academia. What I\u2019ve learned is that often these systems are broken, and\nthat they will conspire to camouflage, conceal, and continue their collective\nbrokenness, in perpetuity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u2019ve also learned is that so many amazing\npeople are broken or nearly so, and they need someone to remind them of all the\nthings that deep-down, they already know. I want to be that someone. I care\nenough to try and, I have a few good things to share. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLife, is amazing; it\u2019s also brief. It concerns me that so many\nwonderful people I\u2019ve met across the globe have lost their ability to dream and\nact upon those dreams. We are becoming a world without empathy, love, gratitude,\nvision or courage. We are becoming a world of uninspired replicants. We are\nbecoming a world of passive-beings, rather than a magical world of active living-souls.\nI want to play some role in changing\nthat\u2026 at least, for some of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am a divergent thinker who has recently chosen to live on \u201coblivion\u2019s\nedge\u201d so that I might be a catalyst for change from outside the system\u2019s\ninfluences of power. I have learned all too well that from within the system,\nthere is little hope of evolution or revolution. I wish to be an act of\n\u201cpunctuated-equilibrium,\u201d like the striking of a comet or the flapping of a\nbutterfly\u2019s wings. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd, I\u2019d love to have you travel on this journey with me!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eYou might\nbe wondering, \u201cWhy Patreon?\u201d I\u2019m glad you asked.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cPatreon is a membership platform that\nmakes it easy for creators to get paid.\u201d If you choose to support my leap-of-faith\nfrom being a gainfully-employed part of \u201cthe system\u201d to a freelance fly-in-the\nointment, then I will be able to take you along with me on this adventure that\nwill include my daily short-essay meditations and selected quotes, and, depending upon the rewards level you choose, bi-weekly\ninspirational , mind expanding poetry and commentary, monthly parable-stories\nthat are intended to make you think and learn, and periodic original\nphotography and commentary that will speak volumes about the magic and power of simply being\nalive. At the higher levels of patronage, I will include you in the\n\u201cdeep-think\u201d and innovative articles I will be writing and publishing for a\nglobal audience. You will be the first to see each rough-draft-manuscript and\nwill even be able to volunteer editorial commentary. In other words, you can be\nchange agent poet-warriors, with me! \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e** If you\nbecome a PATRON you will immediately get access to pre-loaded\ninspirational and original short essays, poems, and short-fiction with commentary to inspire and challenge you.
