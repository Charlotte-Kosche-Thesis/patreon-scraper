I am mostly known in the Furry fandom, but I am a lover of all things nerdy. I\u0027ve been a part of the furry community in some capacity since 2001 and am very grateful for how wonderfully they treat their artists. I do streams currently on Tigerdile and Picarto.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStream Times:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMon - Wed : 10am - 1pm PST\u003cbr\u003eMost Fridays : 8pm PST-?\u003cbr\u003eEvery other Sunday : 2pm-9pm PST\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.tigerdile.com/stream/swankyimage/\"\u003eTigerdile\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMy\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://picarto.tv/ShawnTheGirl\"\u003ePicarto\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the goals of this Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still not totally focused, but there are a few regular items going on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am attending Don Bluth University and I will post my homework here on occassion. I try to do Monthly Character Features where I tell you about a character of mine and make a brand new pin-up of them just for Patrons. I have a telegram channel where I ask opinions and also post a link to my pre-order post on FA, so you get a leg up on the competition to sign up for commissions. I am also trying to have a monthly Patreon stream where Patrons get to tell me what to draw.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes I post bonus art, and I hope to be sending out bonus products from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Pledge?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge here will go toward my household and supporting my hobby/career. In exchange you will receive exclusive content, possibly merch, access to a Telegram channel and maybe a Discord Server if there are enough people. I also do exclusive streams and give a heads up on my pre-order commissions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor right now, mostly you should pledge if you would like to help me out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, you mentioned your family a couple times. Tell me about them.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have 5 kids. 2 step sons, and 3 bio-kids. 1 step son lives with his bio mom and is in college, 1 lives with us and got his first job! He is an aspiring artist, and a real good kid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy bio-kids are 8, 5, and 3 years of age. Their nicknames are Monkey, Bug, and Bubba. The two youngest are autistic, but thankfully mild. It\u0027s been a real challenge balancing paying enough attention to my older child while giving the younger ones the patience and help they need to be their best. It\u0027s rough at times, but I love them all dearly and wouldn\u0027t trade them for anything. Monkey is also an aspiring artist and I may occasionally post her art here as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Husbeast, their father, is an amazing guy and works very hard to support us all. He is my lover and best friend and we have been together for 11 years. Husbeast is a big ol\u0027 nerd and I love it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading and considering becoming a Patron!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
