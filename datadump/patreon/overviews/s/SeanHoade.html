Like fiction, or stereo instructions, or what?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\t\tExcellent question, rhetorical device person! Monsieur Hoade, as he is called in restaurants he cannot afford, is in fact the writer of novels, short stories, and irritating limericks, as well as twee website Q\u0026amp;A constructs.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tSe\u00f1or Hoade, as he is called in Miami, started his writing career at age 10, with a three-page screenplay addressing the hot-button social issue of time travel. Like a butterfly within a chrysalis, he has six legs develops within a cocoon of books and cats, and has so far written novels about a murderous RV salesman, about Charles Darwin on the \n\u003cem\u003eBeagle\u003c/em\u003e, and about Lovecraftian monsters attacking an Edwardian household in England. (You know, the same old, same old.) He also writes about zombies, because ZOMBIES.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat\u0027s the South Florida connection? Why does he open himself up to be hurt every year by the Miami Dolphins?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\t\tSignor Hoade, as he is called by the College of Cardinals in Rome, was born in Miami in 1969. His mother\u0027s OB/GYN was said to be Don Shula (who was trying to make ends meet during the off-season), although that might be apocryphal or just a lie by Hoade. He grew up (to the extent that he did) in Margate, Florida, well known as \"not as bad as North Lauderdale\" and the sister city of Margate, England. In the 1980s there was an exchange program between the two cities, in which American students got to go to the exciting British vacation stop on the sea, and in which English students got to come to \"the Gateway to Coconut Creek.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWas he, despite all the evidence to the contrary, educated in some way?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\t\tHoade-ji, as he is called by his army of Indian sycophants, was the prize of Coconut Creek Elementary, the tolerated of Margate Middle, and the scourge of both Coconut Creek High and, to CCHS\u0027s relief, later Boyd Anderson High School in Lauderdale Lakes, where residents are referred to as \"pre-inmates.\" He majored in Philosophy and minored in Cognitive Science at Indiana University South Bend (nickname: \"The Fightin\u0027 Single Mothers and Retirees Going Back to School after 38 Years at the Cardboard Box Factory\"). Not satisfied with the social status and high salary associated with a Philosophy degree, he then got his Masters of Fine Arts in Fiction at the University of Alabama. He then taught at UA for another 3\u00bd years until his unceremonious firing for (no joke) offending the religious sensibilities of a frickin\u0027 idiot one of his alleged \"Honors\" students.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIs it true that writing and, to a lesser extent, teaching writing is the only work that suits him? In fact, the \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e thing he\u0027s ever been able to do well and consistently at a professional or, indeed, human level?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\t\tHoade-san, as the bouncers at Club Sake refer to him on their \"No Longer Welcome\" list, has actually worked at 103 jobs in the nearly 29 years he has technically been a part of the American workforce.\u00a0\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWow. So is he, like, really proud of screwing up at all of these jobs? What kind of irresponsible asshole is this guy?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\t\tMr. Hoade, as he is known in bankruptcy courts throughout our fair land, is \n\u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e proud of having failed at so many jobs. But, as the novelist Thomas Williams told his fiction students (including Alice McDermott, who shared the anecdote) when they asked about the writing life: \"If you can do anything else, kids, do it.\" Hoade feels that he has truly tested that advice, and it is now stunningly obvious to allies and enemies alike that he cannot, in fact, do anything else.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tAt age 445, Hoade no longer denies that writing is his destiny. It is the only thing he can do, and the only thing he wants to do.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHmm. All right. What kind of family does this joker claim?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\t\tAl-Hoadedi, as he is known at the Circle K, has the lovely Ann as his wife of the past 15 years. He was previously married when barely out of high school, and from that starter marriage had three lovely daughters: Kylara, 23, who is the mother of WonderGrandchild Leon, 4; Ginger, 20, whose intellect is almost as fearsome as her gorgeousness; and Alice, 17, the world\u0027s #1 fan of One Direction, which is apparently a 5-boy singing group with the ability to take over teenage girl\u0027s brains. He also has a fantastic sister, Shari (age none of anyone\u0027s bidness), who is married to a mysterious sports fan named Rob.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAnything else we should know?\u003c/h2\u003e\nHoade Sean, as he is known at his favorite opium dens, just wants people to know that he will be living 2014 as the first year of his life\u0027s Second Act, F.
