    "summary": "\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eSot Blogs A Lot\u003c/h1\u003e\n\nHi there! This is Sot\u0027s Patreon blog. You have probably seen my work around furry community circles. I draw a lot of goofy, cartoony furry artwork- big and small alike!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis Patreon page is simple: It\u0027s a \u003cstrong\u003eblog\u003c/strong\u003e first-and-foremost. Updates on this blog appear here before anywhere else! Many updates will also contain work exclusive to patrons. Posts will contain drawings, sketches, full-color pieces and anything else I want to make. Some of these will be under reward tiers that include additional benefits at a low donation cost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI imagine you came to this page and started reading this because you enjoy my work. Let me be real and explain my mantra here for this blog: One single dollar a month from each of my fans will add up, and in return I get to express myself with making more art. The goal posts I have set for this blog- to hammer in this point- are not lofty, but instead very reasonable. I have a job. I got expenses and errands to deal with every month. That\u0027s my life. Does that matter to you? \u003cem\u003eI don\u0027t know.\u003c/em\u003e But what does matter from \u003cstrong\u003eme\u003c/strong\u003e to \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is having more to show you for contributing every month. So, my goal posts reflect what I want the money to bring you- more art- rather than what it will pay for- my bills.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAre you a long time supporter of my work? This blog is perfect for you, and I have a lot we can do together. Are you a new supporter and really want to see more of what I have to offer? A small donation a month will get you so much more too. Any and all pledges will help me live a better life- which in turn helps me create better art for you. Everybody wins.\u003cbr\u003e"
