     "about": "Three decades of Johannes\u0027 life consist of \"hobbies escalating into professions\":\u003cbr\u003e When little Schloerb began to draw caricatures in his early teen years, he soon became the youngest \u003cstrong\u003epolitical cartoonist\u003c/strong\u003e around, doodling for local newspapers on a regular basis besides school. \u003cbr\u003eThat early talent got spoiled when the first affordable \u003cstrong\u003e3D graphics and animation\u003c/strong\u003e software appeared in the early 1990s. Johannes quickly got eyeglasses, gained weight and became a self-taught 3D artist / visual effects specialist, digitally animating stuff for advertisement agencies, eventually founding his own company, aborted school and turned this hobby into a profession, which lasts until today.\u003cbr\u003eLater on, after he bought his first digital photo camera in 2006, he was very soon receiving requests to shoot commercially, which led to regular assignments as a professional (although again just self-taught) \u003cstrong\u003ephotographer\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eFor a much shorter period of time now he is also filming - and passionately so. Again this led to an unexpected success: many of the videos he shot with his plain-old DSLR and edited on his ancient laptop computer reach a wider audience and score better ratings than big-budget productions by professional teams assigned by agencies.\u003cbr\u003eThis \u003cstrong\u003e\"guerilla filming\" \u003c/strong\u003ecould become a self-taught hobby turning into a profession again! If you want to make this happen, just become a patron for 1$ :-)\u003cbr\u003e",
