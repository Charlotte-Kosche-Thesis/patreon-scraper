    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe Survival-Russia Channel is unique in the sense that I try to Entertain and Educate the viewer about Real Survival and Outdoorsman-ship, and at the same time keeping things real and not being a Corporate Shill.\u00a0 Staying independent basically. I buy the equipment I use and present on my Channel. When a creator gets paid to present gear, it changes the \"game\" completely. So A BIG Thank You to all of you who follow and support the Survival-Russia Channel on YouTube! You guys are Awesome :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the revenue on YouTube have been dramatically dropping over the past year or so. 2018 have so far not been any different. The revenue have actually dropped about 50% in January!! The fact that I live in real Wild Country, where we hunt and have predators, I of course touch on subjects such as Firearms (called Printing tools in my videos), Knives, Hunting and Trapping. YouTube is not all that happy about these topics. At one point, I would say +90% of my videos was immediately put on \"Limited or No Ads\". Right out of the gate. Even before the video was published.. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really enjoy making videos, and I know they make a difference in a highly commercialized \"Scene\", so to speak. I show Stuff That Works and The Reality of Survival and Outdoorsman-ship without any commercial interests/interference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou guys who support the channel, are a cornerstone in keeping the channel rolling!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks A Lot To Present And Future Supporters :) I Much Appreciate Your Time And Effort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLars / Survival-Russia\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"

     "description": "Having reached almost 100.000 Subscribers, it would be awesome having 1000 Patrons supporting the Survival-Russia Channel. Why?, you might as yourself. First of all, it takes funds running a good and independent Outdoors/Survival Channel, as i buy almost all of the gear and equipment I use and review. Also, I do not accept the many offers I get from companies and businesses asking if I want to \"review\" their products in return for money and/or sponsorship. I want to stay independent, and I do not want my channel to just another product outlet. After the \"Ad-pocalypse\" on YouTube, the Channel revenue have dropped considerably. Your Support Matters And Help A Lot! Thank You For Dropping By And Supporting The Survival-Russia Channel :)\u003cbr\u003e",
