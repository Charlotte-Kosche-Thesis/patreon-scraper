I have been displayed at galleries as part of group shows in Los Angeles. I have sold art to admirers of my work in California, New Jersey, Oregon, Illinois, Wisconsin, and the United Kingdom. I primarily do Abstract, Expressionist, Pop Art, Surreal drawings and paintings, or an intermingling of various styles according to my whimsy. I also dabble in poetry, lyrics, and prose so there may be a fair bit of that here as well. Though I rarely dip into puerile waters, I have made this an \"Adult\" site in the event I end up painting the odd sexual organ or three, or write something spectacularly horrid and ill-informed. A thrill a minute, folks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u00a0I have too many pots boiling, as us creative types often do. I suspect Patreon will provide an excellent means of personal incentive to continue and finish specific artistic goals from month to month as well as an opportunity to learn, grow, and share what my weird brain has to offer. \u003cbr\u003e"
