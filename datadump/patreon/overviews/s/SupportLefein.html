My work began mostly with bug fixes ignored or missed by the original developers. Once I began sharing my work with people I would meet from forums to Steam I started to receive requests, for this or that, for which I would gladly do when I was capable of what was asked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more requests I began to get the more I started delving into experimenting with game mods to see what I was capable of doing as for my own original non requested work. After I started creating things I wanted to use for myself, I would offer to share them with friends. After all, the work wasn\u0027t requested and it was completely original, I didn\u0027t think too many people would be interested. I made things that suited my own personal tastes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot long after I started getting requests to collaborate on projects, I did this on condition of anonymity. The internet was a scary place to me!\u003cbr\u003eAs time went on I discovered I really liked working with Skyrim modding, there were so many mods and things you could do with Skyrim it was only natural I would spend allot of time working the development kit, and because I loved not only creating mods but using them; over the time I spent with it I amassed quite a collection of mods from various authors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was during my time with Skyrim, because the game has incredible longevity that mod authors began to fall away from Skyrim modding leaving their works hidden, deleted, unusable because of updates, broken, or made back when tools were much more crude and not as advanced - effectively rendering them potentially dangerous to your install to use. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at this time, I discovered I had a real knack for rebuilding old abandonware mods. I found I had an even better knack for combining the assets left behind in these mods into entirely new creations!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I discovered I could not only breathe new life into old broken and unusable mods but I could recreate entirely new things out of them; I felt I had really found my place. Not in the community, but just within what I truly enjoyed.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s hard to explain the feeling of having something someone poured their time and effort into being lost to time, filled with errors (and in more than one instance with viruses in them!) and totally broken; Wake up into being something completely new and exciting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I work on a mod that was made 5 years ago by someone who just left it hidden on an old forum because they had to leave the community or whatever varying reason, or left just incomplete; I feel like it\u0027s almost a spiritual collaboration with a person in another time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe saddest part about my best work, is no one is able to use it. However that\u0027s what modding is for me, I love to do it. Sure it\u0027s great when it\u0027s something I can share, but overall it\u0027s truly what I enjoy. It doesn\u0027t matter to me not all my work can be released. That\u0027s not what drives me through completing projects that can range from 100 hours, to 1000 hours, it\u0027s the work I enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will see in my Patreon posts how I feel about work I release. I personally feel we modders, condition the people we release our work for into utilizing our work. That when we abandon them after that conditioning it is not only irresponsible, it\u0027s going against the entire reason we choose to release our work to the public in the first place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is reason I will always, no matter the circumstances maintain anything I publically release. Not only do I maintain all my work, but you will find I respond to each and every person I possibly can on any forum my work is posted to.\u003cbr\u003eWhether it\u0027s an error, a bug, a crash or a complaint you will always find me at least attempting to address any issue that may arise while someone is using my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you choose to use my work, you\u0027re entering into a relationship with me personally; Not only do I cherish this relationship, I also take it very seriously, and very personally. You\u0027re effectively under my care because you\u0027re using my work. I feel responsible for your experience when you\u0027re gaming, I feel responsible for bugs you might experience, and I am dedicated to making sure you have the most comfortable and carefree experience I can possibly provide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll notice all my mod work comes with a dedicated Tech support discord server, that is available 24 hours per day, every day of the week. I make absolutely sure there is always someone on hand at any time of the day to assist with bugs, crashes, questions, installation or just conversation about the mod work I provide to the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is who I am, and I stand by my work, and by the community along with the people who have gathered around it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI originally needed to seek Patronage to assist a friend of mine I was supporting financially. I couldn\u0027t take the extra time while making enough money support myself, and her simultaneously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of today, October 5th that necessity has come to an end. My friend has settled her case and has been paid for her injury and will no longer require my financial support.\u003cbr\u003eTo each person who went out of their way to support her (The Patreon money went to her directly, which in turn supported me as I didn\u0027t have to provide as much) you have my absolute eternal gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are no words in any language that could equal what everyone of you has made possible. \u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not just money, you fed someone who otherwise would have gone hungry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe outpouring of support she\u0027s gotten these past several months has been overwhelming.\u003cbr\u003eFrom the bottom of my heart, and hers: Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those donating now, I would implore you to end your patronage. You have gone above and beyond, and you deserve to be praised.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have reverted my Patreon account back to my sole proprietary control, any donations received will fund my ability to cut back from working 3 contracts at once, to hopefully just 1. I currently do any work available to me regardless of my current workload. I have a year of losing over half of my income I am trying to recover from. There were many things I had to live without, and many necessities I just couldn\u0027t afford.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was worth every bit of it. It just wasn\u0027t the most comfortable way to live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you think of supporting, please read over the goals; That is exactly what I will do with the support. That way you can decide if that will suit your conscious choice to support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will always support my work, and the people who use it with or without Patronage;\u003cbr\u003eNot only do I find people who ignore the communities of people who follow them and use their work disgusting, I owe this community a debt of gratitude and a responsibility that has humbled me greatly. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI, am as some of you know the creator of World Difficulty. I am also a mod author of various games (when time permits) with World Difficulty being the one of longest projects I\u0027ve ever worked on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than 1,000 hours went into the project that probably brought you here. Many roadblocks and many late nights. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would have quit, as creating mods was then, and is now a hobby of mine. I don\u0027t always finish them due to time constraints, however with World Difficulty the community rallied behind it like honestly nothing I\u0027ve ever seen for Dragon\u0027s Dogma.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDD:DA has a small community, however it is the most dedicated of any community to come from a modern game release. My goal with World Difficulty was to create the game we all wished it was during it\u0027s 2012 release. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a full year and more than 1000 hours, 2000 if you count all the hours from the army of testers it had prior to release; It has brought you here to, (now let\u0027s be honest, I\u0027m not curing cancer or anything) my humble Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere was of course the recent update to DDDA two years after the games release, because of this World Difficulty will need to be rebuilt, from scratch - That\u0027s something right now I can\u0027t afford to do even with my income being my own again. This is my lowest earning period of the year, with my PC crashing repeatedly and destroying my assets I am having to carefully persist with the updates it requires. The most recent failure resulted in my losing all of the development assets on my drive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the Nexus had the current version; so I\u0027m using that to continue to work on World Difficulty.\u003cbr\u003eThere are so many people I am responsible for who use my work, I will get even the smallest of patches posted as soon as I can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe new update has included some coding changes, that I could utilize to hopefully great effect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have chosen to support me, you have my eternal gratitude. \u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s be honest if you have made a donation I probably cried a little. I can\u0027t help it, I\u0027m still getting used to this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this,\u003cbr\u003eCorrinne Lefein No\u00ebl\u003cbr\u003e"
