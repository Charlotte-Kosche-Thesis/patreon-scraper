Where do all these emotions - the writhing of jealousy, the weight of guilty, the flutters of excitement, or vast changing tides of love - come from? How can one not just express these, but actually steal away with the hearts, minds, and imaginations of casual viewer, transporting them to these emotional planes of existence with just one glance? And futhermore, how is this possible when only rendering that which can be seen? All this and more I seek to understand and demonstrate through my art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(216, 216, 216);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(165, 165, 165);\"\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0PAST, \u00a0PRESENT, \u00a0FUTURE \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver a decade of my life has been dedicated to the study of classical figure art, and I have been lucky enough to have studied under many of the greatest contemporary classical figure artists as well as for three years in an atelier, spending more than forty hours a week in a group studio, embarking on the rigorous exercises used by artists from the renaissance through the turn of the century. Rendering the classical through portrait and nude study had been by life\u0027s work, and it was both a calming and meditative experience.\u00a0Concurrently, when confronted with thoughts or ideas which I felt compelled to explain through my artwork, I turned to illustration with pen, ink and watercolor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeginning on Valentine\u0027s Day 2013, the stability of my life took a turn for the worse, the disasters exponentially growing in both magnitude and frequency, culminating in a breaking point in both my life and my work. A water main exploded in December of 2013, flashflooding my fourth story apartment, and annihilating everything I owned and had known. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough the repercussions were catastrophic and far reaching (even to this day), the most important way it changed my life was for the better; the packing paper and tape meant to pack my water logged belongings was tacked insteadto the bare white walls of my temporary housing, and I began to draw. More importantly, I began to find what I never knew I was looking for: a path.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese drawings are raw emotions, memories of moments that stuck with me, and they are drawn without reference to any models, photographs, or life drawings. The drawings that have been made since then use only what was left to me in the nothingness: the memories and feelings that I clung to, a life preserver in a tsunami. They are absolutely real, they are absolutely fantasy, and they are entirely the Truth as I know it to be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(165, 165, 165);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(165, 165, 165);\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 WHAT MY WORK MEANS TO ME, TO YOU \u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, I\u0027m still trying to understand this myself. To me, they are the only way I know how to make sense of and come to terms with extremely traumatic circumstances, and the only way I know how to express myself, calm down, and begin to disentangle my thoughts, which I often find knotted up and snarled in even through the course of a normal day. Anything I can put on paper is something I can work and rework until I can understand the what, the why, and the how. In understanding, there is calm; in each completed drawing, a weight lifted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI realize that every artist will say that their art is meaningful to the world, but I don\u0027t think I\u0027m qualified to speak to the thoughts of others on this. What I can say is that this is the first time I have ever made art for myself. As a classical figure artist, you\u0027re trained to either render what you see before you, or to (sometimes sensibly) idealize a portrait, especially if commissioned portraiture is how you can afford to pursue the classical nude, pay your rent, or choose whether or not you were able to eat all your meals. This art was not made for you. Quite frankly, this art was the only art I\u0027ve ever made for me. I was never intending for these emotional timepieces to be shown. In fact, they weren\u0027t even supposed to be finished pieces. To me, the importance lies in the long journey the piece represents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, when shown, the reaction of others was shocking. People got angry, people cried, people started talking to each other about important things - events in their own lives that hurt or healed them. Some people withdrew into themselves, and others couldn\u0027t confront them. These responses to my work were so strong and vehement in both action and reaction that I now an coming to realize that it does means something to others as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf it means something to you, in any way, please let me know. Write in my guest book (below) to let me know how you are affected or donate to support my life\u0027s work. By donating even a dollar, you are part of it too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(165, 165, 165);\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0WHY DONATIONS ARE INTEGRAL TO MY WORK \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike almost every artist here, the more money I can raise for my art through my art, the more time I have to make art. Right now, my choices are these (and yes, they\u0027re very real and present and I have done all of these things):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Work a high paying but mentally and emotionally draining job in order to keep a roof over my head and be able to once in a while throw whatever stores of energy I have left over in to my art in the middle of the night, and only when I\u0027m able to leave work at work (difficult if you\u0027re invested and committed to what you do) and remember what I\u0027m actually doing it all for.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Work a low paying, unstimulating job which leaves my mind free for drawing, but probably requires more physical exertion and/or more hours on the job in order to keep a roof over my head and be able to once in a while throw whatever stores of energy I have left over in to my art whenever I can power through the exhaustion to draw until my body physically collapses, disregarding my pure power of will.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Work only artwork, grant writing, self promotion, and show submissions knowing that one has less than 45 days until absolute eviction. Requires almost constant prayer for a miracle, but is generally a rather blissful experience as it can only be achieved when one absolutely cannot survive without the ability to create and is willing to give up everything, including any semblance of a future, just to live as one knows that they were meant - if only to have had six weeks of living in perfect happiness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd believe you me, my art is not two hours of painting with a glass of wine. My art is not an after school special. When I\u0027m working,\u003cem\u003e truly working\u003c/em\u003e, days and nights pass without ever being noted. I lose myself to it, I\u0027m in it, and it\u0027s rarely ever somewhere one wants to be. In order to come to terms with these emotions bourne of traumas and tragedies -- so strong in their presence that they even manifest physically, in an inability to breathe, a racing mind I cannot quiet, a knot in my stomach, a dread that can only be confronted in understanding in order to conquer -- I am returning to places, people, feelings, and moments that cannot simply bandage and forget. In my art, I am returning to a hell that time has, at least, allowed me escape. I throw myself into my work until I cannot physically stand, sit, or lift a brush in order to recover all that I have lost among the levels of my own inferno......... an undertaking which cannot be relegated to the two hours before my alarm for my day job as a underpaid service worker could ever permit. In addition, I get dirty, and I mean, REALLY, REALLY dirty. My artwork is, unfortunately for me, not conducive to any other lifestyle besides... well, making art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to prove that there is still a place for creatives in our fast paced and all too quantifiable world. Your dollar means the world to me, because it\u0027s another minute that I have to work on this art instead of having to dedicate to any form of making a living by other means -- if I had enough donors, art \u003cem\u003ecould\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cem\u003ebe\u003c/em\u003e my living and not just my purpose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born with the desire and drive to make art; I have dedicated myself to training in technique and form; through tragedy, I finally found my voice. What could possibly be missing? Those factors together are a gift I never thought to have for myself, nor did I ever speculate on what it would be like to have them, muchless have them and not be able to use them. Time, the only missing piece, the only thing, for me, which can be measured in currency. What time means to me: not worrying about one\u0027s certainty of having shelter or food or running water.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSure, it would be really nice to also have a treehouse, a batmobile, and a personal drumline, but they are all inconsequential to what would make me truly happy and fulfilled in this life (which if I haven\u0027t said it enough, it is, and always has been, making my art). My ultimate goal would be the ability to devote myself part time to my artwork, which means cutting down the hours of my day job. This would mean I am looking for a way that my art could pay for half of my life: $650 per month would mean half of my rent, my food, my utilities, and my very basic necessities are paid.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Hello! My name is Sydney M. Pertl. Figure art has been my sole pursuit for over half of my life, but it is only recently, upon the complete and total annihilation of my life (due to a house flood) that I have begun to feel as if I were coming in to my own as a professional artist. After a full exhausting year of working various jobs in order to\u00a0break even -- and not succeeding --\u00a0\u00a0I have, as of January 4th,\u00a0decided to pursue my art full time, for my own happiness and sanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn these few short months, I have already had countless opportunities, such as my first solo art exhibition, an invitation to participate in a residency, and future planned gallery shows! Much of this has been made possible with the support from friends, fans, and lovers of my work. Recently, a friend asked if I had a Patreon account, and, upon further research, I have decided to start one!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is really\u00a0amazing because you can support the creations and creators you personally like; and you can pledge as much or as little as you would like to their career. Even one dollar a month can make a huge difference! I take private commissions, sell prints of my original artwork, as well as the artwork itself, but having a more consistent form of support per month is incomparable to my own sense of stability in my role as an artist. In the past, artists were supported by their patrons, their work and talents celebrated by the people. Patreon is an amazing return to that concept. If you like my work, please consider supporting it. Every dollar is appreciated more than you can imagine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have elected to receive any contributions on a monthly basis\u00a0instead of per piece, as I will be uploading many sketches alongside the larger works, which usually take anywhere from one to two months to complete. I am extremely interested in illustration and fairy tales in my sketches, and my larger works are currently focused on personal memories and serve as a coping mechanism for various traumas in my life. Every day that I am able to focus on my artwork, I am happier, more fulfilled, and ever closer to my dream of one day being able to support myself with my artwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo learn more about my art, feel free to visit my website, where you can view all of my\u00a0past and current works\u00a0at: \u003ca href=\"http://www.SydneyMPertl.com\"\u003ewww.SydneyMPertl.com\u003c/a\u003e or my etsy, where you can buy prints of my work: \u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/SydneyMPertl\"\u003ehttps://www.etsy.com/shop/SydneyMPertl\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was also recently featured on local tv for my very first solo exhibition at the Addison Gallery, which you can see here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe height=\"315\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or comments. I\u0027d love to hear from everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for looking, and for your support, in any of its various forms.\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eSydney M.

Meeting this goal means more work for you to see, enough supplies for me to create them, and all my dreams come true. Any amount over this is more than I could ever hope for, but, just in case, every dollar exceeding my goal means affords me the supplies and equipment to take on the bigger art projects which have thus far been financially out of reach; for example, the amount and colors of oils needed to paint in a far larger scale, \u00a0figurative sculptures drafted in clay and cast in resin translated from The Sentry drawings, kinetic musical instruments powered by Seattle\u0027s weather, and much, much more!

Perhaps this doesn\u0027t seem like a lot of money, but when one works on a commissioned basis, finances are pretty variable month to month. Nothing is worse than needing to get an idea down on paper, but then having to use far less ideal mediums (markers, harder charcoal, fingerpaints, haha) - basically, things that are not so free flowing or tactiley. My first goal is definitely to make enough to have consistency in the influx of the art supplies which are, of course, pretty integral to the making of my work :)",

I\u0027ve only recently discovered that it seems that most non-artists were unaware of this cost for working artists. While there are many calls that are free to enter, although typically these are for state and government sculpture or public art commissions, and I apply for every free call from non-profit arts organization gallery shows and grants, although having the ability to submit my work to an entirely different audience: gallery owners and jurors consisting of those who make their career in the arts or arts promotion. With any single call I am able to enter because of this extra $35 per month, I see boundless opportunities. Whether or not my art is accepted for a solo or group show, it will be placed in front of a panel of jurors who, should my work touch them in some way, may singularly have the power to offer me a show (or, even possibly a contract with their gallery), want to showcase my work in an arts publication, or even just tell others that they saw works that they liked. This kind of opportunity, for me, would be incredible. The more people I can reach with my artwork, the more chance I have of reaching someone who can help me realize my dream of absolute financial independence while making the work I need and love to create!",
