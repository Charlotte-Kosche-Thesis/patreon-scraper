    "summary": "My name is Caleb Shiraki, and I have always loved to tell stories. When I was younger, my brothers and I would invent worlds for us to share adventures in. Now that I\u0027m older, I tell my children and wife stories. Yet these worlds in my head just won\u0027t go away. They float there in my mind, trying to make me tell their tales, tales of love and loss, of betrayal and greed, hatred and war. And of magic. In almost all of my worlds, magic exists.\u003cbr\u003eIn one world, the sun has gone, only the stars light the sky. Yet magic keeps the world alive, shining through every plant, gleaming in every drop of water. The world glows with magic, shimmering and alive. In this world the magic of light is tantamount, otherwise, how would humans survive? Humans are not nocturnal, and thus need light to live.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn another world, an ancient war between humans and dragons has driven the fire-breathers into near extinction, with only a few thousand left. The human empire has stretched to cover almost the entire continent, and the dragons are forced into hiding at the far reaches of the globe. Another civilization, a loosely connected group of were-tribes, has begun to unite against the superior forces of the humans.\u003cbr\u003eThe adolescent years of Merlin. Set not in some mythical lost island or continent, but in real places. Our world, if magic had been part of our history.\u003cbr\u003eI started the ShirakiReads blog in order to get some of my ideas out there, as well as to just start writing. It has been an interesting experience, and I\u0027m hoping that Patreon, and all of you guys, will help me continue.\u003cbr\u003eI have hundreds of potential stories floating around in my brain, each of them clamoring to get out into the world. With your help, they\u0027ll get there.\u003cbr\u003e"
