    "summary": "I\u0027ve been modding ARK for around half a year, trying to mod in a somewhat forgotten style. Vanilla-balanced modding has been shunned and overcast by overhauls, and many players miss a traditional kind of mod, back in the days of such like tameable titanoboa or small dragons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Additional Creatures and Pyria: Mythos Evolved, I\u0027m simply trying to do just that, but on a much larger scale. Large and expansive mods focused on balanced vanilla gameplay, adding new challenges and rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditional Creatures started off as just a small mod adding in two creatures: Acrocanthosaurus (since the ARK fanbase wanted it so heavily), and Megaraptor (since it was the favorite dinosaur of a close friend of mine). Since then, Additional Creatures has evolved into an expansive, immersive mod with 43+ new balanced dinosaurs and creatures to the game.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePyria: Mythos Evolved was founded with the idea of a true, medieval fantasy experience within the game of Ark. As of current the mod, like Additional Creatures, adds new creatures to the world of ark, but are balanced, and with a mythology theme to them. The eventual idea behind Pyria is to go much farther than just creatures. New items, new weapons, buildings, and even armor is the eventual plan with this mod. This idea came from being \"ripped-off\" by a once controversial mod that added fantasy creatures, as friends and I wanted to see these same creatures added in game, just not haphazardly. Now, it\u0027s grown into a full on experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of current, all my creatures and models are bought from online sites. As many who doubt the mods call them \"just another port model mod\". Pyria and Additional Creatures are no such thing. The idea of \"just another port mod\" was born from Monster Ark: Hunting Evolved. In the rush to try and create a similar mod to build on the hype that was generated, many questionable modders made port-mods that were of extremely questionable quality. One of these became the idea behind Pyria. Most of the port models had bad textures, were extremely buggy, and had no sound. With Pyria, and Additional Creatures on the other hand, I\u0027ve gone much farther than just simple \"throwing in a new model\". I\u0027ve tried to make aim offsets, turning and running offsets. I\u0027ve given them sounds, as well as unique roles. Not just \"another creature\", but \"another creature with a\u00a0 purpose\". Something that feels like an actual ark critter in use, and not a brash attempt at popularity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to fully flesh out both Pyria and Additional Creatures into true masterpieces: especially the former. With your support, I can gain access to higher-quality models. I can easily also hire on additional help onto the dev team. If I could hire or recruit a talented animator, that means we wouldn\u0027t need pre-animated assets. If I hired on a rigger and model designer, that means I wouldn\u0027t need to buy assets. I\u0027d also be able to provide a wide array of servers for supporters, as of current, only Pyria has an official PVE server, and the cap is quite low...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can find the generosity to help me, I can promise that I will truly make it worth your while. As I learn and grow, i\u0027m meeting new friends and teachers, and discovering amazing things that help me make my mods better and better for all who play them. Your support helps keep me going in easily providing quality content. My dream is with enough support, I\u0027ll be able to push out even better high-quality content. Modding and creation is my dream: and I would love to be able to continue this at an even higher efficiency and quality. Thank you for your time, and your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Sincerest regards,\u003cbr\u003e-Shadlos\u003cbr\u003e"
