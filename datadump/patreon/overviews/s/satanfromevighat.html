    "summary": "This is Satan from Evig Hat and as you may have noticed, Evig Hat hasn\u0027t released as much as it used to back in 2014/2015. The reason for this is quite simple, I have been working on other stuff. What other stuff you ask? Well, I\u0027ve been making dungeon synth under the name Nazgal Dracul, I\u0027ve made some albums with my good friend Ishavsgrim as Bongskrap and Hillbilly Blitzkrieg, I\u0027ve tried to make some youtube videos (such as this one \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uxpSc4N4to\u0026amp;t=450s\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uxpSc4N4to\u0026amp;t=450s\u003c/a\u003e), I\u0027ve been making some viking inspired music under the name Mikill, I tried to make a low budget horror movie (it wasn\u0027t good, but it did take up alot of time), I\u0027ve been making Evig Hat of course and I\u0027ve been busy contemplating my invetiable demise. Now how the fuck do I pay for all this shit? That\u0027s simple, welfare. However, all though my welfare keeps me going it would be nice to live of my art and entertainment instead, and this is why I started this patreon. Will it work? Probably not. I don\u0027t see people paying much for my shit anyways, so I don\u0027t see anyone giving up their parents cash for something I\u0027ll release for free anyway. I\u0027ll have some exclusives and perks and stuff, but all of my albums and videos will at all times be made availible for free on designated websites. So yea, I really appreciate all support any of you will be willing to give me, and if you don\u0027t want to pay for any of my shit then I do appreciate checking it out, giving it a chance. I think my music is pretty good, I dare even say most of my albums are underappreciated classics. Also my youtube vids aren\u0027t all that bad. So please at least consider checking out some of my shit if you\u0027re into extreme metal and shit, and if you like it, feel free to give me some currency for expenses and shit if you so desire.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo yea, hail Satan.\u00a0"
