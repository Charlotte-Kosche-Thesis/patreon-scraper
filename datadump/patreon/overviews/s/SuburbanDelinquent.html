    "summary": "Hi I\u0027m Suburban Delinquent... a YouTube creator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating this page was difficult. I \u003cstrong\u003eHATE\u003c/strong\u003e that it\u0027s come to this! For the longest time I\u0027ve frowned upon other creators who had Patreon pages. Typing this truly sickens me. So here goes...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Beginning\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrior to my YouTube channel I went through a real tough patch. I was losing both my father and my grandmother to cancer (RIP to the both of them). To top it off I had also lost my job and was on the verge of financial ruin. Life wasn\u0027t good and I was terrified. I was having trouble coping with everyday life and fell into a state of depression that left me unmotivated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u0027t have many options. One clear option was to sell pretty much everything I had in order to pay bills and keep my family above water while I struggled to find a new job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Idea and the Inspiration\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings weren\u0027t getting any better for me, I was having a really bad time finding a job. I felt lost and didn\u0027t have a clue what my next step would be. I had a moment of clarity and I asked myself a couple of questions...\u003cbr\u003eWhat am I good at? - Riding motorcycles\u003cbr\u003eWhat are my favorite things to do? - Eat and ride motorcycles\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thought of something I had seen months ago on YouTube at a friends house but couldn\u0027t remember exactly what it was. I called my friend (Gabriel) and asked, \"Who was that dude\u00a0ripping around San Bernardino on his shitbox ZX6 while talking to himself?\". He replied... \"BakerXdereK\"!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Gift\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor my birthday I asked my wife for a GoPro, and microphone. We were tight on money so she searched and found a killer deal on a Hero3+ black and she bought it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe had no idea the gift would have such an impact on our lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Delinquent is Born\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI uploaded my very first video on May 20th of 2014.\u003cbr\u003eThe video was horrible. My voice was shaky, my thoughts were scattered, and I found it almost impossible to talk and ride at the same time. I also struggled with editing (still do).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then It\u0027s been exciting journey. Being Suburban Delinquent has helped me in so many ways. It gave me strength, made me feel whole and filled so many voids I had lingering in me. Suburban Delinquent gave me purpose. A platform to share a positive experience and message with the rest of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have traveled over 50,000 miles and have uploaded about 300 videos, serving nearly 40,000,000 views with almost 400,000 subscribers! Can you believe it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Change\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMarch 2017 things have taken a turn for the worse. Many creators (including myself) just cant win with YouTube.\u00a0\u00a0I have done my best to align myself to YouTube\u0027s idea of \"advertiser friendly content\" but have failed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube has pulled the ads from many of my videos, even after manually reviewed. I\u0027ve repeatedly asked them for specific guidelines only to be ignored. YouTube has also \"deleted\" videos from my channel without any explanation. Only after I notice that they are deleted and send a formal complaint will they reinstate them. Their response is \"Sorry about that.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve asked why the videos aren\u0027t ad worthy only to get their generic \"video guideline\" response. It feels like screaming underwater. Nobody can hear you and if you keep at it you will drown in frustration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hate complaining... Sorry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo... Let\u0027s get real.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always tried to upload fun, positive videos that are drama, hate, political, and religion free. Nobody wants to hear that shit, and I don\u0027t care to talk about it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe direction for my channel has always been simple. I want you to sit back in your chair click the play button and let me take you on a adventure.\u00a0A fun and exciting adventure free of drama, and other crap that always seems to get in the way of fun.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA 7-10 minute vacation that steals your thoughts from the stresses of the day and to bring you with me as I navigate the roadways of Souther California. An adventure seeking out some of the best local spots California has to offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany creators are frustrated and are abandoning their channels. Others are providing really bad content to beef up the pay. Some (including myself) REFUSE to upload watered down content and have to ask their fans for help in order to keep going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to upload \"watered down\" and bland videos just to be able to pay my bills. I am asking for your support and I hate myself for doing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease support my Patreon and allow my channel to continue in the direction that we all know and love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eSuburban Delinquent\u003cbr\u003e"
