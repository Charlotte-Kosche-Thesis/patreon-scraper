I\u0027m a long time artist, designer, and where my true love really roots itself, a comic story teller. I graduated from the Savannah College of Art and Design and frolicked out into the world with a BFA focus on comic and story boarding, where I now drink fancy beers and draw neat monsters full time. My art can be found around various \n\u003ca href=\"http://skulldog.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eonline sites\u003c/a\u003e as well as \u003ca href=\"http://theskulldog.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy main webpage\u003c/a\u003e. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://paperfangs.com/asis/artcontestbanner.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat I\u0027m doing \u003c/h3\u003e\nFor the last five years \n\u003ca href=\"http://paperfangs.com/asis/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy only major comic story telling project has been consistently updating my current webcomic Asis\u003c/a\u003e, with an average of six pages at the start of each month. Each page takes me roughly six hours start to finish, time that is all but unpaid as I share this comic online for free. Finding the spare time to work on any other comics on the side has been near impossible, as even a short project under 20 pages would end up taking well over a year to finish. With the support coming into this Patreon I\u0027m able to take extra time off from my other paid work to both focus on keeping Asis going stronger, as well as give myself the needed time to get other projects finished in a more timely manner. And boy, do I ever have a ton of stories I want to tell, let\u0027s get them all out on paper.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor this Patreon I plan to continue to use Asis as the focus, adding extra pages and side stories as goals are met and held. A second comic project will cycle in and out as certain stages of work are in progress, because it\u0027s a lot less interesting to get a month of boring script updates than it is to see pages. Projects listed as \u0027Current\u0027 are actively being posted monthly here, while ones listed as \u0027On Hold\u0027 are quietly being worked on in the background, usually scripts and thumbnails.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eCurrent story projects : \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://paperfangs.com/asis/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAsis :\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n--Set in a fantasy world ravaged by the lingering effects of a god killed by the very race he created.
