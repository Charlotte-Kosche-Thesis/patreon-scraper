ScreenPrism has grown rapidly in the past months, and it\u0027s all thanks to you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have even bigger visions for the future to become the ultimate destination for movie \u0026amp; TV analysis, but we need your help to get there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support on Patreon will help us create even more videos. You can also communicate with us more directly and tell us which videos you want to see most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho We Are\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eScreenPrism is the definitive source for Film \u0026amp; TV explanations and analysis. We create entertaining video essays exploring popular movies \u0026amp; TV shows: hidden symbols, underlying meanings, visual techniques and greater context.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Mission\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur mission is to deepen appreciation of the entertainment we\u0027re watching. Audiences today are savvier and think more deeply about what they see onscreen. They want to engage, discuss, and connect with others online. That\u0027s where we come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Origin Story\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHi, we\u0027re Debra and Susannah, and we founded ScreenPrism because we love watching and thinking about movies and TV. We would walk out of a movie theater or finish a TV show and immediately want to know more. Sometimes there was a specific question, like\u003cem\u003e what happened at the end of Inception\u003c/em\u003e, and other times it was something more interpretive, like\u003cem\u003e what does winter symbolize in Game of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e. We both studied film at Yale and wanted to continue the great conversations we had in film classes out in the world. We believe there are a lot of other curious people like us who want to dig deeper, so we set out to build a shared community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo much of our world today revolves around visual storytelling, but we don\u0027t learn how to read visual language in school. Understanding pop culture and the stories we share is key to interpreting our world and our times.\u00a0We bring our own expertise in film and visual storytelling, along with \nour network of writers, researchers, professors and collaborators, to \noffer viewers helpful insights on these subjects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a movie and TV fan with a curious mind, and if you share our love of good stories, then join our community and help us grow.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
