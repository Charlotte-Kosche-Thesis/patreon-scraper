She is a non-identical twin and is the younger of the two by just one minute. She spent her early years near the seaside town of Bognor Regis, and moved to Cambridge in her younger years. By the time she was of school age she and her family had moved back to West Sussex and were living in a small village near the town of Littlehampton. Fiction has always been Stacey\u0027s passion, and she began by writing in the fantasy genre when she was in her mid-teens. Unfortunately her first work was lost to a computer malfunction in the days of the floppy disk, and she was left with only a few scant chapters remaining of this first book. To this day it is an ambition of hers to re-start and finish that first book, but her horror writing is her primary focus. Stacey was introduced to the world of horror at a young age thanks to the likes of R.L Stine, and then the accidental viewing of one of the halloween series at the age of 8 years old. She instantly developed a taste for horror and has never looked back. An avid reader of horror fiction, and watcher of horror films, she was introduced to the world of more adult horror writing by her mother lending her a copy of the magic cottage by James Herbert. After that fateful reading she avidly sought out his work, and he remains one of her favourite authors. Stacey also enjoys the writings of Dean Koontz, Richard Laymon and Stephen King. Primarily interested in supernatural horror, Stacey has a real love for \u0027creature feature\u0027 style books and films. She greatly enjoys blending the unreal elements of this type of writig with real human horrors, which ground the supernatural elemnts of her literature. She also enjoys tackling taboo subject matter, and including day to day realisms in her writing to keep her stories and characters relatable despite the fantasy elements. Not only is Stacey an author, but also a keen animal lover, artist and cancer survivor. She has a passion for unusual animals and is especially fond of hairless pets. She has even been on the committee of the UK xoloitzcuintli club, and designed their breed club logo! She enjoys painting various subjects in various mediums and also likes to craft. Crochet is a particular favourite of hers, make of that what you will! She was diagnosed with cervical cancer and then treated in 2013, and is now thankfully in remmission.",
