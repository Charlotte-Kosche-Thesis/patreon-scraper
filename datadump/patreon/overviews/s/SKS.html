    "summary": "I LOVE making videos, from Let\u0027s Plays to Machinima series, they\u0027re fun to make \u0026amp; (hopefully :P) entertaining to watch. Doing it as a full time job is even better, you have more time to dedicate to quality, as well as being able to make videos more frequently. But in order to do it as a full time job, there is the obvious fact that you have to make enough money to support yourself. That\u0027s why I\u0027m making this Patreon Page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been doing videos on YouTube for about 2 years now and at the time of this writing I currently have gained over 4,000 subscribers (if you\u0027re one of them, well you already know you\u0027re awesome! :) ). However, while this sounds like a lot, I\u0027ve been barely making ends meet through YouTube\u0027s monetization system. This has caused me to look into other sources of financial support \u0026amp; what led me to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love the idea of Patreon because it allows content creators like myself to receive support from their fans through small donations each month. The best part is it is NOT obligatory, if you\u0027re not comfortable making donations every month, you don\u0027t have to. So please, only pledge your support if you are comfortable doing so. Your appreciation of my channel \u0026amp; my videos is all the support \"I\" need, the donations from here just help to keep the lights on. :P\u003cbr\u003e"
