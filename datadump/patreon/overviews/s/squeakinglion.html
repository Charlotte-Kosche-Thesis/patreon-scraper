    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, Fellow Squeakers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me just start off with a huge THANK YOU to all of you! If you\u0027re here, that means you\u0027re thinking about contributing to my YouTube channel, and I am incredibly grateful. You all are amazing, and from the bottom of my heart: Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who are wanting to know a little more about me, I\u0027ll be brief-ish. For my entire life, I\u0027ve been a geek. There were times I was embarrassed about it, times I got bullied for it, times I lost dates over it, and times I wonder what the hell drove me to love this stuff. But not once have I ever regretted it. I\u0027ve been a gamer ever since my parents bought me my first game console: the Atari 2600. Yes, my first video game was Asteroids, people! That\u0027s how old I am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLater in life, I was introduced to role-playing games, more complex video games, and live theater. I also got into creative writing and the various Faires that abound in our society, like the Renaissance Faire and the Dicken\u0027s Faire. I collected costumes for years, before they were sadly destroyed by water damage in an unfortunate accident... sigh...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the one thing that I always wanted, but always thought I could never pull off, was using my creativity to make a living, and what\u0027s more... making a difference. I could never find my niche in life. I joined the military, and while I\u0027m proud to serve my country... I always felt that it was a job, not an adventure. I\u0027ve bounced from job to job in order to pay the bills, and none of them ever made me happy or gave me a feeling of satisfaction. I was miserable, to be quite honest. But one does what one must in order to survive, and I had pretty much written off the possibility that I might one day have a career that I loved, rather than a job I hated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong came YouTube. And I thought, \"Meh, so what? A place for people to post videos. Whoopie.\" And I promptly ignored it for several years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen in 2015, I made three discoveries that changed my outlook on life: One... that people can make a living on YouTube; Two... people post video game gameplay on YouTube; and Three... people can make an honest living posting video game gameplay on YouTube. Suddenly, and utterly without warning, everything clicked into place. It was possible. I could have a job that I loved.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFour months later, my father died, I was deployed to Kuwait for a year, and I had the worst year and a half of my life. Long story, not going to go into it. But the one positive thing that came out of it was that I was able to save up enough money to get a solid computer, recording and editing rig, and convert my new duplex into a recording studio. I began recording September 21, 2016, and posted my first video the next day. I was on my way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, here I am. With luck, and your help, one day I\u0027ll be able to make a living making videos from video games. But more importantly, if I can create enough revenue from this Patreon, I intend to create an awareness for the unsung heroes in our lives... the very Squeaking Lions I talk about in my videos on occasion. I hope to not just support myself with this, but to increase awareness for the good people in the world, support charities that deserve a leg-up, and use my fame to make a difference. A real difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the first time, I believe in my future, and I\u0027m looking forward to it. For the first time... I truly feel like a Lion. And my Squeak will be mighty.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSqueak On!"
