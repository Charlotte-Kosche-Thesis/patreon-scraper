My photos have over 1 Million downloads and over 100 Million views through\u00a0\u003ca href=\"#Scott\u0027s Profile on Unsplash\"\u003eUnsplash\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve asked for nothing in return. It\u0027s amazing what we can accomplish if we drop our ego and don\u0027t care who gets credit. To continue giving away photos for free use, but take my entire process to new heights, I came to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you become a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I was shooting photos one morning, I said to myself:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"I just want to play the infinite game.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is all about building community, legacy and playing the infinite game. This isn\u0027t about making so much money that I can buy a Rolex or Porsche. I\u0027ve always thought payment for my photography, art, and video creation doesn\u0027t have to look like money. As disruption is occurring across every industry, I believe there is a way to be paid in something different: community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is simply a place for you to support me, through a small monthly investment,  to continue creating, improving along the way, and in connecting as a community.\u003c/strong\u003e The greater your support, the greater the growth in my creative output and the cycle continues, infinitely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo show my gratitude for your support as a patron, I have created unique and exclusive rewards.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eEven at my lowest reward teir, I am opting to provide as much value for your \u003cdel\u003esupport\u003c/del\u003e\u00a0investment as possible. Check out the rewards you\u0027ll receive off to the right and my milestone goals off to the left.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAn official intro video is in the making!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
