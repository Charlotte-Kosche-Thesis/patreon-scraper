I recently started making videos that show my creative process and have found that art fans enjoy seeing the process as much as the final product. I\u2019ve been taking so many photos of my studio practice that I often run out of storage space!  As a Patron, you\u2019ll have a behind-the-scenes look at the way I work, plus exclusive opportunities to be a part of my process. \u00a0I\u2019ll stay in touch with you to share my work, get some feedback, and answer your questions. \u00a0I\u0027m hoping that this page will be a place where we can have a dialogue about art. \u00a0I would love it if you joined me. \u00a0I appreciate you even just stopping by and having a look at what I do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo learn more about me and see more examples of my work, visit my website at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ShainaNoelleCraft.com\"\u003eShainaNoelleCraft.com\u003c/a\u003e"

     "about": "Shaina lives and works in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  She graduated with an MFA from The New York Academy of Art in 2015 and a BFA from Maryland Institute College of Art in 2011.  Her work is primarily figurative and her obsession with the human form makes sure she never strays far from her favorite subject. Shaina works in oil and mixed media techniques on paper.\u003cbr\u003eShaina\u0027s work has been shown at multiple galleries in New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland: most notably, Dacia Gallery in NYC and Pentimenti Gallery in Philadelphia, as well as the Affordable Art Fair NYC with SaatchiArt.  Her painting \"Wonder\" is currently on view at the Wausau Museum of Contemporary Art for their inaugural exhibition.  She exhibited in a group show of drawings at Lacey \u0026amp; Phillips Gallery curated by InLiquid in early 2017.  Shaina\u0027s piece \u0027Scatter\u0027 won 3rd place at the Philadelphia Sketch Club\u0027s Works on Paper exhibition in 2016.  Her work was chosen for the MFA National Competition at First Street Gallery in NYC as well as the \u201cArt of the State\" exhibition at the PA State Museum in Harrisburg.  Her work has been recognized by publications such as Juxtapoz, Curve Magazine, High Fructose, and Blisss Magazine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.ShainaNoelleCraft.com\"\u003ewww.ShainaNoelleCraft.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/shainacraft/\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/shainacraft/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
