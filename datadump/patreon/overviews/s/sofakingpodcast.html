    "summary": "We work hard each week crawling across the internet, reading and watching content no one else will watch. We have been put on the government watch list and we haven\u0027t even been able to catch up on the walking dead... seriously I\u0027m on season 3. As a result, we are slowly slipping into insanity living off of Top Ramen and the whiskey that fans send us. But it\u0027s not too late! You can still save us by giving us your support. With your help, we plan on increasing our weekly content and adding video to the mix so you can see Brent\u0027s OCD and Dave\u0027s jaw clench with each Brad interuption. So... if you love us... we hope you love us... please love us... and want to hear and see more, then give us money and in return we may tell you where Tupac Island is."
