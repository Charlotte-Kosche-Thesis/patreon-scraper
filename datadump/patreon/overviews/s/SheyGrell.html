The choice of which page is up to you, but you\u0027ll have to let me know in the form of a message, be it on here or through email (SheyGrell@hotmail.com).

Or indeed, both), because I\u0027m just one person, for the moment I\u0027ll be going with \u0027Everybody gets one\u0027. \u003cstrong\u003eBUT\u003c/strong\u003e, seeing as that\u0027s pretty damn brutal to the people who would continue to fund me past that point, I\u0027ll be renewing the right to ask for another single commission at some point. I will do this every few months, but hopefully not a ludicrous amount of time will pass before you can ask again. I have to see how popular demand might get, if it gets popular at all. However, I hope to make this a reliably regular thing.\u003cbr\u003e- Unfortunately, I\u0027ll be applying the same rule of \u0027Everybody gets one\u0027 to the highest tier reward on here ($150). Because of how much it is, I understand if anyone objects. But when you see what I\u0027m offering \u0026amp; keeping in mind it\u0027s just me \u0026amp; no assistance, I hope you understand where I\u0027m coming from.\u003cbr\u003e...
