It is so awesome that you are interested in supporting me and the content I create and that is exactly what I am talking about. Law Abiding Bikers, the motorcycling majority, are the most generous and real down to earth people on the planet! I can\u0027t imagine belonging to a better community of people than this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is so awesome that the Law Abiding Biker Community is interested in supporting my content! Patreon provides me that opportunity, while allowing me to return the favor in the form of \"rewards.\" \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is safe\u003c/strong\u003e, as you can set a limit or cap per month, so you don\u0027t go over your budget. Example; Let\u0027s just say you were to pledge $3 per podcast/video release \u0026amp; you set a monthly limit/cap of $15. If I were to suddenly release 20 podcasts/videos in a month...........you are only charged your $15 monthly limit/cap and not a penny more! How cool is that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI truly believe that those who love the content I create want to see me continue doing what I do and will voluntarily reward my hard work. \u00a0This is much more rewarding than trying to sell a ton of ads to fund the content, which can also be difficult. Or have to hide the content behind a paid membership website wall. Creating original \u0026amp; valuable media content isn\u0027t easy, but a little support can keep me creating and maybe even propel me to make a living at it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGrowth/Correspondence:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the Law Abiding Biker\u2122 Podcast, our YouTube channel, and the website continue to grow, it becomes harder and harder to answer all the emails and comments in a timely manner. I personally love when I get a fast response when I send an email or comment online. Because of that, we have always replied to 100% of emails and comments and usually do so quick. But, as time goes on it has become much harder to hold that standard. By giving priority via the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/lawabidingbiker/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePrivate Law Abiding Biker Facebook Group\u003c/a\u003e to anyone who contributes just $3 or more per podcast episode or video release \u0026amp; with a cap of no less than $12 per month, we\u0027ll be able to ensure a reply to your comment in less than 24 hours. I like that and so will you. ;-) Plus you get the benefit of immediate help from the large group of bikers/motorcyclists already there. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Truths \u0026amp; Reality:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating this content and getting it to you does not come without a price to me, my two daughters, and wife, both financially and in work hours spent. Operating costs are growing steadily as things are getting bigger and more content is being created and released. Please understand, I am not complaining.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust a few examples of those operating costs are computer equipment, audio \u0026amp; video equipment, website domains, website hosting, audio hosting, video hosting, live streaming services, subscription based email services, computer software, online file storage services, new website plugins, website spam and email spam services, website plugins, website security, and website backups. Enough said, you get the point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spend 40 plus hours a week prepping, creating, editing, and publishing content for the podcasts, videos, and blogs. That is in addition to working 40 plus hours a week at my other full time job that actually pays me. \u00a0I work long shifts at my regular job, so when I get days off they are usually 4 days in a row. \u00a0I spend those 4 days \"off\" dedicating myself to keeping this content creation journey going \u0026amp; all the duties that surround it. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany things need to be done behind the scenes to create and get quality content out to you. Examples are creating, editing, \u0026amp; publishing podcasts, videos, \u0026amp; blogs. Website maintenance and updating. \u00a0Updating and interacting on social media platforms. Answering emails, website comments, video comments, and phone messages and so much more. Of course paying bills, taxes, book keeping, and all other small business requirements.
