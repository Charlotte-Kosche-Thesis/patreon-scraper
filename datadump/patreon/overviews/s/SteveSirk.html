    "summary": "I have spent the last 20 years writing primarily about sports, soccer in particular. I\u0027ve written for team and league websites, Fox Sports Ohio, The Orange \u0026amp; Brown Report, Columbus Wired, and many others, as well as authored two books (and counting) on the Columbus Crew.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I have other interests in life and in writing. I\u0027ve been blessed with such a supportive community of readers over the years, so I want this place to be our playground. It will be a place for humor pieces, gushing about things I love, travel stories, silly rhymes, stabs at fiction, behind the scenes glimpses of works-in-progress, personal stories and archives, and whatever else my brain decides to pursue. And yes, there will be sports too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, this will be our place to have fun. A chance to get away from the constant breaking news and instant outrage bombarding us from our social media platforms. A chance to let loose and experiment and have a good time as a community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting takes time, motivation, and work. Your patronage will afford me more time, goose the motivation, and reward the work. It may potentially also provide capital to fund future projects, educational opportunities, and, should the patronage reach an exorbitant level, a Mediterranean beach house. (Solely for writing purposes, of course.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be a mixture of free and patron-only posts on here. Given the urgent nature of the situation, \u003cstrong\u003ethe\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ework-in-progress posts on my new Columbus Crew book will be public posts. \u003c/strong\u003eThose are for our community. A book will be the end result, but it\u0027s not the primary motivation for that endeavor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI originally planned to launch a Patreon in January for non-Crew writing, but current events have caused me to launch much sooner than anticipated. I\u0027ve made up some patronage levels on the fly, but I am open to all suggestions. Let me know what rewards might be important to you. I want this place to be fun and worthwhile for all of us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of your level of patronage, or if you are even a patron at all, I appreciate you and thank you for every second you have ever devoted to reading my stuff over the years. Now let\u0027s have some fun!\u003cbr\u003e"
