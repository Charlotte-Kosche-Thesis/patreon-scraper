I also write articles in this and related topics and have authored a book,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eBeyond Lucid Dreaming: The Conscious Dreamer\u0027s Guide\u003c/em\u003e, which is expected to be published in 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout My Work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m highly passionate about lucid dreaming and the exploration of consciousness. My first lucid dreams were a side effect from a psychedelic experience, which inspired my life-long passion. My exploration of lucid dreams has allowed me to better understand myself and my relationship to the world around me. By putting into practice what I have learned from my lucid dreams, I have been fortunate to overcome suicidal tendencies and greatly reduce the symptoms of my depression. Now, I am dedicated to teaching others how to get the most out of their lucid dreaming experiences. It is my hope that I can contribute to the community\u0027s knowledge and, dare I say, the field of lucid dreaming. I know from experience how valuable a practice it can be from a mental health perspective and hope to see it used in the clinical setting one day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Youtube Channel\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMainly, I focus on teaching people how to get the most out of their lucid dreams, no matter their approach. I cover topics ranging from beginner to advanced, but I do my best to further the topic past simply how to do it.\u00a0I\u0027m not one to rehash all of the same information that\u0027s already out there. I do my best to clear up some of the misinformation surrounding lucid dreaming by calling out obvious bullshit when I see it. Overall, I try to provide content that is packed with great information, helpful, and hopefully entertaining to those with an interest in the subject. I also review lucid dreaming herbs, supplements, and products.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Book\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0As for its contents, the book will be most helpful to people who already have some experience with lucid dreaming. Assuming the reader already knows the basics, it is a journey to improve upon the reader\u0027s skill and provides information on how to best use lucid dreaming as a means to create positive change in oneself and in the quality of waking life, as well. It also has some of my favorite breakthrough experiences, as no lucid dreaming book would be complete without.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I need your help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s difficult to work a full time job and find the time to write books and make Youtube videos. But, I do it because I don\u0027t know any other way. The only problem is that, it can still be difficult to make ends meet, even with steady employment. It is my dream to one day make lucid dreaming education my main source of income. But, I\u0027ll be satisfied if I can at least afford to spend more time creating content for my favorite subject.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Support of my Patrons,\u00a0for which I am incredibly thankful, has gone a long way in ensuring that I can get my book off the ground, improve my content, and focus more on being a lucid dream educator.\u00a0I have been able to hire an editor and a cover artist for my book, and reserve my domain name in preparation of the release of my website. But, there are still some expenses required in order to get it to print, and to begin creating a portal for my lucid dreaming work so far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is My Content Worth Supporting?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLucid Dreaming is a subject that is often full of misinformation, because it is not a dedicated science at this time. While I have been a practicing lucid dreamer for 8 years, and an active participant in the online lucid dreaming community for the past 5, I still have no qualifications; as none yet exist. Despite its breakthrough into the realm of science, there are still many people who convolute the subject with exaggerated claims and mystical undertones. It is my goal to mitigate as much of this damage as I possibly can in this subject that is very dear to me. Lucid dreaming has helped me in so many ways in my life and I simply want to share some of the things I\u0027ve learned. In short, I am personally motivated try to provide as clear information as I can, with a rational approach. And, because I am a genuinely appreciative person who knows the true value of someone who believes in you enough to support your work.\u003cbr\u003e"
