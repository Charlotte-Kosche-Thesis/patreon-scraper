     "about": "ABOUT ME:\u00a0 I grew up a happy child and spirited athlete, went to college and the very first time I took an aerobics class Freshman year, I knew that very class that I was going to be a Fitness Professional.\u00a0 I\u0027m still at it 17 years later and haven\u0027t looked back.\u00a0 My background and resume teaching live classes has allowed me to bring all the different styles and formats taught in a group setting together in a way that gives my workout partners more than just a good sweat.\u00a0 I want them to feel like they are having an experience they can\u0027t easily describe to their friends!\u00a0 I connect deeply to my inner athlete and it comes out when I sweat, teach a group class or make a home workout video.\u00a0 I want my videos and classes to be challenging, achievable, sweat-filled and most important, FUN.\u00a0 Who doesn\u0027t like a good party?!\u00a0 Age and experience have taught me that if a workout doesn\u0027t have a little fun sprinkled into it, people will eventually stop doing it.\u00a0 I believe strongly that fitness is for everyone but you have to find what makes you want to move your body.\u00a0 My motto?\u00a0 Try everything...it could change your life.\u00a0 When you move you bump into all kinds of things!\u00a0 You could experience joy, laughter, adventure and meet fellow fit junkies who become friends like so many of mine.\u00a0 You might even gain some serious inner and outer strength, learn to hold your head higher and feel a pulse so strong it lifts you up in ways you never knew or calms you in a way that allows you to focus the rest of your day.\u00a0 I might not be able to move like this forever but I\u0027ll never give up.\u00a0 Movement and motivating lives in my blood.\u00a0 Along with wine, a love for my family, Netflix, Isagenix and an unforgettable wild night out with friends.\u00a0 \u00a0 Thanks for moving with me!\u00a0 Shelly",
