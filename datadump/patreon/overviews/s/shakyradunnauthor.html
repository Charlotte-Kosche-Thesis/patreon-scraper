I\u0027m Shakyra Dunn, a self-published Indie author that swept onto the scene officially in June 2016 with the release of my fantasy novel \"The One Left Behind: Magic,\" the first of a three-part series!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, I would like to thank you for experiencing the wild ride of becoming established in the Indie field with me and walking down this road. I\u0027ve shouldered a lot in the last few years since before making a mark in my field, but since I\u0027ve emerged, I\u0027ve loved every minute. There\u0027s no end to the characters screaming in my head to get their story told, and there\u0027s no greater feeling than seeing your book in front of you, knowing that you\u0027ve done something right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started this Patreon not for funding, but to share more with my fans, old and new. I love to share my creations with others, and seeing the support is overwhelming. So, here am I. :3 Thanks for joining this never-ending journey."
