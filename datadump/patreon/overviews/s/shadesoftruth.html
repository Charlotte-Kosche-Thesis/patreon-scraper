Shades of Truth Theatre is a serious and vital \nAmerican theater\nthat tells the story of the struggles and triumphs of our people and\nour country\u0026#8217;s history. The theater has signature productions that\nare quite well regarded and received, such as: Whistle in Mississippi: \nThe Lynching of\nEmmett Till; The Meeting; Camp Logan; Rage, Resistance and Revelry;\nHarriet Tubman Herself; I, Barbara Jordan; and much more.

Too, contributors will have opportunities to sponsor primary, grammar, secondary and tertiary schools (colleges), girl and boy scout \ngroups, Sunday school church groups, countless organizations, civic \ngroups, senior groups, and organizations for veterans.
