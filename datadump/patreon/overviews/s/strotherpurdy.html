    "summary": "Why do I look grumpy in the little inset photo? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s lunacy on my part -- but I\u0027m asking you to help me get out of my beloved workshop and stop making furniture for a while so that I can slave away on a laptop writing a book about the great satisfactions available when you work and make thoughtfully with your hands (and I didn\u0027t breathe while I wrote that). In short, I\u0027m asking you to make my work day less enjoyable for a while to get this book written.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking beautiful and useful things creates a deep joy and satisfaction in the maker -- I think this stems from our essential humanity. Fish have fins, birds have wings and we have hands. They\u0027re not very good at locomotion, but outstanding at manipulating materials to make things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd yet so many of us don\u0027t make, aren\u0027t sure where to start, and generally think of work as either white collar (mind only) or blue collar (hands only). I think the result is widespread dissatisfaction with paid work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to explode this dichotomy and help people learn meaningful work to achieve the sense of thriving that comes with making thoughtfully -- whether in hobbies or professions. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHow do I know this? I should start at the beginning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my life I\u0027ve designed and made furniture. Here are a few pieces:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.strotherpurdy.com/images/thumbnails/newtalble2.jpg\"\u003eand\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://www.strotherpurdy.com/images/collectionimages3/oakbed_2008.gif\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://www.strotherpurdy.com/images/thumbnails/sideboard.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e(You can find more of my work\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.strotherpurdy.com/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://mondaugen27.tumblr.com/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have also taught woodworking and something called \u0027design technology.\u0027 I\u0027ve watched children and adults learn to use their hands. I\u0027ve watched the smiles grow from day one in the shop.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I\u0027ve written and published two books:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1X9R4fRkoL._AC_UL115_.jpg\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 and\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513k3PNXuvL._SL500_AA130_.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project will be my third -- less how-to and more why-to, collecting and distilling the conclusions and observations that friends, colleagues and I have reached from our lifetime experiences (and from teaching, being a parent, what other people who work with their hands have learned, and much else).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m turning to you to help make this project happen! With your help, I can get it done in a year (without, it will simply take longer). Then I plan on 2-3 months of editing, layout and printing before I can deliver the finished item.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the tentative title and a wordier, more detailed pitch that I\u0027ve sent to publishers:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Joy of Craftsmanship: On Working Thoughtfully With Your Hands\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eFrom everyday activities to the heights of craftsmanship and technology, working and creating with our hands defines our humanity as much as mind and language do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur ancestors came out of the trees and stood upright, freeing their arms and hands to be used for more than locomotion \u2014 toolmaking became our ticket to survival and thriving as a species, language and consciousness perhaps a consequence as much as a cause of that newfound capacity. Hands are not just the manipulators of tools, but full partners with the mind and the eyes in the way we learn, understand, and communicate with each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe prejudice against the capabilities of the hand in favor of the mind has a long history. All developed societies distinguish blue collar from white collar professions. While such specialization and hierarchy have given us many advantages and accomplishments, it has also left our professions more at odds with our nature. Judging hand work to be menial, simple and easy does all of us a huge disservice as it fractures our basic humanity into intellectual managers and manual laborers. We give up half our humanity when we are allowed to think but not make, or make without thinking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsider the rates of depression, anxiety and general dissatisfaction with life in our modern world. Consider the size of the self-help book section of your local bookstore. Are you perfectly happy with your life, work and role in society? If you are, you\u2019re a statistical rarity. Or, like the majority do you live with constant stress, uncertain of your place in a company and your role, perhaps unhappy in the knowledge that you could do your job better, but can\u2019t for various reasons? It\u2019s not so much the question of whether you have stress, but whether you can find truly satisfying and enduring ways to relieve it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHobbyist (and many professional) gardeners, cooks, woodworkers, mechanics, knitters, and musicians know the profound satisfaction of creating beautiful, useful and unique things--not just in the accomplishment but in the process itself. Many find their work gives them a different perspective on life, unavailable otherwise. Their work is often deeply connected to their identity, even the defining term. To create involves the expression of individuality within a community\u2014we make objects that are unique and yet designed to be integrated within another person\u2019s life. It also involves knowledge through problem-solving\u2014the \u201chandy\u201d person we love to have around the house seems to have a magic relationship with objects: able to fix them, coax them into cooperation, and make them contribute rather than detract from our lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo create also involves an understanding of the importance of beauty and usefulness, esoteric concepts that we nevertheless consider in everything we do. Usefulness is the primary quality of an object toward survival, or simply living easily, and the fundamental quality of any tool (and what object is not a tool of some kind?). The beauty of an object is a more elusive idea, found in its pleasurable presence and easy use. Beauty speaks to an object\u2019s seamless social integration. While these qualities are difficult to name, we all know when something \u201cfeels\u201d right, looks right, or is \u201cthe best\u201d: the graceful teapot that\u2019s a pleasure to use, the perfectly balanced kitchen knife, the shawl that\u2019s both warm and beautiful. Living with well-designed things is a pleasure; however, creating them \u003cem\u003eleads to\u003c/em\u003e knowledge and understanding that can\u2019t be obtained otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe satisfactions involved in making something go well beyond simple pride in accomplishment. The use of our hands creates a feedback loop of learning, delight and understanding. That is, the joy of working with your hands doesn\u0027t just improve your ability to create what you make, it also leads to finding (or is) a sense of integrated yet individual purpose that I call thriving, an enduring kind of happiness in the knowledge that you create unique useful objects that give people pleasure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFew corporate positions offer this kind of feedback loop, or satisfaction. Few manual labor jobs offer either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnduring happiness is a byproduct of thriving, which comes from successful engagement with our environment and fellow humans. To thrive in life, we need to integrate both hand and mind work in our everyday lives. In short, what makes us human is inseparable from our hands \u2014 thriving in life is simply a matter of being fully human, accepting it, and getting on with it. Define happiness as a mental and hopefully static state \u2014 just how we feel at any given moment with no relation to what we learn, do and make \u2014 and we will forever wander the self-help book aisle looking for a new fix.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the seed idea for a book on acknowledging our basic humanity, both physical and mental, as a platform for living well. The book will be about adversity, problem-solving, individuality and creativity as great sources of happiness. It\u2019s about the satisfactions of community, common enterprise and friendship. It will be about life as learning, growing and engaging \u2014 not towards some static state of perfection, but as an iterative process. It will be about dissociated modernity and what we can, as the clever little apes that we are, do about it to have our cake and eat it too. This book is from what I\u2019ve learned and how I got there. It\u2019s from what good friends and others have learned and how they got there \u2014 by working with our minds \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e our hands. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it can be from you too-- as I assume you\u0027re human, you also have stories to tell about either working well, or not, with your hands. I want to hear from and integrate as many personal stories into this book as possible, not just to help you find ways to thrive in life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can support this project through donations to keep me financially afloat while I write and pay the expenses of creating the physical book, as well as through donations of your stories to give it greater depth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for being a part of this!\u003cbr\u003e"
