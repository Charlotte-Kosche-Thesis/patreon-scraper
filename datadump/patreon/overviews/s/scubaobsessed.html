With limited scuba options to fill his daily commute audio needs Darrin Jillson decided to address that gap by creating the Scuba Obsessed podcast. With the help of his dive buddy Jim Kliemann they came up with the concept of Scuba Obsessed. The show was intended to share the amazing gift that scuba diving can be. The format was designed to duplicate the post dive gatherings that have become an important part of the scuba diving community. This is where divers gather, have some refreshments and share their dive excursion experiences. The show pulled from contacts that Jim and Darrin were making the in dive industry as well as utilizing the team members in their local dive club \u003ca href=\"http://mudclub.scubaobsessed.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMichigan Underwater Divers\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years the new regulars were added to the program and each brings their own unique perspective to the show. The dive Mentor \"Mack\" is currently filling the gear as regular co-host of the program. You will frequently find Jim S, and Kevin A. co-hosting as well. \u00a0Darrin can be found hosting, recording and lightly editing the show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince January 2010 the team has produced and recorded over 250 episodes of the Scuba Obsessed Podcast. We have averaged 44 episodes a year which with a little math works out to almost 4 episodes a month. It is a weekly podcast with breaks for business travel and holidays.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help we can make our podcast better for you If you like what you hear, chip-in and we can do more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe aren\u0027t going to stop recording our show, but if we get enough per month we will be able to upgrade our audio equipment and start recording video versions of the program. We will add in on-location episodes and start producing an informational video segments to compliment our existing programming. \u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s all up to you!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting the show and thank you for becoming one of our Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.scubaobsessed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/scubaobsessed-2_2_trans_v5_prod.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
