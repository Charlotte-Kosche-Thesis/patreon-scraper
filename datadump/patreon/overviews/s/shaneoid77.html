I enjoy modern comics, but also as a nostalgia junkie, I like to hark back to the simpler and fun elements of comic book tales of yesteryear. My comic, I hope, brings a mix of this. There will be a huge cast of characters, all made from various times during my life from an autistic childhood, drawing my own set of heroes in my bedroom to modern day creations through MMO\u0027s and RPGs, and some created by my brother, to make a melting pot of creativity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy only $1 reward? Because my Patron will be about supporting the hard work that goes in to the comic, I will upload WIP and upcomic artwork here, but keep the real effort in to going in to the comic projects, that\u0027s what we\u0027re here for, right? :D\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNight Twink available on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://nighttwink.webcomic.ws\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eComic Fury\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://img00.deviantart.net/574b/i/2018/020/3/f/twink_swing_333_by_shaneoid77-dc0lxsw.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Comics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHeroes of the World and Beyond brings a cast of Superhero characters created since the artists childhood to early adulthood and combines them all in to one big metahuman scenario. The idea was to bring the innocence of childhood creations to life with a mature art style and storytelling. The scenario focuses on the media aspects of modern heroism, selling the product of good vs. evil, while the reality of the morally grey areas provides the conflict between characters. Heroes can basically make a living as a celebrity, this doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s an easy job, the bad guys are real enough and your performance in the field impacts on sales. There are some genuinely good guys out there, but it\u0027s hard to find one! Then there\u0027s the scientists and magicians poking about with dimensional travel. That\u0027s going to work out well, isn\u0027t it....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNight Twink was my first attempt at a webcomic formatted for reading online and began as a creative experiment but soon gained popularity over on Webtoon. It is a street-level superhero comic which focuses on the more grim and gritty elements of the genre, with a young gay man as a protagonist attempting to do his best to keep the streets safe.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Creator\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShane is a self taught artist who has loved comic book art since he can remember. He is the sole creator of HOTWAB and enjoys the whole process of comic making, except the flats. They can do one! Shane has previously attempted small press and webcomics in the past, the most popular one being Go-Bee. Outside of the webcomic world, Shane is a nerdaholic, and enjoys heavy metal, science fiction, classic TV and gaming. He is a carer for a disabled family member and does webcomics on the side. He\u0027ll probably live and die in his home town of Newcastle Upon Tyne where he lives in a pokey flat near a noisy motorway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContact\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:hotwab@outlook.com\"\u003ehotwab@outlook.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
