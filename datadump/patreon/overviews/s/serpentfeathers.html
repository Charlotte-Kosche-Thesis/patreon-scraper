    "summary": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I am a multifaceted human creature creating multidimensional art, for the sake of beauty. I believe beauty is a powerful force, one that brings us more joy, peace, and healing than we can imagine, and I want to share and celebrate beauty with YOU! I am a painter, a poet, a performer, a philosopher, a visionary, a teacher, and a designer of headdresses, costume, and adornment. I LOVE making beautiful works of art, and teaching others how to do the same. It is my life. I also make wings, and I dance and fly in them. I am currently involved in the production of, and creating courses for, the online Visionary Arts Academy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 I have massive dreams. I want to create a collaborative multimedia performance art experience. I want to build a visionary arts museum and school. I want to paint, create and perform the countless visions that I hold in my vast imagination, and collaborate with aligned minds to bring these dreams into being. I want to inspire and help others harness their creativity, and I am currently preparing to launch a mentorship program to help creative individuals free their genius from self-doubt. My mission is to fan the flames of imagination, to bring as much beauty through my being as possible, and to remind everyone of our creative power and potential. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 Your patronage will help me be the best version of me. With your support, I feel the fire of your desire to see me succeed, and to see more beauty unleashed into the world. With your help, I have the time and peace of mind to work my art and sharing it with you, rather than putting all that energy into stressing about my baseline. With your patronage, I can focus on what matters most to me, my life as art, as a creator of beauty. I wish to be a healing force in this world, and I want to dish out as much inspiration, magic and wonder as I possibly can. Thank you for helping me live my dreams, and making the world a more beautiful place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0How it works: On the right, you will find a column of patronage tier levels. For each tier, there are perks and gifts you will receive in return for your support. The amount you choose will be billed to your credit card or paypal account on the first of every month. You can cancel or change the amount you wish to give at any time. Depending on which tier you choose, you will receive goodies in the mail, special coupon codes, and access to my Patron-only feed, live sessions, Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s, private videos, and in some cases, original, custom art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 I post to my page each day, so keep checking in to see what I\u0027ve been able to create with your love and support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 Here\u0027s my bio, so you can get a little backstory on where I\u0027ve come from:\u00a0Kathryn \"Ka\" Amorastreya, was born and raised in the high plains of West Texas, where the bleak landscape allowed her imagination to run wild.  She was always finding ways to creatively express herself from a young age. Her passion and purpose was ignited when she began studying healing arts, where she discovered the power of healing, and the beauty in helping people improve their quality of life. She worked as a massage therapist for ten years, and sought ways to incorporate this love for healing into her artistic expressions. She began working with natural elements, merging animal medicines and earthen treasures into ceremonial tools, costume and adornment. Picking up the brush and palette for the first time at the age of 22, Ka realized that she had a profound gift.  As she taught herself to paint, she began to unveil powerful visions, creating her own unique world of beauty. Meanwhile, she developed her expressive talents in the performance arts, by studying and performing martial arts, belly dance, fire dance, and ballet.  Ka embarked on a monumental journey as she constructed her exquisite, white wings and feathered regalia, then took flight. She now resides in Asheville, recently transplanted from San Francisco, where she continues painting, dancing, creating as much beauty in the world as possible. She has danced and offered her art at events, festivals, and galleries internationally since 2002. Ka is also a founding director of the Visionary Arts Foundation and the Visionary Arts Academy. Her work has been featured in a number of main stream publications, including US Elle magazine, Paris Vogue magazine, and The Rolling Stone online magazine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n"
