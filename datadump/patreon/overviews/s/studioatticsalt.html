We were randomly talking about games, anime\u00a0and visual novels\u00a0like we always did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA random idea struck us then, why couldn\u0027t we create visual novels?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.hizliresim.com/D7R8Yy.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrue Odds was our first public attempt, originally created for TyranoJam 2017, which became one of the Honorable Mentions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe were happy with this result, and story we have created for this Jam.\u003cbr\u003eWe quickly polished it and applied to Steam Greenlight in a month, and we were successfully Greenlit in weeks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, due to True Odds being a gigantic project in our minds, it wasn\u0027t something we could do with the overwhelming pressure of college. Nowadays, we\u0027re working on Miss Silver, a lighter project compared to True Odds. We assume it\u0027ll be up on Steam around the end of 2018, if all goes well, we will be returning to True Odds afterward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.hizliresim.com/dO2WOQ.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMiss Silver is the current project that we are working on, and is halfway completed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was thought as a short novel, which we could gain an income that would support us on our work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter days working on it, we started to quite like the characters, and we realized we didn\u0027t want to publish a basic, static game just for the funds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, our 30-minute static novel... became a 3-hour long project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can test our demos here :\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://atticsalt.itch.io/true-odds\"\u003eTrue Odds\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://atticsalt.itch.io/silver\"\u003eMiss Silver\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
