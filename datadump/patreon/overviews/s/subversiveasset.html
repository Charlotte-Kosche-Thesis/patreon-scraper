I arrange cover stories of video game music.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eQ. What is a cover story?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eA. It\u0027s a music cover with a story attached! It\u0027s a two-for-one special every time!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eQ. Why stories?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA. I think music covers celebrate and comment on great music, so cover stories celebrate and comment on the stories and game concepts that come with the music.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eQ. What is this Patreon for, anyway?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eA. I see my patrons as trusted advisers -- people who care about the cover story project and who appreciate my aesthetic. Y\u0027all are the folks who love cover stories enough to invest in the project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLeft to my own devices, I often pick obscure, unmarketable pieces; I will look to my trusted advisers to collaborate with me on which songs or games I should cover in the future, and\u00a0which covers should be licensed for sale. (But I reserve the right to be a free spirit, so adviser polls will be not-completely-binding ;) )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eQ. What if I have a limited budget?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA. No problem! You can set a monthly max so that, no matter how many cover stories are released in a month nor your pledge amount, you won\u0027t go over your budget. And if you wish to change your pledge or cancel, you may do so at any time. (And, just to be clear: pledges apply only for cover stories, and not any other videos I may release.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd videos will still be released on YouTube publicly, so even if you can\u0027t pledge, you can still watch!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eQ. What else should I know?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA. Uhh, since I\u0027m a huge data nerd and tax accountant, there will be so many accounting puns here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
