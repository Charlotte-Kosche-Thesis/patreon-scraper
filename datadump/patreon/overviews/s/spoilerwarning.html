    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Josh, editor of Spoiler Warning. If you\u0027re here, then chances are you already know who we are, but if you don\u0027t, we\u0027re a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SpoilerWarningShow/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLet\u0027s Play series on Youtube\u003c/a\u003e, and we\u0027ve been around for a while. Over four years, with hundreds of hours of content spanning over a dozen games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show\u0027s always been a labor of love for us; we wouldn\u0027t have kept it up for so long if it hadn\u0027t been! But it\u0027s also a lot of work, particularly for me. For every episode we\u0027ve posted, there\u0027s been four or five hours of editing behind it. At three episodes a week, that\u0027s almost a part time job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we\u0027ve come to Patreon to ask you, our viewers, if you\u0027d be willing to support the show. If you pledge, the money will go to me to help offset some of the costs of working what is, essentially, a part time job to edit these videos every week. It will also help us in the future if we need to buy new equipment or editing software; for instance, our old copy of Adobe Premiere Elements 7 has served us well (despite all of its frustrating quirks), but it\u0027s getting a bit long in the tooth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd potentially, if this campaign gets big enough, I could actually afford to take time away from my day job to do this as a real job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/bZ0O2qlxK70\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I know what you\u0027re thinking, \"What about the other hosts?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe spent a lot of time discussing this, but ultimately each of the other hosts insisted that I should take the full cut. With all of the editing on my plate, and all equipment and software upgrades eventually having to come to me, they all feel that doing it this way is the best way to improve the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course, in the unlikely but really cool event that this campaign becomes really big and we start raking in loads of money, well; I\u0027d be obligated to spread it around to the rest of the cast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s also important to note, that the future of the show is by no means contingent on this campaign being successful or raking in loads of money. It\u0027s a lot of work, yeah, but we love doing it. We love interacting with you guys and hearing your feedback and making you all laugh. And we\u0027ll do it even if we never get paid for it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been a great four years, and with your help, we can make the next four years even better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Josh Viel\u003cbr\u003e"
