    "summary": "Hello, gentle readers, and welcome to my Patreon page. My name is Shaun Musgrave, and I\u0027ve been writing about video games off-and-on professionally for almost 20 years. I\u0027m probably most well-known these days for my work at TouchArcade, where I write some of the longest and most detailed reviews in the mobile gaming sector. I also write a regular feature at TouchArcade called the RPG Reload, where I delve into previously-released mobile RPGs to reveal their history and analyze them from a different angle from our reviews. Last year, I wrote a monthly series on the history of handheld RPGs, which had some readers asking me about doing articles on non-mobile games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reality is that I have a family to take care of and my work already consumes virtually every minute of my day. When freelancers aren\u0027t working, they aren\u0027t eating, and while I could stand to lose a few pounds, I can\u0027t ask my family to make the same sacrifice. So if I\u0027m to take on non-mobile work, I can\u0027t really do it for free, as much as I\u0027d like to. But hey, that\u0027s where you could come in, friend! By supporting Post Game Content on Patreon, you\u0027ll give me the freedom to write about games on all sorts of platforms, from all sorts of time periods. I\u0027m really just looking to cover the costs of acquiring games and maybe a little extra mustard to cover my time. The site updates frequently with shorter articles, with longer articles coming a few times per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost articles are posted to \u003ca href=\"http://www.postgamecontent.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePost Game Content\u003c/a\u003e. But some very special articles will be posted here for backers only for a full month before going up on the main site. If you want to read those early, all you have to do is back for a buck! That also gives you access to exclusive bonus posts that will never, ever be posted anywhere else. Other possible long-term goals include books, a podcast, video content, and so on, but let\u0027s not get ahead of ourselves, right? Anyway, thanks for reading, and I hope you\u0027ll feel my writing is worth supporting! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo Developers: While I appreciate your support, if you choose to contribute to my Patreon, I will not be able to cover your games for professional sites like TouchArcade due to the conflict of interest. I\u0027d rather play your fun games and get the word out about them, so Twitter high fives are more acceptable displays of appreciation for my work than donating here. Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
