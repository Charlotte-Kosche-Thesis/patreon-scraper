There is always something going on with me, be it on this page or surrounding the walls of my always spinning mind.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 I\u0027ve been creating music or art or both since I was just a tiny sprout in this world, and I haven\u0027t stopped \u0027intentionally\u0027 since then.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 I\u0027ve been blessed with a \u0027revolving door\u0027 of creativity. This isn\u0027t by choice, mind you! What IS my choice though, is to use it to the best of it\u0027s ability and for me, it\u0027s making others feel something. Whether it be with words, colors or cartoons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 Many years ago I noticed I wasn\u0027t like everyone else. I only noticed, I didn\u0027t actually KNOW if this was true or not, after all, I didn\u0027t look funny or walk around the school yard with a helmet on to keep my thoughts from spilling out of my brain! I just knew that \u0027they\u0027 weren\u0027t seeing what \u0027I\u0027 was seeing and I couldn\u0027t figure out why so instead, I just tried to fit in with \u0027them\u0027 ... never did quite \u0027get that square in the round peg hole!\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 So here I am today, many years after being a \u0027tiny sprout\u0027 in this world and realizing, this is rather unique! I\u0027m certainly not like most people, but I am quite normal, for me. \u00a0For one, I see sound...this is kind of nice when it comes to creating things. Want the technical term for this? \u0027Synthesasia\u0027 (which still doesn\u0027t work in spell check) it means Two or More sense are blended, causing the person who has it....to utilize both those senses at once. Some people \u0027taste shapes\u0027 some \u0027see sound\u0027 and others have it with numbers and letters (look it up, it\u0027s interesting!) \u00a0Since my \u0027sensory ABiLiTY (not disability) causes me to be Always visual and Always audio it leaks into every other aspect of my life as well.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 I do live acoustic shows right from my home studio. I do my art from my studio as well. The world is more or less a GIANT PALETTE of color and sound, and for the most part this is BRILLIANT for me, on the other hand it makes it difficult to be around other people. Sensory overload...too much noise, too much happening etc...\u003cbr\u003ein other words\u003cbr\u003emy senses are often on overload...\u003cbr\u003eInstead of taking \u0027medicine\u0027 to slow my head down or \u0027take these things away\u0027 I use art, I use music and use these things to my best advantage.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 Before dedicating my entire life to art and music, I worked in Sales...but the noise of the office and all the people around was unbearable \u0027for me\u0027 ... so I walked out....6 years ago.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 Following my passion is the hardest thing I\u0027ve ever done because the results don\u0027t happen all at once, they happen one spill at a time, one color at a time, one sound at a time and one person at a time. For each of YOU that see me, or this post, or hear my song or see something I created...it\u0027s another step in the right direction for me!\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 I started this page several months ago and the fact that anyone contributed at all makes me SMiLE! It helps with the essentials, a sketch pad, some paint, some ink......the ideas, well those tend to come simply when I open my eyes and ears in this world. \u00a0It\u0027s going to be a LONG HAUL for me (at my age) to take up a career that I\u0027ve never done or had an interest in...and become great at it...but to do my art and music, well...I\u0027ve had lots of practice at this and I continue learning more!\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 I collaborate with several other artists (music related) on various projects and I also collaborate with others by doing illustrations for books, commissioned pieces and when I can, I drop off some of my art at the Cancer Center near me, for those who are going through what I went through...it\u0027s nice to have something to make ya smile, so my \u0027iNKiES\u0027 sometimes find their way into peoples worlds, in those unexpected places.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 It was just over a year ago that I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. It\u0027s completely gone, but to hear you have \u0027cancer\u0027 is prob the scariest 3 words one can ever hear. Being that I was the one who was being told I had it.....I never had a moment to cry or grieve or worry, it was straight into WHAT DO WE DO NEXT mode and soon enough, it was all over and done with....looking back it\u0027s almost as if it were the Longest Flu ever....hard to believe it\u0027s over. \u00a0It Put my head into Overdrive...and I\u0027ve decided to dedicate as much time as I can into the Book I always wanted to write, the cartoons that I draw almost every day, the music I create.....I want to wedge all this into all kinds of peoples lives...in the corners of their minds and their souls.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI want to\u003cbr\u003emake people FEEL.\u003cbr\u003e....\u003cbr\u003eSo here....is what I create!\u003cbr\u003eBecome a Monthly contributor (keep in mind you can change your monthly contribution at ANY time) and you get Full access to my feed. Otherwise, well...you only see what I post public.\u003cbr\u003eI post high resolution images that I create for my patrons to use as \u0027wall paper\u0027 for all your devices or to download and just have for eye candy.\u003cbr\u003eI have monthly drawings when the group is active and hopping about! and also an interactive place to connect. I welcome your feedback!\u003cbr\u003e...\u003cbr\u003eContributors of $3 a month or more will benefit the most.\u003cbr\u003e...\u003cbr\u003eMy page changes often as do \u0027rewards\u0027....\u003cbr\u003eSo WELCOME to my site and THANKS for following and/or contributing!!!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
