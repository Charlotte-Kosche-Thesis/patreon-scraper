All Patreon rewards are mailed out the 3rd of each month! You get one reward for each payment that successfully goes through! For example, if you pledge the 23rd of a month but choose to revoke your pledge before the first, before rewards are mailed out, you\u0027ll still recieve a reward as a payment already went through. Hope you enjoy your stay of being a patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eMy history with cosplay and anime:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 My brother introduced me to anime as a young child. I started off watching things like Dragon Ball Z, One Piece, and Naruto. When I was little I was OBSESSED with Naruto. Then there came a long stretch of time where life came first. I almost entirely forgot about anime until around age 12 when I asked my brother what the titles of the shows were called. When he told me, I jumped back into it!\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I started cosplaying around 2011. The second I realized Cosplay was a hobby, and by extension, a career, I HAD to jump more into it. My first cosplay was Hatsune Miku, followed by Lucy/Nyu from Elfen Lied, then Inuyasha.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0I have since gotten way more into cosplay, trying to improve as I go along. I love the majority of the cosplay community, as most of the people are VERY supportive of others, though the elitists are something to watch out for. Now I mainly cosplay videogame characters, and anime characters I feel a strong connection with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eMy history with videogames:\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0Much like anime, I was introduced to videogames by my older brother when I was a young child. I recall playing the original Spyro games, as well as the old Crash Bandicoot videogames on the original PlayStation. I never stopped gaming once in my life, after the original playstation I eventually moved onto the PS2, my favorite titles from that were GTA: San Andreas, more Spyro/Crash Bandicoot, GrimGrimoire, and Scaler.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0Not too long after that I got into the Xbox 360, playing Halo, Borderlands, and Portal 2, unfortunately around that time is when I got a PC and started gaming on that. I proceeded to get repeats of Borderlands and Portal 2 to play on PC instead because mouse/keyboard is a MUCH easier setup for me. I\u0027ve gone through several laptops, but I was able to move up to NICE gaming PC\u0027s as of recently. Nowadays I play games like Overwatch, League of Legends, and SO much more.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eSure, but then WHY Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 As many might already know, or guess, I am FAR from rich! I actually come from a poor family. That, and I am currently a full time college student, with far too much anxiety to manage that and a job at the same time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0So what better way to get support, than from people who already love my work or what I do? The money from this patreon will be going towards taking care of myself, like buying food, getting games to stream on twitch, upgrade stuff, as well as buying materials to make cosplay, and wigs, etc. \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 After all of that, the leftover money from each month will be set aside for convention funds, to go to bigger and better conventions to meet more of YOU guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll in all NO ONE has to become a patron! If you do, i am VERY very thankful and i will forever appreciate you for it, but never feel obligated to give me your hard earned money! I will still continue to do my best no matter what happens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for looking!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e**THESE ARE CONSIDERED DONATIONS AND ARE NON REFUNDABLE BY ME**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*IF YOU SEND ME PERVERTED MESSAGES I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO BLOCK YOU.
