    "summary": "Thank you so much for visiting our Patreon page. \u00a0If you\u0027ve found us, that probably means you also tune in weekly to listen to the podcast. \u00a0Double thank you, from the bottom of our hearts. \u00a0We couldn\u0027t do what we do without your support. \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout StrongHer:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStrongHer Podcast was born in August 2017, but the idea was conceived in April 2017 on a Virgin America flight to Las Vegas, during which Allie and Laura practiced podcasting into their reading lights. As the girls brainstormed their podcast, they realized that above all, they both desired to enact positive change for women. They know that the future is female, and through their candid conversations, interviews, and investigative reports, they work to empower other women with the information to create their most dazzling and authentic lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Allie Becker:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAllie is an author, an academic, an amateur artist, and an aspiring adventurer.  She loves a good alliteration, lives for trips to the bookstore and/or library, and holds a special place in her heart for beating up inanimate objects in her boxing class.  Allie has been a proud California girl for over four years, but maintains an unparalleled love for the Midwest, where she was born and raised.  You can find Allie at \u003ca href=\"http://www.alliebecker.com/\"\u003ewww.alliebecker.com\u003c/a\u003e, at @mrs.alliebecker on Instagram, or on her couch reading self-development books with her calico cat, Audrey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Laura Voss:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLaura is an entrepreneur, glitter addict, and insanely extroverted-introvert (most days\u2026she thinks whilst ignoring phone calls on her couch). Her soul lights up when she gets to help a woman uncover her confidence, when she sips a delightful white wine, gets new sharpies, or has a dance party with her dog. Missouri gal through \u0026amp; through, Laura is a transplant to Silicon Valley, where she deeply believes every day is a gift and adventure, and lives by the wonderful Brene Brown\u2019s quote: \u201cowning your story is the bravest thing you\u2019ll ever do.\u201d You can follow her journey at LaGoesWest.wordpress.com or Instagram @OhMyFitnessCoaching. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Next:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAllie and Laura dream of scaling their podcast project up--with video, more interviews, and in-depth investigative reporting. In order to do this, they need your support. \u00a0"
