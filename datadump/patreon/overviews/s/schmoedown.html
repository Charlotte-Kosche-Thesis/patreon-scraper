    "summary": "Welcome to the Movie Trivia Schmoedown Patreon page. My name is Kristian Harloff and I am the Chairman of the Movie Trivia Schmoedown. In case you are wondering what the Schmoedown is, it is a trivia competition started by myself and my broadcasting partner Mark Ellis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started a brand together called Schmoes Know in 2008. It began with movie reviews and ultimately transitioned into a fun podcast simply named the Schmoes Know Movies Show. It was often referred to as the \"Howard Stern show for movies.\" There were a lot of fun bits that started on that show but the one that became a monster on it\u0027s own is the Movie Trivia Schmoedown.\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014, It began as our answer for March Madness, 16 players, 15 weeks, one winner. We pulled it off, it was popular so we followed it up with teams the following year with a team tournament. It was hands down the most popular thing we had ever done. The fans wanted more and we were determined to figure out a way to bring them more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016, we were both working for Collider Video, discussing movie news, talking Star Wars, having fun... I pitched the idea of taking the Schmoedown and turning it into a full fledged weekly trivia league. We tried it and our first match was John Campea against Dan Murrell:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwZeV76LBwU\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwZeV76LBwU\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was a hit, the league took off and before we knew it we had created a mix of Jeopardy meets UFC meets WWE. We had intense trivia games but we also created a narrative. The players took on personas, factions were formed, champions were born. It is growing every day!!\u003cbr\u003eHere is where we need you guys. Schmoes Know are paying for the show, the production, the editors, all of it. Collider is providing the distribution, the studio, the crew to film it etc... This season though, the editors, the writers, the competitors, the food for the crew, belts, props, that\u0027s all us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have ONE amazing writer, Chris Skalicky who works really hard, deserves more so he can justify all the time he spends on writing the questions and he needs HELP\u00a0 ! I need at least one more writer for his staff, maybe two. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy college friend Aaron Wilhelm has been the master editor behind the Schmoedown and he is also drowning in it. He needs help, he also needs to be compensated for his weekly hard work and amazing skills to give the Schmoedown it\u0027s unique feel. We want to be able to add matches, add an editor to give Aaron some help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have been following the Schmoedown long enough, you should know the name Bryan Ward. \u003ca href=\"http://bryaneward.com/2017/10/15/ultimate-schmoedown-posters/\"\u003ehttp://bryaneward.com/2017/10/15/ultimate-schmoedo...\u003c/a\u003e Bryan is a master artist/graphic designer and is responsible for some incredible Schmoedown art but has also created the league graphics that you saw in the Spectacular and will see in the upcoming season.\u00a0 We want Bryan to be around for a very long time and rewarded for his passionate and hard work and again, this is where your subscriptions come in to play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to create the Android version of the app, we need enough funds in order to hire the right developer to make that happen. We want to get the word out about the show and in order to do that, we need marketing, we need a publicist, we need you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe have three amazing championship belts, the Singles and two team belts. Our Innergeekdom belt and Star Wars belts need serious updates. This is where we need your subscription!\u003cbr\u003eThe competitors have been working hard, taking time out of their schedules to put it all on the line in front of all of you. They should be rewarded. I want to compensate the competitors this season. This is where your subscription helps!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, there is so much more we can all do together. Tours, games, merchandise, more shows, a full network....The sky is the limit. I was recently asked in a Q +A, my favorite thing about the Schmoedown and I said it then and I will say it now, the fan investment. I have been humbled by the way you have all embraced the Schmoedown. You are as responsible as we are for growing this thing with us. When you join this Patreon here today, you will be helping once again grow this to be the ultimate sport for movie nerds! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again and LETS GET READY TO SCHMOEDOWN!!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHarloff\u003ca href=\"http://bryaneward.com/2017/10/15/ultimate-schmoedown-posters/\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
