There might be an additional video once in a while but \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003epatrons will only be charged for one video per week\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (usually on every Friday). At no point, any patron will be charged for more than one video per week. Apart from that, you can set a monthly limit for your pledges very easily. Sorry for talking money first, but I had to get this out of the way!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started my YouTube channel at the age of 14, back in 2013, I didn\u0027t have a clue where this journey would take me. I was blown away by the number of views and subscribers. All the lovely response encouraged me to follow the path and actually \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ethinking about becoming a professional musician\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. In summer 2015 I launched the Chi Might Project, collaborating with singers/songwriters/musicians from all over the world in order to create a High Quality Album and I\u0027m excited to announce another original album for 2018 - Chi Might II.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support me as my Patron, you\u0027ll be funding my new album, you will be among the first who will receive a copy of the new album and you will be mentioned in the CD booklet. What else do I need money for? You help me to keep my YouTube Channel going!! Due to the fact that most of my YouTube videos are copyrighted songs, I do NOT earn a lot of money via YouTube (as some people might think) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am incredibly thankful towards all my supporters!!\u003cbr\u003e"
