    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSea Lion Press was established in 2015 as the world\u2019s first publishing label dedicated to alternate history. We have since published some of the best examples of this amazing and endlessly varied genre, ranging from short interest pieces, to novellas, to fully-fledged world-building exercises and epic novels. Our books are available in ebook format, with the first paperback versions rolling out for Christmas 2016 and more to follow. To explore our catalogue, visit\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sealionpress.co.uk/our-books\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eour website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2018, Sea Lion Press also launched\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://forum.sealionpress.co.uk\"\u003ea forum\u003c/a\u003e and blog, to promote discussion of alternate history and wider topics. Money from our Patreon will be used to reduce the impact of the forum\u0027s costs on our regular budget, and, depending on the sums raised, to pay for forum upgrades.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho we are\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSea Lion Press is a small team of passionate alternate history fans from various walks of life. Our founder, Tom, runs the publishing house day-to-day, while chief illustrator Jack is responsible for all our branding and front covers. Head proofreader Ed makes sure every one of our titles is ready for publication. Read more about our whole team\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sealionpress.co.uk/the-team\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat the money is for\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s never been easier to set up a professional publishing outfit. But there\u0027s always more to do, and we pay a much higher royalty to our authors than most publishing companies do. With no salaried members of staff, production from Sea Lion Press will inevitably slow and stagnate. We don\u0027t want that to happen, and so we\u0027re asking our fans to support us to expand the publishing house\u0027s output into new areas like audiobooks, posters, and more. Money will also be spent on bread-and-butter matters, like being able to pay more proofreaders and thus turn around more books more quickly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning a high-capacity and well-operating forum also costs money, and Sea Lion Press currently pays for the SLP Forum out of its operating budget. Your support here will enable us to spend more of that money on publishing more books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho to thank\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEveryone who\u0027s bought a Sea Lion Press book has helped us get this far. If you\u0027d like to go the extra mile to help us bring you more stories from other worlds quicker and more professionally than ever, please consider giving us your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
