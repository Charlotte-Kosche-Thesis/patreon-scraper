    "summary": "Whats up weirdos, Shadetree Surgeon here... and I just want to thank you for clicking on the link and even considering supporting what Triumph Chick and myself are trying to do. We\u0027ve got some pretty lofty goals that we\u0027re trying to achieve but with your help I think we might have a chance to get there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs most of you know I avoided making a patreon page for quite some time because I simply didn\u0027t need it. We were on track to accomplish what we set out to do, or at least start trying to do it. Life happens though, and now that Triumph Chicks mother has fallen ill and is living with us our financial situation has changed drastically. That doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m about to be homeless, we can still certainly afford to keep ourselves afloat. What it does mean is that we\u0027re gonna have to tighten up in several places financially and unfortunately the money I spend growing my youtube channel is the first thing that\u0027s going to get cut.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are my eventual goals: I want to continue to grow the Shadetree Surgeon channel and spread our message. We would like to travel to events all over the U.S. to connect with all the people who\u0027ve helped make this channel into what it is. And finally, our end goal.... is to raise enough funds to create a community motorcycle workshop. A place where riders (and future riders) could come together in a non judgemental space to wrench on their own bikes, learn riding tips and tricks from people much more experienced than them, learn how their motorcycle works and connect with their local motorcycle community. It\u0027s definitely a pie in the sky dream, but it\u0027s one I\u0027m dedicated to achieving. There\u0027s nothing I love more than helping someone new get into motorcycles or helping a new rider feel welcomed in the community, and I want to create a space here that does all these things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve been entertained by what I create here on youtube... and you truly believe I can turn this stupid little channel into something much bigger than it is, then consider giving this a shot.\u00a0"
