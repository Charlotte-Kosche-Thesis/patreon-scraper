I am a full-time software engineer who makes adult games as a hobby. Game design may not be my profession, but it is my passion. I\u0027ve been studying and experimenting with video game and analog game design for more than a decade now. A couple years ago, I created Silver Bard Games to start publicly releasing my work.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince I\u0027m working full-time, I\u0027m not counting on Patreon to for my living expenses, so your support will go directly into creating and improving games. Already, your support has allowed me to buy licenses for development tools, purchase commercial 3d assets, and recruit AimlessArt as a dedicated artist.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSilver Bard Games is a team now, and we have many exciting prospects ahead of us.
