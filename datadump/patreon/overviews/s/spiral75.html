    "summary": "Hello, my name is M, and welcome to Spiral Fitness!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a personal trainer located in the DC area, certified from the National Personal Training Institute. I am versed in a wide range of training backgrounds (martial arts, dance, yoga, weightlifting, team sports) and this affords me numerous tools I can use to tailor training to be precisely what individuals need to achieve their goals, whether that be increased strength, better flexibility, improved cardiovascular health or any combination needed to build themselves up so that they can live their best lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this Patreon campaign is to help me give people access to solid nutrition and fitness information, and exercise technique, via articles, video blogs and move-of-the-week videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo how can YOU help me? Obviously, even the smallest donation helps, and becoming a patron gives you earliest access to my newest content. But also this allows me the ability to create freely, gives me access to facilities and equipment, and most importantly, TIME to generate useful content. And of course, each donation tier comes with rewards, including but not limited to custom blogs and/or videos, dedicated to your specific fitness \u0026amp; nutrition questions and concerns, but also custom workout plans and nutrition recommendations, and live Q\u0026amp;A sessions with me via Google Hangout. \u003cbr\u003eAlso, with your comments, critique and other discussion, your interaction will help me decide what to work on next. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would prefer not to become a patron, but would instead like to hire me directly for personal training, either remotely or in person (DC metro area only), wonderful! Please contact me directly via twitter, facebook or email so i can help you achieve your goals!\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for coming by, and I hope we can connect soon so that i can help as many people as possible live their at their healthiest and happiest, whatever that means to them. \u003cbr\u003e"
