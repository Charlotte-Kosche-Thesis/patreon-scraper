First off, thank you. Secondly, this is your chance to reconsider. If you\u0027re new to me, or my channel, you may want to wait a little while, to see whether you will be sticking with my channel and my content before committing money, as welcome as it would be, I do not want people regretting their decision.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Few Questions Answered :\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy Should I Become Your Patreon?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, this one is up to you. Obviously, I should do everything I can to encourage you to give me money, so I can carry on doing Youtube and Twitch, and there are a few small perks to it that will be listed below, but if you enjoy my content and don\u0027t want to or can\u0027t afford to support me on Patreon, I understand. I would prefer to bring you entertaining content than to guilt or coerce you into giving me money for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat Do I Get If I Do?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSmall things, whatever I can come up with to show my appreciation but not make it feel like you\u0027re losing out by not joining my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, these will include :\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour name on characters in game series I play.
