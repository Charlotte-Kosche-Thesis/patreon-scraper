I mean, creating things in a vacuum is a little bit of fun, but engaging with with people is where it\u0027s really at, and I couldn\u0027t do that without you. So thanks for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first love is writing stories. I fell in love with stories when I learned to read at age 3 and wrote my first story at age 4. I haven\u0027t stopped writing stories yet. I\u0027ve expanded into other genres over my life, so I\u0027m going to share some poems here as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAge 5 I started taking piano lessons and fell in love with music across my lifetime. Combining words with music is another passion of mine, so I\u0027ll be sharing some of those creations as well (and likely some wordless music creations as well!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy grandmother learned to paint starting at age 60 (can\u0027t wait to see what I start to learn at age 60!) but she gave me lessons when I was young, and I fell in love with that as well. I love to tie all my creative passions together by painting what music makes me see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a lot going on and a little bit for everyone. I\u0027d love to have you partner with me on my journey. Remember, YOU\u0027RE the reason making things is so much fun, so I\u0027d love for you to stick around. \u003cbr\u003e"
