    "summary": "Thank you for your time, I promise to fill your minutes with entertainment however surreal. This will include humor, creativity and thought provoking content. In some ways I sort of invented reality TV as you shall see in my hundreds of autobiographical videos I have been compiling in a filmic narrative since the 1970s, 80s, 90s and these last two decades that flew by like screendoors in a hurricane.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI once had grandiose dreams and now the simplest things keep me basically content. I don\u0027t know if you will find anyone more creative and prolific slapping stories up on the internet. If I had all these means of sharing 30 years ago my story might have played out differently. Enjoy my comedy, music, cartoons, books and movies, here for free with some very special gifts when you become a patreon of my arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you look at the right sidebar you will see many rewards tiers to become a patron. And the $1 pledge is just as important as higher numbers. It shows the world people like my work. And once you meet Sockpuppet, I know you will want to be part of the ShatteredElbow family. I mean come on, look at his cute innocent freshly laundered face. $1 dollar makes him so happy he cries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd cries, and cries, and cries, then I have to put him into the dryer and read him a happy story and tuck him in. And remind him happy tears are good.\u003cbr\u003e"
