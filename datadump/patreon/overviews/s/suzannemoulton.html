     "about": "I have created textile and wire sculptures for nearly twenty years.

I utilize old world techniques along with dedication to high quality craft to express modern concepts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve worked for the Feature Film industry for over nine years, enjoying creating miniature handcrafted items for such films as Coraline, Frankenweenie and ParaNorman, and continue to make specialty items for independent Puppet and Stop-Motion Animated films. But I\u0027m always excited to venture back into building schemes of my own design! Decidedly making short run editions that brighten the world and fuel the imagination.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy sculptures, paintings and drawings have hung in the National Horse Racing Museum, The Hyde Collection, Kansas City Art Institute Permanent Traveling Collection, National Society of Illustrators New York, The Portland Art Center and The Coos Art Museum Expressions West Exhibitions 2005, 2009 and 2013.",
