Well I have always had lot to say about Philosophy, Epistemology and the philosophy of\n science, recently I noticed a lot of feminist academics using You Tube to push a particular world view, what motivated me to start my own channel was what I perceived as flawed reasoning, often dressed as academic correctives and in particular, the unfair treatment of commentators within the forum sections of such channels when they took a contrary position, my ambition was to simply present an alternative view,\u00a0 I have been very fortunate that people actually watch my videos and my subscribers have been very generous in their encouragement, but I\u0027m never satisfied to stand still, as I learn more about running a channel, I find myself wanting to make improvements to enable my channel to grow, expand and for me to create better content, whether by upgrading equipment or simply improving my own skill set, people often assume that I am a physicist or a biologist, but my academic qualifications and professional career \nhave been in the field of computer science, and I hope to include videos on that topic, both introductory concepts and advanced philosophical concepts in the near future, but the main focus will be in relation to the rise of cultural Marxism, Feminism and its impact on the academy in particular and society in general, I know that most subscribers will be unable to contribute financially, and I don\u0027t have a problem with that, but if you are able to contribute, that will encourage me to expand my channel, increase the time I have available for content creation and unable me to upgrade my equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShinobiYaka.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
