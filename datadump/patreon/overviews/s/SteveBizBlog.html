    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for checking out my Patreon page! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003eThere is a ton of effort and expenses that are required each month to keep the SteveBizBlog engine turning. For many years now I have funded this effort entirely on my own.\u00a0 But as we continue to grow it is no longer sustainable for me alone to fund this effort, and that is where I could use your help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003elove \u003c/span\u003eyour financial assistance through monthly micro-contributions (Starting at just $1.00), so I can continue to provide the FREE and thought-provoking business content to cash-strapped small business owners so that entrepreneurship, the backbone of our economy, can continue to prosper.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eMy name is Steve Imke and I am a serial entrepreneur. I have created several successful employer-based businesses that I sold earlier in my career. Today, I live off the passive income from the investments I made with the proceeds of those business sales. However, rather than build yet another business to continue enriching myself, I have chosen a different path at this point in my life and that is to help enrich the lives of others, who also have the dream of business ownership, by sharing my unique small business knowledge and insight on what it takes to start and operate a successful small business. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2002, I\u2019ve helped thousands of entrepreneurs achieve their business ownership dreams by volunteering as a mentor with SCORE and also as a volunteer consultant with a local Small Business Development Center (SBDC). I continue to be very active in both of these organizations but helping local entrepreneurs was not enough. I felt I could do a lot more, a lot more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe journey:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eSo, in January 2014 I began SteveBizBlog.com. In the beginning, it was just a way to archive key business concepts and lessons for my SCORE and SBDC clients that I could point them to as a reference source and to provide them with some free tools like spreadsheets and templates to help them become successful business owners. However, because of the boundaryless nature of the internet, soon, I was helping people from all over the world realize their business ownership dreams too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe feedback I continue to receive about how a single nugget of business wisdom I shared on SteveBizBlog helped to crystallize an idea in a readers\u00a0mind and how implementing that idea changed the whole trajectory of their business continues to fuel my passion for this work. Today there are over 800 searchable thought-provoking posts containing thousands of nuggets of business wisdom and those numbers continue to grow each week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach week I personally devote 50 or more hours either researching and writing new content for my audience or volunteering as a mentor and consultant so I can understand the issues that keep entrepreneurs up at night. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my peer\u2019s do not have the luxury of providing this level of free content and have to charge their clients for their knowledge so they can continue enriching themselves financially. Unfortunately, businesses that are either just starting out or desperately trying to achieve profitability just don\u2019t have the cash flow to hire a quality consultant. As a result, many of these businesses simply fail or never reach their full potential which is very sad. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy personal pledge:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eThe way I see it, small business ownership is not only a dream but also the foundation of our success as a society. Therefore, as a way of giving back for the business success I have personally enjoyed in my life, I have pledged that I\u2019ll always share my small business wisdom for free to help grow the small business community that is so vital to our national prosperity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe challenge:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eUnfortunately providing this free content so that others can succeed does not come without real costs on my part. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the typical hosting fees and paid tools that are required to keep the content engine moving forward, I employ several part-time support resources to help me produce the quality content that so many people rely upon to start and grow their business. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI employ an editor to edit my work, as I\u2019m a flaming dyslexic, an email marketing expert as well as a social media manager so I can continue to reach more entrepreneurs with my business changing content. I also employ a website developer as well as a bunch of tools experts to keep SteveBizBlog.com continuing to operate smoothly.\u00a0 \u00a0Here is my team:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ksient.com/SteveBizBlog/Hanna.png\"\u003e\u00a0Edit\u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://ksient.com/SteveBizBlog/July.png\"\u003e\u00a0Social\u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://ksient.com/SteveBizBlog/Vlad.png\"\u003e\u00a0Email\u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://ksient.com/SteveBizBlog/MissB.png\"\u003e\u00a0Developer\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause the expense of providing thought-provoking content continues to rise, I\u0027ve struggled, for some time, to find ways which will help me cover the escalating direct expenses as we explore new avenues to reach more and more people with my free quality content. Unlike many for-profit businesses that use a value ladder of ever-increasing levels of offerings to extract more and more money from their client to cover expenses and make a profit, I offer all my content to free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have considered selling some of my time, in exchange for money, as a small business consultant like many of my peers; God knows I have had plenty of offers but I know that I can do more as a content creator devoting my time and energies to aid cash-strapped business with free and actionable nuggets of wisdom to help them succeed then as a mentor or paid consultant to a few.\u00a0 Moreover, even as a part-time effort this would cut into my content creation efforts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have considered changing the nature of the content I develop to be more mainstream for the sake of better SEO so I can drive an affiliate marketing program or charge other businesses for access to my audience. The problem is that as a thought leader, much of my content tends to be very niche based or on the fringe of general understanding. My intention is to help entrepreneurs think outside the box when it comes to their business. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoreover, most entrepreneurs don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know so they do not ask the right questions. While many of my posts rank #1 for niche keywords most entrepreneurs need to be lead to these concepts because they are not part of the typical search vocabulary. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI for example talk about the \u201cLeverage Contingency\u201d principle which is the concept that the business owner should not get too committed to a direction if a pivot becomes necessary, or the difference between \u201cThick Markets\u201d and thin ones as it relates to owning a market segment, or even how to use the game theory principle of \u201cSelf-Weeding Gardens\u201d to effortlessly filter tire kickers from real buyers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, while these topics are hugely valuable for the entrepreneur to understand, they are not common search terms like \u201cBusiness Loans\u201d or \u201cBusiness Entity\u201d and therefore site level SEO suffers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe use of proceeds:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eThis Patreon campaign is for people who are willing to help me cover the wages of the support resources that make SteveBizBlog.com possible. Additionally, the funds collected will cover some of the direct expense to get my free thought-provoking small business content into the heads of more entrepreneurs so that they can transform their businesses from ordinary to extraordinary during their most fragile financial periods of development. Finally, we plan to use the funds from this campaign to extend our outreach reach with advertising linked to free giveaways so we can change the lives of even more entrepreneurs.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Ask:\u003c/h2\u003eWe would \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003elove \u003c/span\u003eit if you could make whatever level of monthly contribution you can afford to allow us to continue on our journey of keeping SteveBizBlog content 100% FREE.\u00a0 To help ease the pain of contributions we are offering several reward levels so help justify your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t help financially that is ok too but please share our campaign information on your social platforms so others can have the opportunity to contribute to our campaign.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEntrepreneurs everywhere are willing to risk their own personal fortunes to realize the dream of business ownership.\u00a0With your help, we can make a huge difference in their success rates.\u00a0 And by doing so, also help propel the economy that is so reliant on small business to new heights.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks,\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSteve Imke\u003cbr\u003e"
