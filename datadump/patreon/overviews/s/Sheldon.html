While I will create the majority of these illustrations, I hope to use your contributions to hire other artists and increase the variety of styles available in the gallery.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat Can You Expect?\u003c/h3\u003e\nI\u2019ll be creating illustrations in all of the genres mentioned above, using a wide variety of techniques. I\u2019ll be working in media including vector-based digital media, colored pencils, paints, intaglio printing techniques, and many more. Illustrations will be full color, black and white, or limited palette as determined by the subject and the medium.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll images will be available for download as high-resolution uncompressed TIFF files in addition to more internet-friendly formats like JPG and PNG. New images for the Gallery will range from 6x9 inches to 9x12 inches at 300dpi. Once certain funding goals are met, image size and resolution will increase.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ucag.jw-sheldon.com/images/vampire_mixed_2_tn.jpg\" style=\"width: 265px;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://ucag.jw-sheldon.com/images/explorer_horror_tn.jpg\" style=\"width: 263px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWho Can Use It, and How?\u003c/h3\u003e\nEvery piece in the gallery will be licensed under the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en_US\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCC-BY license\u003c/a\u003e, so that authors, publishers, and anyone else can take and use these illustrations for any purpose they want - even commercial publication.
