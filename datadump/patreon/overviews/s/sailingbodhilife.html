    "summary": "Thanks for visiting my Patreon page! And if you are here to support me on Patreon, a HUGE thanks. It\u0027s been a long stressful and scary road getting to this point in my life, and I really appreciate everyone who feels inspired to follow my journey and help me along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is how I got here and what is driving me to take on this seemingly crazy leap into the unknown.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m Philip Nelson. I was born and raised on a grain farm in central Alberta, Canada, with wide open spaces, and many places to explore. Growing up I always yearned for adventure. One thing that continues to inspire me is discovery and exploration. Every day it seems I learn something that completely blows my mind.\u00a0After 20 years working in the \u201creal world\u201d I learned what someone else thinks you need and what you actually need is not likely the same thing.\u00a0As a result, the stagnant corporate world of 8 to 5 has left me wanting\u2026 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a long time I\u0027ve been troubled by the disconnect between people and the conflict that results from that disconnect. We seem to be stuck in our own little worlds, excluding anyone who may \"threaten\" us, and in some extreme cases wanting to wipe them off the face of the earth. So\u00a0what is really going on in the vast civilizations around the world? Are our perceptions of others and of ourselves factual, or are they prejudices or ideals that we have been lead to believe? I want to find out what really makes us who we are. Not the Western \u201cus\u201d but the Global \u201cus\u201d.\u00a0I have this feeling that if we only knew more about each other that the world would be a better place, and we would probably find we have a lot in common, as well as a lot to learn from each other. So... I\u2019m off to continue my love of discovery on a grand scale, and share it all with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eMy plan is to sail around the world, following the routes of explorers, settlers, spice traders, pirates and colonial warships, to explore and document the way that people live and think. Where are they from and how did they get there? What are they looking for in life, and what do they value?\u00a0Our ways of living may be different, but our reasons for living may very likely be the same.\u00a0Once we acknowledge our similarities, we will be able to embrace our differences. If the world sees that someone else can do it, that one person can have a positive effect on another person, and that positivity can spread, they will begin to understand that they can do it too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m off to feed my passion for knowledge and exploration, and hopefully fire your passion to learn, spread knowledge, and find some adventure of your own.\u00a0Knowledge is power. The more we can learn and discover for ourselves, the more control we will have over our own destinies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you dig what I\u2019m doing, please become a Patron and help me bring interesting stories and a passion for exploration to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreat things all start with a single step forward, followed by\nanother, and another.\u003c/div\u003e"
