    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eA Life Change\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA major life change has suddenly allowed me to cut the tether of a 40 year career of illustration and painting to pursue a full schedule of running my journaling workshops. I could not be more excited to begin a new career that is meaningful, to myself and others.\u00a0\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s a link to the workshop description:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://spark.adobe.com/page/lmCb2w5kBPubQ/\"\u003ehttps://spark.adobe.com/page/lmCb2w5kBPubQ/\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Workshops\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you check the link above you get a very clear sense of what this is: designed with the non artist in mind it\u2019s all about learning tools to see more, experience more, deepen memory. And it\u2019s just a lot of fun.\u003cbr\u003eWhen I have to travel the\u00a0workshop is one full day, mostly drawing in the morning, and some painting in the afternoon. For Colorado locals I offer a shorter half day version \u2014 half the time and half the price makes for an easier yes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFiguring Out 2018\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u2019m throwing myself into this with everything I have, but as we all know nothing is ever as easy as we hope. The obstacle is scheduling \u2014 people LOVE the concept, but every place I\u2019ve talked to is booked solid for 2018. \u003cbr\u003eLooking for a partial solution to cash flow I\u2019m exploring ways to offer local watercolor workshops in addition to the travel journal one. I\u2019ve done them for years, and now having found a place right here in Longmont to hold them will offer it when asked. (Happens with surprising frequency.) I\u2019ve not pursued watercolor workshops for two reasons: Most arts centers are already hip deep in watercolor courses, and the pool of potential participants is tiny. My energy is finite, and the travel journal direction is where I need to spend my resources. That\u2019s my future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon Makes A Difference\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo far I\u2019m getting terrific response from venues \u2014 in two days last week (April) I got a yes from Sedona, AZ, and from Telluride, Durango, Pike\u2019s Peak, and a couple others in Colorado.. alas, all for 2019. \u00a0While I\u2019m working the levers to figure out how to get workshops organized sooner, in particular local ones, financial support from Patrons is invaluable. It\u2019s making the hole in the bottom of the boat smaller, and every little bit helps. \u003cbr\u003eAnd your contribution also does this: I\u2019m encouraged by it. This is SO important \u00a0\u2014 people stepping up in a tangible way saying, \u201cYeah, I wanna see you succeed.\u201d, is enormously meaningful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow You Can Help\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou\u2019ll see Rewards levels named \u201cCoffee\u201d, and \u201cMuse\u201d, to the right on laptop, below on a phone. By clicking \u201cGet $3 [or $25] reward\u201d you will be donating an automatic payment of $3 [or $25] on the first of each month. (You may also choose any different amount you please and write that in.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you! What an exciting time, and I look forward to sharing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6FTiQJI.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
