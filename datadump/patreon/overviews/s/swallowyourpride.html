I do have a few affiliates and advertisers that are helping to keep the lights on currently, but I know you don\u0027t want to hear ad after ad after ad on the podcast. If this podcast has brought any value to you and your career, I am simply asking for a small amount of that value back, so that we can continue to churn these out like buttah!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could not and would not do this podcast without you, and would love to have you join me in this exclusive community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you just want to give $0.25 per episode ($1 per month), click \"Become a Patron\" up to the right and that option will be there."
