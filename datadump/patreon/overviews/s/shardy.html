LED control systems can often be substituted to get the job done, but don\u0027t have the additional safety features built-in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBut really, these installations are about the participant interaction.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis often requires creating custom hardware to repurpose existing devices, or designing new interaction systems which aren\u2019t exactly off-the-shelf. Sometimes, creating new things really is the easiest way to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDon\u0027t care about control systems for 20\u0027 blasts of fire? Other systems that have come out of my work on these projects include an interface to NeuroSky EEG headsets, DMX512 theatrical lighting control on the cheap using LED strip lighting, and the wireless motion sensor.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of my current hardware releases can be found on my \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/propane-and-electrons\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGitHub page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nSo, why do I need your support?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe simple answer is: hardware prototyping and design costs money. The CAD tool I use is free, but every board design costs money to fabricate and assemble. Boards often need multiple revisions, and parts are frequently not reusable. A board that costs $3 individually to produce may require multiple production runs at a 10 board minimum per run; add parts costs and shipping and it may be a few hundred dollars per design. This doesn\u0027t include the cost of assembly tools and testing equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhile the larger art installations are funded through art grants and other fundraising efforts, hardware design is an ongoing process that often inspires new projects. The cost of working on new hardware is there whether or not installation funding comes through; grants may pay for completed control systems for art installations, but not the R\u0026amp;D costs for designing them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny funding received here will go 100% to working on these projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd what can I give you in return?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am a supporter of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eopen source hardware\u003c/a\u003e. I want to share the work I do with anyone who is interested in building and creating more awesome things. The hardware I design is available for free for anyone who wants to use it in their own projects, and I am happy to work with other artists or groups to modify and customize individual designs for their applications.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd finally, a disclaimer: while many of my projects are used for ridiculous projects like \u003ca href=\"http://site3firearts.ca/#riskeeball-content\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eoversized Skee Ball lanes that shoot fire\u003c/a\u003e, not everything here will involve fire. (Just most of it. Probably.) I know what I am doing in the area of fire art; the installations I work on have been displayed at public city events, are compliant with NFPA 160 and have been inspected (and approved) by safety organizations including local fire departments and the TSSA. While I won\u2019t say \"don\u2019t do this at home\" (please do this at home), be careful when working with fire.\u003cbr\u003e"
