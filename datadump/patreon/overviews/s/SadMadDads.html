    "summary": "The Sad Mad Dads are three new fathers, wandering through the strange, horrifying and exhausting yet wonderful, exciting and fulfilling world of being a reluctant grown up and parent. And trying to get their heads around the fact that their dreams and desires are now small considerations in an increasingly complex matrix of stuff that needs doing NOW. The Dads document their experiences and reflections in a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://sadmaddads.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlog\u003c/a\u003e and record a comedy\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sadmaddads.podbean.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePodcast\u003c/a\u003e where they discuss their opinions, comment on current affairs, try to be funny and showcase any creative exploits that they may have managed to fit into their chaotic schedules.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour generous support will allow us to get the hosts into the studio, cover the hosting costs and maintain our high audio quality. With enough support, we could have more funds to get more interviews and guests, more time to increase the quality and relevance of the information we present to you, actually be funny on occasion and we might even become better parents. And better Podcasters, obviously. There is a massive slice of the creative community that are parents and, therefore, struggle to get their art / music / media out there. We\u0027d like to help change that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will also acknowledge all new Patrons during the Podcast and thank you profusely so that you can boast about it to your friends. And we\u0027ll be forever grateful."
