    "summary": "Greetings, star-eyed child!!! I\u2019m glad to have you here!! I\u2019m Yume!! I\u2019ve been drawn to drawing (ba-dum-tss) since I was a child, but have never really had the chance to pursue an artistic career... But that only means there are many things I can still try to achieve!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI suffer from an array of chronic conditions and they have gotten in my way a lot recently, making it really hard for me to leave my bed for long periods of time, which makes it pretty much impossible for me to work. My family doesn\u2019t make the situation any easier for me, so if I want to afford proper treatment, I have to do something about it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here!!!\u003cbr\u003eI thought that maybe if I can save little by little with the amount of time my body allows me to spend doing what I like, eventually I\u2019ll be able to do something!! While improving my art at the same time!!\u003cbr\u003eRight now there isn\u2019t so much I can do, but hopefully, with time and support, I\u2019ll be able to offer more!!!\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking out my page!!\u003cbr\u003eLets keep dreaming!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2606Update\u2606\u003cbr\u003eAs of March 11, I have been diagnosed and have now access to treatment!!
