    "summary": "Thanks so much to anyone visiting this page and considering supporting me and my mods! Things have escalated quickly. I went from knowing nothing about coding to trying to edit existing mods to meet my needs for my own personal use, to realizing I would need to just start from scratch to get the outcome I wanted. I then began to see the demand out there for a prostitution mod and decided I want to work with the community to work at exactly what we are looking for!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter/along with the prostitution mod, I want to create many mods and learn to make CC as well. So, any of my pledges on here, please be vocal! Make requests, comment on requests you like. I need practice and I\u0027m going to get it trying to create exactly what you are all hoping for :)"
