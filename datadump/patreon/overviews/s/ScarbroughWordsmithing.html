    "summary": "This isn\u0027t how I thought my adult life would be. I thought it would be a mindless office job and a steady paycheck, not flying full-tilt into a career of artistry by the seat of my pants, with a best-laid plan and the ups and downs that come with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up in a household on cusp between the middle class and poverty, in a bad neighborhood in my favorite city in the world, Kansas City, MO. It was only natural that my parents would steer me toward books for entertainment, both for my own edification and for the relative affordability they provide, but even they couldn\u0027t foresee the impact that my devouring need to consume books would have on my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was 15, having just finished reading \u003cu\u003eFahrenheit 451\u003c/u\u003e by Ray Bradbury for the first time, I decided I wanted, or needed, to be the opposite of his Firemen. I wanted desperately to create these miraculous compilations of ideas, to write the things I could see and hear in my mind\u0027s eye for other people, to allow them to experience the wonder of the world as I did. My life\u0027s dream became then, and remains today, to create a lasting work of poignant, relevant fiction, which will inspire others in turn to properly value the written word and teach them unexpected life lessons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBradbury was the final straw, but he was not the only inspiration in this regard. As a young child I had read everything I was capable of understanding, to the point of reading The Hobbit to its completion at 7 years old. Into my teens, my reading - and thus, my understanding of what was as yet a simple fantasy of a potential future - expanded exponentially, incorporating writers such as Le Guin, Louis L\u0027amour, Tolkien, Zane Grey, Burroughs, Frank Herbert, and the myriad authors in Star Wars, among literally hundreds of others. As I\u0027ve grown both as a person and a writer, a little bit of each of those writers\u0027 work and the lessons they teach both conceptually and regarding writing itself as an art form has intertwined itself in my personal style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I graduated from high school slightly early, at 17, and found myself tossed into the more adult world of university academia, my reading scope widened exponentially again. I found myself studying non-fiction for classes, and learning different ways to express ideas, from the stolid, straightforward writing of stodgy grumps like Marx, Engels, and Nietzsche, to the melancholy of Wilde and Plath, to the fanciful whimsy of as-yet-unknown (to me) classics such as Tanith Lee and\u00a0Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI chose to major in English Arts and minor in Creative Writing, to learn to capture this skill and enhance my natural talent with the art of wordsmithing. Since then, I have written nearly limitless commissioned fanfiction, several articles, edited too many projects to count, and three years ago, begun work as a full-time freelancer in both writing and editing. I have also begun work on a relatively unique novel, which, I hope, will be a bestseller when it\u0027s finished.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the pursuit of my nearly lifelong goal of creating written work that will positively impact the world in mind, I have decided to create this Patreon to both connect with fans of my already considerable, if relatively insignificant, body of work and to ask for your help in maintaining my ability to produce art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon will focus on three aspects of my life as an aspiring author. First, it will focus on my newest creation, a hardboiled supernatural series of short stories focusing on a keen-edged, hard-hitting reporter named Ace Sterling, who wants nothing more than to experience the beauty of the supernatural world, but is repetitively assaulted by the horrific and the grotesque. Secondly, it will focus on my work on my personal novel, which will be generally referred to on this page by its working title, Starspun. Starspun tells the story of a woman who, in following the trail of her missing wife, is led on a merry chase through not only our universe, but several others, with adventures both grand and terrifying. Lastly, it will focus on what my long-time fans will recognize as an ongoing project: the worldbuilding and story aspects of the post-apocalyptic d20 tabletop RPG system called Apocalypse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your interest and support, I know that I can not only meet my realistic and necessary monetary goals, but I can also work to make my dream a reality, creating art through wordsmithing that will last for generations to come.\u003cbr\u003e"

This target includes my shares of the rent, the electric, water, and internet service bills, and my personal cell phone bill. With this goal reached, it will allow me to take a portion of the monetary load currently being carried by my spouse and housemate, and allow us to start saving more money as a family unit.",
