We\u0027re much more concerned with creating new work, and then getting it out RIGHT AWAY, and moving on to the next project. I first set this up to help me manage custom orders for my new book, which just came out, through A. Keck Press, and if people happen to become patrons, it means I can give them access to all sorts of extra things next time I work on a special art, book, music, or curatorial project. \n\u003cstrong\u003eKnowing there\u2019s someone out there to make art for is pretty important for artists, so the idea of Patreon is kind of amazing, and very motivating. I\u2019m hoping that this will enable me to spend more time on my art, and have people to send gifts to. I love making presents! \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is set up in a way that helps organize who wants which gifts.  It\u0027s a chance for you to become an official patron of the arts. Any time I create a new Thing, patrons will get exclusive content (and sometimes physical gifts) before everyone else.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAbout Riddled with Spots\u003c/h2\u003e\nRiddled with Spots is a short book about the Maker\u0027s search. It traces the journey of artists (also known as The Moonlight Hunters) on the search for their creations. This pictorial poem was created as a posthumous collaboration with Charles Whymper. A visual narrative that invites interpretation, the space and pacing reflects how artists internalize the world, and how the world internalizes them. \u00a0(*If you\u0027re into literary theory, you\u0027ll probably come up with all sorts of connections hidden inside the poem. \u00a0If enough people (let\u0027s say 5) get the signed edition of the book, I\u0027ll release an explanation decoding the connections.) This book was my first funded THING on Patreon. \u00a0Anyone who pledges now will not be charged until I create the next big THING. \u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://wp.me/p2N3F9-gd\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFor more information about the book and where to get it, click here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://sarahzar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cover-moonlight-hunter-square.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFAQ\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019m considering becoming a patron.

Pledges are per Thing. You\u2019ll only be giving a dollar when I release a Thing.  If I disappear for a few months to work on a top-secret project, you don\u2019t get charged anything.  I will probably release 0-2 Things per month on average, but you know how unpredictable artists can be.  If you have a particular contribution level in mind, I encourage you to cap your monthly amount at that number.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI live outside of North America.  Will you still mail things to me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n*Of course!  If you live in Europe or elsewhere and would like a physical copy of the book or other gifts I send out over time, please consult with me about shipping costs to your country, before selecting your pledge amount! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will I get my book in the mail?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you order by January 15th, you will have your book in time for Valentine\u0027s Day, if not much sooner, as long as you live in North America! (This leaves me time to personalize your orders once they\u0027re shipped to me from the publisher).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI want more than one of the books with all the bells and whistles.  What do I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you pledge multiples of twenty, I will send you the appropriate number of books.  So if you want two, you can press the reward button in the Book Lovers section on the right, then choose to increase your pledge to 40.  For 3, you can pledge 60, and so on.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nI only pledged a dollar, why do you need my shipping address? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter you\u2019ve stuck around for a bit, I might want to send you a small thank you card in the mail. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eYou just added a new award level, can I switch to get the new things?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course you can!

This could be book projects, drawings, paintings or collages, sculptures, songs, music videos, or entire art shows. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nREADY? HERE WE GO:\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLet\u0027s say there\u0027s a hypothetical artist (let\u0027s call them \"Stranger\") who is working on a top secret long term art project that they can\u0027t tell anyone about, that won\u0027t be ready for at least a few years.  They\u0027re also creating smaller projects while preparing the really big project, but none of these things follow a traditional schedule.  After all, every creative knows that time is precious and inspiration strikes often, but rarely on alternating Sundays.  Stranger can set up one of these Patreon pages in such a way that his/her patrons pledge to contribute a fixed amount each time Stranger completes a Thing.  This support essentially \"buys time\" for Stranger to focus on making, and then the patrons get sneak previews and all sorts of other special perks for being encouraging and wonderful.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I want to become \"Stranger\u0027s\" patrons, and I want to contribute $1 per thing, but not more than $10 per month?  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s very generous of you!  After you push the \"Become a patron\" button at the top of the page, you can choose to set a monthly limit to cap the number of dollars you will pledge, in case Stranger happens to make an INSANE amount of Things one month.  That helps make sure patrons of the arts (yes, you!) give only as much as they\u0027re comfortable with, and Stranger doesn\u0027t need to feel guilty for making too much or too little art.  Patrons only support the art when art is actually made.  Because creating a LOT is a good thing, and really, the whole point of all this... \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIf Stranger doesn\u0027t make anything for a couple months, will I get charged during those months?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNo.  You only contribute as a patron when actual Things are made.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI like what \"Stranger\" is doing, but I\u0027m strapped for cash and really just want the book. Please don\u2019t pledge anything if you need that dollar!  This whole patreon thing is supposed to make all of us feel good about participating our community.  I would never want a penny from someone who needs it.  You can go get the book over at sarahzar.com/books\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWill something amazing happen if we invite all our friends to be patrons? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m glad you asked!  If the amount raised per Thing one day gets to 5,000, then every time I release a Thing, I will draw a name from a very special hat, and send one of you an original oil painting in the mail, signed and with a certificate of authenticity, for your art collection.  Or a sculpture.  Or some other one of a kind art object, whatever form it may take.  If the amount raised per Thing gets to 10,000, I\u0027ll send one of you an even BIGGER painting. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eEnough with all the \"Stranger\" stuff, we know it\u0027s you!  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou\u0027re right, it\u0027s me...  I\u0027ve never done this before either, can you tell?  If you have any more questions or suggestions, you can contact me here: \n\u003ca href=\"http://sarahzar.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://sarahzar.com/contact/\u003c/a\u003e"
