    "summary": "Hi, this is Danger and Russ from the YouTube channel \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SnakeFistExplosion\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSnakeFistExplosion\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0We\u0027re freelance video editors by day and YouTube gaming streamers by night. \u00a0It all started off when we just wanted to make some funny GTA videos, and fast forward 3 years later we\u0027re streaming most days of the week on top of making a few edited videos as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love what we do, and its amazing how much our channel has grown over the years, and we\u0027ve met a lot of really cool people along the way. \u00a0The dream has always been that one day we could support ourselves with the channel and focus on making content. But with the inconsistencies of YouTube in general, and the struggles involved in balancing that with being a freelance editor; we\u0027re looking to Patreon to help us fill the gap when it comes to making the move to create content for our viewers on a full time basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe tend to dream big, its probably why we formed a channel together in the first place. \u00a0Russ, deep down, is a filmmaker and wants to make movies. \u00a0Danger wants to make video-games and write books. \u00a0As supporters of our Patreon, you would not just be supporting the content we already create on YouTube, but would open us up to create more things that we would share with you - our supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe dont take this lightly, we hate the idea of asking the people who support us so much already to contribute to our Patreon; but we think this could be a very good thing for us as creators, but also for the people who watch our content. \u00a0YouTube, as some may have come to realize, tends to reward creators who can manipulate the system in their favor. \u00a0This means only streaming games that perform well (GTA5), trading interaction with the viewers for constant begging for likes and subscriptions, and creating misleading titles and thumbnails to trick new viewers into watching them. \u00a0The way we look at it, if our support comes from Patreon, we would be under less pressure to have to compete on YouTube in this way, and would end up playing games that people enjoy seeing us play instead of thinking about what will attract more views. \u00a0This doesn\u0027t just make our content more enjoyable for you; our supporter, but all of our viewers as a whole.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks in advance for your support, and for wanting to help us make our channel better. We hope that what we offer back can return the favor in some small way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDanger and Russ from SnakeFistExplosion"
