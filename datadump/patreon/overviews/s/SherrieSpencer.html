    "summary": "Thanks so much for looking at my Patreon page.  My name is Sherrie Spencer, and\u00a0\nI am\na fantasy and children\u0027s book illustrator, a story teller, and art\nteacher.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\nhave been producing artwork nearly my entire life. Transforming\nthoughts and images into tangible creations has been a passion for me\nsince the beginning, and it was borne of necessity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt\nthe age of five, I suffered a major stroke. With the entire right\nside of my body disabled and my right arm completely paralyzed, my\nlife had changed dramatically in an instant.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince\nmy speech was severely impaired, I began to draw in an effort to\ncommunicate my thoughts and needs to those around me. My first\nartistic effort was a drawing of a horse (what little girl\u0027s life\nwould be complete without one?).\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecause\nmy Mother could not at first identify what I was trying to draw, I\nknew I had to sharpen my skills in an effort to perfect my craft. The\nlevel of detail and the lifelike imagery evident in my work is\ntestimony to this goal having been accomplished.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith\nintensive therapy and the passage of time, I regained my mobility in\npart and my speech entirely. At that point, however, I had already\ndeveloped an insatiable passion for art. I began drawing in earnest,\nand took advantage of inspiration whenever it presented itself.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis\noutward expression of inward feelings served as something of a coping\ndevice when I was an adolescent, attempting to cope with all that\ncomes at that point in life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nExposure\nto the world of art and artists themselves inspired me to embark on a\ncareer of my own. I discovered immediately that it suited me\nperfectly; my deep devotion to creating and my strong ambition have\nproven to be indispensable assets. Even now, doing what I love for a\nliving is proving to be more than its own reward.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn\nthe time since finding her calling, I have displayed my works all\nover the country at Comic Book Conventions, SCA events, Renaissance\nfestivals, brick and mortar Galleries, Fine Art Shows and world wide\non the internet. My art has been published several times in small\npress books over the years, including The Little House of Music (a\nchildren\u0027s book), 26 Tears, the Dawn 2006 Convention Sketchbook which\nfeatures similar art, as well as my own self published art books\nDreams and Desires vol. 1-4, and Fantastical Enchantments, my very\nfirst coloring book of fairy art.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\ncontinue to work on her own graphic novel, to be completed sometime\nin the next year. I also have begun producing functional art products\n(some are featured here, and on my website) in which I utilize a\nlaser machine to help me make wooden and leather hand made products.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlthough\nI feels there\u0027s much more yet to learn, and that I have far to go, I\nam intent on enjoying the journey.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy become a patron of the arts, you ask?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo you can share in this journey of inward thoughts becoming outward expressions, and see through an artists eyes the wonders that await you.!"
