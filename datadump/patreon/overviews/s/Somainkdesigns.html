Since I was a child, I was always asking \"why?\" , always sharing and expanding my love of nature and any information I could find on how it \"works\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIam a believer that we must insist on being thinkers, doers and trying even if failing - attempts to create, modify and express new combinations of art and the natural world. From functional motions, natural cycles, beauty, and the unknown to recreating and spreading innovation and compassion through biomimicry , inventions, stories, visual artwork and community- this is what it should mean to be human.",
