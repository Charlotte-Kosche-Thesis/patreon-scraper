    "summary": "Hi all, Stav here, and if you\u0027re reading this I guess you\u0027re considering becoming a Stav-Tech Patron, so, basically, THANK YOU, because as you well know, Patreon is going to be the only way I\u0027ll be funding all these badass tuning-related features, videos, tests, and general rare awesomeness I do for you lot, and it will be impossible to continue without your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile if you\u0027ve got this far you must know what I do, but the important things to know is this is ALL I do! To keep doing this constantly, and of course make things bigger and better, I need funding somehow, and that\u0027s where you guys can save the day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike so many YouTubers and similar, I\u0027m not some rich kid, I don\u0027t drive a 911 Turbo or live in a big fancy house and don\u0027t even need your money like so many others, I am, honestly, pretty damn poor lol. The long and short of it is, unless StavTech starts earning rapidly I will have to either slow my work/updates with the brand, or end it all together. But with funding I want to INCREASE the rate I give you the awesome car tech in it\u0027s varous forms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI drive a \u00a3400 car, rent a pretty crappy house, and while I have my RX7 and Pug 205 I love dearly, I\u0027m that broke at the moment I can\u0027t even afford to use them- BUT despite all this I\u0027m doing daily in-depth things for you guys either on the YouTube channel, the Facebook page, or the StavTech website, as I LOVE what I do, it seems you lot do too, and I HOPE I can truly make a living from StavTech!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLiterally even \u00a31 a month if only ALL the StavTech Facebook fans would instantly make this a full time job AND allow me to buy new equipment and create awesome tuning tests and features for you guys, and while we all know only a small % of people really will become a Patron, if YOU can give as much as you feel you can, and feel I deserve for what I give you you via StavTech, it can TRULY make a difference and make this StavTech dream come true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first aim is simply to buy a decent video camera to film the YouTube videos with, but my ultimate dream would be to create a UK version of the Engine Masters show, busting the countless tuning myths out there on the engines we all know and love, but that\u0027s long in to the future, so one step at a time..."
