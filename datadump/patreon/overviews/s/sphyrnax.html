However, what differs from my DA commissions is that here you get the chance to participate in a monthly raffle for a shot at free art besides what you order.\u003c/span\u003eDoesn\u0027t matter what you order, you all will be participating in the same. The amount of raffle\u00a0winners will vary (from one to multiple) depending on the number of commissions I get that month. This is up to my judgment!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future,\u00a0I expect to start recording timelapses of these commissions (adding an extra exclusivity to it) but currently it\u0027s only that, expectations; as well as offering the PSDs for those who might be interested (even though there\u0027s nothing special in them, I do most of the work in 2-4 layers).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e What\u0027s so special about my art? Why would you want to order from me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBasically a couple things. First one, the price tag. I keep my art affordable because I know not everyone has a hundred dollars to pay for a fancy piece from other good artists (not saying I\u0027m cheap and that artists should be cheap). This makes it possible for a diversity of people to order something, even those who live from allowances!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond one, you can do WHATEVER you want with the art that you order. You can use it for commercial purposes, resell it, claim it as yours, say you painted it, post it anywhere you want, modify it anyhow you want, ANYTHING! You don\u0027t have to ask me for permission (even though I\u0027d love to know if you have plans for it no matter what it is). I believe that you should have the right to do whatever the hell you want with something you buy, so there is that! Royalty free art with love for you. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e How can you live off such small prices?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live in a cheap country, my life is not expensive and I don\u0027t need thousands of dollars to survive. I\u0027m a humble doodie who just enjoys art and wants to offer a piece of himself to those who decide to support him. The price might or might not go up slightly in the upcoming years depending on how the economy turns out but I will forever have a category where my prices will ALWAYS be affordable no matter the timeline we\u0027re in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003e ___________\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003eAnyway, that\u0027s pretty much all I have to say. :) Thank you VERY much if you decide to support me, all the money earned goes to food, bills, medicine for when I get sick (rarely), the cutie friends we call pets and savings for the future. Forgive me if I have any grammatical mistakes, English is not my mother tongue. ^^\u003cbr\u003e"
