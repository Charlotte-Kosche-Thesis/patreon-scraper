    "summary": "Save More Kids is helping to rebuild an entire nation by investing in youth empowerment! Save More Kids (herein referred to as \u0026#8220;SMK\u0026#8221;) is a 501 (C) 3 non-profit agency founded by Quanuquanei Karmue (Q) and his wife Wendy Karmue. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSMK supports Christ\u0026#8217;s Children Home Orphanage (CCH) located in Liberia, West Africa. CCH was established in 2009, when Q\u0026#8217;s parents (Neyor \u0026amp; Fungbeh Karmue) selflessly went back to their war-torn country, Liberia and adopted 44 children, all orphaned due to 15 years of civil war. The family home has become one of the best orphanages in the entire country of Liberia. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of the Impact Project is to create a financial engine through a social enterprise (rubber tree and palm tree farms) that provides not only immediate employment and economic stability but also long-term sustainability for the development of programs that directly impact the lives of Liberians. Programs focusing, social impact, education, community development and growing the local economy will provide hope for the future by influencing the minds of young people in Liberia, an alternative to the influx of negative outside influences like ISIS, Boko Haram and other terrorist groups and potential war lords who thrive on young impoverished and hopeless people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSMK was created as a means for reaching thousands of children living with very little hope for their future. Save More Kids serves as an alternative voice for children surrounded by unfavorable conditions. We have a 3 pronged approach to fixing long-term problems: One, empowering young people by meeting them where they are; Two, mentoring their hearts, connecting their minds to open their eyes to the problems that continues to cripple their environment, and future; Three, we provide them with the resources they need so that they can become the solutions to the problems threatening their world! Simply put, the best way to solve long-term problems is by creating an environment where the youth and the community can become major stakeholders in a part of the solution to the problems they face. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe do this through 5 major initiatives:\u003cbr\u003e1) Christ Children\u0027s Home\u003cbr\u003e2) Education Fund\u003cbr\u003e3) Emergency Relief Project\u003cbr\u003e4) Girl\u0027s Period Project\u003cbr\u003e5) Rubber Tree Impact Project\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur vision is to help rebuild Liberia by investing in urban, rural, underdeveloped communities and societies around the country.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more information, visit our website at \u003ca href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.savemorekids.org%2F\u0026amp;h=cAQEUjulD\u0026amp;s=1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.savemorekids.org\u003c/a\u003e"
