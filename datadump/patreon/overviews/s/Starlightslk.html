    "summary": "I am a veteran cosplayer that has been cosplaying for over 10+ years now and I love doing so but as of late it has not been in my budget.\u00a0I currently am freelancing in Film/TV/Video Production so spending time/resources on cosplay is a luxury I can\u0027t afford but\u00a0I have so many fantastic ideas for costumes, photoshoots, and videos that I would love to create by supporting me here you will help me to bring these ideas to life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love shooting on location and that has resulted in some amazing photoshoots! I also have several short films scripted that I would love to create, this is in addition to ramping up my video content in general. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am professionally trained with a ton of experience in Film/TV production so if given a budget/proper equipment I can do some really cool things; which coincidentally is my long-term dream and ultimate goal for this Patron! (I\u0027m really hoping I can get to the point with this Patreon where I am able to create short films and compete in film festivals!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI did something similar on a small scale in 2014 by pre-selling prints of a planned photoshoot so that I could purchase the official replica of Mami\u0027s rifle. So in the same vein by supporting me here you would get early access to new content I create before the rest of the internet as well as exclusive content. Trust me I have some amazing ideas lined up. ^_~\u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe support I receive from here will go towards things like new equipment, materials, supplies, and offsetting the cost for all the time that goes into the production of the photo/video shoots (including editing/post-production which I currently do myself) as well as any other related costs.\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/2665.png\" style=\"height: 1.25em; width: 1.25em; color: rgb(41, 47, 51);\" title=\"Heart suit\"\u003e\u00a0(Please see my goals for more info.)"

Some high end festivals still require film in order to accept your submission for consideration, which is quite costly but to be fair film is my favorite medium to work on, there\u0027s just something sexy about actual film.
