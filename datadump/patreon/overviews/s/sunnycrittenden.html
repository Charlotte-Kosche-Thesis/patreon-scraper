I finally settled on \"my girls\", which I\u0027m most known for, in 2008, after taking a class on the internet on how to draw a face that didn\u0027t have googly eyes, for which I\u0027m grateful, because until then, I didn\u2019t know how to express my ideas in an artistically aesthetic way, beyond being a camgirl and taking photos. Now, my girls are just how I draw people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I\u0027m trying to build a brand, it\u0027s called SunnyGrrrl. It\u0027s feminist, not always nice, and my girls are the heroes. My work consists of mixed media paintings and colouring pages right now, with a few Art Resin pieces mixed in, when I can afford to play with that medium.  Some of my work is pretty. I like making pretty things, especially if I think it might be hung in a child\u0027s room. Some of my work is a little dark. I like to document things, so I consider the documentation of all of my projects almost part of the art itself since it\u0027s all uploaded to social media, and specifically for people to consume and enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sunnycrittenden.com/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem\u0026amp;g2_itemId=13542\u0026amp;g2_serialNumber=1\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople sometimes say to me, \"I love you!

Eventually it may help me fulfill artistic goals I can only dream of right now, like one day having an art show at a real art gallery in Toronto, maybe even with a menu of my choosing, and free wine and beer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sunnycrittenden.com/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem\u0026amp;g2_itemId=13546\u0026amp;g2_serialNumber=1\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlmost every creative thing I do is with my patrons in mind, whether it\u0027s creating Polaroids or colouring pages, or documenting the creation of a mixed media painting, my #1 thought is almost always, \"what will my patrons think of this?\" or I create things for specific patrons to enjoy because I know what they like. I write and document because I get excited and feel compelled to in the moment. I create art because that is the energy I feel in my bones.

I do not create on deadlines so the colouring pages are released as I\u0027m inspired to make them.
