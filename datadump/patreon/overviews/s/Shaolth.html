    "summary": "Welcome to my page and thank you for the time to read!\u00a0First off, I want to sincerely thank all my friends, family, fans and potential patrons for the time, dedication and support given to me, for if not for everyone I would not have come as far as I have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout me; My birth name is Jaden but my Alias is Shaol. I am an aspiring author aged 22 working on a massive fantasy novel series involving unique dragons and creatures. Not only is it just a book series in works but I am hoping to take it further as the world of Kelretha created is so vast in lore and development that it has the potential to become something greater. And that is my dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a young man with disabilities such as Asperger\u0027s and other complications\u00a0that I am living with day to day striving to produce and progress my creative imagination and so the thought came to me to come to Patron to offer involvement and rewards to friends and patron\u0027s who support me in the times tough to see my dream become a reality as well that the proceedings would go mainly towards saving for book publication, editing, production and only if needed for life stability as I cannot work normal day to day jobs. As discouraging as that is to me I can use my talents for writing and so here I will put in the effort as motivation and goals to see through my works become known to the world; as well to offer involvement in the future for those who truly believe in this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo let me tell you a bit spoiler-free of my first book; \"Infernus Rerversal - Fate\". This is a revision-remake overhaul of my 2011 legacy book, \"The Last Infernal - Innocence of Youth\" as I have grown a lot from then to now. Featuring in the Fantasy world of Kelretha; the main protagonist is a unique young female dragon blessed at birth chosen by a fate she never expected to come. When all seems peaceful within a sanctuary called home; one life-changing event turns to another as the young is forced into a new life of survival and strife to endure alongside her only friend. In a hostile world that judges and challenges one to the limit, She must overcome what is laid before her and adapt if she is to survive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to captivate those to give my writing a chance and make it feel rewarding to support me as I involve myself directly with the audiance of my friends, supporters and hope to make new friends along the way. I intend to do voice audio, video streams potentially and frequent updates to here on Patreon, Discord and my own website, \u003ca href=\"http://www.Kelretha.ca/\"\u003ehttp://www.Kelretha.ca\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am open to all feedback/critism and welcome interaction be it through chats or voice but please understand too I have a very busy life being a single father as well many I try to keep up with but I do assure my Patrons\u0027 will be the priority for my progression to my novel build. I have a whole large series in mind and plan long term deveoplement so give it a chance as worse case all are free to stop at any time no pressure. I only ask for patience day to day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe official discord server: \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/WewBvn7\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/WewBvn7\u003c/a\u003e (The Discord is in Alpha stage of being built, please bear patience there!)\u003cbr\u003e"
