His skepticism was eroded, however, when she began to channel \nmessages from \u201cthe space between lives,\u201d which contained remarkable \nrevelations about Dr. Weiss\u2019s family and his dead son. Using past-life \ntherapy, he was able to cure the patient and embark on a new, more \nmeaningful phase of his own career. A graduate of Columbia University and Yale Medical School, Brian L. \nWeiss M.D. is Chairman Emeritus of Psychiatry at the Mount Sinai Medical\n Center in Miami. Dr. Weiss conducts national and international seminars and \nexperiential workshops as well as training programs for professionals. His work has been covered by major media including The New York Times, 20/20, and The Oprah Winfrey Show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout \u003ca href=\"http://www.jimbtucker.com\"\u003eDr. Jim Tucker\u003c/a\u003e: Jim B. Tucker, M.D. is Bonner-Lowry Professor of \nPsychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences at the University of Virginia. \nHe is Director of the UVA Division of Perceptual Studies,\n where he is continuing the work of Dr. Ian Stevenson with children who \nreport memories of previous lives.  A board-certified child \npsychiatrist, Dr. Tucker worked with Dr. Stevenson for several years \nbefore taking over the research upon Dr. Stevenson\u2019s retirement in 2002.\n Dr. Tucker, who was raised Southern Baptist, had never \nseriously considered the possibility of past lives before reading one of\n Dr. Stevenson\u2019s books.  After learning about the work, he became \nintrigued both by the children\u2019s reports of past-life memories and by \nthe prospect of studying them using an objective, scientific approach.  \nHe contacted the Division and in 1999 began working there half-time.  A \nyear later, he gave up his private practice completely to work at the \nuniversity.  He has now published two books and numerous papers in \nscientific journals.  He has spoken before both scientific and general \naudiences and has made a number of television appearances, including \nGood Morning America, Larry King Live, and CBS Sunday Morning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Creator\u003c/strong\u003e: Standards of Starlight is a publishing and entertainment company created by the super-enthusiastic-about-great-stories Kelly Utt-Grubb.

For example, if you\u2019re an entrepreneur, I might write it so one of my characters tries out your product or service. If you volunteer at a wildlife sanctuary, I might write it so one of my characters pays a visit or attends a fundraising event.

For example, if you own and charter yachts in the Florida Keys, I might have a couple of my main characters spend time in your area and interact with you. If you\u2019re affiliated with a foundation that supports groundbreaking medical research, I might have one of my main characters become afflicted with the related ailment and seek out your research for a cure. You/your character will appear throughout the novel and will play a significant role in the story line. I\u2019ll also feature you and your personal story to my Patreons and fans, will name you in the Acknowledgements section of one or more novels, and will pay a visit to you in person and take you out for a thank you dinner at your favorite restaurant.\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlus:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u2022 Good vibes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u2022 Exclusive content in the activity feed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u2022 Behind-the-scenes chapters throughout the editing process\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u2022 Behind-the-scenes videos on story inspiration, celebrity wish list movie star picks, professionals involved in the editing and publishing process, and real places featured in the series\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u2022 Invitation to an exclusive online video chat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u2022 Indie publishing and brand marketing tutorials\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u2022 A chance to meet Kelly Utt-Grubb at a real place that inspired a place in the series and to appear on a behind-the-scenes mini tour\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u2022 Autographed paperback copies of any six novels in the series\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u2022 Two limited edition tshirts (different designs) available only to Patreons\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u2022 A verbal shout-out at the end of each behind-the-scenes video\u003c/p\u003e",
