    "summary": "One day, when I had some free time at my day job, I sat down and thought about what I loved doing the most. Music popped first into my mind, quickly followed by singing. Then playing video games. And making people smile and laugh. I love connecting with people. And I combined these loves into making parodies and original songs about the video games I enjoy the most.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI started running into the wall of needing additional time and money to continue making these songs and videos. I would love to drop down to part-time and put more focus on creating new songs, original songs, with videos by all our favorite machinimators... and I\u0027d love to pay them for their time and expertise.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFor assistance in this, I turn to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to support me on Patreon, you\u0027ll gain early access to any future songs and videos, insight into the projects I\u0027m working on, and a voice to work with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYour support will translate to me having more time to make this content for and with you. We\u0027ll be able to enlist great machinimators and music collaborators. We\u0027ll push more limits, creating bigger and better songs and machinimas.\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to working with you. :)"
