    "summary": "Heylo,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot to get too Robert Frost-y, but on the left hand is a distant Art Mountain, as described by Mr. Neil Gaiman. On the right is a level path: the desk job. I work as a human resource specialist, and I\u0027m good at it. I could easily continue along the the telephone-answering, Excel-using route and eventually have what one could consider a very good career. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing is, I can do more \u003cstrong\u003egood\u003c/strong\u003e if I pursue art. Good Art is an experience--a catalyst for thought and empathy. It is a vicarious experience that teaches mindfulness and consideration, and I want to add those sorts experiences to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, \"the first law of art is sacrifice.\" I dedicated myself, endured grueling critiques and practice, and I earned my Bachelor\u0027s degree in fine arts. I gave up my second job to make more studio time. I\u0027ve spent money entering art shows and poetry competitions. I\u0027ve sacrificed sleep, health, and sanity. Perhaps the fact that I\u0027m writing this note at 2:58 a.m. is a testament.\u00a0 It\u0027s all starting to pay off: I\u0027ve had a visual art residency and group show in Cleveland, my writing was published in Exile, and one of my images was used on the New England Review\u0027s website, but I need to press harder. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt takes time and money. Good Art requires even more. Good Art requires \u003cem\u003econsistent\u003c/em\u003e time and effort. I will continue producing work in my spare time no matter the circumstances, but I want the opportunity to offer the best art that I am capable of creating, and I want to share it and be able to live. I need patrons to do this; I need your help. If you value art, and the pursuit of art, please consider supporting me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe nitty gritty:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be posting a mixture of creative writing and visual art pieces. I write mostly poetry, because it relates well to my studio practice. When I\u0027m drawing, painting, or even creating an installation, I am trying to create poetry without words. Sometimes, I also combine words and graphics into a single piece. I draw a lot of inspiration from the everyday or my location, because \"Art is a harmony parallel to nature\" (C\u00e9zanne). Most of what you will see here will be drafts, especially when it comes to my poems, because I can\u0027t publish writing in literary journals if they\u0027ve already been published elsewhere.\u00a0 Due to the nature and frequency of my posts, I\u0027ve decided to do a monthly rather than a per-piece campaign. I would like to keep submitting pieces and poems to competitions, pay for supplies, pay for software and equipment (such as Adobe Creative Suite and a Wacom tablet) that would allow me to better meld my written and visual content, and to eventually be able to spend more time creating. Any funds I receive will go straight toward supporting me and my work.\u003cbr\u003e"
