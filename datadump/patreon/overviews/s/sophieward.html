    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWelcome to my community of readers, dreamers, thinkers, writers. What a journey we are all on. I\u2019d love to tell you a little of my story, how I got to this place, a glimpse of the prism of my life and love. Perhaps it might spark something within you, some comfort or inspiration on this gift of a day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Journey\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born in Australia and grew up mostly on the white sands of the ocean, where the red earth meets the sea, or in our big back yard climbing trees. I grew tall and lanky and found my way into modeling at age 15. By 23 after graduating with a degree in English and philosophy I woke up to the fact that I had an eating disorder \u2013 anorexia. For three years I had been starving myself whilst trying to fit into the perfect mold of model, student, daughter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen fellow Perth native Heath Ledger passed away, I flew to Los Angeles to be with my sister who had been close to him. Whilst there I realized I didn\u2019t want to go back to the land I had previously called home. I needed a new beginning, to throw all caution to the wind. I remember a dear friend of mine clutching my shoulders on the corner of a darkened street full of magnolias and jacaranda saying, \u201cJust do what you love. Be with who you love. Eat what you love, sing what you love, go where you love. Just do what you love.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese words changed my life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Glittering Crumbs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the next three years I would work on my self-worth, heal my body, transform my self-image and write the equivalent of six novels over three years whilst living in New York out of a suitcase. I poured words into a blog and self-published my first novel \u003cem\u003eThe Beginning of an Inexplicable Journey\u003c/em\u003e. Life was a mad adventure. I was following my dreams. I was really living, and looking back \u2013 on a cryptic quest to find love and the fullest self expression of my soul. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmazingly, the cosmos conspired with my daring requests and I discovered a glittering trail of crumbs left by the universe. A path was made with my words as they carved out my heart. As I walked it, it led me to my beloved. He is now my husband and (fast forward) we have been married five years, parents for almost three of those. We have experienced so much \u2013 love, loss, pregnancy, miscarriage, birth, New York, Bucks County, Los Angeles, and now, the mountains of Ojai. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe writing I did in New York has become my second self-published work \u2013 a book called \u003cem\u003eHeart of Bold\u003c/em\u003e.  It will be published soon and I am so thrilled to share it with those who feel called. Those words that tumbled out of me, questing, searching, aching for love, manifesting my dreams; they will be forever available to you. I am so excited! It is taking some time to shape this work of art and soul into something I feel proud of, and your support assists in so many ways in the journey towards making its publication possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my Patreon page as a space for my readers to connect with me on a deeper level. Here you will be able to receive signed books, personalized notes, footage of my book readings, private access to my journal entries before I post them on my blog, updates on my creative journey and more. My writing has always been very personal, but I\u2019m finding as I walk this path of motherhood, my time becomes more restricted and the shifts within my being become grander. It is harder for me to write as frequently as I once did, but when I do write, the distillation is more concentrated. I don\u2019t know what is next (I never have, have you!?) but you can be sure as a patron you will be the first one to know about my evolutions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am really just so grateful for the opportunity to share this beautiful journey with you. You, my readers, make it all so worthwhile. You are why I do what I do. You push me forward. Your every syllable of your support lives in my heart. Thank you for being here. I look forward to connecting with you!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
