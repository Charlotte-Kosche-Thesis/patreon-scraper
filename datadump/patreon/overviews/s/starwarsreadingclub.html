    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince April of 2016, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to join the amazing members of the Star Wars community through YouTube. What started out as an attempt to join like-minded fans of the novels, has evolved into something I could have never expected. In addition to book reviews, I make YouTube videos discussing different aspects of Star Wars lore, theories and the most recent news regarding upcoming Star Wars movies, television episodes, games, etc. More than anything, I enjoy having as much fun as possible in our fandom of Star Wars.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is a completely optional way of supporting my YouTube channel as I have chosen to dedicate myself to it full-time, as well as receive Patreon exclusives. Patreon will allow me to dedicate more time to creating videos with a greater frequency for discussions regarding the latest Star Wars news, but also improve the quality of the videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a long time, I have wanted to create more books reviews and multi-video series regarding a specific Star Wars topic, and Patreon will allow me introduce both to the channel. It will also provide me with the opportunity to create more videos related to Star Wars gaming on Twitch and a Star Wars-gaming specific YouTube channel, both of which would work as a complement to the main Star Wars Reading Club channel. Most importantly, Patreon will allow me to better interact with fans and viewers of the channel and just have fun as new Star Wars releases approach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for considering becoming a Patreon and helping to support me and the channel. I can\u2019t explain how much the support I have already received from the videos means to me and I look forward to continue celebrating our fandom of Star Wars."
