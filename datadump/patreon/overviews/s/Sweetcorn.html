So there will be \u003cbr\u003emost likely other kind of arts sooner or later.\u003cbr\u003eI draw Yaoi, Yuri and Hetero Things. Depending on what people suggest me to draw I will try to draw all kind of genres from time to time.\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t draw anything that makes me feel uncomfortable for requests or suggestions. \u003cbr\u003eThough I will tell you if this should be the case.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the current Comic about?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe current comics I\u0027m working on are two Sonic yaoi comics.

If you send me a message I send those to each patron privatly. I will most likely upload some preview panels inbetween every now and then too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI wanna support you but my pledge got declined. What should I do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0027re pledges got declined, it means that you won\u0027t be able to see any of my content anymore nor will you get any pages or illustrations to download.\u003cbr\u003eTo change that you need to check your payment settings , since there must a reason why your pledges got declined.\u003cbr\u003eOnce a week past I will send you a message, informing you about your pledge being declined. Patreon itself will also contact you every two days. Once your settings are fixed, the pledge should go through and you will be able to see my content again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is there no Art of a certain character ?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvery Patron of mine has the permission to make suggestions on what kind of art I should draw. To do that you can comment on any content of mine or simply send me a message. I will try to please everyone of my patrons. However, please keep in mind, that there are also things I wont draw. If I like the idea you suggested I will most likely start to draw more content of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf I pledge1-2$ per month, will I miss alot of content I could have get, if I would pledge 5$ ?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDon\u0027t worry. The remaining content that is for 5$ or more-patrons might also be full colored artwork. But it won\u0027t be anything that hasn\u0027t been drawn before in a different way. It will also only be around 5 artworks per month. I also won\u0027t post any previews/teases for these Artworks. \u003cbr\u003eThe comics are the main focus here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I only request once?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo. Every 5$ or more patron can have at least one request for becoming my patron. After that , there will be random times I can fulfill another request of yours. However, I won\u0027t do request in a monthly basis. Shall we say: You can always ask for requests after already receiving one but please consider that I won\u0027t have always time. If you\u0027re lucky and ask just around the right time I will be able to draw another request of yours.\u003cbr\u003eIf you really want a monthly request option, you would have to choose one of the highest rewards I have to offer. Those will be full colored. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI pledged to you, when can I have my reward/s?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou can already tell me your request/s on a messages or somewhere on my content right after you selected a reward.\u003cbr\u003eOnce the pledges goes through at the end of the month I will start to work on your request/s. \u003cbr\u003eSame goes for a speed paint video. \u003cbr\u003eThe best thing to do is to ask me directly via message. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of art-request can I ask for ?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThat depends on what kind of reward you selected. Full colored NSFW requests can\u00a0 either have 2 Human characters or 3 Mobians in it. Every reward below 20$ per month can have either 1 human or 2 Mobians. Again, there will be things I won\u0027t draw. Also there will be things that I simply can\u0027t draw. I\u0027m trying to practice new poses, angle and other things so if your requests is a complicated one, it might not come out as good. So you might consider requesting for art that I\u0027m actually able to draw.\u003cbr\u003e"

Once this goal is reached I will upload all pages I did so far plus the bonus pages for my patrons only. ( Yes this doujinshi has extra pages ) If my patrons want, they can also have a link to download all pages. \u003cbr\u003e",

So around\u00a0 26 pics or pages per month. AT LEAST. I would make sure to draw on a daily basic. and if I going to take a break for the weekend for example, simple predrawing more content during the week so that I still have something to upload on my \"free-days\" I would take this literally as my JOB. And I would highly appreciate your help. \u003cbr\u003eI would be online very often also , keep offering streams and let you decide on what to draw next ;\u0027D.

Its the only thing that makes us work harder to achieve our life goals. We may do or not do believe that we will actually succeed in our goals. But its worth a try. 2000$ a month is more than I could ever imagine. I could move out of this tiny one room flat and get a bigger flat for myself.\u00a0I would probably start to spend at least 8 hours a day on drawing. No more worries. Only drawing :3 \u003cbr\u003e",
