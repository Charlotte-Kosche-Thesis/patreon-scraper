Being Minnesotan, the only thing harder than setting this up is talking about myself enough to explain why you should support it, so I\u0027m going to let Jen do the talking for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo hi, now this is Jen. I started reading Steve\u0027s books in high school; I loved them then and I still do. His work furthered my love of both fantasy and classic literature. He has created worlds that I\u0027ve longed to step into and characters that I\u0027d love to buy a drink for, even if I\u0027d check my pockets afterward. A few years ago, I met him in person and he is warm and funny and caring. I\u0027ve enjoyed all the cool stuff on his blog, whether it\u0027s posts about politics or writing, songs he\u0027s written, running jokes, or the 13-part discussion series on Trotsky\u0027s \u003cem\u003eThe Revolution Betrayed.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, knowing Steve is one of the best parts of my life, and I don\u0027t think I\u0027m alone in wanting to make Steve\u0027s world better the way he\u0027s made ours better with his words. Your support would help Steve take care of bills and medical expenses.\u00a0Things can get tight between books coming out, and usually things are tightest at the times he most needs to focus on writing (and nothing slows down the work like worrying about money). Steve will be writing occasional updates for Patrons, and some of his blog content will be released to Patrons before it gets posted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this, and thank you for supporting and sharing the campaign.\u003cbr\u003e"
