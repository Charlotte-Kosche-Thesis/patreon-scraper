    "summary": "Since the results of our last crazy election, fake news has been all over the news. I believe in free speech, but I also believe in telling the truth. Part of the problem with social media is that it gives anyone a megaphone to reach everyone. Readers and voters are overwhelmed with news, which they\u0027ve lost the capacity to evaluate for authenticity. Half this country can\u0027t tell the difference between an article from the Washington Post in their news feed, and one from the guy working out of his mother\u0027s basement--or a country in eastern Europe. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we desperately need are platforms to aggregate and disseminate fact-based news from good sources! We need the reliable publisher who only publishes articles that have been thoroughly researched and are supported with facts that have been checked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to do with Alt Left Press. While it has a strong Liberal leaning, I don\u0027t publish any news that isn\u0027t from a reliable source, whether that source is the NYTimes or a stringer working to bring an untold story into the light. I don\u0027t post or share anything that I don\u0027t have 100% confidence in its authenticity and reliability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy readers (granted, they\u0027re a small group now but growing daily) have come to rely on the variety of sources I bring to them daily. This is a new concept in publishing: a platform aggregating news from multiple sources and guaranteeing that those sources are reliable. But it\u0027s based on a tried and true idea. Like a trusted Walter Conkite bringing the news to us each evening, the brown derby wearing Lou demanding a rewrite for accuracy, I want my readers to know that they can trust what they\u0027re reading in Alt Left Press is the truth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee my work in progress at AltLeft.host and follow me on Twitter and Facebook."
