    "summary": "Hi gang,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by my Patreon page! I\u2019m going to resist my natural urge to ramble and just get right to the point:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the moment I first picked up a guitar (I was 5!) I knew that music was in my blood. It was my only passion. And after twenty years as a professional performer - and all of the ups and downs that come with that life - my commitment to that passion has not wavered. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut more than that, I want to create a community - a family - of people who are invested in that music just as much as I am. I want to take all of that passion, work ethic, and perseverance I\u2019ve learned over the years and make music \u003cstrong\u003efor you\u003c/strong\u003e. And I am sincerely grateful to you for your interest in being a part of that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u2019s the plan: I\u2019m going to make music! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will record a minimum of one song a month until I have enough songs to release an album. Once the record is finished I will release it into the wild and start working on a new one. Throughout the process patrons will have access exclusive content, demos, interviews, livestreams of recording sessions, and even special cover versions of songs that \u003cstrong\u003eyou choose\u003c/strong\u003e. Pledge as little as $1.00 per song cycle and you\u2019ll be with me throughout the entire process. $2.00 gets you access to the music before it is released on each album. The rest of the patron goals support the creation of the work and give you access to me, my feed, and my progress, and even allow for collaboration! Thank you for your generous donations!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u2019s first on the docket? Well, the first album is going to be something special - something that I\u2019ve been wanting to do for ages. A long time ago I was in a whimsically creepy rock band called The Awful Lot with my buddy\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://johnwickpresents.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJohn Wick\u003c/a\u003e of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://7thsea.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e7th Sea\u003c/a\u003e fame. We recorded a six song demo way back in 2006, but I was never really happy with how it turned out. Two days to record six songs led to a lot of compromises in quality and I always thought it could have been better. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u2019d like to do it better. Not only do I know more about songwriting and arranging than I did back then, but I can actually record and mix it myself, which means that I can give it the attention it deserves! And maybe if I play my cards right I can even get John to perform on a track or two\u2026\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in learning more about me or hearing music from some of my past projects, please check out my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sheldonmorley.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e. Thanks again for taking the time to read this, guys. As always, I appreciate your support. I couldn\u0027t do it without you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Oh, I guess I ended up rambling after all, eh?)\u003cbr\u003e"
