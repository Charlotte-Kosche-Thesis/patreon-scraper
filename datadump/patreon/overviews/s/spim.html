    "summary": "Hi there, I really appreciate you taking the time to check out my Patreon page and i hope that you will understand why i have created it after reading the following.\u003cbr\u003eThis is the evolution of creative funding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a DJ/Producer that makes music, runs a free weekly Drum \u0026amp; Bass club night in Jersey and I have been sharing the Drum \u0026amp; Bass sound that i love for many years on my long running \u0027Subfactory Radio Show\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you will already be aware it is very difficult for underground musicians to balance earning money from a day job and then find the time and energy to let their creative juices flow to make something positive for others to enjoy. These days there just isn\u0027t any money in actually making music unless you really hit the big time. This is mainly because of the change in how most people collect their music. Downloading for free is now the norm and yet music is so important to our every day existence. Imagine a world where the only new music you could listen to was huge corporate funded pop!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve never been in to Drum \u0026amp; Bass for the money. Only the way it makes me feel. This feeling has developed into a deep love for all things DnB and a deep understanding of the power it can have to enrich lives of those who seek it. I also feel a deep responsibility to help Drum \u0026amp; Bass continue to grow alongside the people that contribute to it and also the people that resonate so perfectly with it. I have made no money from my radio show yet 1000\u0027s of people have benefited in many different ways from listening to it. I know this from the heartfelt messages that i have received from people all over the globe whom have received its assistance during hard times and happy times alike.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I took a leap of faith early this year and now work my day job part time which gives me a a chance to be as creative as i can as long as I\u0027m not worrying about my lack of funds! So this is where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love what i do. If you love my music. If you dance to my sets. If you regularly listen to my shows or watch my videos then this is an opportunity for you to give me some support easily with something personal in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for taking the time to read this. \u003cbr\u003eBig ups\u003cbr\u003eMuch Love\u003cbr\u003eSpim x\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
