    "summary": "I am creating a documentary about the Sioux and tribal communities and activists at Standing Rock, North Dakota. They are peacefully demonstrating against the construction of an oil pipeline through native land. My aim is to personalize the story by live streaming my crew\u0027s trip up, filming interviews with the Native people, and capturing the suffering of the people; as well as the devastation the North Dakota Pipeline would cause to Standing Rock land and water. I will be driving there with a small film crew in Rv\u0027s. We have access to professional equipment, including 3D virtual reality cameras that will put the viewers in the middle of the riots, prayer ceremonies, and lives of the people and crew in North Dakota. We cannot let the greed of Big Oil destroy Our Earth, Our home any longer!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeaceful Tribal ceremonies have been violently interrupted. People are being assaulted in their sleep. Police are firing rubber bullets, bean bags, using riot dogs, and mace against defenseless people. This for us all, but we cannot let this story be bulldozed over in the night.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany arrests have been made, including at least 7 journalists. They have had their cameras taken (some returned, some not) and memory cards stolen or wiped - a direct violation of the freedom of press. Police are limiting access to Standing Rock. They are preventing aide and blocking new protestors from entering. Police, the NOPD Oil Company, and its affiliates are blocking media content and filtering what is released through the local wifi. The NOPD is pushing to continue construction ASAP. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePLEASE take interest in this issue. Follow us on this life changing journey. Watch what is going on in North Dakota, and meet the people this pipeline will affect. ANY HELP IS GREATLY APPRECIATED!! This project means the world to me and my crew. IF YOU HEAR THE CALL DO NOT HESITATE. TAKE PART.\u003cbr\u003eTHIS IS REALITY. THIS IS HAPPENING NOW. WE CANNOT CRY FOR THE LOSS OF HUMANITY WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING THIS REALITY.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI STAND FOR STANDING ROCK. I STAND FOR THE SIOUX PEOPLE.I STAND FOR WATER. WILL \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e STAND WITH ME?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StandUpforStandingRockNow/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/StandUpforStandingRockNow/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
