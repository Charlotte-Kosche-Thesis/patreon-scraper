I will be sharing tutorials on how I make the animations, modelling and music as I go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*** PLEASE NOTE. I do not charge for the daily update videos (Often Tutorials), just the music and animations.I\u0027ll look to average one paid post per month. ***\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour help will allow me to put more detail into each episode, turning it from Sound and Rendered images into part animation up to full frame Animation. As a Patreon your funding is paying the bills meaning I get more time on the project per episode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be sharing what is involved in making each episode, with personalized thank you messages for the part that you sponsored. Sponsors also get a credit on the final work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether we\u0027ll be involved in an emotional journey with many wonderful sights and sounds never seen before.
