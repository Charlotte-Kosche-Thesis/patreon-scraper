    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m Jason Schindler. I\u2019m writing in a variety of formats, genres, and realities. I tend to write more science fantasy, enjoy dark faerytales, eldritch wonders and phantasmagore, but non-fiction and science writing are well within my scope. Ultimately, I\u2019m working towards transformative stories, and going to the dark places is the best way I know how to discover and feature this lightness in being.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur stories, like our world, are a beautiful mess, and I\u2019m working towards getting them both in a better place.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpeaking to the hearth?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHumans are storied creatures. We need stories to understand the world, be it mythic or scientific, humorous or tragic. I\u0027ve been writing somewhere between those lines, creating weird and delightful, sometimes shadowy, ergodic and jackdaw fictions about our changing world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHearthspeaking gets us back to that time when we decided to make a home of the campfire, build up the walls to keep us warm and keep out the dark, and decided to separate ourselves from the outside. Hearthspeaking quiets us down to hear the fire and the earth we inhabit, listen to the snow and the trees, make friends with the snails and the bugs and the owls overhead, and teach us how to reconnect with that world we separated ourselves from. It\u2019s a gathering of community around a common space, the space of what warms and moves us, and teaches us to speak the truth to each other in kindness and gravitas. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMany roads traveled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve worked in chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry for awhile and have been convinced of finding a different way in the world, for myself primarily, but that lends itself to understand how our society could use improvement. This yearning led me to a pilgrimage to Japan, Thailand and India and further into Dharma and Druidry. There, I found deeper understandings of ecology and permaculture, environmental ethics, and the economies that are over extracting resources from the earth and leading us into a combative and consumerist culture. As I understand how to live in the world better, I deepen my practice in Aikido, Buddhism and Druidry, and strive to express them in written forms and stories to get at the complexity of human life and consciousness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, you\u2019re a writer then?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, and that\u2019s why I\u2019d like your help. Writing is tricky to get paid at, and while I\u2019m trying to get my craft and writer platform up, honed and more widely known, I could use your support. Consider this my tip hat. If you like what you read, consider sharing a link or giving something.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI received a writing minor in my college days, have been writing at Nanowrimo since 2006, and am a prospective student for graduate studies at Oregon State University\u2019s Environmental Arts and Humanities program. I\u2019ve been published in small literary arts magazines and have a fair amount of desktop publishing experience to get myself self-published here and in the future.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want you to know what you\u2019re getting yourself into, so as followers or subscribers, I\u2019ll be distributing some materials for free, some as patron only posts, and further offerings depending on your support.\u00a0As I refine this space and my schedule, I plan to make weekly blog updates, share flash stories and curious things on this blog, and give monthly supported offerings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs with all Patreon subscriptions, you are only ever charged if I produce work. Most stories or chapters will be around the 3-5k length, and I intend them to be fairly honed, peer reviewed pieces that I\u2019m proud of before I share them with you. Some will be longer, some a little shorter, depending on the story and what they\u2019re a part of. I\u2019d like to move-up to twice monthly offerings eventually, weekly if things go really well, but first thing\u2019s first.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few of the stories you might hear more about:\u00a0\u003cblockquote\u003e\u2022 The Epharmonium Project \u2013 my current major novel project of what happens when the ancient progenitors of the world decide to reach out through your nightmares. A short story that inspired this project will be offered very soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Have a drink with Metabaron Munchausen! \u2013 a sci-fi take on a classic tale; short story finished, longer forms pending.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 The Nightmare Warrior \u2013 a Doctor Who fan fiction, possibly a novella or longer; how much space and time must one traverse to have compassion for the Old Ones?\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 I know some old orcs at a bar with impressively human problems\u2014and revolutionary dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 What happens when you find a portal to candyland and have a snack?\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 In the land of Japanese faerys, what ghosts do we stumble upon when we\u2019re looking for others?\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 What do chinpira punks really get up to when they\u2019re not sucking up to yakuza: hint\u2014there are lots of crows in Tokyo.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 There\u2019s a miller down the lane that mills something else than grain; his muffins are to die for.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy gratitude, always.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much and for even reading this far. I appreciate any support you may be willing to give, morale or monetary. I hope to inspire, and your contribution and collaboration inspires me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
