Can a podcast change everything that is rotten about Canada: our society, our economy and our politics? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe think it can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSandy does the web design and Nora does the sound editing. We pay for hosting and server costs and we hope to dedicate more time to be able to bring you more episodes. Ideally, we\u0027ll be able to record enough to surpass our current hosting package, and need to purchase an even larger one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re able to financially support us, we really, really appreciate it. If you can rate the show, recommend us or post about a favourite episode, we would really, really appreciate it. And, if you have any questions about the technical side of the podcast, feel free to be in touch with Nora directly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay in touch and let us know if there\u0027s something happening in the world that you\u0027d like to hear us dive into."
