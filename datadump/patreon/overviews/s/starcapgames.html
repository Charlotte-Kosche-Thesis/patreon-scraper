    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Starcap Games?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eStarcap Games is an independent games studio out of Somerville MA, founded and run by Patrick Roughan. We believe that games have an amazing power to bring people together through shared experiences, especially when players are sitting and having fun in the same room. Our focus is on creating tabletop games that have a large degree of player interaction and can be enjoyed by larger groups of players, both casual and experienced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.starcapgames.com/\"\u003eSee All of our Games on the Starcap Games Website!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e|  \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/starcapgames/\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e |  \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/starcapgames\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e |  \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/starcapgames/\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e |\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Does This Work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur main focus currently is on Print and Plays. These games are made to be printed out, cut, and played, right from your printer to your hands. Some games may require additional common game items, like dice or game pieces, which will be noted on the game\u0027s instruction page. Each time a Print and Play comes out, a free Ink-Lite version will be released for everyone, and Patreon backers will get access to the Full-Art version of the game.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf one of our Print and Play games gets enough attention, we\u0027ll run a Kickstarter in order to make it one of our Commercial Releases. Remember to message or tag us with comments, photos, and more so we know which games are getting lots of love!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, we sometimes make games that require no printing and instead use things you would have around the house, like playing cards or dice, which we call Rulesets. A release of a Ruleset will not charge our backers; think of them like a fun bonus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for Everything\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eStarcap Games wouldn\u0027t exist if not for our fans and players. Thank you all for supporting us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
