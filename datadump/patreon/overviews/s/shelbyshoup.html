A lot, I know. I have many interests but the passion that connects them all is story telling. Whether it be creative or critical, written-word or moving images, I hope my ability to share stories will inspire you. I am passionate about telling the truth and about telling stories that help engage and motivate people.

Founded by Retired Investigative Reporter, Bill Proctor, the organization has successfully helped several families who have been affected by wrongful\u00a0convictions. Being able to shadow Bill, both in his Private Investigation Firm and in Seeking Justice, has taught me a great deal about investigating, reporting, and the justice system overall. As of right now, Seeking Justice is only provides outreach and resources. Bill is stepping away from the leadership role and has offered the business to me. I have decided to turn this into a for profit business and offer a subscription-box service to those who are interested in helping individual families and in activism for wrongful convictions and a justice reform.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShort Term Goals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI plan to order merchandise to kick-start this subscription box service.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI plan on completing my Private Investigation Certification.
