We perform completely improvised and unscripted comedy shows inspired by the words of Jane Austen. We create Austen themed rap videos, with one success gone viral and a number in development. \u0027Dear Mr Darcy\u0027 our tongue in cheek musical ode to Colin Firth in a wet, white shirt, has 650k views on Facebook, 17k views on YouTube and has appeared in six international film festivals and brought us followers and fans from all over the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We Want to Be:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe want to make half a dozen more rap videos, produce a live sketch/variety show, film the sketches, create a podcast re-imagining famous action films through a Jane Austen lens, print t-shirts and well, whatever Jane Austen themed bits of silliness inspire us. Patreon supporters will take part in the silliness, inspire the creative process, and be the first ones to receive a t-shirt in the mail, a sneak peak at the videos and behind the scenes footage. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Did This Happen:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSense \u0026amp; Spontaneity started by \naccident. Improvisers Jessica Messenger and Esther Longhurst were \nlooking for ways to clown together, and while entertaining their many \nsmall children they began doing Jane Austen impersonations with toy \ndinosaurs. Four years, fourteen sold out seasons, three regional and one\n interstate tour and a viral video later it seems our ridiculous, \naffectionate and incredibly silly obsession with a long dead regency era\n authoress has taken on a life of its own. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Are We: \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEsther Longhurst is an improviser, voice over artist, writer, director and occasional lion. She feeds her children by being silly on stage, screen and radio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJessica Messenger is a playwright, performer and director who is almost as obsessed with improvisation and the persuasive power of rap, as she is by reading all of Jane Austen\u0027s books. She only has one child but hers is the hungriest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmanda Ash is a drama teacher, stage manager, improviser and technology wizard. She narrates our live shows, builds and delivers our sets and makes sure every one is on time. She has the most children and her job is the most like hard work. \u003cbr\u003e"
