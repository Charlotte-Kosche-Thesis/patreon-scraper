    "summary": "My name is Lydia. I am 22 years old and I live in the foothills of California. I have always been a writer of different sorts. I have worn and shed many different layers and meanings of the word \"writer.\" I have been a poet, a short-story creator, a high school newspaper editor, a small-town reporter, a blogger, an essay-writer, amongst other titles.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am here because I want to challenge myself to continue writing. I want to share my stories and encourage people to pursue their emotions and feel deeper. Here, I want to wrap you up in descriptive words and blanket you in life experiences. I want my stories to feel like a hot cup of morning coffee, and remind you of fond childhood nostalgia.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA little more about me...\u003cbr\u003eI like to call myself introverted, not shy. Kind, not weak.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy husband and I just celebrated one year of marriage. We share a roof with my parents and three cats which is located in the same small town we grew up in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis is the space where I encourage you to accept and to welcome your feelings. I like to write about experiences I\u0027ve had or about feelings. \u003cbr\u003eAside from that, my goal here is to establish a following of people who enjoy my work and are willing to stick by my side. I don\u0027t want fans. Rather, I want to establish a community of people who want to encourage and support one another in their dreams. Together.\u003cbr\u003eIf you like anything you read here, please come back and give me a chance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePlease feel free to reach out to me for any reason, and thanks for stopping by \u0026lt;3"
