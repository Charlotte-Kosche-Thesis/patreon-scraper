I don\u0027t want to annoy my supporters with constant reminders. I just want to thank you for your support from the bottom of my heart. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you pledge to support me, I will add your name to my Patreon mailing list and I will send out a monthly newsletter with links to my files early in the month. The newsletter may also contain additional benefits such as coupon codes to give you additional $$$ off on my group buys for vinyl and other crafting products.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you pledge $100 per month, I will include your logo in the bottom right corner of one of my videos. Note that you must be a supporter in good standing (pledges are paid). If your payment is declined, the logo will be removed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also share additional files, tips, cheat sheets and more throughout the month to my supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support lets me continue producing tutorials and project videos on a full-time basis.
