    "summary": "In this next year (2015-2016), I plan to work on an AUDIO BOOK of comedic thoughts, behind the scene stories of the music industry (with music examples!) and not so general life experiences. You\u0027ll be able to HEAR me in your HEAD (especially if you wear headphones!) I plan to create two physical books: \"We Are Each Other\u0027s Angels\", which will include the song of the same name (thanks to Chuck Brodsky\u0027s permission and he will, of course, be receiving profits). I want to create a gift sized book with beautiful photography and graphics called \"Hat\u0027s What I\u0027m Talking About\". This will include interviews and photos of fascinating women and their special, memorable hats. My friend, Colin Boyd, and I would like to make a recording of just the two of us playing guitar and singing our original songs. And, of course, I\u0027m ready to start creating a ONE WOMAN SHOW. This is just some of what is IN MY HEAD and ready to EXPLODE OUT INTO the realm of YOUR WORLD!!! I love you. Let\u0027s make music and art---ready, set, GO!"

The stories have been completely riveting, so I realized: time to share them with the world! My goal: photograph 20-30 of these glorious women with their hats.
