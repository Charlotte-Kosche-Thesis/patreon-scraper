    "summary": "First and foremost, thank you for even coming to looking at my Patreon and considering supporting me. \u00a0It means a lot to me that people enjoy the art I create enough to potentially spend money on it. \u00a0It\u0027s honestly more than I ever expected.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHaving said that, it\u0027s kind of delightful to be at that stage where I think it\u0027s time for me to be less small-time and work my way into being maybe medium-time. \u00a0I got big plans, relatively speaking, for myself and for what I want to do going forward, and most of it takes some upfront money. \u00a0Now, I\u0027m doing fine as far as getting bills paid and getting food on the table, more than fine even. \u00a0So, this isn\u0027t a campaign to make sure I survive. \u00a0This is purely for business and to support my publishing and con-going endeavours. \u00a0These things will happen, but I think with the help of this Patreon, they could happen much faster and with greater frequency. \u00a0If that\u0027s something you\u0027d like to see, then consider supporting me!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo what do I want to do with my funds? \u00a0Namely I want to publish the novels I write. \u00a0Self publishing is pretty viable these days and I really think for the amount of illustrations I want to put in, it\u0027s probably the best route for me. \u00a0What\u0027s super nice is that there are lots of formats that I can release things on and easy options to make some chapter mini books and things like that. \u00a0Those won\u0027t cost me as much but that\u0027s still cash money every time I want to make something for you guys. \u00a0And when I want to move on to more traditional publishing options for annual sketchbooks, story arc collections and maybe even a big collaborative art book, funds might get a little tight. \u00a0That is what this Patreon is all about, collecting funds so I can make things for you to enjoy.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, not everyone is going to have money to spare and maybe this doesn\u0027t sound worth your hard earned money, and that\u0027s okay! \u00a0My promise to you is that these things will happen, even if it means I have to keep doing cash commissions to scrounge up the print costs myself. \u00a0But if you want these things and want them sooner than later, here\u0027s how you can help! \u00a0Take a look at the support tiers and hopefully there\u0027s an option that gets you what you want from me at a fair dollar amount. \u00a0Thanks for reading, you guys are the best!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCheers,\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDani\n\u003cbr\u003e"

When not melting, she does a little client work, draws fanart for her friends and illustrates and writes novels.  Self-taught, Dani learned to draw by copying pokemon cards in middle school, like all the greats, and struggled choosing between majoring in art and biology.  As she\u2019s clearly not a doctor, biology didn\u2019t work out but neither did art.  Trained in interpersonal and intercultural communication, she enjoyed her college career, even if she doesn\u2019t directly utilize it.  She and her boyfriend have a mighty need for a dog, and enjoy cooking at home and co-op video games.\u003cbr\u003e",
