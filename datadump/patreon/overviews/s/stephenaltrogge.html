I created the video course\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.goodnewsofgreatjoy.com\"\u003eGood News of Great Joy\u003c/a\u003e. And I\u0027ve written bunches of books.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been doing the Internet / blog thing for a while now. Ten years actually. These days, around half-a-million people visit the site every year to access the resources we\u0027ve created.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my big challenges is finding time to work on these things. I work full time and these gospel-centered materials only get whatever is left over. I would absolutely be delighted to be able to spend more time creating free resources for you. I\u0027m thinking of gospel-centered books, podcasts, videos, courses, and more. I want to be able to provide as much for free as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess it\u0027s because I love getting to create God-honoring things that other people enjoy. I love being able to write something or publish that something that helps people love God. It is one of the most rewarding things I do. AND...the things I\u0027ve created have been published in many different outlets and even different languages. God has allowed my impact to be expanded.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would really like to increase the amount I can do with the resources I\u0027ve got. I want to record more videos. I want to blog more consistently. I want to create FREE devotionals and podcasts and courses.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut here\u0027s the thing. The more stuff I create, the more it costs. I\u0027ve got to pay for the website, the podcast hosting, the recording software. And the\u00a0time I spend on these projects takes time away from my regular job. This makes it tough, as you can imagine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWould you consider becoming a supporter of the site? Basically, it means you donate a little bit of money per month, and we can cover some of the costs. It would also allow me to do more free things for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you say? We would be really, really grateful..."
