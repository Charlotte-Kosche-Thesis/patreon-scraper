    "summary": "Welcome, and thank\nyou so much for being a part of this new journey! Your presence and support are\nthe essence and foundation of this new chapter in Sparkle Poetics. Now,\n\"What is Patreon?\" you might ask. Patreon is a unique website that\nallows artists like me to receive direct funding for their creations. It is\nimportant to note that by becoming my patron, you are providing\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003erecurring\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003efunding\nfor me as a creator.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou\nwill have first access to everything that goes on behind-the-scenes over here.\nEach time a new poem or creation falls from my fingertips, you will be the\nfirst to know. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat\nexactly is Sparkle Poetics? By textbook definition, to sparkle means \"to\nshine or glisten with little gleams of light, as a brilliant gem - a play of\nlight...\" But this is merely scratching the surface. I\u2019m learning that\nthis can mean to transform. To sparkle is to leave another a\nlittle lighter and brighter than before. In return for your sparkling patronage,\nI will be sending you at least one, new poetry video per month and several\nother lily pads of art along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am also overjoyed to create and publish my first book! Hundreds of pages of\npoetry and prose are waiting to become a physical reality. In the interim, I\nwill be designing the first prototype of this novel in the format of an e-book\nwhich will be available you at no cost! Hell yeah! Additionally, your support goes in to the creation of new art. You can take a look at the visual creations coming to life on my Etsy store\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.etsy.com/shop/sparklepoetics\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I first felt my dream calling me, it was like\nstanding on the shores of the ocean for the first time. The tides were lapping\nat my feet, pushing me and pulling me deeper into the center of something\ngreater than anything I could imagine. My concept of our appearance in this\nuniverse expanded in immeasurable ways, and I was left to process just how vast\nhuman potential can be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNo one builds a dream alone. Thank you for your time, attention\nand presence in the universe. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
