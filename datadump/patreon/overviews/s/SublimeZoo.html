And frankly? We\u0027d like to get paid for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e- This is something we would love to do full-time. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe joke all the time (on both our blog and podcast) about us having 8928320948309840293890 day jobs and side hustles, but there is an inordinate amount of truth to those jokes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love what we do, but currently what we do does not pay the bills.

That\u0027s not entirely true. We had some semblance of what we *might* be getting into, but actually jumping into it was another thing entirely. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo much blood, sweat, tears, time, and $$$ goes into making a podcast. And since we want our podcast to be the very best that none ever was (heyoooooooo), we\u0027re gonna have to come correct and come with more than 3 dollars to our name (okay, we have more than that but you get us).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eStill have more questions?\u003c/h3\u003eYou can email us at sublimepak3@gmail.com or contact us individually at lexluther@sublimezoo.com or ajparker@sublimezoo.com.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
