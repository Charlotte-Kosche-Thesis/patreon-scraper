    "summary": "To all my rebels, rule breakers, game changers, innovators and disrupters of society. I love you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo really. You are my faves.\u00a0I see you as the MLK\u0027s the Maya Angelous, the inspiration, the hearts and souls of change for the better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI founded a movement called AWAKEN THE REBEL \u0026amp; I\u0027ve decided to use Patreon to move that mission forward. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started this journey (of rebelling into the direction of my life purpose) as a stand up comedian, then moved into being a life coach \u0026amp; entrepreneur, but ultimately I don\u0027t want to define myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a creator. I am a messenger. A connector. This movement has wings of its own and cannot be boxed in by labels, rules, or structures.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s the deal...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want this message to be perverted by the need to make money. I don\u0027t want it to get bought. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut in order to keep it pure, I need your help. That\u0027s just the truth. In order to create my live events, produce rebel content, or do ANY of these things it takes to move this mission forward it takes time and it costs money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I am asking for support, for community, for allies, for rebels, for activists, for bad asses to come together and stand by me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\u00a0commitment to you is that I will always keep it real. Keep it raw. Say what others won\u0027t say. That this movement will have your back. Protect you when you are bullied. Support you when you feel alone, and have you in mind every step of the way. That is who I am. And that\u0027s what this movement is about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo facades, just realtalk. REAL connection.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to sell you anything. I don\u0027t want to convince you that you need something that I have to get to your next level. I just want to stand by your side and cheer you on, light your path, and have your back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe our enemy is oppression in all forms which is why a percentage of the proceeds from this project will go to the International Justice Mission (IJM).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a non profit organization that not only saves people from slavery and human sex trafficking, but they go in and change the laws of these countries so that these atrocities against members of our human race cannot be committed again...and if they do, they will not go unpunished.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the mission that makes my soul sing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrimarily in the past I have focused my work on life purpose, career fulfillment and entrepreneurship. My interest is to continue to support this rebel community in these ways, but ultimately I want to help us to all live the life of freedom we have always desired and dreamed of. We will collectively buck oppression wherever it shows up in our lives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes we are oppressed by a boss, sometimes by a toxic relationship, and sometimes by ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI say HELL NO to that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to freedom, I got your back. When it comes to empowerment, I got your back. When it comes to emotional health, I got your back. I got you. That is my promise to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYet I cannot do this without you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI remember what life was like for me before I went to my first seminar and gave myself permission to look within and realize the truth of me. It was sad, lonely, jaded, and hard. I didn\u0027t believe relationships could last. I didn\u0027t believe it was safe to love freely. I was always protecting myself from pain. And one thing I have learned is that when you close yourself off from pain, you also close yourself off from joy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was numb. I was only a friggin\u0027 20 something and I was numb. So many people of all ages are walking the planet like that and they don\u0027t deserve to be or feel oppressed when all that they need to set themselves free is within them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see myself not as an expert, but as a facilitator or a catalyst for progress, growth \u0026amp; freedom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo you can see why I need your support. It\u0027s not enough for me to be free, I want to sing this message from the rooftops and support others in having their own awakenings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo help me baby. But feel no obligation, let this be support you give from your heart, from your soul, from your spirit because you believe that \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\" MLK\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe you are the expert in your life. That you know what is right for you. I believe that you have a juicy little rebel inside of you that is wise beyond measure and that rebel sometimes just needs some support in coming out to play.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to invite you to come out and play. To live. To breathe. To love. To create. And to run wild and free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI promise to do right by you. To support you. To be your ally. Your rebel friend. Your fire starter. I will honor your contribution and your involvement in this movement. I will listen to what it is that you want to get out of it all. I am a very good listener :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are very important to me as you are the fuel that lights the fire of this movement. You are the air that keeps that fire burning. Without you I cannot do this, and I see Patreon as the perfect community based fireburning platform to ignite us together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf it calls to you, please become a patron and let\u0027s get this party started ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShereen\u003cbr\u003e"

In order to seem \u201cnormal\u201d and keep everyone else happy she decided that she would forsake all her own desires to fulfill other people\u2019s expectations. So she got a degree, landed a job, and found herself utterly miserable at the age of twenty-four.\u003c/p\u003eLuckily one of her best friends suggested she go to a seminar where she was able to \u201c\u003cem\u003eAwaken her Inner Rebel\u003c/em\u003e,\u201d and truly examine this life she had created. She decided to immediately quit her master\u2019s degree program and start doing stand-up comedy. This was the official beginning of her writing her own \u003ca href=\"http://awakentherebel.com/free/\"\u003eRebel Rule Book\u003c/a\u003e, and living life by her design.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe excelled in the world of stand up, and was scouted by MTV while performing at the Hollywood Improv. She was brought in to audition regularly for E!, MTV, and VH1. The truth of the matter was that as Shereen began to write her own rules, she realized that comedy was not the end all, be all for her. Instead of making people laugh, or talking about the latest celebrity mishap she felt most fulfilled when she was inspiring others to stop settling for less and live their own rebellious extraordinary life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis was the beginning of the Awaken The Rebel movement. Shereen decided to continue to make people laugh while helping them to stop settling for less and awaken their inner rebellious spirit so that they can live an extraordinary life by their design. Shereen is certified in Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP), and is a Certified Professional Coach (CPC, ELI-MP) by the Institute of Professional Excellence in Coaching (IPEC an ICF accredited school).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe hosted of The Shereen Show show on CSAT.TV, where she is featured as a life purpose expert and talk show host that helps people stop settling for less and live an extraordinary life. She has also been a host on the Oprah Winfrey Recap show onAfterbuzz TV, a network founded by Maria Menounos.\u003c/p\u003eShe is the creator of a live event series entitled Awaken The Rebel Live, where rebels from all walks of life come together in Los Angeles, California to write their own rules together and live an extraordinary life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe lives in Santa Monica with her hot husband Kenny, her baby girl Maya, and her awesome dog Rambo. Her life is full of beautiful rebellion, and she hopes to help all those who encounter her to join the movement and have the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShereen believes we are all rebels and thought leaders in our own right, and that we are all just waiting for our own opportunity to Awaken The Rebel.\u003cbr\u003e",
