    "summary": "First and foremost - THANK YOU - from the bottom of my little black \nheart. Your patronage directly supports the arts. Your support \nallows me to continue creating highly \nentertaining, provocative performance art for many to enjoy, as well as \nproductions, events and classes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mission as a burlesque \nartist is to create work that entertains, empowers, and challenges \naudiences to explore new ideas, imagery, and concepts. When I take the \nstage I\u0027m celebrating my body, femininity, and art; raising a lovely, \ntattooed middle\n finger in naked, sparkly glory to a society that that \ntells women to dress, move, behave, work, love and live within archaic, \nsexist propriety. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I teach my approach holds a similar \nmission. Creating space and giving permission to explore sensual movement and \nconfident energy; while on a much deeper level beginning a journey of \ndismantling the toxic and oppressive messages of body-shame, beauty standards, sexism, and so on. My goals are to grow and expand as an instructor through \nRevolver \nStudios and travel. I aim to build my following and community sharing my passion for personal growth and healing through movement along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a producer I wish to\n offer \nunique, engaging, and professional entertainment in the form of burlesque, sideshow, circus, vaudeville, dance, etc. Success for me as a producer is creating an opportunity to put a pause on day-to-day life for the audience to live, play, laugh and\n enjoy the presence of ourselves and others. I founded and produced Carnivale Revolver for five years - the premier burlesque revue in St. Cloud, MN. I have also produced a number of other burlesque/variety shows over the past five years in addition to New Year\u0027s Eve speakeasy Divine Decadence and Silent Cinema Brunch - all of which have brought me great happiness and fulfillment. Thank you to each and every person who has supported any of these productions, it wouldn\u0027t happen without you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease like and follow Revolver Productions, Revolver Studios MN, and Scarlette Revolver on FB and IG. @revolver_productions @revolverstudiosmn @scarlette_revolver\u003cbr\u003e"
