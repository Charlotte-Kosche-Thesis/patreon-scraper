    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy Name is Sam Covina Storey and I am a singer and\nsongwriter of original Blues, Country and Contemporary Christian music. I have\nbeen playing the guitar since I was 12. In 1966, I met the love of my life; we\nmarried and were graced with a son. I made the decision to put family before a\nmusic career and worked construction for nearly my whole life. With often\nbruised and splintered hands, I continued to write songs and play my guitar. My\nmusic became a means of escape and enjoyment instead of fame or money. I would\nnot change it for the world, although it does mean that I have a lifetime of\nwork that I have not been able to share with you, until now.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow at the age of 70 I\u2019ve finally hung up the tool\nbelt.  However, making a living as a\nmusician is not an easy road to travel. I now finally have the time but need\nyour participation to get the music out of my studio and into the heart and\nsoul of the world. As in the days of old (yes even older than me), artists,\nmusicians and other great talents received support from patrons in order to\nensure the time and space needed to produce their art. Patreon is the modern\nplatform that allows you, the fans, to contribute to creators such as myself\nthrough monthly financial pledges. In exchange you, the patron, get some really\ngreat rewards. As a patron you will be joining me in a journey from creating\nnew songs, refreshing old ones, recording, filming and finally sharing the\nmusic. \u003cbr\u003e"
