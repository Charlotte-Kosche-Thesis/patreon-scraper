The format really fits me nicely. No reality show artificial drama, no forced endorsements, no absurdly short deadlines to make for \u0027interesting TV\u0027. \u00a0Just a guy who enjoys the heck out of cars and wants to share that enthusiasm with others. \u00a0I\u0027ve always built cars, and always will, now I\u0027m going to share all of it with you."
