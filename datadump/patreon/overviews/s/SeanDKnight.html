My passion for writing has been the one constant thing in my life, no matter how difficult life has become. However, passion is all well and good but if I can\u0027t finish something, then I feel that I have wasted that passion. So I want to take the steps necessary to finally finish and publish one of the books I\u0027ve been working on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, the writing part is all up to me but therein lies a major problem. I\u0027ve never been satisfied with my work or confident enough to share it. Yes, I\u0027ve written plenty of news articles and some\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://hothardware.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-gameplay-and-performance-review-is-the-pc-version-the-definitive-one\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evideo game reviews\u003c/a\u003e. But news articles were always easy to write because I was just reporting the news without injecting my opinion. Whereas\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://hothardware.com/reviews/evolve-review-a-humans-versus-monsters-hunt\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evideo game reviews\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://press2reset.com/2012/04/16/editorial-boycotting-diablo-iii-a-threat-to-gaming/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eeditorials\u003c/a\u003e were my opinion and I always felt trepidation whenever I hit the submit button. I have shared some\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://seandknightblog.wordpress.com/2017/08/25/harry-potter-and-the-courtship-of-ginny-weasley-chapter-1/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efan fiction\u003c/a\u003e before, but my real work writing fantasy and science fiction I have kept close to the chest. So I\u0027m trying to push myself to change all that by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/seandknight\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003estreaming the writing process\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, engaging people about what I\u0027m writing, and talking about it all to overcome these issues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon-supporters will get to help flesh out story ideas and characters, offer names for characters and places, and even get to look at my work via Google Docs where you will be able to leave suggestions, offer criticisms, or even correct my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you can\u0027t support me in a monetary fashion, you can help by just sharing this with your friends and family.
