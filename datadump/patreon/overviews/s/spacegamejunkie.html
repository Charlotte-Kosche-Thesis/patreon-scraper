    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eWhat is this?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHello, and welcome to my Patreon campaign for my beloved computer space game-centric blog,\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"http://www.spacegamejunkie.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSpace Game Junkie\u003c/a\u003e! Space Game Junkie is a love letter to the space game genre, a haven for developers and fans to come together and share their love of spaceships, space stations, even space suits. I\u0027ve been running Space Game Junkie for a little over three years now, and while it\u0027s doing well, I know it can do better, and that comes down pretty much to me. I put a lot of time and soul into Space Game Junkie, and while I\u0027m proud of the work I\u0027ve done, I know I can do more. What I don\u0027t want is to litter the site with ugly advertisements and the like, which is one of the primary reasons I created this campaign. What I would love is for eventually my income from this monthly campaign and other avenues to simply cover the cost of hosting the blog and such. Money is a great motivator as well, and it will help give me confidence to see that I\u0027m supported by people who love space games as much as I do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWho are you?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOh, me? Thanks for asking! My name is Brian Rubin, and I\u0027ve been playing video games since the mid 1970s, starting with one of the original home Pong machines. Remember those? Eventually I got an Atari and a TRS-80, and had a wonderful time playing games like \u003cem\u003eLunar Lander\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eYar\u0027s Revenge\u003c/em\u003e and so many more. The game that really got to me, however, was \u003cem\u003eStarflight\u003c/em\u003e in 1996, which happened to be my first DOS-based game on an old Tandy 1000 EX. Ever since then I\u0027ve been in love with games that involve space in some way, whether you fly a spaceship or build a space station. I created Space Game Junkie back in 2011 after being inspired by the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCRPG Addict\u003c/a\u003e, whose goal is to play through every computer role playing game in chronological order. I began the site as a way to play through all the early space games I missed on other platforms, not knowing we were about to be part of a massive space game resurgence. Now the site has morphed into something completely different, and better, than what I originally intended.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is Space Game Junkie?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy passion. My love letter to the space game genre. A community of like-minded space game fans, and so much more. Space Game Junkie began life as a simple blog, but now it\u0027s morphed into a fairly popular YouTube channel, a Twitch channel and a weekly podcast wherein we\u0027ve had dozens of game developers and fans on to discuss the wonders of space gaming. The site basically covers space-focused gaming made for home computing platforms, from the original \u003cem\u003eSpaceWar!\u003c/em\u003e to \u003cem\u003eElite: Dangerous \u003c/em\u003eand beyond. The site doesn\u0027t cover mobile or console games because I\u0027m not as familiar with them, nor do I have the brain space. With that said, there\u0027s a long, long list of games to be covered, and I hope to not only help engage with fans about the classics they love, but help fans find new space games to fall in love with as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat will you be creating?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI try to make my site as fun and engaging as possible, and to that end Space Game Junkie offers the following: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* \u003cstrong\u003eGame-Focused Videos\u003c/strong\u003e - I\u0027ll be creating \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/spacegamejunkie\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003egame-focused video content\u003c/a\u003e that covers reviews of new and classic games, previews of upcoming games, games centered around a specific theme, and so much more. These videos will be uploaded to YouTube and be free for everyone, and free of advertising as well should this campaign be successful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* \u003cstrong\u003eThe Space Game Junkie Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e - My cohost Jim Hunt and I sit down every week to discuss space gaming, whether it\u0027s games surrounding a specific theme, the latest news, or talking to a developer about their game. As I write this, \u003ca href=\"http://www.spacegamejunkie.com/category/podcasts/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe podcast\u003c/a\u003e is nearing 100 episodes, and we\u0027re nowhere near running out of things to talk about or people to talk to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\t * \u003cstrong\u003eRegular Streaming Events\u003c/strong\u003e - Recently -- thanks to their release on GOG -- I began a weekly night of \u003cem\u003eStar Wars: X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter\u003c/em\u003e (and likely \u003cem\u003eAlliance\u003c/em\u003e as well) that will focus on friends and me having melee matches, going through campaign missions and so much more. I intend to expand this to other regular events, such as tournaments, weekly segments and more, which will all be available on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/spacegamejunkie\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e. Thursday night events can either be chosen by fans, or focus on a developer coming to play a game with us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* \u003cstrong\u003eOther Types of Content\u003c/strong\u003e - I also plan to do regular opinion pieces, textual Q\u0026amp;As with game developers (sometimes folks don\u0027t want to do a podcast, which is totally understandable), specific Games of the Week and more! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* \u003cstrong\u003eWho Knows What Else?\u003c/strong\u003e - I am always trying to come up with new ideas, or maybe you have a suggestion for something to try? I\u0027m always trying to expand the site\u0027s content to make it more fun and engaging. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* \u003cstrong\u003eUltimately, a Community\u003c/strong\u003e - Between story and video comments, an active\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/dEfyMtP\"\u003e Discord\u003c/a\u003e server, a lively\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/spacegamejunkie/\"\u003eFacebook Group\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/groups/spacegamejunkie/discussions\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e forums\u003c/a\u003e and events, I want to foster a community of space game fans who come together for the common love of the spaceship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhere Do I Come in?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not a fan of banner ads and the like, never have been. I\u0027ve tried them here and there but I dunno, they make me feel a little dirty. By supporting this Patreon campaign, you\u0027ll not only help keep the site and its various other entities ad-free (to as much as I can control of course), but you\u0027ll also help motivate me. Let\u0027s be honest, money is a terrific motivator, and while I would love to eventually work on this site full-time, even eking out a meager second income from avenues such as Pateron would be a tremendous help to my motivation and my confidence as a blogger. Therefore, by supporting this Patreon campaign, you\u0027re supporting not only my work in covering space games from developers large and small, but supporting a growing community of fans and developers coming together to share their love of space games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat Can I Expect as a Patron?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHonesty. Passion. Love. Respect. The same things that you\u0027d get if you weren\u0027t a Patron. Let me be clear that this campaign is purely optional, and my content won\u0027t change whether you support the site or not. It\u0027ll always be honest, passionate and hopefully engaging and enjoyable. As I\u0027ve never used Patreon before, it seems there is a Patron-only feed of some sort, so you\u0027d have access to that for even more community chit-chat. I\u0027m not planning rewards or anything like that, however. If you want to support me, then I encourage you to do so, but if not, hey, that\u0027s fine too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHonesty, Above All Else\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve mentioned honesty a few times, and I want to be clear about something that\u0027s pretty important. No matter where I get a game from, be it a key from a developer or a publisher, I buy it myself, a gift from a friend or heck, an abandonware site, I will judge every game has honestly as I have every other game I\u0027ve covered, no matter the source. This means, for example, if I received a game for free from a publisher and I don\u0027t like it, I\u0027ll say so, clearly and distinctly. While I love this genre and always try to be positive, that won\u0027t stop me from being critical of a game if I feel it\u0027s deserving of such a critique. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat Will Our Funds Be Used For?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of this campaign is multi-fold. First, I would love, LOVE to bring in enough to make the site self-sufficient in terms of covering the costs of hosting and regular backups through VaultPress (which is an AWESOME service, by the way). I would also love to remove ads wherever possible. After that, the funds would be used to buy more games to cover for the site, better equipment and so on. Eventually I would love to have a sustainable income out of this -- enough to do this full time, is my dream -- and Patreon is a part of that plan. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI therefore thank you for visiting my Patreon page, and if you choose to become a Patron, I thank you doubly for that as well. Have a wonderful day."
