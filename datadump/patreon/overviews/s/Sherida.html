For example, one of them is a game that I\u0027m making to raise funds for young underprivileged girls in Vietnam to give them better access to an education and healthcare! I definitely want to do more games for charity in the future and your patronage can help me make them without me having to worry about food and rent \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help I can experiment and research with new interactive storytelling methods to make better and prettier games and share them with you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I working on right now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eAt the moment I\u0027m focussing on 3 different projects, the first is a little game for my Cycle4Girls fundraising campaign that I\u0027ve almost wrapped up. You can read more about it here! The second one is a short game called In My Life about being in love.\u003cbr\u003eThe final project is a research/ experimental project in preparation for my next project (working title Ophidian) where I look for new ways to tell stories in games where your choices shape the story.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always loved videogames but I\u0027ve been in love with the potential of what videogames can be even more. The last few years have been great for the medium in showing new ways of play, interaction and stories as well as new beautiful art styles and I love being part of that movement.\u003cbr\u003eWhat I don\u0027t love however, is how money, or better yet the lack of it, makes it difficult for me to experiment with new little games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking Beyond Eyes cost a lot of money and all the money that it\u0027s currently earning is used to pay off the investments. Meaning that my income is close to non existing at the moment :)\u003cbr\u003eThe games that I enjoy making are quirky, pretty, original and damn hard to sell to publishers or other investors. These people want to know what you\u0027re making, how you\u0027re making it, who your target audience is, how much units you will sell and what changes you\u0027re willing to make to ensure that you will be making more money. This means that you either have to take a much more commercial approach to your work, which doesn\u0027t leave room for experimenting, or you have to find a way to fund your work through self funding or grants.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving a Patreon allows me to cheat a little bit though! I can create and experiment making games without having to constantly worry over bills and money AND it allows me to share some of my work online for FREE \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
