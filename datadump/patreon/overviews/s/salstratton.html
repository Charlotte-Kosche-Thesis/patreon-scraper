This is huge for me, the first step to the rest of my life basically, and I would love to share this journey with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be posting sneak peaks to my story and my writing journal which I have started to write daily. I will also be writing book reviews, so check those out. And I will post fan fiction for the fandoms that I follow and adore, such as The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Gossip Girl, Archer, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Once Upon A Time and others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love, love, love to have your support, so I can pay rent and live my dream of being an author!
