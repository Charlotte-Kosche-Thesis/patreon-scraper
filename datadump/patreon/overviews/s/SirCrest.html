    "summary": "My name is Brett Sanders, but I go by Crest or SirCrest online. Like millions of other people, I make videos. Lots of videos. I make mostly video game videos. But occasionally I do videos on hardware, software, tutorials, game guides, reviews, previews, even some cinematic content on the side.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMaking videos and quality content takes time. I could put that time towards another job or other freelance work. But I want to make youtube videos. However, after your late teens, it becomes more difficult to justify the time and money put into making \"free\" content. And over the last few years I have hit that point. And while I do have income through my video editing, a solid patreon campaign bolstering that, could bring in proper fulltime income from my channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI made videos like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/gTeIuXWl2J4\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/7esJZJcK6kg\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat this has to do with you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, I have a small but strong following on Youtube and subsequently twitter for my specific style of content. But unfortunately a small following, no matter how passionate, can\u0027t support someone via advertising online. This is why I\u0027m reaching out to you, my followers, for extra support that youtube\u0027s infrastructure can\u0027t do for a content creator of my size. And let\u0027s be honest, many people use adblockers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven just a few of you,\u00a0donating a dollar or so per month,\u00a0would have a significant impact into my income. This is similar to a the YouTube Red discussion. Adsense on a per person basis brings in such small amounts of income. Donating a single dollar offsets pretty much a lifetime of a single viewers traffic to my content. Imagine if a few dozen pledged a few dollars. While that might not be all that much, it\u0027s a world of difference compared to pure adsense and youtube income.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow it would work.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou would be pledging any amount you wish per month to support me. Initially I went with on a per video basis, but my style of content is quite varied and I felt it might be unfair to some people supporting me for only some content they like. So I moved to a monthly format. You can support me for whatever reason you wish. It could be my LP\u0027s, it could be my tutorials, cinematics, reviews or previews. Whatever the reason, there is one place to support me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso sometimes some months are lighter in videos but the videos in those months take more time and energy to make.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will happen with the impact of this campaign?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs you might expect, I don\u0027t have any plans to charge for any content. If I did it would be through patreon specific tiers with content I wouldn\u0027t normally make. I wouldn\u0027t want to divert content for the channel to patreon only.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money you pledge in the past might have gone to hardware or upgrades, but the fact is I have small income that I use if I need it. This patreon is to bolster the income I have to bring my monthly income to proper levels to live on my own. So this money will frankly go to things like gas, food, rent, things like that. No doubt about it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHeck, depending how well this goes I might be able to attend some conventions to meetup with people. There is no telling right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I hope you consider if my content has in some way helped you or you enjoyed it. Even a dollar per month would be helpful to me in my work. Thank you for reading.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
