    "summary": "My name is Janis Sweek, and welcome to my Patreon page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform that enables artists to engage with fans, allowing them to help support their favorite creators. Although it appears similar to Kickstarter, it is very different from traditional crowdfunding. Where creators normally raise money in one lump sum for one project, Patreon allows creators the funding to create a stream of smaller works. Since I work a full time job to help support my family, I can\u0027t pursue my joy of writing full time, but Patreon gives me the opportunity to let my stories unfold gradually, with the hopes of sharing them with an active audience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe idea for \u003cem\u003eShroud of Gossamer\u003c/em\u003e began in the early \u002790s, when the internet was in its infancy. I was part of a wonderful group of writers on the Prodigy bulletin boards, and we crafted characters that would intertwine with each other\u0027s stories. Madeline, the protagonist of \u003cem\u003eShroud,\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eis one such character. Over the years, that same group of writers moved on to other forums, and eventually interaction slowed down as we all became busy with life in general. \u00a0It was at that point I began to write exclusive stories about my characters alone, when I had the time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the journey from their origins on Prodigy to the present day, some of my characters have evolved into something more, while others are very much the same. \u003cem\u003eShroud of Gossamer\u003c/em\u003e will introduce them, and the world they live in, to you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also be writing a series of short stories, some connected to the main plot of \u003cem\u003eShroud\u003c/em\u003e, and others delving into the backgrounds of various characters appearing in\u00a0\u003cem\u003eShroud\u003c/em\u003e. Everything is centered around a modern world, darker than our own, where the supernatural and other mysteries are veiled from human eyes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe Leviticus, another character from \u003cem\u003eShroud\u003c/em\u003e, describes the world best:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Think of it this way - most of the world is dead to what\u2019s going on, draped in blindness, like there\u0027s a shroud of gossamer keeping them from seeing what\u0027s really there. Everyday things reinforce that blindness. Take the news for example. Or social media. All the trending stories are just distractions. They keep the public fighting and arguing differences of opinions, and redirect any focus from things that are actually important. And the few people who rip away the gossamer, be it by chance or by choice, realize that to survive they have to support the lies and the distractions. If they don\u0027t... well, you know what happens to people spouting nonsense about monsters and conspiracies...\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I add chapters to the novel, Patrons will be the first to access them, give feedback, and possibly shape the world of \u003cem\u003eShroud\u003c/em\u003e. Eventually, I hope to have an ebook or physical novel once the first book is complete. I will also strive to come up with some great surprises to share with you all as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Where does this money go?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money created from Patreon goes towards further expanding the world of \u003cem\u003eShroud of Gossamer\u003c/em\u003e. It will be going towards artwork and hopefully other little surprises that I plan to share with my Patrons. The support helps keep me motivated and focused on continuing to bring new content to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What if I can\u0027t afford $1 to support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\"\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s okay. There will be a lot of content available for free on my website for everyone to enjoy. If you like what I do and want to help me continue, the best thing you can do is share my website and Patreon page with other people. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Why per chapter/short stories vs per month?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginally I was going to go with \u0027per month\u0027, but I didn\u0027t want the stress of a deadline looming over my head, or to feel pressured to post something just to earn the backing of Patrons. I want to focus on quality, not quantity, which was why I selected \u0027per chapter or short story\u0027. The goal is to officially publish a chapter or short story every other week, with various posts outlining the process. Fear not! You do not have to worry about me creating a bunch of chapters and getting sudden surprise charges. With Patreon, you can set a cap for monthly backing, so if you only want the \u0027per chapter or short story\u0027 to simply be a monthly amount, you can do that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What is the difference between a chapter and short story?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShort stories vary in length, but they aren\u0027t exactly short. For example, the short story \"Two Brothers\", a back story on a couple characters, is currently over 20 pages and 14,000 words long. Chapters will be part of the ongoing \u003cem\u003eShroud of Gossamer\u003c/em\u003e novel. Chapters also vary in length and in the case that I feel a chapter is too short, I\u0027ll also release additional content with it, either an extra chapter or short story. Once all the chapters are complete for the first novel, I\u0027ll be working on the next novel in much the same fashion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

In high school, I completed a 250 page fantasy story based off my tabletop characters, and in college I joined the writing group where most of the \u003cstrong\u003eShroud of Gossamer\u003c/strong\u003e characters were born. Besides creative writing, I also enjoy watching anime, playing video and tabletop games, and listening to Japanese and Korean rock/pop music.",
