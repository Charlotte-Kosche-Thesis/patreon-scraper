    "summary": "Hi! Thank you for visiting Supermuscleman Saves, my personal Fortress. WELCOME! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my unique and personal portal for you to join and help me in my adventures and with my 2018 goals. I am excited sharing them and I hope you can help me, Supermuscleman, in all what Superman means to me and I hope, to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am proud and honored to wear the \u0027S\u0027. I have used the shield to encourage many sick and compromised individuals to continue to achieve their best. Whether you\u0027re 3 to 86, we all need a hero to help us when we are down and need encouragement. That\u0027s where I fly in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI donate my time to do outreach and personal appearances to various children\u0027s / adult hospitals, Elderly Care Homes, and fundraisers with additional requests all around the UK and online. I want to do more. I want to instill hope where medicine can only do so much. I\u0027ve seen the \"magic\" when their hero walks in and encourages them with their physical therapy or to take their medicine when doctors and even their parents are challenged. You may have seen my efforts to help \u0027Draven\u0027, last year on my Facebook and Instagram to raise funds in the cold windy rain. Oh the life of a superhero! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen a child or the child in us meets their favorite hero, all their worries melt away. I\u0027ve been honored to meet so many fans on charity walks and hero meet-and-greets while fundraising. I have seen the hope in parents\u0027 and friends\u0027 eyes that don\u0027t have a clue on how to proceed. I want to relieve their anxiety. I want their hopes to continue after an event or meet ends. I want to do more. I will do more. This is where you can help Superman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you want to do this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe need hope. All of us need to be a part of something greater. This is my way to give back to Superman and Christopher Reeve who inspired the 6 year old in me to take on the cape and S to make the world better. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I can increase my visits to more hospitals, homes, charity fundraisers and events. I do not live in London so travel, wear and tear on my suits, and incidentals take funds. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA round trip travel cost to London is \u00a348 ($68) per trip.\u003cbr\u003eOne suit can costs between $500 and $2k and can only lasts one year. I am currently on my 5 suit. (Superman cant appear scruffy)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe children\u0027s hospital has requested 14 visits this year alone. I am a small business owner and I have donated funds and personal time to bring honor to Superman\u0027s S. Even Superman cannot do it alone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe funds raised with your generous assistance will go towards better suits, transportation and all things to bring hope into the world. I am not soliciting funds to get paid or to reimburse my time.This is not what my Patreon page is for. My personal efforts are and will be always my gift to bringing honor to Superman - to both of whom I remain always indebted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Supermuscleman Helps, you will see updates on my appearances, the people you have helped me help, and the inspiration that you can take pride to help make the world much better. Ill also be putting up exclusive photo shoots and have other rewards ill give out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Did You Get into Superman?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMy first memory was seeing the classic Christopher Reeve Superman the Movie when I was 6. Inspired, I insisted being Superman with my friends. I enjoyed the comics and used him as a role-model. He stands for kindness and protecting those who are in need, I latched onto that as a child and inspired, I became heavily involved in wildlife protection and charity work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt University, I took up bodybuilding and had the perfect excuse to put on my first Superman costume. I had been working out heavily and I could not wait for the first fancy dress. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell that\u0027s when it happened. Someone parked their Fiesta car on my friend\u0027s purse strap and the bag was now jammed. She tried and tried but failed to free it. So what was Superman to do? I lifted the car enough so she could get her bag (insert Superman music theme) and the rest is history! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWord spread that I lifted the car in my Superman suit and from then on, I could dress as my favorite character without shame and Supermuscleman was born and it became my nickname on campus! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started doing the odd appearance for family and friends\u0027 kids in my suit that I realized I saw through Christopher Reeves\u0027 eyes and understood what he must have experienced. I gave hope. People\u0027s smiles and the gleam in their eyes say so much more. This Supermuscleman Saves Patreon page is a way we all can share in their smiles. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Can You Help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI understand your donations are your time invested in what I want to do. You can donate one time or choose to be a yearly donor with different levels to match your generosity or interest. (See side bar.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever you choose to support our efforts, I sincerely appreciate any assistance you can provide and have tried to make each level personal to match your support and interest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Like, Any Examples of What it is That You Do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWatch the video and check out my Instagram page - its SuperMuscleMan"
