Don\u0027t you release most of your photos for free?\u00a0\u2606\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s very true, however doing what I do can get expensive. I really want to keep this going and to do that I need to keep spending what I can on new outfits, props, etc. Having most of my photos out for free won\u0027t last forever, this patreon will give you the ability to help me keep it going permanently! It helps that I have a personal photographer, but even that\u0027s not free.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith the help of Patrons like you, I can not only make sure that I can keep up with costs, but I can make shoots even better. I\u0027ve even given a rough outline of goals, I\u0027d love to do a monthly stream, but I don\u0027t have the equipment right now to do it in a quality I\u0027d be happy with.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u2606 Exclusive Photos, Sneak peaks, shopping? Like a blog?\u00a0\u2606\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYes! Except this is particularly giving you the skinny on what I\u0027m doing concerning all my photos! I like to keep things secretive to surprise everyone, but not here! You get to see the birth of outfit ideas and see all the troubles of me getting everything perfect!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2606 So when are rewards sent out? \u2606\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAll throughout the month, I\u0027ll be posting stuff according to the tier you sign up for! As more people join, you can expect even more photos so share my patreon page and help me gain more followers. \u003cu\u003e Photos are typically NSFW, but I don\u0027t do anything explicit.\u003c/u\u003e The rewards are posted close to the end of the month and I try to get it with 7 days left.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2606\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eBut what makes those exclusive photos so special? \u2606\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eWell they\u0027re photos that I felt were just \u003cem\u003etoo hot\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to be placed on any of my other pages. I even manage to make those extra special with their content. Those censor stars I use are also smaller than I normally have them so you get a better eyeful, for \u003cu\u003eselfie packs I don\u0027t really even censor them at all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u2606 Behind the scenes? Like what?\u00a0\u2606\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn occasion, I\u0027ll be showing off things like getting my make-up done or even getting dressed for the shoot!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u2606 Wait!?!? You have a snapchat!\u00a0\u2606\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course and only the proper tiered patrons can have access to it! Whether I\u0027m out and about, getting ready for the day, or out losing my mind at some event, you\u0027ll get to see it! But most of my time is spent lounging about at home so don\u0027t be shocked to see me trying things out! You just have to remember that you tell me through patreon your username so you get the proper access. I won\u0027t accept it via any other site since this is the best way to ensure that yes it is your account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2665 Remember! \u2665\u003cbr\u003eI understand that not everyone can contribute to my Patreon, and if you can\u0027t you can still help me! Show my instagram, deviantart, or tumblr some love! Show friends my photos, reblog my stuff on my tumblr and comment on my deviantart/instagram! That\u0027ll be more than enough for me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxoxo\u003cbr\u003e- Elise~\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\nJust remember, these photos are copyrighted and as a Patron, it\u0027s your privilege to receive any reward and by sharing or printing any of my work you\u0027ll be hurting my ability to continue doing what we\u0027re both enjoying.
