What about Video Games? Even better... How about these 3 things together? Sounds good? Read on! I\u0027m working on a project that is certain to pique your interest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt all began with a question...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in March 2017, I began the work on an ambitious project. I had been streaming programming on Twitch for about a month and wanted a long-term project I could commit to. The idea that struck at the time seemed pretty crazy: \u003cem\u003eWhat if I could create a piece of software that would assist developers and researchers with the task of turning video games, new and old, into machine learning and artificial intelligence experiments?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast-forward to today, Serpent.AI is an absolutely unique and novel open source framework that has exceeded all expectations I had both feature and popularity-wise. It boasts over 4100 stars on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/SerpentAI/SerpentAI\"\u003eGitHub\u003c/a\u003e and in only 3 months after its beta release managed to snag the #10 spot in the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.mybridge.co/30-amazing-python-projects-for-the-past-year-v-2018-9c310b04cdb3\"\u003elist of top 2017 Python projects\u003c/a\u003e.

At the time of writing this, Habitat is still being worked on but here\u0027s a short description of the initiative:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Serpent.AI up to this point, a user would have had to write their own game plugin to provide support for the game of their choice. After that, they had to come up with a task for the game agent and implement all that from A to Z. Not only is this a lot of work but it\u0027s also a very intimidating amount of things to learn for developers that are getting familiar with the framework. Habitat is a project that acknowledges this difficulty and will offer an alternative for beginners: Curated, ready-to-go machine learning environments for popular games! With game support, inputs and actions already made available for you, you get to the machine learning part way faster!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwitch Channels\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am still streaming Serpent.AI content on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/serpent_ai\"\u003eTwitch\u003c/a\u003e to this day and intend to keep doing so for as long as I can. In February 2018, I introduced a new,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/serpent_ai_labs\"\u003e24/7 channel\u003c/a\u003e that runs various Serpent.AI experiments in real-time. The Twitch streams have played a big role in making the Serpent.AI framework happen; the support I received from my community there is phenomenal and streaming regularly has provided me the consistency required to ship such an ambitious project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy goal on Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVery simple really: Making a pledge on Patreon helps me absorb the costs incurred by the development and promotion of the project. All that has been shipped so far has been done on my own dime. After parting ways with my last job in July 2017, I have elected to not reenter the job market and dedicate my full attention to the project. This decision is not cheap but it is what allows me to make Serpent.AI the best it can be. You can now help with that too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s all! From one person to another, I genuinely thank you for your support!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
