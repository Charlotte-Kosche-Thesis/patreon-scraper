     "description": "I, Klyde Spracjar, have let go to create my own vision, and to project it outward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am\u00a0creating a very first of it\u0027s kind, full length, long-playing album. With rock roots, classical influence, and a hard, groovy, rhythmic, grooves, \u0027Desire\u0027 will be a resurrectional 2018 release, due on April Fool\u0027s day, 2018.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith my release on a foolish day, I am no fool.\u003cbr\u003eThis is not a joke: I am a former 1st Ranger Battalion 75th Ranger Regiment operator. I have been awarded a Ranger tab, and after another deployment as a junior leader in Afghanistan, I returned home, with troubles, to instruct at Ranger Training Battalion, on the Florida panhandle. It was\u0027t easy, as I have a past. I was the Top Gun of my class 09-10 in RASP, and a promising leader. One thing held me back;\u003cbr\u003eI am no killer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward through many, many unsuccessful bands as a guitarist or bassist trying to incorporate my vocals wherever I can to help \u0027fill in\u0027 the sound.\u00a0I was constantly denied artist involvement in the writing process of these bands. I wanted to contribute more and was held back.\u00a0I have realized my true goal: To have my voice heard; I can sing! Though, this new found skill does not come without great practice and dedication to yourself, and your art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot everyone will like what you do.\u003cbr\u003eInfluence one soul out of every million, and that is enough for me. I don\u0027t need the money, I am fully disabled and compensated by my government. I am extremely grateful for this opportunity to pursue what I have always wanted to do as an infant. Chuck E\u0027 Cheese, 1992. I was turning 1 years old. The mechanical, animal, band was revealed onstage as the red, velvety, curtain was pulled clear. This was my first memory...\u003cbr\u003eIn the home video, I walked up the the stage, put both my hands on it, leaning over just enthralled watching these \u0027things\u0027 play music! I loved what I heard, I loved what I saw, and it stuck with me for life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Sua Sponte: The Forging of a Modern American Ranger\u0027\u003cbr\u003eBy author, and former Navy Seal Team One Captain and CIA Agent Dick Couch, had these things to observe about myself, \u0027Kevin Seiple\u0027 in one of several excerpts of his book:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I watched private Kevin Seiple during the week of marksmanship training, and he was shooting very well...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e{further down}\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCouch: \"So,\" I venture, \" where would you be if you hadn\u0027t had a wife and baby?\" He gives me a wistful grin.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSeiple: \" I\u0027m not sure where I\u0027d be, but I know what I would like to be doing. I was a lead guitarist in a rock band. We were pretty good - not great, but good - and we were getting better. The music business isn\u0027t an easy one, so I\u0027d probably be working day jobs for pocket money, and playing gigs at night - and probably sleeping in the back of my van.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCouch: \" And now you\u0027re a soldier?\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027That\u0027s right.\u0027 He says with a firm smile. \u0027 I\u0027m a daddy and husband, and soon I\u0027ll be a ranger. I\u0027ve got no complaints; I\u0027ll do all right here.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTruth is, I wasn\u0027t all right.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy wife, whom I married prior to my first deployment, left and took our daughter back home to be with her lover on Christmas Eve 2010. 3 months later I was in Afghanistan conducting operations in support of the U.S. Foreign Policy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI fell apart. I stepped on a low-order (dud) landmine/pressure plate/ something (who knows) and it barely made a sound, and a small cloud of dust around my feet. It sounded like a bottle rocket shoved into the dirt and lit, or a small, lunch-sized bag of potato chips covered in earth; a very muffled \u0027POP!\u0027\u003cbr\u003eSometimes, I think it did fully detonate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe world is literally one big vibration of sound, you\u0027ve heard the planets\u0027 sounds from space right? Absolutely stunning and a must hear if you haven\u0027t yet. The Earth is barreling through space at 1,000 miles an hour or more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNow imagine a car wheel as it spins faster and faster, seemingly rotating slower and slower, perhaps it goes in reverse direction. Know what I am talking about?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNow imagine that same concept, with terrestrial life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m no acclaimed scholar, or Berkeley alumni astronomer, but I am a dreamer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen anything is probable, EVERYTHING is possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading and I hope that you decide to support a product that will be available for all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Klyde Spracjar\u003cbr\u003e-Kevin Seiple\u003cbr\u003e-Kellan Seiwert\u003cbr\u003e",
