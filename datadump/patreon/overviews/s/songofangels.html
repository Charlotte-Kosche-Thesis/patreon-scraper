    "summary": "Well, here we are. The next frontier toward creating a bold \u0026amp; new, worship platform that reaches into Heaven \u0026amp; the Glory realm. Another great American revival is in sight. And here I am asking for your help to produce more music \u0026amp; message for God\u0027s people.\u003cbr\u003eThe video above tells you what I want to do with my Music and News Channel. So what\u0027s Kickstarter? If you\u0027re just showing up here for the first time ... here\u2019s the lowdown: If you\u0027re a partner or friend of mine and want to support me in the creation of new songs/webcasts/videos/writing/performance-art and more inspiring \u0026amp; ministry TV , this is the place, as you can see. And the feedback from the patrons gathered here has been \u003cem\u003eGREAT\u003c/em\u003e. It\u0027s working. I read comments we discuss, I love feedback, I am figuring this system out\u003cem\u003e as I go\u003c/em\u003e, with the help of the people here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy backstory: I\u2019ve been happily struggling since I got off my record label in 2015 to find the right platform for ongoing support, through which I can release constant material (and get paid). I\u2019ve gotten to know myself. as a missionary evangelist, a singer-songwriter. As a recording artist, I thrive on a direct mainline to my audience without having to go through labels, distributors, or the often mercenary establishment media machine. I love making things and instantly sharing. I know my community: you\u0027re smart, kind, love the Lord, are patriotic, supportive, future-platform embracing people and you are loved and so appreciated!. I think subscription sites like Kick starter \u0026amp; Patreon(ongoing monthly support site)  are a new revolution in new, gospel music-release and art patronage. What I\u2019m doing flies in the face of most conventional approaches: I try to release pretty much \u003cem\u003eall of my artistic content\u003c/em\u003e for free: the songs and videos live FREE on YouTube, my site, wherever. THAT IS HOW I LIKE IT. Not everybody wants to buy it. That\u0027s fine. It\u0027s yours, it\u0027s God\u0027s, it\u0027s everybody\u0027s, you can take it, you can share it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI NEED YOUR SUPPORT VERY MUCH:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut to do this: I need support, true patronage and those of you willing to be the driving engine to pay for the continued production of more content. Almost 1,200 of you have subscribed to my channel since 2015. Kick Starter will help get my new album and concert tour off the ground but Patreon is more of a monthly commitment: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE FACT IS:\u003cbr\u003eWithout your support I simply cannot continue the work I do. You get a road test both Kickstarter \u0026amp; Patreon if you\u2019re hesitant. You can cancel before you\u0027re charged at the end of any month, so it\u0027s risk-free). By being a Patron together we can change this troubled world and make it a better place- a place where the holiness and glory of God can visit \u2013 and do this as partners and friends.I really believe in the future of \u003cem\u003eKingdom of God on earth.  \u003c/em\u003eI believe in \"New Testament grass roots power\" and what Kick Starter \u0026amp; Patreon is doing to help indie voices in the  church like me. It isn\u0027t making world news (yet), because it is what it is: a quiet, underground network of Christian creators connecting directly with their fan base, bypassing the entire Nashville commercial record system and biased secular , often anti Christ establishment news media. This is incredible. In these days of artist negativity, Kickstarter \u0026amp; Patreon are the bright side of the net: it is how the web can really \u201csave indie artists\u201d like myself in an art \u0026amp; news economy that is floundering with so many sites offering free music streaming. \u003cbr\u003eAnd it means you need to step up and support the artists you love, the true worshipers like me that you want to see bravely challenging the system, the art work you want to see reflecting the realities of this generation of believers , the anointed musicians \u0026amp; gospel artists you want to fill your hearts and your stereo speakers, the authors, singers and lyric writers  you want to see \"singing\" about the state of the world and the glory of God. Here\u0027s the key: \u003cem\u003eTHIS IS A HUGE EXPERIMENT.\u003c/em\u003e And a new Song of Angels 4 album with rebroadcast in national Christian TV(Such as Sid Roth,TBN and Daystar etc.) will open doors to one of the greatest revivals this world has ever seen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you guys know me, you know I \u003cem\u003elisten \u0026amp; I pray\u003c/em\u003e. And together we can make this a better nation and world for our children and their children. (Proverbs 13:22) Whatever you feel led in your heart to give, I can\u0027t thank you enough for your being a patron here. We love America and all the nations - we desire to promote and preserve her freedom * morality with all the abilities God has given us. We uniquely bring in the knowledge of the glory of the Lord in word and in song and will do so with the sharp edge of truth always. With your help, you have made our \"pen\" mightier  the sword of the LORD. For conservative, patriotic and faith based music and message,  please donate or comment today! God bless you and God bless America! \u003cbr\u003eSo together, let\u2019s \u003cem\u003edo this for ourselves, for our families\u2026 \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eLet\u2019s make a real revival in AMERICA a reality! \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove in Christ,\u003cbr\u003eFederico\u003ch3\u003eRisks and challenges\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eI already have written the music and lyrics for all 18 songs of Song of Angels Vol. 4 and simply need to record and mix to finish!\u003c/p\u003e"

     "about": "Federico (Freddy) Cardella-Hayler Is an Boston born, singer, worship leader, composer, author \u0026amp;  missionary evangelist.  He became born again Christian while attending a F.C.A meeting (Fellowship of Christian Athletes) at the College of William \u0026amp; Mary. My Italian side of the family name is Cardella which I took as a stage/commercial name when singing in operatic concert venues - since most of the music I sang was in Italian and i am of Italian/Austrian descent.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eStage Name: Federico being his formal name \u0026amp; Cardella his family name from Italy- he recently re-branded his CD \u0026amp; DVD\u0027s as \"Federico\" instead of Freddy Hayler. When he first commenced the Song of Angels project in 1998 - \"Federico\" was the original name. Under advise from his Record label (Provident- Sony Christian Records) \u0026amp; management, it was recently determined for him to title his records as one name \"Federico\" - as he was already using that title in the classical \u0026amp; operatic world of mainstream music. Sorry for ant confusion! :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFederico attended both Fuller Theological and Gordon-Conwell Seminaries, and the US Center for World Missions Graduate School in Pasadena, Ca. where he focused his studies on world missions, church growth and the history of great revivals.  After graduating, he entered the real estate business, raised his family and is now a full-time gospel singer and missionary \u003cbr\u003eAlthough operatically trained, he has always used his talent for the Lord and sings a wide range of gospel, praise and worship, romance music and sacred classical music.\u003cbr\u003eOne of ten children, he has loved to sing ever since he can remember. \u003cbr\u003eMore Than a Song\u003cbr\u003e\"To worship God means to worship Him with our whole life.  We will then find our hearts afire with mission and purpose to reach out to others in practical ways in everyday life. The true worshiper will  in simplicity, bring the love and light of Jesus to our world.\" \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m convinced that America\u0027s very survival and life as we know it fully dependent on a spiritual awakening from Heaven. In Feb. 2015 I began to see in prayer the impossibility of simply remaining a singer but realized God had called me to do so much more for His glory. \u003cbr\u003eI was simply a singer who saw that American liberty is in great peril.  Our nation has become spiritually and morally disheartened by a weak leadership in government and a lukewarm church. Because of this void in leadership, the whole world is hurting, confused and spiritually lost in a quagmire of moral chaos. terror and crime.  Where once America shined as a role model of virtue and prosperity now she reels under debt and the the major exporter of smut to the world.\u003cbr\u003eThe moral absolutes that have guided us for 250 years has all but been abandoned. Peace loving Christians are being persecuted and beheaded in the Middle East and besmirched  and harassed here by \"politically\" correct media and government here at home.\u003cbr\u003eIn our country, there has been a relentless and deliberate changing of our national laws to insult and thumb their nose at the laws of God\u0027s great Universe. \u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s no wonder that \"natural\" catastrophes, economic woes and lawlessness now grip the headlines. But this is only the beginning of judgments that are in the land if we as God\u0027s people- his Bride do not purify ourselves, repent and pray on her behalf.\u003cbr\u003eLong tested  traditional values are under relentless and unreasonable assault - even the ancient, institution of marriage and the most basic legal and natural definition what is male and female has become unreasonably and wickedly convoluted by design. Who would have ever dreamed 100 years ago that abortion on demand, the sale of body parts, gender confusion, sinle sex public bathrooms and school showers \u0026amp; locker rooms, rioting in the streets and anarchy, the rise in cults, occult, opiate abuse, terrorism, gangs, illegal immigration, cities as war zones,  and Islamic extremism would be so prevalent? The schools and media now propagandize that its okay not to know if you are man or woman? Really?  \u003cbr\u003eWe have abandoned our long trusted allies and have embraced our enemies. We have forgotten the founding fathers goal of making this great American Republic a city on a hill to illumine the whole world. We have forgotten our missionaries and the Great Commission had become the great omission.\u003cbr\u003eThere are over 6 billion people in the world and some 16,000 people/ethnic groups - most who do not know of the Lord.\u003cbr\u003eAnd by all means, we must endeavor to do all we can to reach them with the love and salvation of Jesus Christ.\" It is my hope and prayer that my music and message helps to spread the light and life of God\u0027s truth to the entire planet ...\u003cbr\u003eAnd so i leave you with 2 Chronicles 7:14; Habakkuk 3:1-3; Matt. 28:18-20\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s Time!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Federico\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
