    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eThey had been there\nall along, waiting just beneath the surface. So I took up my pen, and I set\nthem all free\u2026\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m an illustrator-author-musician-composer-podcaster general creative with a penchant\nfor storytelling in many formats. My illustrations distill grand ideas into\nsimple, elegant line-and-shadow images, drawn in real ink on real paper, with\nsmall digital touches added at the end to make everything sweet and smooth. Sometimes they\u2019re witty\nand whimsical; sometimes they\u2019re odd and unsettling. And sometimes they\u2019re just\ntoo cute for words. People grow horns and hooves. Beasts roam freely with\nchildren riding in their manes. Machines and mystics and robots and royals\nmingle in upside-down landscapes with forest doors that lead nowhere and\nladders that lean against the moon. I never know until the pen hits the paper what might happen,\nbut the results are usually worth playing in the mystery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYeah\u2026it gets pretty unusual around this place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThrough this Patreon portal into the quirk and the cryptic\nthat is Steven Luna Illustration, I will be opening the floodgates on volumes\nof new images for intended for future publication that you as a patron can own\nas they\u2019re created. Some will be seen nowhere else, entirely exclusive to my\npatrons. We\u2019ll have our own secret gallery, only in this one we can eat\npeanuts and drop the shells on the floor if we want, and nobody will tell us to keep our\nvoices down or to stop doing handstands in the lobby. There are storybooks and\ncalendars and art volumes all in the works, and special surprises are sure to\nspring up along the way. They\u2019re so surprising, I\u2019m not even certain what they\nall are just yet\u2026but the ones I do know of are pretty whopping. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHow whopping?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell, in addition to collecting the rewards for your paid\npatronage tier, all patrons regardless of tier will be entered in a monthly\ndrawing to win the frame-ready original version of the digital image created for that month,\ntitled and signed in the corner by me (if you\u2019re into that sort of thing). And as\nthe patronage grows, so will the tiers and the rewards and the surprises, until\nour heads and our hearts practically explode from all the excitement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWow. That seems like a lot to hope for, doesn\u2019t it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m in if you are. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for finding me, and thank you so very much for supporting my\nart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt only gets weirder from\nhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll material copyright 2018 Steven Luna.
