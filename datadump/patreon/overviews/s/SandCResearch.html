It seems to be making the fitness industry smarter. Hopefully, you agree! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, I have released over 500, covering the ways exercises work, the effects of different types of strength training, the best ways to improve sports performance, and optimal methods to stimulate muscle growth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is true that you can read my infographics for free if you look through my social media accounts. But if you become a patron, then you\u00a0can have your own copies to refer back to! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards include a monthly summary PDF for just $2 a month, or a full encyclopedia-style digital resource for only $5 a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see from my goals, when you become a patron, it frees up some of my time, which I plan to use to make high-quality videos. On video, I will be able to explain even more clearly how strength training works (and how we can do it better).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome a patron now, and join\u00a0me in making the fitness industry a smarter place!\u003cbr\u003e"
