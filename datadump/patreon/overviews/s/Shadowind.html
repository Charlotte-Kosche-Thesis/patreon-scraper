I\u0027m Erin but I often go by Shadowind or ShadowindART online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to my Pateron Page! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a freelance artist working in both digital and traditional mediums. I love nature and to draw and paint animals and fantasy creatures, and I have been doing it since I have been old enough to hold a pencil in my hand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support my art on Patreon?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e While I love to create artworks at the moment it is not my full time job, and I could not support myself doing it. I have always dreamed that someday I could support myself and make a living with my art alone. As it is I\u00a0 currently I work 4 days a week as a barn hand cleaning horse stalls, and in between I often take jobs pet-sitting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0l love animals and my jobs working around them,but like many artists who have to work other jobs to survive I can often be\u00a0 busy and worn out from my other work. I want to create more art and be more consistent with the art I post so any support I get will help motivate me towards this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI often wonder what it would be like if I could make enough money on my art to support myself more to feel more secure in my place in the world and not have to worry so much about working other jobs all the time and feel that pressure to make money and be more free to make art at leisure... How much better of an artist I could become if things were like this? Also how nice would it be if I could actually afford to have a small place of my own and move out of my parents attic? haha XD \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA good friend of my suggested I open a Patreon Page for my art, as art has been a life long passion of mine, so I decided to take her advice and here I am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 By supporting me on Patreon your bringing me one step closer to being able to make a secure living off of my art. Your pledge will help to buy art supplies and encourage me on my personal journey as an individual artist! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome things I would maybe like to get using my earnings on patreon for the future for furthering my path as an artist would be:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*a few Copic marker sets as I have never tried the but seen some amazing work done with them and I would love some for next Inktober but they are so pricey\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Maybe some nice new watercolors and gouache as I use that a lot for pet portraits\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*possibly a web cam and/or mic for streaming more on twitch\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContent~\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI hope you all will understand at the moment that I am just starting out here on Patreon. More content will be added as I go along and learn more about this site, what are good rewards to offer, and how everything works. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment I will be adding content whenever I have the time and energy to, so it may not be on a regular schedule, but it will be regularly added\u00a0 ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 However I do want to get so that I am on a schedule and adding more content at the begining of each month especially when i actually start to get patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I would like to possibly add things on like: giveaways of small prizes (Things like stickers from my Zazzle Shop, prints, or small original artworks) As well as possibly exclusive speed paint videos or streams ( I\u0027m not the best at video editing and i don\u0027t have a webcam as of yethowever, so i\u0027m not sure if this will happen right away)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU for the awesome support!\u00a0 You are an amazing person for supporting my art and you have my deepest gratitude!\u003cbr\u003e"
