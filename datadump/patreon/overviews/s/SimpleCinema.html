I\u0027ve put myself through film school and I\u0027ve been a writer ever since I was able to read. Right now my main focus is my novel series \u0027Those Who Dwell in the Dark\u0027 which is a Horror/Mystery/Coming of Age series in the vain of authors like Stephen King and Neil Gaiman. Mainly, what I\u0027d like to accomplish, is to be able to write full-time, as there is honestly nothing I enjoy more, but to get there, I\u0027ll need some help. I\u0027m focused on trying to stay afloat and constantly deliver content to my audience, however big or small. Even if you just clicked here to browse, I appreciate your time considering me. And for those of you who wanna get into this, welcome aboard!"
