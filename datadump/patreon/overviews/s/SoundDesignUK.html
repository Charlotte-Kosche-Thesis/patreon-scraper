We do this so that everyone can learn more about the industry and ways to pursue or enhance their audio career.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat type of content is there?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\nWe conduct interviews with voice actors, sound designers, composers and other audio professions around the world of various levels of experience, from juniors to veterans. We write reviews of sound libraries, games, films, tv and other media purely from an audio perspective. We basically cover everything audio!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you support us?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\nThe Sound Architect has always been self -funded, and all the writers do all this work voluntarily. It\u0027s a lot of work for all of us, and it would be great to continue doing so.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEQUIPMENT, is the main issue we need to address first. We\u0027re working with what we all have personally, but we need better equipment for the interviews, and videos. For example, even a decent portable recorder and some lav mics would enhance our video interviews. Can\u0027t have bad audio quality on an audio site!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy voluntary writers who are AWESOME, but can only do so much. With your help, we could achieve so much more and fulfil the amazing potential that The Sound Architect has. We would love to be able to pay the writers for their work as they very much deserve it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe also have hosting costs, theme costs, domain costs, SoundCloud Pro costs and everything else just to keep the site going.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you feel you\u0027d like to see more of the site and show some support, then any donations or shares are highly appreciated to keep this resource going!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGame Audio North\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Sound Architect now also presents Game Audio North, a highly successful networking event in the North of the UK. Funds from Sam also go towards this as part of his own money for The Sound Architect and Game Audio North. So for things to be sustainable we need to support the event itself as well!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Impact\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\nWe get many success stories of people progressing, pursuing their career in audio, with thanks in some way to The Sound Architect. A reader thanked me directly as it was one of the interviews that led her to apply (and be accepted) for her Masters degree at the University of Westminster. One of the guests on our podcast was hired for a job, partially due to our review of one of the game he worked on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTHESE are the kind of stories that explain why Sam runs The Sound Architect\u2122 and we want to create more of them, keeping The Sound Architect\u2122 going as long as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAny support will all go into The Sound Architect\u2122 for equipment, editors, events, competitions and more writers all to make it greater for our readers and listeners!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSam Hughes\u003cbr\u003e\nEditor in Chief"
