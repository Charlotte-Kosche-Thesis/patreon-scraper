His debut novel, \u003cem\u003eThe Void Knight\u003c/em\u003e, has not come out yet, but\nwhen it does, Paul has assured me that it will be the all-time best-selling\nnovel of the nineteenth century. Mr. Fassett is also a prolific illustrator,\nwhose most recent works can be found in his desk drawer and hanging on the\nrefrigerator of his mother\u0027s kitchen.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPaul has been the director of short films you\nhaven\u0027t seen yet, as well as the writer of music you probably don\u0027t want to\nhear. I know what you\u0027re thinking: \u201cWow, what an amazing guy. I wonder if he\u0027s\nsingle?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYes he is, but not by choice.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPaul lives in Apopka, Florida, with his\ngirlfriends Lefty and Righty, who never leave his sides.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWho I really am is a writer. I write. I edit. Then,\nI write some more. If I am lucky, the things I write get published. I\u0027m not\nvery lucky.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have been told that I am a jack of all trades. I have dabbled in many\ndisciplines including Illustration, Photography, Music, and Acting, but my true\nlove is literature and game design.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg554/stratedgygaming/YourContribution_zpscmxnuqb6.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to cover my bed in dollar bills and\nroll around on top of them. Barring that, I will use your contribution to\nincrease the production quality of my video essays. In time, my hope is to have\nenough resources to create high quality short films and video games, as well as\nbehind-the-scenes and tutorials on the various methods I use to create these pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe real dream is to take this show on the road\nand open my audience up to the wide world of creators in both North and South\nAmerica. My hope is that eventually, I will be able to make feature length documentaries that focus on the issues that affect the world around us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contributions will go towards camera equipment, editing software, the purchase of games for review, and for the future, flights to interview subjects of videos, or to investigate subjects of videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecifically:\u003cbr\u003eManfrotto Fluid head tripod\u003cbr\u003eNikon d7200\u003cbr\u003eNikon 35mm f1.8\u003cbr\u003eRig Wheels Rail Dolly\u003cbr\u003eGo Pro\u003cbr\u003ePersistent Lighting system for indoor interviews\u003cbr\u003eLarge Diffuser screens\u003cbr\u003eDrone for overhead establishing shots\u003cbr\u003eMonthly cost of Adobe Creative Suite\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal is for the channel to move away from using footage from news broadcast, or royalty free video, and concentrate on filming my own footage so that future videos are not copyright claimed by anyone but me. (This has been a problem)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg554/stratedgygaming/Schedule_zpspb2vrman.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to produce a video essay once every two\nweeks, but with a full-time job this is not always possible. My goal is to\neventually produce content on a weekly basis. Patrons will only be charged for\nvideo essays, and they will only be charged a maximum of 4 times a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg554/stratedgygaming/Ethics_zpszhaa8b90.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStrat-edgy Productions will never compromise the\nintegrity of its critiques by accepting sponsorship that may have an impact on\nits opinions.
