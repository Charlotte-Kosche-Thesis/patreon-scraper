    "summary": "Thank you all for visiting my new web home and I hope to see you become new and much-loved members of my Sparkle Squad!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a handmade jewelry designer, specializing in custom themed designs for holidays, bibliophiles and film buffs. I have professional quality skills in bead weaving, stringing, wire crochet, wire wrapping, metal stamping, resin photos and layering, as well as mixed media design. I teach local beading and craft classes at several locations in El Paso, Texas. I make video tutorials in both jewelry making and crafts which have previously always been posted solely on my YouTube channel. Eventually, I would love to be able to open a small beading/ craft maker shop. Your support here will assist me in saving up for that tremendous overhead expense down the road, so thank you in advance for being apart of that special dream making strategy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to the recent demonetization issues and the needs that I have to expand my offerings as a teaching artist and freelance professional, I\u0027ve decided to establish a home here at Patreon. I am excited to engage with my existing Sparkle Squad members that follow me over here, but also want to reach out and thank any new sparkly supporters or Patrons. I\u0027m still getting acclimated to the idea of earning more reliable financial support from my Sparkle Squad, so it is truly with a humble heart to anyone becoming a patron here that I say...thank you BIG SPARKLY BUNCHES! I hope to offer you some interesting content, a listening ear, potential networking mentor and whatever else you might be seeking that falls into line with my varied skills and interests.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan to offer video tutorials with VIP Sparkle Squad 1st-Access here before it is released to any other platform. I will also be glad to take project and/or technique requests as I consider upcoming tutorials. As an entrepreneurial professional with a background in\u00a0finance, education, events planning, web development, eCommerce, print\u00a0and\u00a0eMarketing...I also plan to offer various written posts, file shares and PDF content that will help my fellow artists with the Type A aspects of running their own handmade business. And along the way, of course, tidbits that I hope you may find interesting about me personally such as cat photos (yes, I\u0027m THAT kind of crazy cat lady), event setups at my craft shows, and whatever else you may express interest in reading about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m BRAND spanking NEW to this Patreon platform, but I do plan to offer consistent\u00a0content and fun engagement with my patrons. Please do, however, be patient with me as I learn the processes and system setup for newbies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions or want more info, please visit my website at \u003ca href=\"http://www.sparklebymonica.com.\"\u003ewww.sparklebymonica.com.\u003c/a\u003e I have links to all my social media which includes a blog and video page with tons of previous content that you can view to\u00a0tide you over until I get stocked up on sharing sparkles here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave a sparkle-riffic day, y\u0027all!! And thank you all again- SO VERY MUCH! Your sparkly support means more to me than I could ever express in mere words!\u003cbr\u003e"
