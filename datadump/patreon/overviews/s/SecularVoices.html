At this level, I\u0027ll be able to quit my full time job and concentrate on SecularVoices and Young Skeptics, attending as many events as possible, posting articles multiple times daily, and traveling the country to set up Young Skeptics chapters (once I dry the tears from my eyes, that is)!! This would truly be a dream come true and I\u0027d owe it all to my supporters."
