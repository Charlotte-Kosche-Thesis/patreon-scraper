We\u0027re an actual-play, adult comedy podcast featuring a cast of bizarre characters making their way through adventures set in the Heart of Bronze universe, the fictional alternate-reality created by author Michael J. Rigg.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Clockwork-Looking-Glass-Heart-Bronze/dp/1503317625/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1489581564\u0026amp;sr=8-1\u0026amp;keywords=clockwork+looking+glass\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii557/steamrollersadventurepodcast/ClockworkLookingGlass_PB1_zpsrbh18cba.jpg\" style=\"width: 609px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou don\u0027t need to read any of the books to enjoy the podcast. The books merely provide the setting. The tales and adventures in the show are as diverse as the players within it, simply taking queues from the Story Crafter (or GM, or DM, if you will), who happens to also be the author of the series. Our show comes out every Tuesday, and generally runs about an hour. Every episode surrounds the adventures of our player characters as they solve mysteries or thwart enemies (If the dice are kind)\u00a0in an alternate reality that is both familiar and strange. Sometimes we present special episodes that cover lore, mechanics, out-of-character chat, or guest spots.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRole-playing Steampunk?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re new to tabletop role-playing games, Google \"Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons,\" and you\u0027ll get the idea. We pretty much work like that, but with unique rule sets, and all within a Steampunk universe. If you\u0027re new to Steampunk, just think \"Victorian science fiction,\" and you\u0027ll get the idea. Imagine a world where the Industrial Revolution never took hold. Imagine a world where the stuff of Jules Verne, Nikola Tesla, H.G. Wells, and H.P. Lovecraft took off! Our stories are filled with curious gadgets, machines of steam, crawling cities, monstrous\u00a0airships, slavering ghouls, crafty witches, and a nation divided by continuous warfare.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii557/steamrollersadventurepodcast/HOBAmerica_zpsdqjzv4dj.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re an adult comedy gaming show, meaning we sport an \"explicit\" tag on iTunes--mostly for strong language and mature situations.
