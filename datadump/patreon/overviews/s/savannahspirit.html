For some, I know you in real life. Thes days it\u0027s harder to maintain any kind of steady connection through instagram \u0026amp; facebook since I\u0027m often deleted for posting my work. I\u0027m tired of the constant censorship and worry that my profiles will be deleted. It\u0027s frustrating starting over and over. Here, you can always find me and I can always find you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m grateful for all of your support thus far.

Here we can establish our own sense of community outside of social media networks which do not allow nudity and artistic freedom. By becoming a patron you have much more access to my work here as we break away from the confined spaces of social media.\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFine art prints and postcards, commissions, writing, videos, sounds and early access to my newest work all available with your continuous support.

     "about": "Brooklyn artist, Savannah Spirit takes a classical approach to \nphotography not unlike Edward Weston or Imogen Cunningham. Growing up in\n Carmel, CA during her formative years she was inspired by the artists \nwho made work based in line and form. The black and white nude and the \nlandscape became her first loves. Savannah\u0027s most recent series, \u003cem\u003eNevertheless, She Persisted\u003c/em\u003e\n melds together this classical aesthetic while addressing \nobjectification, body-positivity, the female/male gaze and censorship. \nHer solo show of the same name, \u003ca href=\"http://katharinemulherin.com/upcoming-30/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eNevertheless, She Persisted\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e at\n Mulherin New York, presented uncensored nudes out of the confines of \nsocial media where they have been repeatedly flagged and censored as \n\u2018inappropriate.\u0027 Savannah continues to be kicked off instagram and \ncensored on facebook for posting her work. As an activist, Savannah has \ndedicated her time to photographing important civil rights issues \nincluding Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, People\u0027s Climate \nMarch, Anti-Trump protests and the Women\u0027s March. Her dreamy landscapes \nand slices of life are inspired by her love of film and cinematography.\u00a0 Savannah\u2019s\n work is included in numerous private collections including a permanent \npiece in Tom Ford\u0027s Houston store. She has lectured about her work at \nvarious Apple store locations in NYC.
