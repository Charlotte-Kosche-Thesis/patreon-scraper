Thank you for visiting my Patreon page. My name is \u003cstrong\u003eSameera\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and I\u0027m am quite known for detailed \u003cstrong\u003eoil pastel tutorial\u003c/strong\u003e videos on my YouTube channel under the same name. The video shown above is a example of my oil pastel tutorial from YouTube.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been over two years on YouTube now and I\u0027m very glad to see the immense love and response shown by my viewers over my tutorial videos. \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Even though you guys wanted me to make more such videos, I had some constraints. Since oil pastel is a very niche community on YouTube (and the internet), and not many people know about it (many people mistake it with crayons), my YouTube channel wasn\u0027t doing well in terms of the views and subscribers, which means, in return to the \u003cstrong\u003ecountless hours\u003c/strong\u003e of work that goes into painting, filming, and not to mention the editing, I hardly generate any income from youtube, even though I get a very positive response from my viewers. This is because oil pastel is such a niche area in art, the popular ones being oil paints, water color and color pencils (I personally love watercolor and might make videos using it some time).\u003cbr\u003eTo get noticed on youtube, there are certain untold rules like following the trends, making the videos shorter, collaborations etc., which are not possible with the tutorial style videos I make. In addition to this, I also make crafts and DIYs on my youtube channel and I didn\u0027t want to mix my art and craft videos together, because the audience is different for each of these. That is why I decided to create a community where we all can learn art together and enjoy the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003ePatreon is a platform for artists and creators to offer services in the form of videos or posts, and in turn they charge a nominal fee. The people who are interested in taking these services are called \u003cstrong\u003epatrons\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eTo become a patron, one is required to pay a minimum fee of \u003cstrong\u003e$1 per month\u003c/strong\u003e or per creation (In my case, per creation) and if desired, he/she can also pay higher than that, and he/she will be rewarded accordingly. The rewards will be in the form of bonus videos, live streams, contests, giveaways etc. (Please check my rewards section on the right)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eIf I become a patron what do I get?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eIf you become my patron, you would get access to \u0027patron only\u0027 exclusive content which is detailed lengthy oil pastel tutorials with step-by-step explanation. There will be one tutorial every month which is common to all my patrons and one live stream and one bonus video every month to the respective patrons as mentioned in the rewards section on the right. \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eThese tutorials will not be available on my YouTube channel because of the reasons that I mentioned above. On the whole, you can \u00a0get access to live streams, bonus videos, behind the scenes, personal chats, and videos on the requested topic or genre. In addition to that, I would be very grateful to you for supporting me to continue my passion to create and teach art :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eSo are you quitting YouTube?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eNo and I never will. My very intention to start youtube was to inspire people to create art and I will continue to make craft videos on YouTube just like always whenever I find time. I really wish to upgrade my \u0027Craftosphere\u0027 craft show through better quality videos and content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eCan I watch your videos for free?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYes\u003c/strong\u003e, you can continue to watch my videos for free on my YouTube channel. However, from now on, there will be no more tutorial style videos on my channel. Instead, the videos that I post here will be in the form of short, time lapse videos on my channel. However, the live streams and bonus videos are only confined to my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope I was clear with my explanation, and I can\u0027t wait to start this journey with you. Thank you for sparing your time to read all of this :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
