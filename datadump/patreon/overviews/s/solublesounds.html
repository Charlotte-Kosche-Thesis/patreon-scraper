    "summary": "Soluble Sounds is a new music producer emerging from the depths of a vast ocean of musicians with a unique style sticking out from crowds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003elisten to my music here if you haven\u0027t heard it already :) https://soundcloud.com/solublesounds\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I am a 27 year old music producer. I have been making electronic music for over 10 years and playing at club nights and festivals around Europe. I have now made the leap over to Australia for a few months. i am inspired by everything and love experimenting with sounds. Meaning there is a big of variety of styles, sometimes these are blended together. I have always had a passion and love for music. I started playing guitar at the age of nine, by 14 i was playing in bands. I started beatboxing and vocal scratching at the age of 12 and at the age of 15 beatboxing in clubs. Getting side tracked by finding making digital music much more fun, this is what i have continued to do. i am now picking up the guitar more, beatboxing again, and teaching myself clarinet as i want to integrate instruments and electronics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAiming to set up a studio and rehearsal space so i can start a band with live electronics. I also want to buy equipment to loop beatboxing and instruments and busk. As i believe watching a band or going to a concert is an amazing experience but busking in the street has an impact on peoples everyday lives. I am eventually planning to build myself a mobile solar power studio so i can travel recording all walks of life incorporating it into music whilst busking around the world and doing workshops.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei have almost finished my first album of cheeky psychedelic techno/prog which i am hoping will be released around march 2018 just doing all the finishing touches. so i have started this page to pay for the mastering as it is an expense that really makes a massive difference."
