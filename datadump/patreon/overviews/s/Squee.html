    "summary": "Hello! My name is Stephen, but I am better known as Squee. For almost 5 years now, I have made Let\u0027s plays, written stories, and done many other things designed to entertain my viewers. Over time, a community has been built by viewers like yourself that has become like a second family to me. I have finally decided to make an attempt to devote myself full time to this community and generating content for it. However, I can\u0027t do that without support from that community. I want to be able to provide daily content that viewers will love and in order to do that I need to treat this as a full time commitment. The goal of this campaign is to generate enough support from you guys to allow me to spend 40+ hours a week entertaining you, while still paying my bills. If you enjoy my content, and want to see a steady stream of it, please consider pledging below."
