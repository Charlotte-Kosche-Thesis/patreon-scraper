Each week, they randomly choose a Bob Dylan song, listen to it, think about it, move it around, tap-pinch-kick-punch-jab at it, drive with it, buy it a drink or two, and otherwise let it dig itself under their skin. Then they get together to talk about it as as song as a musical arrangement, as a set of words, as a historical moment, as an artifact, as a cipher for our current world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Are We Doing on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, like everyone, we\u0027re looking for others to join us in this project.
