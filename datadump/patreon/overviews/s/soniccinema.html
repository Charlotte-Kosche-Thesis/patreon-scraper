I hope that I can make\nit worth your while.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe\ngoal I have had for Sonic Cinema over the years is to produce intelligent, and thoughtful,\ncriticism and commentary for movies both big and small, whether they are the\nlatest Hollywood blockbuster or a filmmaker\u2019s first, shoe-string attempt at\nfilmmaking with a 3-5 minute short film. Both types of films are worthy of\nconsideration, and even if they aren\u2019t always top quality, I have sometimes\nfound far more enjoyment in a short film from YouTube than I have the newest\nfilm from Marvel Studios, and if I can highlight a film in the former type that\nexcites someone like it did me, than I am glad to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhile\nSonic Cinema has always been, first and foremost, a personal expression for me\nto share my thoughts on movies, as well as my own musical and filmmaking\nefforts, I have always hoped to have a stronger connection to readers, and\noffer them a chance to have their voices heard on movies that they have\nthoughts on. This has included close friends who have recorded\ncommentaries and podcasts with me, or have allowed me to publish their written\nthoughts on the site, as well as filmmaker interviews, which have been a big part of the podcast, whether it is about their own work or someone else\u0027s. For your patronage, I would like to extend some of the\nsame opportunities to you, as well as share some of my own insights on a more\npersonal level.\u003cbr\u003e"
