Aside from various experimental horror projects such as a series of mockumentaries called Buried Conspiracies, an analysis series called XBlur, a found footage series called CodeRadiazione and the occassional true story / creepypasta narration (though I am not limited to those), I also do SCP videos with proper live footage, essentially giving \"life\" to the SCP in one way or another. Occasionally, if time and circumstances allows me to, I also create various films - from short movies and documentaries to series, I\u0027ll be focusing on anything the likes of these. A lot of other experimental work that doesn\u0027t fit in any of the listed categories is also\u00a0what I do! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Support My Channel?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe videos are a lot of work as I do much more than just recording audio, but also recording video footage from scratch. Even if I were to gather an earning through Youtube, I cannot rely on it in any way due to its, well, anti-horror attitude. \u003cbr\u003eThis being said, everything I publish is 100% free. If you\u0027d like to see more and better content released with a more steady schedule, you may offer to support me in any way you see fit! The money will be used for better equipment, footage, actors and audio, thus leading to a generally accelerated working progress. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you for ANY support in advance!\u003c/em\u003e"
