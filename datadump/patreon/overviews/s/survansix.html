A pleasure to make your acquaintance.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are Survansix: just two dudes from opposite sides of the globe, making games and having a fun time doing it. To us, game-dev is about more than just making cool games. As livers and breathers of the art-form, we have grown up being exotic animal trainers, professional go-kart racers, and esteemed space adventurers (do a barrel roll!). So it seems only fitting now that we try our hand at paying homage to some of these classics. If you\u0027re interested, we wrote a \u003ca href=\"https://survansix.blogspot.com.au/2017/11/hello-world.html\"\u003eletter addressed specifically to you\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNathan (from Australia) is our programmer, novelist, and general conversational praddler, and Marcelo (from Brazil) is our concept artist, logo designer, and pixel-art extraordinaire. We post most of our progress to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/survansix\"\u003eTwitter\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eand\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/survansix/\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/survansix/\"\u003eTwitch\u003c/a\u003e-stream our development throughout the week. We also post highlights of our journey to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC69pZFFTropMhFv0Ud0jiTA/\"\u003eYoutube\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eon a regular basis. We are just beginning with game-dev, and as such are still honing our skills, but along our path of discovery we hope to share a couple of laughs, and a few of the lessons we have learned along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Liminality?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLiminality is an adventurous fantasy, where you\u0027re a lost spirit helping souls free themselves from their past. You experience the world through the eyes of the people who lived in different eras of time, and you set out to find a way to re-establish the present, the past, and the spirit world. At its core, Liminality is about the pursuit of happiness, and the things you find when you stop trying to find it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe gameplay revolves around a party-oriented combat-system (think Trine) and dimensional travel (think Zelda: Ocarina of Time). The action component of the genre feels reminiscent of titles like Hyper Light Drifter and Gauntlet, while the story-driven questing component feels more in line with Zelda: Wind Waker, Owlboy, and The Witcher series. We\u0027re super excited to show you more about it, but while we\u0027re early in the stages of its development, we implore you to check out our blog for regular lore write-ups and world descriptions.
