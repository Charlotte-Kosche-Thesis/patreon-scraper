    "summary": "Hi friends. This is Dan Fields, host and creator of \u0027Save It For the Show\u0027, which very well may be your favorite podcast on the internet. Or maybe top 3 at least?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEither way, you\u0027re here because each week you enjoy listening to my co-host Eddie Galindo and I share stories, tell jokes, make each other laugh...and make you laugh too. *rimshot*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe truth is the show doesn\u0027t need much money to survive. So why do a Patreon you\u0027re asking yourself? Well, why not. Aside from the few hundred dollars a year in hosting, website shit, equipment etc. we don\u0027t need much money. Paying for that would be cool.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother thing this campaign will support - merch and shirts. We had a very successful t-shirt campaign. But it was a one-time thing. So I\u0027d really like to have the resources to have an all the time store, with more than soft goods, but also hard goods (don\u0027t be gross) like mugs, buttons, stickers, etc. And not just stuff with our logo on it, but \u0027classic\u0027 jokes and bits from the show like real treats, goats, is that weirds, the couch I had sex with, etc. Also more money could upgrade our equipment, making for a better sounding show. Maybe even to pay for an editor so I can focus on doing the show and writing material, and not as much behind the scenes stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe point is with some money each month Eddie and I will be able to put more time and effort into doing the show, and won\u0027t have to seek sponsors or ads.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, if you\u0027re a fan of the show, you know I do everything honest and up front. And I take risks, try new things, etc. So for people who give us money, you\u0027re really part of the show. Part of the family. So I\u0027ll bring you more into the circle, look for your advice, etc. And if this campaigns shits itself out, so be it. But if we can scratch together some dough, we\u0027ll continue doing even cooler stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome Patreon campaigns\u00a0feel like thinly veiled threats. As in, if this doesn\u0027t work the show is off. That\u0027s not remotely close. The show will remain free and will go on. This will just make our wives give us much less shit if they know we\u0027re making some money from this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support. --Dan Fields"
