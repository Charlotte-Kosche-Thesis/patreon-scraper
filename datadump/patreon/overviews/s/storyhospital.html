Each column answers a writer\u0027s question about their work in progress. These columns are focused on the craft and practice of writing. I don\u0027t tell you how to get an agent or quit your day job; I get right into the heart of the relationship between the author and the work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can read each column on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://storyhospital.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe Story Hospital website\u003c/a\u003e or right here on Patreon. And by becoming a patron, you\u0027ll get access to extra columns, an amazing community of writers, inspirational postcards, and much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Rose Fox and I\u0027m a lifelong reader with a special fondness for genre fiction. My parents are writers and I grew up critiquing my mother\u0027s manuscripts. I\u0027ve freelanced as a book reviewer, copy editor, journalist, and book editor. Now I\u0027m a senior reviews editor and copy editor at \u003cem\u003ePublishers Weekly\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0with more than 100 published book reviews and articles under my belt. I co-edited \u003cem\u003eLong Hidden: Speculative Fiction from the Margins of History\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0with Daniel Jos\u00e9 Older (Crossed Genres, 2014),\u00a0and I\u0027ve edited dozens of books for self-published authors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also passionate about teaching and helping people. I volunteer as a mentor for teen writers and spent three years as Readercon\u0027s program chair, helping to create a world-renowned conference program that inspires and energizes hundreds of writers and readers every year. Teaching is my favorite part of book editing, too. Nothing makes me happier than that moment when I make something click for a writer or help them fall in love with their work all over again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd lastly, I\u0027m a novice author. I\u0027m making very slow progress on two novels at the moment, and learning a tremendous amount about myself and what writing feels like from the inside. So I know just how hard it is to wrestle with a story, and I want to help make it easier for you and all my readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI need help from the Story Nurse!
