With all this new goodness at our disposal, we\u0027ve been able to achieve the following concrete results:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-GUESTS who have or will soon appear on our shows include - Soren Bowie, Katy Stoll, Cody Johnston, Tom Reimann, David Bell, Maggie Mae Fish, Katie Willert, Robert Evans, Starline Hodge, Greg Burke and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Writing on our first VIDEO PROJECT has begun, a set of sketches called \"Disney Owns You,\" (more details below) that\u0027ll become available whenever we are able to afford the crew to film it, hopefully 6-8 weeks from the time of this writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Our first PODCAST BONUS SERIES which will be available to Cool Beans only and is entitled \"The Coen Brothers Bros.,\" is in production. It will be like Kurt Vonneguys, but for the works of Joel and Ethan Coen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-We are approaching the financial bandwidth we\u0027ll need to support our first show that we pay for out of the Small Beans budget. That means either a new podcast series on the Small Beans feed or maybe even a video series from a Cracked alum if our Patronage stays steady or increases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat new members can help us accomplish next...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal now is to continue not only to expand our current footprint (so, more of the great Small Beans content we\u0027re making, but made by our friends for a fair wage and released through our network), and achieve the kind of production values on our video projects we had come to be known for at Cracked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat last bit is an expensive hill to climb--hence the new goal--but we\u0027d love to see Small Beans get to the point of producing more visually ambitious series like \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_saLI-LH-VqV5QWYiR5kplcyyJKcaqTh\"\u003e8-Bits\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3A9F3320FD0DF7DC\"\u003eAgents of Cracked\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_saLI-LH-Vqa1PJ4AUPTvsNazP2paxLp\"\u003eWelcome Back Potter\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_saLI-LH-Vrju_59gsumjnELpiZfTiZV\"\u003eWe\u0027re Not Alone\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSPOILER ALERT: \"Disney Owns You\" will have no props or costumes and take place at a conference table. It will still be freakin\u0027 hilarious, but we can\u0027t keep that up forever without a regular video budget to get us sets, actors who aren\u0027t Michael, and better cameras than we own. Increased membership will provide us a bigger canvas to fulfill ourselves artistically, and perhaps more importantly, allow us to HIRE our friends (see guest list above, imagine more), which means they will get MONEY from us and be able to PAY RENT.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTell a friend about us or one of our shows! Rate or review! Join up if you can afford it! Help restore our video team to its former glory, and show Cracked\u0027s corporate overlords at E.W. Scripps what a doofus move it was not to support these people!\u003cbr\u003e",

Thanks to our fabulous patrons, we have released some 50+ pieces of content, filmed two web-series, launched six podcasts, and formed a truly lovely little community here. What\u0027s next?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomething we think you\u0027ll enjoy. Something we think you\u0027ll be very excited about. Something we\u0027ve been mentioning in places, but are ready to make priority number one. It\u0027s time for DOWN TIME. What is Down Time?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA show. A monthly show where friends sit around obsessively analyzing pop culture, movies, TV and the internet, complete with fan theories, searing pop culture insights, hilarious banter and clip packages to die for. If this reminds you of some other show you may have liked, that\u0027s acceptable to us in the extreme. Why do I keep ending every paragraph with a question?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Comedic Rule of Threes. Anyway: writing, shooting, and editing twelve episodes of Down Time, not to mention the lengthy idea-generation process and clip logging, is a tall order, but no one knows how to do it better than us. With the above goal reached, we\u0027re confident we can fully commit to an episode a month, every month. If you know someone who would find that news exciting, please, share it with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDISCLAIMER: Casting Notes! We would never want to bean-and-switch you, so if your only reason to want to patronize us is to see Daniel O\u0027Brien in this show again, know that that\u0027s not going to happen. He\u0027s taking a break from acting. Soren will also likely not be a part of this project, as he\u0027s busy with life and work. Swaim is in. Willert is in. Stoll is in. Johnston is in. And we\u0027ll be adding more faces to the cast as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is all. Love from the Beans.\u003cbr\u003e",
