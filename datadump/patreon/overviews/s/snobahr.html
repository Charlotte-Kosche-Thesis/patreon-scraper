    "summary": "I have been reading tarot cards since 1974, when Santa Claus \nleft a \u003ca href=\"http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/rider-waite/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRider-Waite tarot deck\u003c/a\u003e in my stocking. From that deck, I learned how to read the \n\u003cem\u003eCeltic Cross\u003c/em\u003e spread. Later, in my 20s, I received the \u003ca href=\"http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/robin-wood/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRobin Wood Tarot\u003c/a\u003e, \nand started doing \n\u003cem\u003e5-card spreads\u003c/em\u003e, and then \u003cem\u003e3-card spreads\u003c/em\u003e. They are nice, quick \nspreads that offer a lot of information. I\u00a0have a \nvariety of decks available to me, from which I am offering readings. They are discussed in my posts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nI am also available for single readings, through \n\u003ca href=\"https://squareup.com/store/tarot-by-amanda/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSquare\u003c/a\u003e, so that you can see how I read before committing to a monthly subscription. (Use coupon code\u00a0TAROTPATREON for 15% off your Square purchase!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll readings are kept confidential.\u003c/strong\u003e I will occasionally post public readings, but those will be general readings, not for any specific person, usually. Your individual readings will be photographed with your name and reading number hand-written upon it, to show you that your reading is \u003cem\u003eyours\u003c/em\u003e. All readings are kept on my hard drive and on a cloud server, so that if you need another copy, I can email it to you promptly.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nAs I get more comfortable with the Patreon format of readings, I will make more slots available. I have limited slots right now, because I want to be certain I\u0027m giving each reading the individual attention it deserves. This also allows you, the Seeker, to have an idea of when you will receive your reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdded August 1, 2017:\u003c/strong\u003e If I have to schedule a week off, those who have weekly subscriptions, that would otherwise miss their reading day, will receive a reading of the next card tier above what they are subscribed to. So, Single Card subscribers will receive a 3 Card Reading; 3 Card subscribers will get a 5 Card Reading. 10 Card subscribers will get their 10 Card reading, and any other reading type I offer, either for themselves or for a friend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhen you become one of my Patrons, please let me know which deck you\u0027d prefer that I read from.\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eYou can ask that I switch decks for the following month, or I can continue with whichever your current deck is. I will also let you know when a new deck is available to be read from.\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis is for entertainment purposes only, and not to take the place of a licensed lawyer or doctor, and that by subscribing to this, the subscriber is stating that they are 18 years or older.
