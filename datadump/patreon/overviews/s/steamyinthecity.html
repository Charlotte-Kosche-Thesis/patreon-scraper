    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eOur Story...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Kristina Tolleson. My husband, Scott and I started making music videos\u00a0in 2011 with our talented musical friends for our\u00a0YouTube channel \"SteamyintheCity\". At the time, neither of us knew how a career based around creating music videos for free was actually possible. One day we just decided that if we wanted to spend our lives do something that we loved the best way to get there was to just start doing what we love now as much as possible and workout the details as we go. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo years later, on May 4,\u00a02013, we officially launched the SteamyintheCity Music Collective with our first ever live streaming concert. This was a huge milestone moment for us because it was the first event we produced in our\u00a0newly leased 3,300 sq.ft. production studio in Long Beach, California. The concert was a huge success, and it was the first time we opened our doors to the public so it was awesome to see the place packed out for our musicians.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://steamyinthecity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/SteamyintheCity-Music-Collective-Patreon-Photo-Jan2014.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then we\u0027ve found ways to use the studio to accomplish all\u00a0sorts of creative things, like filming music videos, regular live streaming Stageit concerts, photo shoots with our artists, even teaching/learning sessions with our collective members about all of the different skills needed to produce music \u0026amp; videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year is all about giving you more! More music videos, more concerts, more photos, more artists, more of everything we do. We believe that the best kind of art comes from authentic collaboration, and so we have held strong to our policy of not charging artists any fees to work with us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can imagine, running a \"free\" music collective creates some significant funding challenges. Our first thought was to run a Kickstarter campaign, but their model of raising one large chunk of money for a specific project doesn\u0027t really fit into what we are trying to do. Plus the time limit would ultimately force us to put everything else we do on hold while we promote the campaign which didn\u0027t feel very authentic to who we are.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEarlier this year we were introduced to Patreon by it\u0027s\u00a0creator Jack Conte who, like us, is an artist creating music videos for his YouTube channel \"PomplamooseMusic\". We\u0027ve been following Jack Conte and Pomplamoose for years, they have been an incredible inspiration. They are always thinking two steps ahead of us, which is awesome because over the past year they\u0027ve introduced us to some pretty incredible things that have become a big part of what we do. Possibly the best thing they\u0027ve not only introduced to us, but created for us, is Patreon a website designed to raise funding for artists in a\u00a0100% authentic way that supports artists in producing more content and not less. It also allows us to connect on a more personal level with each of you in the activity feed and through different patron rewards.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is like a Kickstarter, but instead of raising lots of money for one big project, donors or patrons, commit to giving small bits of money for every piece content we release. In our case, we will be releasing music videos on our YouTube channel SteamyintheCity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return our patrons will receive access to all sorts of exclusive content like intimate Patron only Stageit Concerts with their favorite artists from our collective, behind-the-scenes content from our shoots, on demand performances from the Stageit Concerts we produce, galleries of extra photos from our shoots, story boards, google hangouts, video, audio, \u0026amp; photography production tips \u0026amp; tutorials, and a whole bunch of other great rewards.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to become a Patron of the SteamyintheCity Music Collective?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo become a Patron today, just read through the patron rewards below for our different levels of Patronage. Then enter the amount you would like to donate to us for every music video we create and release on the SteamyintheCity youtube channel. We currently average about 1 music video per month, sometimes more, but another great thing about Patreon is when you become a patron you can enter a maximum donation amount per month so that you never go over your budget. Even on months that we release 2 or 3 music videos. It\u0027s also super easy to cancel your patronage at any time so there is no long term commitment required. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, to authentically honor your ongoing donations the only videos that count towards Patreon will be creative videos that take us time to produce and not our vlog style content such as \"Stageit Song of the Week\", announcement videos, or behind the scenes videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe feel that Patreon is one of the most incredible internet inventions ever created for dream chasers like us, and we are absolutely thrilled to be a part of it early on. We are incredibly excited to meet all of our future patrons and connect with each of you on a more personal level and hear your own dream chasing stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKristina Tolleson\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCo-Founder of the SteamyintheCity Music Collective\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
