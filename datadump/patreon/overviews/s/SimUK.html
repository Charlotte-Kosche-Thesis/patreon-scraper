I even had enough time to;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003ea) recall that a number of people recorded having broken their noses on the impact of hitting an airbag...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eb) So I was trying to decide if I should deliberately try and straighten my nose using the expected break by turning my head to the correct angle?? \u00a0I finally opted to turn my head to the right side, relax and let the airbag take the fall. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA smart choice, or so I thought. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately for me the airbag did not deploy and I hit my head hard on the wheel, at least that\u0027s what I think happened because I was instantly knocked out and only awoke to a somewhat apologetic lady driver knocking on my passenger window. \u00a0(Just as an indication of how drunk she was she offer to take me to her brothers restaurant by way of an apology! \u00a0That was immediately after the accident!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I didn\u0027t break any bones or even lose a single drop of blood, but my brain had taken an almighty whack and 8 years on I still feel the effects of that day. \u00a0I developed speech, behavioural and cognitive issues and PSTD. \u00a0It has compromised my capacity to work in any industry and has impacted upon my family and my own day to day life. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016 I turned to Youtube as a way to make a little money and primarily to help me adapt to these life changes and make my way through to the other-side, it\u0027s a struggle but I have made a little progress each day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll tell you all about it one day.\u003c/div\u003e",
