My mind is different than 99% of the population, and I guess high function schizophrenia is a thing. My clients tell me I am the most interesting Uber driver, so I guess that would make me the most interesting host for a select audience. I am fighting a lot of negative stigma since I have a schizophrenic mind: most the negative stigma I get now a days is from Mods on reddit after posting on spiritual forums. I have to be mindful of my situation and do something unheard of. \u00a0The driver of the year is schizophrenic. \u00a0My default picture says \"Another sixty hour work week.\" It is rare for people with schizophrenia to work more than 20 hours a week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

Thanks for your money you piece of shit.\" I believe in spreading positive vibes and spitting on those who treat me like I am less just because I am not another neurotypical following a linearly\u00a0progression. I do not have a local bias like the one explained in that book. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo sum it up why this is different than everyone else is that the ring leader at the end gave me due respect after finding the 12 keys of the priesthood in my brain. 12 keys of the priesthood? What does this mean to non-Mormon\u0027s? I associate weird things together being a schizophrenic, so I kinda believe I have 12 markers in my brain that may spark genetics into a new dawn. My mom studies genetics in college before the government shut down her program. God damnit, my brain\u00a0hallucinates different than what is mentioned in the book The Autistic Brain: thinking across the spectrum.

This opens a door for brain science in the sense that\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mean, insanity is doing the same thing again and expecting different results. This goal may usher us into a new age of understanding the power of the brain.
