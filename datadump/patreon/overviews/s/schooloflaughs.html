I want to keep it that way, but also offer you a way to\nsupport us if you have found value in the content we provide. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nA listener recently told me about Patreon and\nI totally love this concept.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn a nutshell, in exchange for a small\nRECURRING monthly donation of your choice, you gain access to many extra\nopportunities to interact with the show.

Time is a limited resource, and each episode\ncan take up to 5 hours to record, edit, mix, produce, tag, create art, write\nshow notes, provide links, upload, post and promote. Unfortunately, this is all\ntime I am spending away from developing my own comedy and booking shows.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe funds would\nhelp offset the costs associated with time incurred producing the show, and at\nthe same time give you more of what I believe you find valuable. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHOW MUCH?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u2019s up to you, we average 4 episodes a month and\nare hoping you feel like the information is worth at least $1.25 a show. So, a\nmonthly pledge of $5 is our hope. More is great, less is still helpful. If we\nreach the target of 200 patrons (which is just a fraction of the overall\nlistener downloads per episode), I think we would be on track to continue the\nproduction of the show and creating opportunities for you to grow as a\nperformer and\u00a0see definite returns\non your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e"
