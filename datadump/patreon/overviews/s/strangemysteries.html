That\u0027s why I\u0027m offering things, which, so far, I believe you all want here on Patreon for pledging money on a monthly basis. \u00a0 These things will not only give you power in making some decisions, but will help me understand what other things you want.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eThat\u0027s where Patreon Comes In!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, I\u0027ve been trying to figure out what you all want with surveys, polls, questions, and comments.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eIn terms of videos, this is what I can surmise you all want. \u00a0I\u0027ll be running polls to see what else you all want.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nYes, they are kind of generalized, but these are the things I am going to improve with pledges. \u00a0Hopefully you\u0027ve already had a taste of these things in the what happens when you die video and bonus video....and I\u0027d like to go beyond the quality found even in those.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is the information I\u0027ve acquired.\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n1) \n\t\u003cstrong\u003eBETTER TOPICS\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nI acquire these with polls, and user submissions. \u00a0This has worked well. \u00a0I have a bunch saved up and ready to go actually.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nAnyone who becomes a Patreon by pledging at least $2 (joining the \"Go Deeper\" Bonus Video Segment tier) has shown me that they are serious about Strange Mysteries, and therefore has more credibility if they took a poll. \u00a0They will be able to cast their vote in the general polls I can host here on Patreon, which I will take more seriously than the results of a generalized poll. \u00a0Also, they will be able to tell me what other perks they might want on Patreon. \u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\"What Might be Beyond the Edge of the Universe\", \"5 Questions that Question Reality\", \"Will Time End?\" \"What Happens When You Die,\" Space Topics - these are example ideas and topics I\u0027ve acquired from you all that have been rated highly.
