HAVE YOUR OWN CHARACTER CREATED AND COMPETING ON THE SHOWS!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years now the Sterling Eyes lads have created magnificent content for your audio pleasure, keeping you amused on buses whilst you cry tears of joy at the thought of zombie Miss Elizabeth being seduced by Dead Eyes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow it\u0027s time to give back for those harrowing mental images! (We\u0027re joking - kinda!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve enjoyed the show for the last few years and would like for us to keep creating consistent content then please take a moment to pledge as much or as little as you\u0027d like to our patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show takes a lot of time to produce and we love doing it but to keep us on the air on a regular basis costs money and we need to recoup at last a small portion of our costs. (also Dead Eyes desperately need a new headset so I don\u0027t have to edit his breathing out of every show!!!!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe massively appreciate everyone of our listeners, subscribers and fans who have stuck by us through some rocky times (WCW, Dead Eyes car mishaps, etc) and anything you can pledge would be a massive help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur show is a foul mouthed (not suitable for children!), often off-top rant through the history of wrestling. We have recorded somewhere between 6-7 series covering everything from the dawn of the WWF, WCW, ECW, and the current day product and you can access them all with a $10 subscription or just listen of all of our new shows for only $4 a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also talk about a lot of random subjects including video games, tv shows, movies and why Dead Eyes cars just won\u0027t work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT THE $1 SUBSCRIPTION OPTION THAT WE CAN\u0027T REMOVE WILL NOT GIVE YOU ACCESS TO ANY OF THE OLD OR NEW SHOWS.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
