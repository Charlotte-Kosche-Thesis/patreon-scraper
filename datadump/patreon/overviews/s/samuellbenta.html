    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSamuell Benta, from London UK. Welcome to my Patreon page! Where do I start? Well, originally I started off as an Actor, but as a young Black man in Entertainment I was forced into content creation out of frustration with stereotyping roles (especially of a negative nature towards males). I started to create content with the purpose of healing relationships, and raise positive self-awareness. Why? Because we\u0027ve all been through pain in our lives, yet I believe through that we can find our purpose and do good, if we allow ourself to. I want to aid others around the world, and show them a whole new type of Entertainment, Web/TV Shows-Film that inspires and is innovative.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAfter 6 years of hard work, my Webseries \u2018All About The McKenzies\u2019 was put on ITV last year as a pilot (Main UK TV Broadcaster), which was enthusiastically received by most (including children, as it\u0027s family friendly). However, due to the Controller of the Network change before things were properly put in place, they didn\u0027t fulfil an entire season, leaving me at a loss of what next steps to take. Patreon info was sent to me recently as a link by someone in the industry, and suddenly I saw a way where I can get back into making the Show, and assist with other projects for people to be Educated-Entertained = EDUtainment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/fEXCub/AATM_BOSS.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can you help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy donating as much/as little as you want-can, this will allow for the resources to make content consistently with others who are passionate about doing good things in the world through Media. Although initially reluctant to use the CrowdFunding platform, I feel it\u0027s necessary now as too many politics go on within traditional forms of Entertainment (such as being told my Show was \"Too Black for TV.\"), and being let down by Networks has lead me to turn to the public for assistance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich, in a way is better because aside from maintaining Editorial control (rather than allow Networks to dictate), the public can then contribute to what I create and enable us to grow together as a community. After all, by paying Taxes etc we inevitably pay to watch what\u0027s on TV/Networks anyway. \u003cstrong\u003eThis route simply cuts out the middle man so to speak, and gives the public more power to decide what type of material they want to watch with their loved ones\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon will allow me to bring Shows-Films directly to you, with ever increasing Entertainment Production value. Unfettered by corporate owners or obligations to someone who may think they know it all and/or what the people want, through this platform we all have a more powerful voice. Pay nothing towards the creation of something if you don\u0027t believe it benefits you in some way, and if you do, then decide to stop being a Patron - no hard feelings. I want you to fund this Mission-Vision because you \u003cstrong\u003ewant\u003c/strong\u003e to fund to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/nQVnfG/S_Benta_i_DJ_Photography_63.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does your money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nProduction costs! Most who watch Films in Cinema and/or TV don\u0027t necessarily give thought to the budgets that go behind such Shows. The average pilot for TV is $2mil! Big budget aside, the advantage I have is my crew\u0027s talent which allows us to make top notch content on smaller resources. Your money will be going on Production, staff, use of office space etc and equipment (as even the use of locations cost). The Vision I am building requires consistent cashflow for budgets to keep the cogs turning for Production, and to operate like a Network does with the difference being,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e the public are the Commissioners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I\u0027m just \u003cem\u003estarting\u003c/em\u003e my Patreon journey I \u003cem\u003eunderstand\u003c/em\u003e it may \u003cem\u003etake time\u003c/em\u003e to reach the big budget money to make the \u003cem\u003ereal\u00a0\u003c/em\u003emagic happen, so in the meantime I want to show you every step of the process of everything I\u0027m doing now leading up to the desired goal, and will keep you entertained until the big funding increases, as more people become aware of this page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI realise this funding goal may take time, but with your support and raising awareness of this campaign, anything is possible as the true power IS in the people-audience = \u003cstrong\u003eYOU!
