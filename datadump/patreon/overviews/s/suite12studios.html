    "summary": "Light chat turns into conversation. Conversation turns into discussion. Once a discussion is good enough, a podcast might be found. When we started podcasting years ago as a fun idea to share our thoughtful rants out into the world, it was something done very casually. We had to stop our fun new hobby because life (kids, marriages, new jobs) got in the way. Now we are back living in the same city and able to continue enjoying our hobby, and wish to grow and expand our conversation even further. We love talking about movies, TV shows, videogames, comic books, everything nerd culture! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imgur.com/RGF1bpu.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur weekly \"\u003cstrong\u003eBurgers and Fries\u003c/strong\u003e\" podcast will dive into an episodic review of Bob\u0027s Burgers, one of the best animated shows of the last decade. Every Thursday we will release a review, in order with a rating at the end, so you can keep up with where we are!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imgur.com/L42HtLp.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \"\u003cstrong\u003eState of\u003c/strong\u003e\" podcast is our flagship podcast, where we discuss anything in the Zeitgeist and how it\u0027s faring in this current world. Released bi-weekly, enjoy our rants and raves from videogames to movies, from actors to creators. Nothing is out of bounds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imgur.com/xpB7Mtt.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen it\u0027s time to relax, go ahead and watch a shitty movie with us! \"\u003cstrong\u003eIn Defense of\u003c/strong\u003e\", probably our most fun podcast, is where we watch a movie from the IMDB \"bottom 250\" and see if there\u0027s anything to defend about the movie. Only the worst of the worst, but full of fun laughs, can there be a diamond in the rough?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a backer and you will not just be helping us maintain our ability to give you great content, you will also be helping us fulfil our plans for expansion. We have so many great ideas that we don\u0027t have the resources for. We appreciate your help! Any donation you give would go a long way to help us continue to do something that we truly enjoy."
