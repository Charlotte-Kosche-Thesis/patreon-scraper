If you\u0027re reading this it means I\u0027ve taken the plunge and am starting a Patreon. Crazy.\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve worked both professionally and personally in the games scene for a few years. You might know me from a \u003ca href=\"https://scarletcatalie.itch.io/transit\"\u003equeer walking simulator\u003c/a\u003e released this summer, or from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iQPHja27g4\"\u003eone of my talks at VideoBrains\u003c/a\u003e where I talk about Queer Stuff (tm), The Source Engine, and playing Thumper so hard my thumb bled. I want to take the next step and put all of my focus into making tiny, experimental games, which is where YOU come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Will I Be Making?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eRight now, I\u0027m making more small games on the regular. These might be small experiences in tools like Flickgame, Bitsy, Puzzlescript, Twine, or Unity - depending on the goal of the project. Ideally, I\u0027ll try and get one of these out every month at most, and host them on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://scarletcatalie.itch.io\"\u003emy Itch.io page\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ll also be continuing to make custom map content for games as I see fit. What I\u0027m really trying to make with these projects, though, are simply unique experiences that are weird, queer, interesting and stylish.\u003cbr\u003e\nSo far, I\u0027ve been releasing games for free, with some pleasant success with titles like TRANSIT and SNEKK netting enough to pay a couple month\u0027s rent. These games will continue to be released for free: what I\u0027m looking for from you guys is the support to sustain myself, while I make games for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DE3kOtyXcAEZjoz.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon? Why now?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI recently moved back down to my family home in Edinburgh, after finishing University, and there\u0027s a few reason\u0027s I\u0027d like to get this rolling. In moving, I lost access to a fantastic work-space, and finding good places to work and focus has been a pain. Losing independence has also been pretty awful, after making a lot of progress living in Dundee. With Patreon, I\u0027d like to get some of that self-sufficiency back.\u003cbr\u003eBeing less of a burden on my parents and my partner would be a huge help, frankly, as would fuelling a horrendous coffee habit. If this exceeds expectations, I\u0027d love to be able to move out. Really, too, motivation - knowing that folk are out following my work would be a huge push to Create Good Content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve worked in studios for years, but the last few months in trying to find career building work has been rough. What I\u0027d love to do, what I\u0027ve always wanted to do, is find ways to make creating queer, interesting games and games-adjacent content sustainable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DE3c-h5WAAAf7FR.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
