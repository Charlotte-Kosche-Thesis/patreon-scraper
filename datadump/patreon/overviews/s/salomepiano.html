    "summary": "Hi everyone! Thank you so much for stopping by my page and for considering to pledge!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a pianist from Switzerland, based in NYC. I was trained classically in Switzerland, Paris, London, and New York. \u003cbr\u003eI love performing, and even more than that I love performing with visuals such as video projections and lights. I believe the effect of music can be enhanced through the addition of visuals and can make a piece of music more accessible to the audience, especially when they\u0027re not too familiar with it. That\u0027s why I created \"Envisage\" a couple of years ago: a piano recital set as an audiovisual experience. \u003cbr\u003eApart from the classical repertoire, I\u0027ve recently gotten into video game music. I started playing with the video game music cover band Critical Hit a few years ago, which led to further adventures in that field, like touring through Europe and the US with my good friend Taylor Davis! I\u0027ve since released two video game and anime-themed piano albums (\"PLAY\" and \"Salichan - The Ghibli Album\"), and have also started to write my own arrangements for piano of the songs I like form video game and anime soundtracks. I love doing this and am so happy to be able to (in part thanks to my wonderful patrons!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so incredibly grateful to anyone who listens to my music, watches my music videos, and for every form of support. I couldn\u0027t do this without you and your contributions!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
