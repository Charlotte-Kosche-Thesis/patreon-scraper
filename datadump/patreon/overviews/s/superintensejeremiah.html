    "summary": "Hi! Super Intense Jeremiah here! I started the Project Lilac\nseveral months ago, creating a smart phone based top-down third person shooter.\nI\u2019ve been working as a software and optical engineer for three years and I recently quit my job thus to have more time spent on this project. \u003cbr\u003eI had better feelings about this game as longer I\nspent time on the plots, graphics, game magnetisms, and the core level designs. As a\nhard-core gamer ever since mid school, I had gradually come up with my own\nthoughts and tastes for what a decent game should be. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nInspired by Dark Souls franchise and Bloodborne, I came up with\nmy own vision of creating a mobile version of an innovated Soul/Bloodborne styled game,\nand planned to take full advantage of nowadays smart phones\u0027 graphic capabilities and unique functionalities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI thus decided to throw all my time and energy at this interesting idea, and with all your help, I believe, I will be able to make this\nhappen with a fairly short amount of time, introducing a pure \u201cnew DNA\u201d to our\nbeloved video game industry!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA\nCthulhu, but not a Cthulhu\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Inspired by H. P. Lovecraft, the story of \u201cSolitude\u201d took\nplace in Victorian London, immersed in a dark and mysterious atmosphere, our\nprotagonist Jeremiah is struggling between losing his sanity and facing the truth behind the reality. The very philosophy of Lovecraft is\nabout the fear of unknown, the story of \u201cSolitude\u201d however, took a twist from\nthis idea, and is about the fear of \u201cknowing\u201d: the more you have learnt the\nmore horrifying the world would\u2019ve been reviewed. Our protagonist Jeremiah has a unwilling gift: the more insight he gains, the\ndeeper the truth behind this physical world he would review, visually! The\ngame features different structures, enemy forms and aggressiveness based on the\namount of insight the player has, and also changes the surrounding and environment within the same level, players are able to \u201cactivate\u201d the insight anytime to\nalternate the geometry and path of the current level, and beware, the enemies will behave differently based on the activation of your insight, and its current amount.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA\nSoul Game, and Much More\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 I always had a love-n-hate relation with Dark Soul\ngames, it was extremely rewarding on one hand, and was quite frustrating on the\nother. It often happens when I spent hours farming for high level\nmobs to upgrade my character, then ended up with dying by one hit. Well, that happens not only because a hard-core game as it is, but also the sluggish control and lazy efforts it tossed on the character dynamics, which I use to believe\nthat they merely had their issue covered with a \u201cyou are supposed to die a lot\u201d\nexcuse. In Solitude, the game will be extremely punishing, but you don\u2019t need\nto ever concern about the timing, weight capacity, or the \u201cuseless\u201d\nhealth upgrades in end game. The gameplay magnetism will be optimized nicely, with an increased amount of \"invincible time\" dodging and rolling, offensive actions will be in a much faster pace, more importantly, no one uses a great sword in Victorian\nEra! Indeed, Jeremiah is a master of range weapons, and you will have a\ngrand access to different firearms including: revolver, postal, rifle, shotgun,\nand crossbow\u2026 But remember this: hunting from a distance for an extremely fast-n-aggressive foe doesn\u2019t grant you a lazy trigger happy moment! They will hit\nyou, and they will hit you hard!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA\nBloodborne, with no \"Blood\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI always had a good time performing transform attacks\nin Bloodborne, and in Solitude the weapon transformation will take a leap of faith\nfrom its predecessor, that says: most of firearms have melee versions of their\nown unique functionalities, and yes, some of the typical weapons still have a ranged\nsecondary version, such as a semi-auto sniper-rifle would have a \u201cfully loaded\u201d\ntransform, so you can charge it up for several times, and take a very powerful\nshot at your foe, which deals a massive amount of damage. But it never hurts to\nadd a short blade to your fancy-looking revolver with extra gears, if you choose\nto face a strong foe in a close quarter combat. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nMeantime, the health system will be completely removed\nfrom the root design of game, now your stamina is your health! Well, that doesn\u2019t\nmean by you can keep stay away from the mobs and breath real hard to get your\nhit points back like what we all do in CODs :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe health system, is now integrated with your\nstamina. Getting hit by a mob will drain a fairly large portion of your current\nstamina, and if your current stamina isn\u2019t enough to cover that hit, then the\nmax amount of the stamina will be damaged, which stays as long as you decided not\nto drink the \u201cTears of Jordan\u201d: and yes, that\u2019s what a \u201chealth potion\u201d is\ncalled in the \u201cSolitude\u201d, and it refills your stamina cap! But beware, the \u201cTears\nof Jordan\u201d does not only stand for its fancy name after the holy river, it could\nalso massively damage your foes in a fairly large area when you ran out of the\noptions for gaining an upper hand, and yes, the \u201cTears\u201d are pretty hard to find\nin the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA\nMobile Game, a \u201cReal\u201d, \u201cActual\u201d Mobile Game\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI always had issues against the current mobile game\ndesigns, where most of them did a poorly and lazy job on their control input. Admit\nit or not, they face-spammed the console controller on your smart phone screen and got away with it all the time! To me, they look more like a PC game with\npoor graphics on a much smaller screen. But a smart phone can do a lot more than that! Thus in Solitude, unique smart phone input\nwill be considered seriously: for instance, you can now load a firearm by shake\nyour cell phone, and keep \u201cthumb swipe\u201d for a faster loading or shooting (for\ncertain weapons of course!), and the little motor in your smart phone will also\nbe taken seriously: it will work as a \u201ctrigger reaction\u201d, as what a console\ncontroller does! (it is optional of course, for the sake of your battery!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eAn\nInnovation Never Ends\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAn innovation never ends! The Pateron is a journey of\nclashing of ideas, I will be always active and interactive, and I\u2019m more than\nhappy to hear from you guys for any good ideas or inspirations. As a gamer\nmyself, I am working on a very game that deserves all who work as hard, and\nplay as hard as all us gamers, for which reason, I sincerely need as much help\nas you may kindly provide!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nP.S: \u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor daily news and updates about my project, please follow me on Instagram at: \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/superintensejeremiah/\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/superintensejeremiah/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy Sincerest Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e"
