    "summary": "Hi! My name is Marie Tary, also known as ShadowsMyst online. This patreon was created to help support the creation of my two webcomics ,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.shiftersonline.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eShifters: Redux\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.brymstone.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBrymstone\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been creating comics for years, but these two have been my biggest efforts by far. Both have fantastically rich worlds with so many stories to tell, and I would like to keep working on them, but unfortunately I don\u0027t make any money off them. I\u0027ve always done them because I\u0027m passionate about them.\u00a0Each comic page takes between 4-8 hours to pencil and ink, another 3-4 hours to color (if Che does it. Double that time if I do it.), and another 2 hours to apply lettering and finishing touches like special effects. That\u0027s at least 9-14 hours of work per page! That doesn\u0027t include time spent writing/scripting. Some types of pages (action sequences for example) take longer to produce than others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, the time needed to produce these\u00a0has limited my ability to create them as time has passed and my circumstances have changed. I have had to put a lot more time into other paying work (commissions, design freelance) to make up the shortfalls in living costs and pay for unexpected expenses. The same goes for Che, who previously could donate time for free has had her circumstances change where she also needs to get paid for her work.\u00a0This has led to repeated hiatuses, which isn\u0027t what I want, and I know that\u0027s not what readers want either. But the reality is, unless this pays something, its a glorified hobby and when push comes to shove, hobbies get put on back burners when the chips are down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to change that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo be clear, both comics are online for FREE and will always remain FREE.\u003c/strong\u003e They are not going behind a pay wall, or anything like that. Even if this patreon doesn\u0027t reach the minimum goals, the comics will be updated, but ONLY as I can as a hobby. But there will be perks and bonuses for those who are willing to help support me to have the time to do them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, here\u0027s where you, awesome people, come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money from this patreon will go to help with my living expenses so I don\u0027t have to take on additional unrelated commission or design work, so I can focus on comics, as well as to pay my colorist, Che, for her time to work on coloring the comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDonor rewards will include early access to new pages, behind the scenes looks, random art, exclusive wallpapers, streaming, and other goodies as I work them out. Rewards may change from time to time. If there is something you want to see, message me!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are a fan of either comic, I hope you will consider supporting me to help get these comics back on track. If you would like to make a one time gift, or do not want to use Patreon but do want to support Shifters or Brymstone, I also accept paypal donations. If you email me, at shadowsmyst@gmail.com, we can work something out.\u003cbr\u003e"
