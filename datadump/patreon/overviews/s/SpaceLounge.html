    "summary": "My name is Zack Orr and I am a singer/songwriter on a mission. I am broadcasting a live performance of a different song (originals and covers) every day for a year. You can watch the video stream of the performances on your phone via the Periscope app (@SpaceLoungeProd). I also upload the HD versions to the Space Lounge Productions YouTube channel daily. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis year marks my 25th anniversary as a performing musician. I decided that I wanted to do something musical every day to celebrate. On April 7th, I saw an announcement about the live video streaming app, Periscope. I downloaded the app and played an original tune of mine called \u003cem\u003eThe Last Stage on Earth.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eThat day there was only one viewer. By the end of the second week, 100 people were tuning in to watch the song of the day. And the number of viewers just keeps going up! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe goal of the \u003cem\u003e365 Days of Song Patreon\u003c/em\u003e is to take a project that started at my home studio and transform it into an album. Every single patron will have a say in the songs that make it onto the studio album. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u2019s how it works:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- If you pledge $1/month you get access to the Patreon only feed and voting rights for the \u003cem\u003eSong of the Week\u003c/em\u003e. Each week, Patrons will vote for the song they liked the most. The winners will become one of the 52 official \u003cem style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003eSong(s) of the Week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0If you pledge $3/month you also get to vote for the \u003cem style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003eSong of the Month\u003c/em\u003e. The \u003cem style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003eSong of the Month\u003c/em\u003e candidates are the winning tunes from the \u003cem style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003eSong of the Week\u003c/em\u003e contests. The winners of the \u003cem style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003eSong of the Month\u003c/em\u003e contests will become the 12 tracks on the \u003cem style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003e365 Days of Song\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ealbum that I am re-recording with a full band!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMilestones\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e for this project are reached, the content I produce will be directly affected. Sure, upgrading the audio/video production quality will happen\u2026but what I am excited about is taking \u003cem\u003e365 Days of Song\u003c/em\u003e on the road. This project is unique because it gives me the opportunity to perform songs that evoke a place and time in the lyrics and music\u2026in the actual places, at the actual times.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are a couple examples: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I would love to play LCD Sound System\u2019s \u003cem style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003eNew York, I Love You But You\u2019re Bringing Me Down\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0with Manhattan as the backdrop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Or picture Prince\u2019s \u003cem style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003eManic Monday\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0performed while standing in a busy train station early Monday morning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNo matter how you like to listen to music, we have a \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eReward\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e for you.
