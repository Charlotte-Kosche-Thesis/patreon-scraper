Instead, I hope to create an underground world, where historical or mythic figures interact with fictional characters to create the histories that might have been.\u00a0 Some of the stories will be linked, others will stand alone, and the stories will span a range of genres.\u00a0 At this stage, all the stories will be in English.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe stories will be published every 4 weeks on my website, \u003ca href=\"http://www.storiesunderparis.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.storiesunderparis.net\u003c/a\u003e, with a minimum of 15 new stories to be published in 2018, in addition to the 42 stories that have already been published there.\u00a0 As the story network grows, readers will be able to navigate from story to story along the lines of the Metro.\u00a0 The station pages will also contain brief essays about the actual history of the station and the people or things it was named for.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy your stay in my alternate Paris.\u003cbr\u003e"
