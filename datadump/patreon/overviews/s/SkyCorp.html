The infection was pronounced and forever\n changed anyone it touched.  Victims often underwent significant changes\n to their libido, frequently becoming sex-crazed.  These glandular \nchanges sometimes caused dramatic shifts in patient\u2019s height, weight, \neven their gender.  In the most extreme cases, the infected lost their \nvery humanity itself as they devolved into monstrous animal-human hybrid\n creatures.  It was clear that dramatic steps needed to be taken to \nprotect our way of life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis contagion spread like few ever had previously.  With no cure in \nsight, the following year SkyCorp was awarded the Department of Defense \ncontract to create a quarantine zone for the infected.  The quarantine \nzone was hastily constructed, and with close partnership from the \nNational Guard, all infected were forcibly relocated.  To this day, \nSkyCorp continues the administration of the quarantine zone.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDue to this zone being a collection of largely underground facilities\n that were reappropriated for containment, the project has been \ncolloquially referred to as \u2018The Underworld.\u2019  While uninfected citizens\n are technically permitted to visit The Underworld, it is heavily \ndiscouraged due to the risk of exposure.  Still, occasionally a citizen \nwill need to enter regardless.  In that situation, we can only pray they\n will return human \u2014 or they\u2019ll become a permanent resident themselves.\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat is it?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eThe Underworld\u003c/em\u003e is a text based transformation game for mature audiences including \nerotic content such as: furry transformation, monstergirl transformation, gender transformation, oviposition, \nlactation, and \u003ca href=\"http://skycorp.global/game-content-and-chapter-summaries/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emuch more\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Along the way, you\u2019ll meet a wide \ncast of characters across the three factions that each have their own \nideology about how to deal with people different from themselves.  Your \nactions will determine which faction achieves victory, and by extension,\n the fate of humans and hybrids alike.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe game is a work in progress.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eQuotes\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u201cI love this game so far!

instance, they might show a chapter with only the first part of the chapter content.\u00a0 Saving may or may not be disabled for these builds, and they are not as well tested generally.\u00a0  They will contain sections of untested content, limited/missing instructions, empty rooms, broken text, or halting bugs.\u00a0\nAlso, I am not as fast at updating as other
