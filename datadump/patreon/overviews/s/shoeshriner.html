You inevitably prepare yourself for something with how you spend your time growing up; That something is adulthood. I spent that time drawing and watching cartoons, so those are the tools I find myself working with. The key difference, of course, is I\u0027m no longer playing with stix in Lovecraft country; I\u0027m in Beantown. A world where the stalks are higher and there\u0027s fruit to be picked, however much they and those who spend their lives counting them may stink. Despite the smell, these beans will provide the nourishment I need to grow and create music. And the more I eat, the more my days playing with stix will allow me to traverse the stinky stalks and perhaps one day make it a land in the sky where waiting for me will be a golden harp, one that will produce music completely free of stink.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e. . .\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the risk of sounding redundant, I\u0027ll just say that I\u0027m a broke art student who wants to create cartoony things, and in order to keep doing that, I need to pay off my living expenses. If my art can help me do that, it will be a very meaningful step towards becoming a self-sustaining being who can give back to the world and pay the amazing support and opportunities I\u0027ve been given forward.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThanks so much for your time; I\u0027ll make every bean I receive count!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-Matt Shoemaker\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
