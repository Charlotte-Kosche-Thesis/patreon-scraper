Two years later, in a distant patch of space, a mysterious\nexplosion kills nearly the entire crew of the science vessel Starship Iris. The\nonly survivor is Violet Liu, an intrepid, sarcastic, terrified biologist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut as Violet struggles to readjust to life after the Iris, questions\nabound. Was that explosion really an accident? If not, just what is going on?\nAnd why does every answer seem to get more bizarre and more dangerous?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf Violet and her newfound allies want to untangle the\ntruth, they\u2019ll need courage, brilliance, and luck\u2014and honestly, a couple of\ndrinks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nThe Strange Case of Starship Iris\u003c/em\u003e is a show about outer\nspace, survival, espionage, resistance, identity, friendship, found family,\nromance, and secrets. (Also, there\u2019s jokes.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat brings you to Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt is very important to me to release the show for free. However, if I want to tell this story right (and I do), it\u0027s gonna need a sizable cast. I don\u0027t know my actors in real life; I can\u0027t ply them with baked goods or pay them in favors. \u003cem style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eIf I can\u0027t fund the actors, I can\u0027t make the show. \u003c/em\u003eIt\u0027s that simple.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI paid for the first episode myself, from compiling money my grandma gave me for a few different special occasions. But frankly, I only have so many birthdays (and so many grandmas) so that is just not a reliable funding model.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m new to Patreon; how does this work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou pledge to pay a certain amount of money whenever a new episode comes out. You\u0027re only billed once that new episode is available. And in return, you access cool bonus content!

So pledging at the $2 level would only cost you $14 over the course of the whole first season; about the price of a single movie ticket in Chicago. All in all, a very affordable way to become a patron of the arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWait, would there be a second season?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepends on the response to this season!
