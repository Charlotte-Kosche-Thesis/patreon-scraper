    "summary": "Growing herbs, making magic on an urban farm in Nashville, TN\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFarming and plant magic are my passions, both gifts I learned from my great- grandmother. I grew up with her in my life every day. She taught me the importance of growing your own and using the gifts from the earth to heal. I remember making my first poultice with her, and eating poke salat every spring.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2010, my bones were aching to reconnect with nature after spending many years at a desk job in the natural foods industry. We started our first garden, got some chickens, and started making all our families skin and body care needs that year. It was an amazing year of learning and excitement, but I wanted more! Soon after, I started studying in the Wise Woman Tradition and expanded to creating herbal teas, tinctures, and elixirs. Each year we grew and in 2015, I quit my day job to farm and practice my herbal passion full-time calling ourselves Double N Urban Farm and Apothecary. Over the past 4 growing seasons, we have offered a vegetable CSA, herbal CSA, attended farmers markets, and hosted workshops.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow we are on to our next chapter, we are turning our entire 1/2 acre vegetable farm into a 100% organic medicinal herb farm, and this is the birth of Stomping Ground Herbals. We will be offering more herbal wellness than ever before and my heart is bursting with joy!\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who know me personally, this has not been an easy journey. Medical expenses struck us hard in our first year of being full time farmers. This is something we have not been able to overcome, so our farm growth and my education came to a screeching halt. This is where you come in!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT YOUR SUPPORT MEANS:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e- I will be able to expand my farm\u003cbr\u003e-I will be able to host more workshops\u003cbr\u003e-I will be able to add free learning tools to my website\u003cbr\u003e-I will be able to go back to complete my next level of herbal training\u003cbr\u003e-I will have access to the supplies I need to keep creating\u003cbr\u003e-I will have a working vehicle to haul compost and get me to markets\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon felt like the best option for me because it allows me to engage directly with those who support me, and giving back feels so good!. You feed me, now I feed you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank each and every person who donates. Even the smallest amount makes a huge impact on where I can go with my farm and my business. I also want to thank everyone who has supported both my farm and my apothecary along this journey. You are the reason I am able to create plant magic for a living. You allow me to give and you make it possible for me to be excited about each and every day! Words cannot express my gratitude. Love to you all!\u00a0"
