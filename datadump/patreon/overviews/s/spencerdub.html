However, these days, money and the motivation to push \"publish\" are both tight. By becoming a patron, not only will you help support an independent content creator on the internet (that\u0027s me!), you\u0027ll also help me keep the lights on over at my blog so that I can keep writing cool things.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eJust who are you?\u003c/h3\u003e\nI\u0027m Spencer, a mental health counselor associate, board game geek, and occasional Guy Who Writes Things Online.

These days, with a little more practice under my belt, I prefer to write posts and essays that present thought-provoking ideas through an honest, personal lens. I\u0027m always learning and always practicing, and my blog is where much of that happens.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow often do you post?\u003c/h3\u003e\nWell, I used to aim for at least two posts a month, but that\u0027s... \u003cem\u003echanged.\u003c/em\u003e As I \u003ca href=\"http://spencerdub.me/blog/2017/02/writing-dried-up//?utm_source=patreon\u0026amp;utm_medium=patreon_description\u0026amp;utm_campaign=look_at_these_things_I_wrote\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewrote in early 2017\u003c/a\u003e, a number of stressors have jammed my creative feed, and I struggle to get damn near anything written.
