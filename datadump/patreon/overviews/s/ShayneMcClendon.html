They don\u0027t let me quit, they wait patiently when my \"day job\" sidelines me for weeks or months at a time, and they read/review/recommend my work.\u00a0It was one of my incredible readers who found this site and encouraged me to set up a profile. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons of the arts have been a true gift throughout history. We might never have gotten \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" if Harper Lee hadn\u0027t received a generous gift of one year\u0027s wages from Michael and Joy Brown that gave her the time and freedom to finish it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose who follow me have repeatedly wished for lottery winnings or an insane inheritance from a long-lost (and ridiculously loaded) relative so they can help me focus on my fiction.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI worked as a corporate bookkeeper for 15 years. When the company was sold and I was laid off, I was lost. Writing was a \"hobby\" for me since I was a child. Never anything serious. Not a \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ereal\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then it was.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work as a health content creator (articles, sales pages, books, and graphics) for several clients and I\u0027m dependent on that income to make ends meet (which can be further apart some months than others). They have the power (and have used it) to decrease my income dramatically with a single email. It\u0027s not much different than working a 9-to-5 job and getting laid off without warning. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery time my client work changes, my fiction suffers because I have to ignore it to find additional clients or devote all of my time to projects. It\u0027s part of real life and I\u0027ve been rolling with it for years but the ongoing stress is taking a toll. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027d love to see what could happen with more time to write fiction. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re new here and wondering what Patreon is about, it\u0027s pretty simple (and that surprised me).

Sustainable income that frees up my brain to write even more. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery couple of weeks, I do a Game Night with the members of my Facebook group. They post photos in the comments and I write a short story under it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn about an hour, I write an average of 5 short stories with random plots, from several genres. It helps ease the pressure in my head when I haven\u0027t had a chance to work on my own stuff for several days.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write fast. I write well. I have \u003cstrong\u003e2300 reviews on Amazon\u003c/strong\u003e and 94% are 4-star (6%) and 5-star (88%). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t put money into advertising, I don\u0027t hire editors, I stopped going to book signings, and I\u0027m still working for other people at least 6 days a week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to grow as an author.
