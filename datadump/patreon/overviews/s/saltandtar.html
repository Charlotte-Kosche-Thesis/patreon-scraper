It started like many other plans start I suppose, over a few cocktails. Before this night it was only an idea to \"one day\" build his dream boat. Our buddy convinced us that it was possible with the help of his parents\u0027 property which allowed us a place to construct since paying a boatyard monthly is a little out of our budget. We hadn\u0027t seen the property until we moved to the Pacific Northwest in February 2015 after selling our previous boat a month earlier. With a bit of cash from that sale we began raising a boat shed the following month. Six months later Rediviva was in full frame. Now a year and a half in we are joining Patreon with the goal I can quit my day job and focus entirely on making videos to support our project. What started out as Garrett\u0027s dream is now our reality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have lived our lives, for the most part, attempting to be separate from the norm. Determined to do things differently and on our terms. I believe we\u0027ve accomplished that. Now we look to the future and have realized the importance of sharing. Not just doing things for one\u0027s self and breaking even with the karma bank but to be ever-growing with a positive impact. The idea with Salt \u0026amp; Tar is to see and share the world and using the world-wide-web to do that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnjoy\u003cbr\u003e"
