    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWHO IS SINI?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi! I\u0027m a poisonous dragon who writes short stories in the furry fandom. I author short stories of a wide range of kinks\u2014I\u0027m not bound to a single pleasurer. Most of my short stories have been commissioned by other furries in the fandom.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY IS SINI HERE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMetaphysically, I exist to inspire readers\u2014to get them through the day-to-day schema. Whether I\u0027m writing my short stories or my novel, I want to throw a wrench in the status quo. You say to yourself, \"Well, that \u0027ll upset everything,\" but that\u0027s okay. I\u0027m gonna keep throwing wrenches, upsetting everything until I can throw a wrench so precisely at random that it fixes everything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuuut... if you just want to know why I\u0027m on Patreon specifically, I can answer that too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m juggling school, commissions and personal writing projects. Schooling is important to me (I want to get my degree), and commissions are important to me (I need to pay my rent). Most months I can break even between what I make from commissions and my rent, but sometimes the burden goes to my savings. Between school and monthly expenses, the balls I tend to drop most frequently are my personal writing projects. For that reason I have not made a lot of progress on editing them this year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHIS IS MY JOB\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI treat my craft seriously. I write professionally for a living. Will I work part-time/full-time shifts in other fields if need be? Most definitely. But I have my foot in the door, now, and while my rent is still low I have the opportunity to write for a living, to write a novel in hopes of it taking off. I can juggle, sure, but I don\u0027t want \u003cem\u003eScaleback\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0or my short stories to be the balls that get dropped.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBOTTOM LINE:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI respect you for reading this far. If you\u00a0decide to support me, thank you. I appreciate every penny of your patronage, and I\u0027ve got some goodies for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBOTTOM BOTTOM LINE:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s start throwing some wrenches.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBanner (c) the talented Blizzarderful.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://t.co/kiVUMz63dJ\"\u003etwitter.com/Blizzarderful\u003c/a\u003e"
