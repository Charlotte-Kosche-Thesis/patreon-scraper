Maureen spent many a semester building sets or painting back drops for theatrical productions, which lead her to gigs doing Interior Design for furniture design Companies.\u003cbr\u003eAfter the housing market crashed in 2008, it left Designers with shallow pockets and Maureen had to reinvent herself once again. her passion for color theory, anthropology, science, and form, were a solid foundation for a career doing hair.
