    "summary": "Hi Folks :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou always wanted to know who or what is behind \u003cstrong\u003eSYNTH ANATOMY\u003c/strong\u003e. It\u0027s just me, Tom. I\u0027ve been interested long time finding new music technologies in hardware as well as software. I love to take sounds into new worlds and to develop new sonic palettes. I don\u0027t limit my horizon to hardware (DAW Less music production) but include different innovative music software.So I can operate in my favourite hybrid world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSYNTH ANATOMY\u003c/strong\u003e is a music technology website based in Vienna which has its focus mainly on hardware and software which are strongly related to electronic music production. Founded in 2014, in the form of the \u003cstrong\u003eSYNTH ANATOMY YouTube Channel\u003c/strong\u003e that had the focus mainly on hardware and software sound demos. Since I wanted to tell the people not only in video form but also daily in the written about all the news in hardware, software (plugins,\u2026) and iOS, the official SYNTH ANATOMY news page was created in 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know, media finance is different today. Promotional banners are booking less and less as people prefer to use Ad Blockers. To continue my love of music technology as a profession, I invite you to donate at least $1 USD per month ($12 USD per year). The more people there, the more SYNTH ANATOMY can develop in the future (Coverage from trade shows, events, reviews, interviews, tutorials, exclusive deals...)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting in \u003cstrong\u003eJanuary 2018\u003c/strong\u003e, there will be at least one \u003cstrong\u003egiveaway a month\u003c/strong\u003e to thank you for your support. Plugins, iOS apps or even hardware will be give away to all the supporters. I would be very happy to receive your support already in January, because then the \u003cstrong\u003eNAMM 2018\u003c/strong\u003e will be where I will be on the site for SYNTH ANATOMY. So hotel, flight, etc. can be paid, I need your support. In addition, I can thus avoid that some videos are overcrowded with sponsorships.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANKS for your support. Here you will see your money is well spent :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
