    "summary": "Hello and thank you for visiting my Patron Page. My Name is Patricia, Patty for short and I am very excited to start this new venture. So far I have been on a twenty plus year journey with my art making. Through the years I have faithfully practiced creating work, examining many styles, and subjects and I have been exploring ideas about myself as a woman and mother. I have visually recorded the places that have had an impact on my childhood, painted my travels throughout Europe and the US and often explore issues that have to do with the planet and the creatures that live on it.\u00a0 The bulk of my work came from ideas that surrounded an amusement town that I grew up in which I had incorporated into my own life, memories, and imagination. In a Nutshell,\u00a0every painting I have done has become part of a visual diary of my life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOver time and more currently, I have traveled inward toward my own spirituality and meditative growth as a human. These newest works express happiness with colors that are bright and beautiful using new mediums and meditative breathing techniques with some sacred geometry mixed in.\u003cbr\u003eOverall, I must have created over five hundred works of art and have several thousand drawings yet to be put on canvas.\u00a0 I am\u00a0a hyperdiverse artist who has studied and mastered most mediums and love combining and using them in one way or another.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to share this contagious creativity, these great vibes and getting to know each one of you!!"
