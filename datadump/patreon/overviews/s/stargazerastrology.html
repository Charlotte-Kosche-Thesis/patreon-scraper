    "summary": "I\u0027ve been writing the STARGAZER\u00a0astrology column for eleven + years now and have enjoyed the relationship I have built with my clients and readers through the blogs I have had over the years. \u003cem\u003eSome of you may even remember the original incarnation on MySpace way back when\u003c/em\u003e. \u00a0(You can check out the current archives\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://stargazerastroatlas.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Stargazer forecast emphasizes evolutionary and psychological astrology. My goal is to help you actively use astrological phenomena to map out productive strategies for your life based on a linear cycle approach to lifestyle management, with a strong emphasis place on the Lunar Nodes. I write horoscopes that offer clear directives as to how to best utilize the current energies, and to suggest the learning potential that lies within so called challenging alinements. While we live in the moment, we must appreciate the choices we made in the past are what got us here today. Through reflection, we can learn and appreciate how the choices we make in the present will lead us into the appropriate future we seek, which we design through the decisions we make moving forward. Your life and success require your active participation to fully manifest. No singular astrological alignment will propel you to success or be the cause of your downfall unless you have collaborated to create that result. Astrology may be the map to that destiny, but your heart and intuition are the compass. You can\u0027t reach your destination until you trust yourself first and foremost.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more support I can get here, the more time I can devote to content creation and research, so if you enjoy the work, please become a member! Thank You :) ~STARGAZER"
