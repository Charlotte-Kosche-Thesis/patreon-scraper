Having seen living statues a few times before, she was drawn to their silent beauty, and quickly fell in love with this type of performance art.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fbos1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/21314834_1530973120294573_3627680185557276239_n.jpg?oh=c0918803bf29ba0afc2e8e6f7fb4f93f\u0026amp;oe=5A4F9E11\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter a few years of regularly busking as a living statue, she started blogging and having open dialogues about her experiences as a performer, giving people a look at the artist behind the art.
