My first\u00a0milestone goals are: literally laying hands on a graphic tablet (desperately needed) and upgrading my graphic software from an immemorial Ulead Photo Impact 7\u00a0 to an up-to-date Adobe Photoshop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy patrons \u003c/strong\u003e(\"love you, folks..!\" *high five to all of you*) \u003cbr\u003esupport me with a monthly pledge of 3 or\u00a05\u00a0$.\u00a0 As a\u00a0\"Thank You So Much !\"\u00a0they are rewarded with monthly updated patreon-only galleries, access to my patreon-feed, wip-folders, plus a monthly special reward they can\u0027t even watch on patreon, but get send to them via e-mail. This will be either one ore two pics ( category \"explicit scenes\" excluded here), often one of the pics will come with an additional wip-folder. Check my \"monthly reward\" posts for previews of the next months reward. \u003cbr\u003eThe monthly special reward I will send to you \u003cem\u003ethe month after you joined\u003c/em\u003e, as soon as I received my monthly summary from patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe archive\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e...will be added in August 2017. All pics that I \nreleased until August will be moved to said archive, which will be \nseparated into two areas: The \"level-three-archive\" and the \n\"level-five-archive\". From then on all pics I release in the future \n(August included) will stay in their basic tier (\"level-three-posts\" and\n \"level-five-posts\") for one month, before they, too, are moved to the \n\"archive\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat means: all the posts you see in the tagged folders on the left, are \"this month only\" \u003c/strong\u003e(except for \"monthly reward\" - wich is a non restricted advertising folder, and \"my feed\")\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll patrons who are not able to download the pics they want within that \nmonth (away from net) can write me a note, and I will send the pics to \nthem via e-mail as soon as they regain access to the net.\u003cbr\u003eThe only way to get access to the \"archive\" is via the \n\"level three archive\" and the \"level five archive\" - tier. Those will be added in August, too. The pledge for those will start with 6$ and 10$, but will rise in the future.\u003cbr\u003eNote that, like the \u003cem\u003emonthly special reward\u003c/em\u003e, I will send the archive to you via e-mail in the following month, as soon as I recieved my monthly summary from patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent state of what awaits you in the archive:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePinups \u003c/strong\u003e(level three) - \u003cstrong\u003e57 \u003c/strong\u003epics\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTentacles, snakes and the like \u003c/strong\u003e(level three) - \u003cstrong\u003e56\u003c/strong\u003e pics\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExplicit scenes \u003c/strong\u003e(level five) - \u003cstrong\u003e57\u003c/strong\u003e pics\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWip folders\u003c/strong\u003e (level five) - \u003cstrong\u003e113\u003c/strong\u003e folders\u003cbr\u003eplus the monthly special reward\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS.: just in case we do not know each other from DeviantArt - let\u0027s do something about it, shall we: \u003ca href=\"http://shazycrit.deviantart.com/\"\u003ehttp://shazycrit.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
