    "summary": "Hi everyone, I\u0027m SJ Segraves, and I\u0027m thrilled that you are checking out my Patreon page! For the past thirty years, I have been an Equity actor, a theater manager, an Artistic Director, and a director and educator for young performers. I\u0027ve spent a lot of my life in theaters. When I went back to school to get my masters\u0027 degree in education, I discovered a passion for a different kind of expression -- telling stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago, I started to write: stories of my parents and my family (some of which are hilarious), stories of my ex-husband and how and why I decided to leave my marriage, stories of working with a professional theatre company, stories of beginning a new life in a new city at 41 years of age, and many, many stories of the characters I\u0027ve met, experienced and loved throughout the years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter all these years of working in and around theatre, I have decided it\u0027s time to start telling my own stories in my own way, on my own terms. I have chosen Patreon as a way to share my stories with as many people who might enjoy and be entertained by them as possible. Also, Patreon will help discipline, sharpen and focus my writing, and help me move toward my goal of publication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo where do you come in? As the page says, Patreon means patronage. As a patron of my page, you will get stories! Many of them will be true stories, but I\u0027m going to change the names to protect my loved ones. Some of them will be fiction.\u00a0Most of it will be virtual, delivered electronically. If you back at the higher levels, some of it will be physical - you may even get some original artwork! I plan to release no more than two \"things\" a month. So whatever level you choose to support will be charged no more than twice per month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting this Patreon, you will be helping me to move forward in the next chapter of my creative life. If you are reading this, chances are you\u0027ve been part of my journey in some way. I can\u0027t wait to share some of the stories of my journey with you. And if there\u0027s something we shared that you\u0027d like to hear my take on, let me know! Thank you.\u00a0"
