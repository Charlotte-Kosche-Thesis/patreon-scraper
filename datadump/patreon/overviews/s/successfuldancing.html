    "summary": "This Patreon is my way of sharing my thoughts and concepts on what it means to be a successful dancer. I come from a dance crew named Poreotics and we have been performing and touring all over the world since 2007. We\u0027ve won numerous dance competitions including Hip-Hip International 2008 and 2009 (back to back USA champions) and America\u0027s Best Dance Crew Season 5. After dancing and making a name for ourselves, I\u0027ve realized how small our community is. How many dance crews and dancers can you name that are successful and have made it on their own? I\u0027m not talking about dancers that get hired by other people, I\u0027m talking about dancers that are their own bosses. This is something I really want to explore and discuss with you and take you on a journey understand the mind of a successful dancer. I will be focusing on interviewing all the successful dancers that I can think of and gather all of the knowledge into the form of blogs, podcasts, videos, and even a book! Please support me on this journey as it takes a lot of time and money to create these types of content."
