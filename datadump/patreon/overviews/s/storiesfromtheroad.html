    "summary": "Foreword:\u003cbr\u003eWho are we?\u003cbr\u003eI am an Englishman in Sao Paulo. Yes, it sounds like the title of a song but in fact I\u0027ve been here for nearly eight years teaching English to Brazilians. People are crazy to learn English here because they know it\u0027s a way out and a way to improve there lives. Brazil is still very much a third word country. It\u0027s a third world country that tries to hide it\u0027s difficulties behind shallow gloss. When you look behind the gloss you find a lot of poverty, crime an corruption. Young people suffer because they can\u0027t find a way out. Learning English and having it on your CV or resume is a simple way to improve your prospects. We throw a coin into a homeless mans tin in the street, we often buy food for people living on the streets here, so why not throw a coin into our hat and help us make a difference to another human beings life?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHELP less fortunate young people help themselves in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Is quality teaching an art? I think most talented teachers would say, absolutely yes! Good teachers are performers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTeaching is a lot like acting, a high-energy, performance profession that requires a person to act as a role model. Good teachers are highly motivated performers with huge personalities who are prepared to give and give.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo hi, my name is Steve Bradeley, Prof. Steve Bradeley as I\u0027m known in SP. \u00a0I\u0027m an English Teacher working with people in Sao Paulo. Time and time again I hear \"but I can\u0027t afford to learn English\" In Brasil, English is so important, it\u0027s a way out of poverty and a way to improve your life. Imagine being a young person in Sao Paulo looking to get a start on the ladder of life. Without English it\u0027s almost impossible to get out of the poverty trap we are all aware of. In Brazil it\u0027s ten times as hard as it is in modern Europe or the States. I\u0027ve been here for nearly eight years now teaching young people how to speak English and most drop out through lack of funds. I can\u0027t teach people for free it\u0027s impossible. So help me to develop my school and help some of these people get on in life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll we need from you is $1 or \u00a31 or 4.25 Brazilian Reals\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we want to do to be very very clear is to be able to offer subsidised English lessons to young people and teach them English even if they can\u0027t afford it. Once a student expresses a wish to learn, then money won\u0027t stand in his or her way. We have a way to \"SAY YES\" We believe that our campaign is a very unselfish campaign and is aimed at helping others create a life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat are the problems?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn SP there are many private English schools but they offer large crowded classes and are expensive and some are slow and ineffective. The minimum wage here is R$800 per month, the equivalent of \u00a3180.00 or $200.00 US per month. This is the minimum per week in the UK. State schools are very very poor and don\u0027t offer effective English lessons. So, the only chance is to pay high monthly school fees, if you can. Clearly, on \u00a3180.00 per month this is not possible if you come from a favela or poor working class family.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do we want to do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs already stated, it\u0027s simple. Offer poorer young people the chance to learn English in a good school . Free or subsidized tuition and learning materials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do we need?\u003cbr\u003eAll we need from you is $1 or \u00a31 or 4.25 Brazilian Reals\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need cash. regular income in small generous donations. The equivalent of \u00a380.00 British pounds or $100.00 US Dollars a month will pay for one student. He or she will then have nothing to pay. So..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$800.00 US per month will allow 10 students to study English with nothing to pay.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e$8,000.00 Dollars a month will allow 100 students to study free of charge. So we would like to have 800 Patreons all donating $1.00 per month. That would simply be amazing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne person with $1 doesn\u0027t sound like it would make a difference, but 1000 people with $1 can and would make a world of difference to a lot of young lives. In my life I received a lot of help from others, it\u0027s the same for everyone. So let\u0027s start here by helping and paying back and passing on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can help us in any way we will send you a free e-book every month as a reward. Plus photos of the people we meet and work with. Thank you in advance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll we need from you is $1 or \u00a31 or 4.25 Brazilian Reals\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eps...\u003cbr\u003eStudents can already apply for free learning materials and easy English reading materials by using this email and asking: freebooks@inglesozinho.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also help us by buying digital books from our shop. All proceeds go towards our cause.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.inglesozinho.com\"\u003ewww.inglesozinho.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I tell my stories to those who want to listen and I travel with my wife. I am an Englishman in all senses and my wife Renata is a Brazilian in every sense of the word. We are traveling the world writing our stories and making our vlogs when ever we can. Many prople can\u0027t afford English lessons especially younger people from favellas and the poorer communities of Brazil. Wouldn\u0027t be great if money didn\u0027 stand in the way if education, esoecially for young people hoping for a better life than their parents.",
