It was a 9 second long video of a city I made in SimCity in the shape of a man sitting on a toilet with the city sewerage system acting as his digestive tract .. my videos have come a long way over that last 3 years although, to be fair, my sense of humor hasn\u0027t ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo years ago I decided that I loved what I was doing and I wanted it to be my full time job.\u00a0There is simply nothing more rewarding than entertaining people and putting a smile on someone\u0027s face.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eSo why am I asking for help?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy channel is still relatively small and the simple fact is that I don\u0027t make enough money from Youtube to be able to carry on doing this full time. I\u0027m still a little way away from being able to live on just what I make from YouTube and so I\u0027m asking for help until I can make that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eFreedom and Quality\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want the freedom to create the best content possible without having to worry about how many views they will get or \u0027have I spent too much time on this video\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I\u0027m building something difficult or complicated or researching new ideas, I want the freedom to be able to spend 2 days or 3 days, or whatever it takes, on a single video if that\u0027s whats needed to produce something really special.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to keep improving the quality of my videos, in two ways:-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, by continuing to upgrade my audio and video equipment, which can be a very expensive business (just upgrading my video card would be $500+)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also like to reduce the amount of adverts shown on my channel specifically to remove any \u0027mid-roll\u0027 ads which I personally find annoying and I hate having to have them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewarding Your Support\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI often get sent free stuff by Developers and Publishers like game keys, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom now on, that stuff will be given away randomly to my supporters. Every Patron will be eligible regardless of the amount they pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also be setting goals that give you additional rewards when they are reached. Like setting up a voice server for all Patrons, again, regardless of the amount pledged.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eLiving The Dream\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI LOVE making videos, I LOVE playing games and most of all I LOVE entertaining people.
