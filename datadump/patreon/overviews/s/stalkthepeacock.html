I could never do this without you, and without you it just wouldn\u0027t be any fun.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal for our rock n roll tribe is to be able to release at least 1 new professional video each month (similar to the intro video). I\u0027m sitting on a catalogue of hundreds of originals (and a handful of cover songs) that I want to share with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn our new digital age, video content is a powerful outreach tool. For so many reasons, fresh video content is everything for artists. I am so excited to partner with you on this ongoing cinematic journey. Now, let\u0027s make some art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Which reward tiers have access to the exclusive content on Patreon?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA: All of them. Your rewards are \"in addition\" to having access to all of my exclusive Patreon content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Can I raise or lower my reward anytime I want?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA: You sure can!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Can I cancel at any time if I can\u0027t afford it anymore? \u003cbr\u003eA: Yes, absolutely! Anytime. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What happens when we reach our $500 monthly goal?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA: We\u0027ll be able to make our first acoustic video! Yay!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What happens when our monthly memberships start exceeding $500?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA: Good question! There are so many creative cinematic possibilities for a musical artist. For example, music videos with full production give an artist the chance for a feature on a network that\u0027s nationally syndicated. Full band live show production videos are great for showing talent buyers and venues that we\u0027ve got the goods for that $10,000 gig. And, we\u0027re all about getting the most out of the content we\u0027re creating. An example of that would be mastering and releasing the audio from these videos in the form of an EP on iTunes. When memberships begin to exceed our $500 monthly minimum, we will have the freedom to explore opportunities in the studio and on film that will only enhance our mission to continue growing this tribe.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "If you think Wonder Woman is a badass, then you\u2019ll definitely want to meet Sarah Peacock. 1.2 million miles, 2,800 shows, and fourteen years of nonstop crushing it while flying solo is one heck of a road trip. Sarah Peacock bridges gaps between Country, Blues, Americana, and Rock-N-Roll. Her music is raw, truth telling, and fiercely unique. Essentially, at all times, Peacock is victoriously defeating the forces of evil with glorious Amazonian strength and valor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHeld hostage by a record label at 21, the troubadour life came with a rude awakening for the young Georgia native. Peacock made her home in a \u201892 Volvo with her dog and a guitar, and for nearly seven years earned a living in the corner shadows of American dive bars. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tables turned in 2011 when an anonymous fan helped her buy out her recording contract. Since then she has released six albums, winning multiple awards for her songwriting. \u201cHurricane\u201d won \u003cem\u003eBest Song\u003c/em\u003e in the \u003cem\u003eAmerican Songwriting Awards, \u003c/em\u003eand \u201cBeautiful\u201d was a winner with \u003cem\u003eInternational Unsigned Only\u003c/em\u003e. \u201cThe Cool Kids,\u201d and \u201cAre We There Yet\u201d have nominated her for \u003cem\u003eBest Female Artist\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eBest Song\u003c/em\u003e in a number of songwriting competitions. Peacock was also named \u003cem\u003eListening Room Network\u2019s Artist of the Year.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the dark side takes another swing in 2015. And, big Nashville promises are especially good at grave digging. From RCA Studio A \"project golden child\" to street orphan practically overnight, Peacock was ghosted by her entire team and producer without explanation. Spirits crushed, she hit the road. Solo. Again. That was the catalyst that launched her next album, \u201cDream On,\u201d and landed Sarah her first tour bus. But less than 4 months later, she was watching it burn to the ground at a California truck stop. Sarah\u2019s fans quickly came to the rescue with a fundraiser, which is what kept her on the road. That special connection between Sarah and her fans is what put her in Hank Williams Jr.\u2019s former tour bus, one year after the devastating loss. \u201cYou have to be unstoppable, even when you don\u2019t believe you are.\u201d That\u2019s the Modus Operandi for the now half Tennessean, half Texan road warrior. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen she\u2019s off the road, Peacock is active in the anti-bullying and animal rescue communities. She helped start a rock school for kids and recently formed her own 501(c)3, \u003cem\u003eThe Band Waggin,\u2019\u003c/em\u003e benefiting animal health and rescue programs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017, she signed with \u003cem\u003eIn Tune Entertainment \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eAmerican Roots Records. \u003c/em\u003ePeacock is sponsored by Taylor Guitars, Fender, 1964 Audio, Strymon, and Mississippi Cold Drip Coffee. Her upcoming EP, \u201cHot Sheet Motel,\u201d is a collection of 5 songs that reveal the secrets of one woman\u2019s journey through the shadows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
