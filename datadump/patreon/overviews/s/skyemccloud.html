    "summary": "Something that I\u0027ve always wanted to do, ever since I was little, was entertain. I enjoy making people happy through my actions, whether it be a joke, a story, or a song. Life sometimes doesn\u0027t go as planned; I never got into acting as best as I would have liked, becoming a singer is too much of a long-shot, and I just don\u0027t think I could really do well as a comedian. I\u0027ve spent much of my adult life thus far working customer service jobs, because it\u0027s simply what I do best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAh, but then there is writing. Writing has always been an artform I could do, and do well. It\u0027s something I enjoy. I could spend ages brainstorming up perfect plots, and I\u0027d jot them all down. But I never have the time to finish much beyond a short story. Through websites such as FanFiction.net, FurAffinity, and so on, I have found ways to share stories and generate a fanbase. Sometimes my stories are safe for work, sometimes they\u0027re not, but they are always deeply rooted in the characters\u0027 interactions and the world around them. My desire is for this to be my life\u0027s work. To create wonderful stories and novels and series and more and more for those who would give their time to read my work. But the rent needs to be paid, and writing simply isn\u0027t paying the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo that end I\u0027m turning to Patreon as the first step in realizing my own dreams and ambitions. This page focuses on my short-term goals in the hopes of turning my sights on my long-term goals, hence why my listed goals sound so ambitious. I look to my fanbase, both old and new, to help me take these steps forward in realizing my dreams. First in being able to rid myself of the need for customer service jobs, secondly to keep me self-sufficient, and finally to be able to have the worry-free time to write those novels and series I would so very much like to see on the shelves of bookstores around the world. In return you would have my eternal gratitude, and the heartfelt thanks of a dreamer realized.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven a dollar helps. For the short-term I\u0027ll be using the funds gained here as emergency money, money towards being able to attend Texas Furry Fiesta and Anthrocon, and perhaps a nest-egg so I can actually take a vacation or two without worrying about money. I\u0027ll be writing at least one story per month for Patreon, although I plan to post other stories elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can catch my content at FurAffinity, SoFurry, DeviantArt, InkBunny, and y!Gallery ... all under the handle of SkyeMcCloud. Check me out there as well!\u003cbr\u003e"

I enjoy writing a variety of genres, but my most-favourite deal with a futuristic take on things. Not so much science fiction (although it\u0027s definitely an inspiration), but perhaps a take on the future that could be, or at least the future within the world I\u0027m writing about. The furry fandom has done me well; most of my writing is at least furry-inspired, if not at least outright blatant.",
