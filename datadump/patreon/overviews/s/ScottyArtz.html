Ray Fox was heavily inspired after playing video games like Sonic the hedgehog and Crash and watching a loot of Spider-man and X-men cartoons. Despite watching cartoons and playing video games all day like a young bum, I didn\u0027t start drawing until I watched my eldest cousin create her own little comic series for fun! (that she never finished btw, LOL!) But little did she know, she inspired me to create my own story and characters for the rest of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created a ton of characters and stories since then, but Ray Fox was special to me. I decided to stick with him. It is my dream to make Ray Fox a Graphic Novel or Cartoon series one day. I knew I couldn\u0027t make this possible without drawing and writing so I adopted both hobbies and took them seriously with the help of my friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSynopsis\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou follow the adventures of, Raymond Fox Maple, a clumsy and sarcastic, teenage fox in a bizarre world of anthropomorphic animals, who most seem to have, just as bizarre, special abilities and powers. Raymond himself, is a stubborn, vigilante who happens to be a pyromaniac. He tries to be a hero but he destroys everything in his city by fire. Hence why I called him a pyromaniac.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin Ray Fox as he\u0027s forced by law to redeem himself of his mistakes and destruction by joining a team of unlikely daredevils like himself to explore the world around him and catch a lot of bad guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eRay Fox updates every Friday and you can find every update on \u003ca href=\"http://www.rayfoxthecomic.com/\"\u003ehttp://www.rayfoxthecomic.com/.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore about the Artist\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI say what drives me is the fact that I always have these ideas in my head. When I was little, I always thought of little stories so I picked up a pencil and wanted to illustrate them. Now, drawing is my biggest hobby. The Ideas in my head are still there, and they still strive me to draw. With that being said, I have never drawn for the beauty of Art it self. Fine art never interested me. I only draw because I watched Spider-man and pretended to spin webs when I was 5. I draw because I played Crash bandicoot as a little kid and I thought he was the dumbest, coolest thing ever. I draw because Mario is the most likable plumber in the world. Those silly, kiddy things inspired me with ideas, so I draw because I want to put my ideas on paper.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was one of those weird kindergartners who cried every time he got his hands messy with glue. I never wanted to paint or get messy with pastels (probably why I adopted digital illustration.) I just simply wanted to tell stories with a cartoony, graphic art style. I adopted story telling and over the years have done my best to perfect my writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI completed all my education. I have a Bachelors of Fine Arts in Illustration and Design.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Right now, the comic is currently only completely illustrated by me, which is fine and dandy buuut..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIF I reach this goal, I\u0027ll be able to hire a very talented inker (or even a bigger team if I surpass my goal) to help me update the comic much faster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe comic currently updates normally once a week, per page. (Current short term goal is 3 times a week). Not bad, but I have so much in store for Ray Fox that my current pace drives me crazy! I would like to finish entire episodes in a short span 1-4 months instead of taking a year to finish them! With just one inker, my process time would probably be twice or 3 times as fast and you all would be able to see the story progress along much faster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan we make that happen? I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s a lofty goal but not an impossible one. I believe Ray Fox will get enough support for it!",
