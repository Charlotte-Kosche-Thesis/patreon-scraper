    "summary": "Hi. My name is Joshua Bailey. I, alongside my friend Greg P., are \nstarting up this group inspired by a personal friend of ours who suffers\n from PTSD, and needs a service animal to help her through the day. We \nare working to gain the funding to pay for her dog and its training, but\n looking into it, its rather expensive. Some programs offer to help \nfundraise part of the cost, and as wonderful as that is, it still tends \nto leave people with fairly hefty costs. We feel that no one suffering \nfrom PTSD, or any trauma that requires the aid of a service animal, \nshould ever have to also face such a large fee alone just to feel safe \nin their everyday activities, no matter where they\u0027re at. Starting as a \npersonal fundraiser, that you see here, to help our personal friend \nraise the money she needs for her service animal, we\u0027re working to \nexpand this into a full, nonprofit charity meant to work alongside those\n organizations to help pay for the training and maintenance of animals \nfor people that sorely need them, especially those that are having \ntrouble getting financial aid in other places.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to make a one-time donation instead, please head to our GoFundMe (gofundme.com/service-paws), or you can make direct donations through paypal as well to servicepaws@outlook.com. Thank you to everyone that offers support or helps to spread this around.\u003cbr\u003e"
