    "summary": "I have been writing and performing music, poetry, and prose for almost 30 years, now, in several genres and under several different names/personas including Savage Daughter (I wrote a song titled \"My Mother\u0027s Savage Daughter\" in 1990; \u00a0it is still being sung by people, as far as I know, on several continents to date), Wyndreth Berginsdottir (mostly in original Viking-Age Norse-styled work originating within my participation in an international historical education-through-recreation organization), and as A.Shieldmaid as a writer of fan fiction and erotica. \u00a0I am also fortunate enough to be half of a largely a capella duo called \"Twa Corbies\" (with the incomparable June Zenner) for the last twenty-some years. \u00a0June and I have also been known to participate in loud and highly inappropriate metal and punk projects under such names as \"Ofeelya Groyn\" and \"Sheela Na Gig.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have released two solo albums--songs and spoken word--to date: \u00a0\"My Mother\u0027s Savage Daughter,\" \u00a0and \"I Have Wedded This Blade.\" \u00a0Selections from both are available to listen to and/or purchase at \u003ca href=\"https://wyndrethsavagedaughtershieldmaid.bandcamp.com\"\u003ehttps://wyndrethsavagedaughtershieldmaid.bandcamp....\u003c/a\u003e . \u00a0I self-published a poetry chapbook of my poetry, \"Blood-Songs,\" in 2016 and made the special collector\u0027s run of 50 copies entirely by hand, including the printing and binding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also a fairly rabid repurposer, and make rugs woven from discarded jeans, and floor mats and rugs crocheted from repurposed plastic grocery bags. Each of these bag mats keeps up to 150 100% post-consumer plastic grocery bags out of the landfill. \u00a0I am a bookbinder, and I specialize in making blank journals and \"junk journals\" from repurposed materials including cereal boxes, repurposed papers, and \"found\" ephemera. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso a fiber-arts nerd.\u00a0 I\u0027m a comber, a spinner, a weaver: I skirt, clean, dye, and spin my own wool because it\u0027s productive and relaxing. I build my own tools--from drop spindles and wool combs, to looms--including the 8\u0027 monster pegloom in my dining room and the freestanding 6\u0027 Navajo loom in my living room.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have found ways to teach fiber arts in a number of ways--from formal women\u0027s recovery groups to informal learning moments at a Scandinavian metal show--as means of relaxation, self-esteem, therapeutic movement, empowerment, women\u0027s history, and skill-building.\u00a0 No plans to quit that voluntarily or any time soon.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe, personally...\u00a0I have often been described as being subtle as a groin pull, and I can\u0027t argue with that.  I believe in the empowerment of everyone, and am honored whenever I am able to function as a mentor to women learning to find their voices, literally and figuratively. I have very little patience for gratuitously mean people.  My family--by blood and/or by choice--includes many, many diverse people, and I love and support them ferociously, if not sometimes clumsily. I am an Internet-ordained minister.  I have a degree in Substance Abuse Counseling and worked as a counselor working with women involved in the Corrections system for nearly 8 years until health concerns caused me to reevaluate my career.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe point of all this incredibly uncomfortable shameless history and self-promotion is this: \u00a0I am on Patreon because I want to continue to write and perform and record and publish and repurpose and create and use all of that to benefit others and our society, as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u0027re still with me after all this, and you decide I\u0027m worth your time and some of your own hard-earned financial backing, I want to thank you right now. \u00a0THANK YOU. \u00a0THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you\u0027ve read all this and you aren\u0027t able or willing to back me, rock on. \u00a0I thank you, also, for your time and your attention.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSavage Daughter\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
