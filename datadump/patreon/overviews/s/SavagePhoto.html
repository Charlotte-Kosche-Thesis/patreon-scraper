    "summary": "First of all, thank you for visiting this page and even considering being a part of my journey. The fact that you are reading this now is more than I would ever expect anyone to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you somehow just stumbled onto this page without knowing anything about me and my work, allow me to introduce myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.alteredexposure.com/images/666_1923-edit-crop-u1059_2x.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jesse Mount. I am known better by my self-appointed\u00a0pseudonym, Jesse Savage. I do photography, retouching, and digital artwork that is often on the edgier side.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe photography work I do is highly stylized art. I have started to head towards conceptual or theatrical type of images. Some of which are done on a fairly larger scale.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt least when I have the time to do so. I generally only get to work on personal projects a 1 or 2 times a year at max due to the amount of effort and funding it needs to pull off the ideas I have. I need to find locations, buy props (or materials and take the time to make them). Lots of times there are costumes and/or makeup that need to be done. I still don\u0027t have the proper tools to even do a lot of things I wish I could.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to the fact that photography is a very expensive craft to get into, I have fallen into the world of weddings and birthday parties just to be able to afford my equipment and stay afloat. But in doing so, I have found that I use up all my time doing this and the results are not even that great since I have no passion in it. I don\u0027t belong in this type of world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is what brings me to Patreon. With your help, I will be able to have more freedom to create my images. If I could focus my efforts on creating my visions, I can do so much better. I might be able to travel to different locations for the perfect images. I could create some series that I have been putting off due to the lack of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to make one thing clear. This is not a cry for help. I am not asking for donations to buy gear so I can start doing something. I have plenty of gear already (more than I really need, actually).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is an invitation. An invitation to be a\u00a0part of my journey and help me grow as a creator.\u003cbr\u003eAn invitation to be part of a dialog in which will guide my direction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are so many different ventures that I wish I could pull off. I feel like if I had the time and resources, I could do so. Time is the biggest factor. I can not possibly do everything I want to with my time on this planet. Making decisions on where to put my focus is the hardest thing I go through. My patrons will be allowed to partake with direct communication with me in order to help me make these decisions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to becoming a part of the journey, you will also get some nice rewards.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me on this journey and you will see some truly great things happen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho knows how high we can go till we are allowed to fly?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. I have fallen away from most of my social media accounts as I feel like it is a major waste of time. Social media platforms have gone the way of algorithms that make it hard for anyone to be noticed on someone\u0027s feed\u003cbr\u003eI plan on using this platform for most of my online communication since it is directed to those that are genuinely interested in what I am doing.\u003cbr\u003e"
