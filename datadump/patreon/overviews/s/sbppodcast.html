    "summary": "Hi there. I am Susy Botello and I am the founder of the International Mobile Film Festival which I created to give respect to filmmakers and everyone who wanted to make movies with their mobile phones. Back in 2009, I wanted to give everyone a platform to screen their films on a big screen and roll out the red carpet. Basically, all human beings in the universe qualify as long as they shot their films with only mobile phones. It was a crazy idea, at the time. Not so crazy now though. We put on a film festival every year in San Diego and filmmakers come from all over the world. Last year brought filmmakers from Germany, Chile, Australia and Canada ages 11 to 82. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fsan1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/21616560_1670991392925741_6153422236560391550_n.jpg?oh=7d926b338f319b93e8e79cdea545ef0a\u0026amp;oe=5AA6C22F\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fsan1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/18198509_1516819378342944_2220679093793130920_n.jpg?oh=83394fa291dd6bb15a2a4e629add3253\u0026amp;oe=5AAEE781\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI teach workshops and I do speaking engagements too, like the panel on mobile filmmaking at Comic-Con International in San Diego in 2016 \u0026amp; 2017. \u003cstrong\u003eThe SBP Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e is a way for people in the mobile filmmaking industry to share their stories and their experience. Stories connect us and inspire us but we also learn a lot from what others share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DU5-uhiVwAA_9kH.png:large\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what the heck is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e Well, it\u2019s a way to support creators who are creating things so that they can keep creating! That\u2019s pretty much what my understanding is about it. We have set some levels of pledges for monthly subscriptions you can make. To show my gratitude, I have decided to give some benefits depending on the level you pledge. Even a dollar is awesome. Don\u2019t think a dollar is not going to make a difference. If a 100 people don\u2019t think a dollar is worth giving that\u2019s $100 dollars which never see the light of mobile film! You can read the benefits for each pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on the level of membership you get you\u0027ll get discounts to tickets to join me in person on the red carpet in our International Mobile Film Festival in San Diego. I just started here, so as I get my feet wet I\u0027ll come up with some really cool ways to thank you on top of what I can promise now. There are live chats we can join on, and I can share some special podcasts just for you which would be unique and only for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to continue doing what I have been doing and growing the platform and making it better. I am interested in growing the community and connecting everyone through storytelling and making great films with smartphones.\u003cbr\u003e"
