It calls us to be bold, visionary, and creative. It honors intuition and alternate ways of knowing. And it reminds us not to take ourselves too seriously.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s exactly what I want for myself and for my clients.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe perfect training ground\u003c/h3\u003eBy 1996 I\u2019d been a waiter, a writer, an editor, a business manager, and a full time artist. I had a penchant for Jungian studies, the novels of Dorothy Sayers, and Improv.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then I agreed to help a few friends with their businesses. Before I knew it, they were coming to see me each week, not only with business issues, but also with life questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u2019t know what to call this work. It wasn\u2019t consulting, and it wasn\u2019t therapy. All I knew was that clients were more engaged, confident, and pro-active in their lives and work. They were living into their dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day a client mailed me an article from \u003cem\u003eNewsweek\u003c/em\u003e about coaching. Attached was a sticky note saying, \u201cThis is what you do.\u201d And I saw that my checkered past had been the perfect training ground for my life work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCoaching and beyond\u003c/h3\u003eI went on to get formal training as a coach and to earn the highest credential awarded by the International Coach Federation (ICF). I continued to study both within the coaching world and beyond.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI studied Process Work, Embodied Intelligence, and became a Certified Facilitator of The Work of Byron Katie. I read widely and explored many models of inquiry, insight, and human potential. Still, in 2011 I was frustrated. In spite of all my searching, something was missing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAn encounter with deeper Principles\u003c/h3\u003eThat same year I came across the insights of an improbable spiritual teacher, Sydney Banks. Syd, a welder with a 9th grade education, had an awakening experience, which he came to articulate in terms of Three Principles: Mind, Consciousness, and Thought. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn one respect Syd\u2019s insights were nothing new. They were consistent with the sages in the perennial wisdom traditions. Yet there is a simplicity, clarity, and accessibility in his teaching that makes a tremendous difference, especially for contemporary seekers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSyd saw deeply into the inherent wholeness and health of every human being and the way in which we each create our experience moment to moment from the inside out by means of the Three Principles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, when I point my clients to the spiritual principles behind the human experience, they blossom. As their understanding deepens, their joy increases. They act with greater ease, creativity, grace, and wisdom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Three Principles made sense of coaching\u003c/h3\u003eThe Three Principles point to fundamental truths about the human experience that, in my experience, account for why coaching works, when it does, and what is missing when it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m committed to sharing these Principles within the coaching community for the sake of grounding the good work we have been doing for decades and revealing more clearly the path to the great work that insight into the Principles makes available.\u003cbr\u003e",
