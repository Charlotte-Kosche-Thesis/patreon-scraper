    "summary": "Hi, my name is Tamara Ford. I\u0027m the creator and content editor of the Shelf Addiction book and pop culture blog and the podcast host and producer of the Shelf Addiction Podcast. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShelf Addiction is dedicated to feeding your Book Nerd, TV Junkie, and Movie Fanatic addictions! Listen to the Shelf Addiction Podcast; the home of Book Chat and Pop Culture Sunday where you\u0027ll find episodes that range from bookish content including author interviews, book discussion roundtables, and more to pop culture content where myself and Lisa Orban talk about TV and Movies every Sunday (and sometimes Monday). Want even more?\u00a0You\u0027ll find book reviews, movie reviews, and more on shelfaddiction.com blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBooks are my passion. I love books and audiobooks. I\u0027ve loved reading since I was a child, and in the past 3-4 years, I\u0027ve become an advocate for audiobooks. It\u0027s my way to relax and to get excited about fiction. Beyond my literary jaunts, I\u0027m a self-proclaimed TV Junkie and Movie Fan. I want to share my love of all things books, TV, and movies with you via Shelf Addiction! \u00a0I enjoy sharing my thoughts and giving winning recommendations that will help you out when you\u0027re looking for a new book to read or a new TV show to watch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReading, watching, and listening to content on Shelf Addiction\u0027s various platforms is 100% free and will always be. \u00a0From web hosting, podcast hosting, editing software, equipment and more to editing podcast and video, and writing website content - all of these things take time and money: two things I\u0027m short on. I currently have a lot of content for you to enjoy, but I have big plans for even more book and pop culture related things on Shelf Addiction. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I am going to be able to create all the additional content and programs that I have planned, I\u0027ll need to buy equipment, subscriptions, and technical assistance. Please consider showing your support by contributing to the further growth of Shelf Addiction."
