It has\nsparked discussion and created words and thoughts and passion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd, touch wood, it will continue to do so. It is\nmy belief that games exist as cultural texts, containing narratives which tell\nus something of worth about people and the world whether they want to or not.

I\nfind it to be a fulfilling and productive way for me to spend my life.\nSometimes I like to think my writing is somewhat valuable, defying everything\nI\u0027m told by larger society. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut beyond the dreaming\nand sense of self-fulfilment, it is very difficult for game critics like myself\nto find sustenance in this work. There are very few paying jobs and most of those that offer\nsteady pay give pittance in exchange for menial press work a world away from\nwhat I want to be writing. Everyone tells you there\u0027s no space for my kind of jam.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s where\nPatreon comes in. With your support, my writing can help to sustain my\nday-to-day living, while the money I earn can be put back into delivering more articles,\nartwork and videos. This way if you enjoy my work and feel it warrants a couple\nof quid, you can help to make my load a little lighter and keep the good stuff\ncoming. To this end, you can support me by \u003cstrong\u003eas little as $3 a month\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOtherwise, I have a\ncat named Zoe and she is adorable. If you don\u0027t care about my writing but want\nto help me buy Zoe her food, they are also acceptable terms for supporting my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat your funding will net you\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat you will get\nare more articles of the sort I currently write. Your money will go towards my\nliving costs - groceries, rent, bills, you know yourself. It will give me the\ncreative freedom to write the games criticism that large publications are\nsimply not interested in but our community thrives on. With money coming in, I\ncan focus more on talking about freelancer-unfriendly indie games, or write\nmeandering think-pieces with no thesis at all. It will free up my time so I can\nplay more games in general, meaning I will have more material to talk about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy writing routine currently nets\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eone article and one video per month\u003c/strong\u003e, since I\u0027m presently at it part-time. At that\npace it would take over $400 an article/video to make it comparable to the Irish\nminimum wage. If my writing shows to be a viable source of income for me I might\nincrease my rate of articles, but never to such a point that would degrade its\noverall quality. I want to reward your trust in me with quality work I\u0027m proud of. But if you choose to support me, please bear\nthis in mind and cap your monthly patronage to whatever you feel is appropriate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of whether or\nnot you want to pitch in to the Stephen fund, I\u0027d like to thank you for taking\nthe time to check out my Patreon. I hope you find something here which you feel\ndeserves the support you can offer. Even if the most you can spare is $3 a\nmonth, every dollar helps me to continue with the work I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again and all the\nbest.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nStephen Beirne\u003cbr\u003e"
