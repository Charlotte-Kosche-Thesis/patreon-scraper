In 2015, I started doing live Periscope videos on the topic of persuasion and politics, mostly about President Trump\u0027s skill as a persuader.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrior to blogging and Periscoping about the 2016 presidential election, I enjoyed a robust speaking career and did a lot of licensing of Dilbert products. That all dried up (about one-third of my income) when roughly half of the public labelled me a racist for saying positive things about Trump\u0027s persuasion talents. Periscoping about politics takes substantial time and effort, and it brings with it considerable risks to both income and reputation. But people tell me my Periscope videos sometimes shape the national conversation as well as help folks succeed in their personal lives. I created this Patreon page for anyone who would like to encourage me to make more Periscope videos on what is obviously a risky topic: Trump\u0027s persuasion skills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(\u003cstrong\u003eNote:\u003c/strong\u003e I don\u0027t agree with President Trump\u0027s political views in many cases. But I do enjoy the show he puts on, and his skill as a persuader. And I like a strong economy. I consider myself ultra-liberal on social issues, and I am not a member of a political party.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write about persuasion because I have a background as a trained hypnotist, and I\u0027ve been studying the field of persuasion -- in all its forms -- for decades, as part of my job as a writer and communicator.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for reading this far. And a special thank you to the wise and generous donors who decide to support my unusual form of free speech.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
