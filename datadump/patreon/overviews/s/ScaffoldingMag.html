We match visual artists and writers to create a unique reader experience. We also feature editorials about diversity, social issues, popular culture etc. \u003cstrong\u003eOur mission is to become a vehicle for up-and-coming artists to be discovered and express their unique message.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy \u003cem\u003eScaffolding\u003c/em\u003e? \u003c/strong\u003eYou probably noticed that it has nothing to do with building and construction. Not in a traditional sense anyway.

The idea was born from knowing how difficult it is to be noticed in the publishing industry. There are so many talented people out there! The \u003cem\u003eScaffolding\u003c/em\u003e idea resonated with the artists and we received some fantastic submissions!

We have expenses for running web-sites, numerous software, advertisement, production, and printing the magazine. Also, we are committed to supporting writers and visual artists by offering them 60% of the net profit. This is a very important goal for us, because we are artists and writers ourselves, and we know how important it is to be recognized for our hard work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur long-term goal is to grow to a point that we can afford paying the contributors actual cash and be eligible to nominate our contributors for major literary and art awards. We want Scaffolding to become a happening place, where people are discovered! By supporting Scaffolding, you are supporting artists from around the world, and a team that worked hard to make Scaffolding happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cool thing about our magazine is that it has no paid ads! It also will not become dated because of the ever-green content. It is filled with fiction and editorials. It also features a unique collection of artwork that you will want to keep looking at while taking your morning coffee or entertaining your guests.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more details, find us at \u003ca href=\"http://www.ScaffoldingMag.com\"\u003ewww.ScaffoldingMag.com\u003c/a\u003e , Facebook \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ScaffoldingMag/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/ScaffoldingMag/\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0and Twitter \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ScaffoldingMag\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/ScaffoldingMag/\u003c/a\u003e @ScaffoldingMag\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWatch video trailers or the stories, published in the 1st issue:\u003cbr\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnU130MSD6g\u0026amp;t=20s\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca class=\"redactor_btn redactor_btn_video\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"

Everything in our life is temporary--style, fame, beauty, youth. These coveted ideals are a scaffolding in our life and identity, as we construct ourselves as a certain type of a person.
