On the SFLC Podcast, I and my cohosts Ryan Sprague and Steve \"The Professor\" Dunn have talked to current world champions, contenders, and up and coming stars from the UFC, Bellator, Glory Kickboxing, Lion Fights, and more. Our goal is to get to know the fighters on a more personal level and really see what goes on in the mind of someone who eat, sleeps, and dreams combat. We have a one-of-a-kind approach, and that\u0027s exactly why people tune in every week via iTunes, Stitcher, and Podomatic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Need You\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon\u00a0gives us the unique opportunity to build a stronger connection with you, the fans, in exchange for your financial support. It will enable us to create more high-quality content and take this show to the next level (which you can learn more about on the left under \"Goals\"). In exchange, you\u0027ll get loads of exclusive content created only for patrons that will give you an even closer look at the fight game you won\u0027t get anywhere else, all for just a few cents a day. If you haven\u0027t already, give the rewards a look on the right, and we think you\u0027ll like what you see.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading, and we\u0027ll see you at the fights!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eMike Heck\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHost \u0026amp; Creator of the SFLC Podcast\u003cbr\u003e"
