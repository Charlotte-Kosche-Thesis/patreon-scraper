I have been creating content online for over 10 years and truly believe that the work I do through content creation makes the greatest impact for the largest amount of people. The trouble is 1:1 coaching pays the bills. I am limited in my ability to take on private coaching clients and have infinite content creation ideas that keep getting pushed under the rug in favor of paid hour for hour work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to serve you through video content, podcasts, workshops and more. Patreon offers me the opportunity to do that!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my Patreon community we will be able to dig deeper into my personal experiences to share obstacles that I\u0027ve overcome, specifics about how I\u0027ve built my businesses and what has helped me along the way, tips for living an intentional life and even feedback on your ideas and work!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to have you join me in this next phase of creation. This platform allows me the opportunity to show up for you in deep and meaningful ways as a community and that is so exciting!\u00a0"
