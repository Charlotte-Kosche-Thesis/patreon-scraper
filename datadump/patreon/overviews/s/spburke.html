Therefore, I\u0027m starting simple with reward tiers. A simple dollar gets you access, where I\u0027ll share what I\u0027m working on and will provide early updates once completed. I do however plan to add more tiers in the future with special rewards, so stay tuned for that. To each and every person who donates, thank you so much! You have my undying gratitude. Looking forward to showing you what I got!"
