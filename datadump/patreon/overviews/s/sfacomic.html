My name is Abby, but between many friends and the net I\u0027m known as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://secretstabby.tumblr.com/aboutme\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eStabby\u003c/a\u003e, and I\u0027m here with my partner T.Y Nereim\u00a0to pitch Starfox Adventures the (Fan)\u00a0Comic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter playing the demo at a Best Buy in 2002, Starfox Adventures changed my life. And since that fateful day I\u0027ve been eager to make a comic about it. At first it was probably going to be closer to how the game plays out, but the older I got, the bigger the story got. The game itself has many plot holes, character inconsistencies, and several unanswered questions that make it undesirable to a lot of Starfox fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to change that. Or at least attempt to make it more interesting and consistent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTaking elements from Dinosaur Planet, Star Fox, and our combined imaginations, I want to fill the glaring gaps that the game is begging to have filled, as well as adding my own twists and spins on the story and it\u0027s characters. I\u0027ve had many years to think this over and with my current abilities and the help of someone who knows more about comics than I do, I think now is the time to finally breathe life into this project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Are We Doing This?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eN\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eot only is this comic meant to bring to light on how I interpret SFA, this project is meant to help us both learn more about story telling, world building, comic-making, scripting, consistent drawing, color, and teamwork. I graduated in 2014 as an animator, and while I like to animate I\u0027m starting to wonder if that\u0027s really what I want to do as a career. So I\u0027m going to use this childhood dream of mine to dip our toes into learning more about the comic medium. This will be a huge learning experience and will hopefully lead to making more comics in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd earning income to do it will be more of an incentive to keep up with a schedule.\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Long Will This Comic Be?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eI don\u0027t have a definite answer. The game itself is pretty long and adding more to it is only going to make it longer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s just say it\u0027s going to take \u003cem\u003eat least\u003c/em\u003e a couple years if everything goes as planned.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Kind of Audience Will This Comic Be For?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eWe will be aiming this story at anyone 16 and up, along with any Star Fox/SFA fans.

There \u003cstrong\u003ewill\u003c/strong\u003e be times where an update will be late or we run out of buffer due to my energy waning from this highly stressful work. Worst case scenario, I may have to take an occasional hiatus to recover. But I\u0027m hoping that the longer I work on this, the better and faster I will get and pages will become second nature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease expect that there will be inconsistencies, mistakes, typos, and style changes throughout the entire comic. This project is one giant experiment and is meant to help our skills as artists and storytellers. \u00a0And in turn that means there will be errors, especially at the beginning. I\u0027m hoping to get good enough at some point where I can go back and re-do older pages even better than I could before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause this is a fan project, there\u0027s always a chance that we\u0027ll be forced to take it down. BUT, that doesn\u0027t mean we\u0027ll stop. What will probably happen is that this Patreon will turn into one that\u0027s for several other projects/works (fan and original) that we\u0027ve been sitting on to eventually share and the SFA comic will be thrown into the mix. Though since I don\u0027t expect to get a whole lot of attention, I \u003cem\u003ethink\u003c/em\u003e we\u0027ll be ok. No promises though.\u003cbr\u003e"
