You\u0027re probably the kind of person that kindergarten teachers show pictures of to their tiny adorable students and say \"Behold! Liken yourself unto this wise soul, and strive to emulate their most generous and benevolent behaviours, for they have given of their funds to the Six Cold Feet podcast, so that its glorious creators may bring forth unto this world a podcast of joy and glory the likes of which this world hath not ever seen!\" \u00a0Well, you know, if they are kindergarten teachers from the early 20th century. Who also enjoy podcasts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSix Cold Feet is a fiction anthology podcast about music, mystery, and the places we escape to when the real world disappoints us. Season one tells the story of River, who is looking for his recently disappeared sister. He attempts to enlist the help of his fellow townspeople, but we soon learn that they have given up hope, that the town in which they live seems to be rather unusual, and that River has plenty of problems of his own...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWritten by award-winning author and poet J.M. Donellan and performed by a cast including Melanie Zanetti, Jessica McGaw, and Tom Yaxley this series will leave you pondering long after the final episode sings through your speakers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn conclusion: We love you, you are really charming and cool and everyone says so, it\u0027s not just us. Thank you for being the most important part of any art piece: the audience. We look forward to showering you with the appropriate rewards. Keep being excellent. The tiny adorable kindergarteners of the future are depending on you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
