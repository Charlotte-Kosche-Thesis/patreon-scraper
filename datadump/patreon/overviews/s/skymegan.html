    "summary": "Hi, y\u0027all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name\u0027s Megan, and I\u0027m a full-time professional performance artist. I travel around the country working primarily at renaissance festivals as a comedian/singer/swordfighter in a show that I co-write and direct.\u00a0 Our mission, in that job, is to create and present art that empowers and encourages people (especially women) while they laugh and sing along. Needless to say, I love my job!\u00a0 I get to travel, make art, make people laugh... it\u0027s awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s also really, really hard.\u00a0 We\u0027re fairly new to this, just beginning our third year on the road, and that means we don\u0027t make a lot of money.\u00a0 And while travelling is fun, it also presents unique challenges, which I am always finding new and better ways to meet.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve come to Patreon for several reasons.\u00a0 You see, this website works in a fabulous way - you find artists and creators you like, and you patronize them!\u00a0 And I really want you to patronize me!\u00a0 Believe me, that\u0027s a sentence I\u0027ve never used before.\u00a0 But here and now, it\u0027s just what I need.\u00a0 See, if you\u0027re one of my Patrons, you\u0027re giving me something unbelievably valuable - power.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWait... what?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, power.\u00a0 Let me explain.\u00a0 You see, I\u0027m an artist.\u00a0 I make art.\u00a0 I tried to fight it for a long time, tried to live without it... and let\u0027s just say that didn\u0027t work well at all.\u00a0 I\u0027ve got to make all kinds of art, all over the place.\u00a0 And that requires a lot of power.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe power to travel, safely and swiftly, between venues that are sometimes thousands of miles apart.\u00a0 The power to feed myself even when we have a week without shows.\u00a0 The power to focus on my work in the off-season.\u00a0 The power to believe in my own creation, and the power to share it.\u00a0 You, dear darling Patron, can give me some of that power.\u00a0 You can see in the goals that I\u0027ve set what I plan to do with it.\u00a0 I need a safer vehicle, and I need a sturdier home.\u00a0 In the mean time, I need to survive between shows and seasons.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not asking you to buy anything; it doesn\u0027t work like that.\u00a0 I\u0027m asking you to believe in me, and to share a little of your power with me.\u00a0 And in return, you will find me abundantly thankful... and yourself abundantly rewarded!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are three levels at which you can patronize me and at each level, you\u0027ll receive access to art that nobody else gets to see.\u00a0I\u0027ve always made a lot of art I haven\u0027t shared - most of it has been languishing inside my brain, or my computer, or in my hands, for years, and I\u0027m finally taking the big scary step of sharing it with other people.\u00a0 Your support gives me that kind of power, too; the courage to put more and more of my work (and my heart) on display.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you subscribe at the $1 level, the Jello Shot level, you get access to my Patron-only blog posts!\u00a0 At least once a month, I\u0027ll post an essay of some kind right here where only my Patreon buddies can find it.\u00a0 These posts may be funny, or feminist, or both, or something completely wacky - I am, after all, an eclectic artist!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to knock it up a notch, try the $5 Craft Pint level! These Patrons will get exclusive photographs!\u00a0 Every month, I\u0027ll post photos that aren\u0027t available anywhere else!\u00a0 You may know that I\u0027m frequently involved in photoshoots for which my friends and I make costumes, design hair and makeup, and travel to interesting locations.\u00a0 Craft Pinters will get to see never-before released shots from a wide variety of projects. These artistic shoots will alternate with behind-the-scenes photos of travel and festival life; a rare look into my wild world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you really want to up your proof, go for the highest level of Patronage - the $20 Hip Flask!\u00a0 I\u0027m trying something brand new for my top-shelf Patrons.... video!\u00a0 Every month will find totally new experiments in video, just for y\u0027all.\u00a0 Sometimes, funny, sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes, well..... not safe for work.... (you did see the adult content warning, right?)... I\u0027m going to try all kinds of things for my Hip Flasks.\u00a0\u00a0Bonus!  Flask level Patrons will also get written work not available anywhere else - poetry and song lyrics, including the ridiculous and raunchy parodies I write for the show, will be posted here!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook, if you\u0027ve stuck with me this far, I want to go ahead and thank you.\u00a0 Whether you decide to patronize me or not, I want to thank you for checking out my work, thank you for considering me worthy of your time, thank you for coming to Patreon in the first place looking for people you want to share your power and your heart with.\u00a0 The plain truth is, I make art because I have to.\u00a0 I\u0027m always going to.\u00a0 I\u0027m asking for your help to make more and better art.\u00a0 I want to write and find and create new things for YOU. Thank you for allowing me to do that.\u00a0 Thank you for giving me the power to do that.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my heart.\u00a0 I hope you enjoy it."
