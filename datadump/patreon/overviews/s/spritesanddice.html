Tired of the negativity that filled many other game reviews and websites, they longed for something more. With a love for both table top as well as video games, and their radar hugely pinned on the indie gaming community, they decided to make the site they\u0027d always wished existed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSprites and Dice was founded to talk about games, and the gaming community, in a different way. Rather than focusing on the flaws in games, the writing focuses on what is done right.While we still approach gaming with a critical view, articles are only written when the writer enjoys the game they played, that there was a quality in it, whether it was story, game design, or art, that stood out to them in some remarkable fashion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLife is short, after all. Isn\u2019t it better to focus on the good stuff?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe currently have a full staff of six hard working nerds:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Wyatt Krause, Editor-in-Chief\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Jon Glover, Webmaster\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Adam Factor, Editor\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Eric Henn, Lead Writer\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Dana Kjolner, Writer\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Nate Brogan, Sound Engineer\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur entire staff works on a volunteer basis, writing and posting articles after we\u2019ve completed a full day\u2019s work at our day jobs. We do it because we love it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, you may ask, \u003cem\u003ewhat do we do\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eReviews\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs writers for gaming, we of course love reviews; they are a great way of finding out if a game is a good fit for you. While we don\u2019t believe in numerical ratings, we only review games that we enjoy playing, and we make it clear why that particular game caught our attention. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eOp-Eds\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also write opinion pieces and features. Opinion pieces are articles meant to bring up a discussion; they can talk about the meaning behind the game, or they can argue why that game was so popular to begin with. Feature articles are supposed to be our \u2018crunchy\u2019 pieces where we do things like break down our strategies in our favorite tabletop games or do comparisons on various heroes in your favorite MOBA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003ePodcasts \u0026amp; Twitch Streams\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find our bi-monthly podcast in all of the usual places, as well as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.spritesanddice.com/sprites-and-dice-podcast\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon our website\u003c/a\u003e and here on Patreon!

We also want to expand, moving towards better equipment and coverage of events. More importantly though, we want to pay our staff. While this site is a platform for new writers and developers to establish themselves, we would still like to compensate them for their hard work!
