    "summary": "We are located in a renovated Victorian Gothic church in the charming, artsy, and eccentric hamlet of Brattleboro, VT. Formerly the All Souls Unitarian church, the decor expresses the culturally inclusive nature of the original congregation, mixing elements of the Renaissance, with Gothic Revival, with Celtic and Scandinavian folk designs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur restoration process has been, and will continue to be, a dance between creating a modern venue, and preserving the patina \u0026amp; soul of the 140 year old building. Whenever possible we used original materials in order to maintain the spirit of the room, and blend new features into the old.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are reaching out to our fans, and new supporters to help us reach our goals. We are currently fighting a two fold battle to realize our vision. On the first front we are confronted with the daunting expenses of restoring, maintaining, and bringing up to code a large historic stone church. Secondly we are facing the financial challenge of providing the best possible entertainment while still keeping the costs to our patrons reasonable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have come a long way so far. We have replaced and repaired the floors throughout the building, added three ADA bathrooms, a full catering kitchen, upgraded the entire HVAC system and rewired the building. We have also added a full stage, sound booth, and bar, along with a professional sound and lighting system. We are currently working on adding full fire suppression in order to increase our capacity to a sustainable level, but we need your help to reach the finish line.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe that music and artistic expression is often the most direct conduit to experiencing, experimenting, and communing with the spiritual and mystic states of being.\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to provide a space, and an experience that provides both momentary sensory explosions, and everlasting memories.\u00a0We hope to become that venue that artists want to play, and the show that music lovers don\u2019t want to miss. We aim to be the circled date on the tour sheet, the reason to drive on a Tuesday night, and the cherished memory for fans and players alike.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
