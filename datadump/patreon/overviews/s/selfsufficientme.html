Consequently, we created a happier, healthier, and balanced lifestyle by supplementing the significant loss of income through growing our own food whilst still being able to afford to live in this modern money-driven society.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough my videos, writing, and now podcasts I want to share with you how I achieved\u00a0my goal of \"slowing life down a little\" by practising self-sufficiency so we, as a family, could spend more quality time together.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs at the writing of this post, I\u0027m at a crossroads whereby being a home-dad\u00a0for the past 10 years is coming to an end (our boys don\u0027t need someone at home as much now) so it makes sense that I\u00a0either get back into the workforce or stay devoted to, this, my new online career. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, if I go back to work for someone else I will still create content but it won\u0027t be as much as I would like and that\u0027s why your support is so important to me and why I decided to open a Patreon Page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s one thing growing our own food and being self-sufficient in that sense, but sharing this information through videos, articles, and other content takes time and a great deal of effort so I\u00a0do think to request\u00a0some funding via Patreon by those who support what I do is justifiable.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, my goal is to earn enough out of my online content creation to do this fulltime so I can create even MORE - this is what I truly LOVE doing, and I will do my best to keep creating content about self-sufficiency and other related subjects for as long as possible no matter what happens!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePersonally, I\u0027d rather rely\u00a0on my supporters than Google Ads to keep my content creation viable so when I reach my set goal here on Patreon I will remove display Ads from my Blog so that the online reading experience is cleaner. Promise!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEssentially, not only are you supporting my\u00a0work but\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eyou\u0027re helping to free me\u003c/strong\u003e from Google and the continuing concern about the fickle nature of Ad revenue on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for your support, words don\u0027t do justice when trying to\u00a0describe\u00a0 how much I really do appreciate it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003eMark :)\u003cbr\u003e"
