I am a father of one with another on the way and they are\nmy main motivation and inspiration. I am a coil builder, vape reviewer, photographer,\ncinematographer, zombie killer, and professional bare knuckle boxer. So, all in\nall, I build coils, love my family, make videos, kick ass, and take names. Not\nin any particular order. I am tremendously grateful that you have taken the\ntime to check out my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\nWhy I need your help.\u003c/div\u003e\n\nI do not get paid for making YouTube videos. Most assume\nYouTubers make great money from the adds that sometimes run at the beginning of\nthe video, but the reality is, that money doesn\u0027t even cover the cost of electricity\nit takes to film one tutorial. My content is free and will stay free. I take\ntremendous pride and work extremely hard to provide the absolute best quality\ncontent possible. And I love doing it. But I need your help to continue making\nit. It is very expensive and time consuming to make my videos, so I am asking my\nsubscribers to help offset that cost. Anything and everything helps! My family\nand I will be tremendously thankful for anything you can give. As a thank you\nfor your generosity, I will be providing different rewards for different tiers\nof pledges. These will include coils, exclusive access to monthly Skype\nhangouts and live streams, Patreon only content, one on one coil building\nlessons on Skype, and more! Check out the rewards on the right! Donations are made on a reoccurring basis, but you can cancel them at any time. For the\nprice of a cup of coffee, you can help me in my pursuit to provide awesome high\nquality content while continuing to teach and spread the life saving message of\nvaping. If you believe I provide you with value, please consider giving\nwhatever you see fit. With your help, I can keep creating and teaching while\nstill being able to provide for my family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eA Few of the Costs Involved in Making My Content:\u003c/div\u003e\n\nMonthly Editing Software Costs\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTime away from my family\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHours and hours of filming and editing\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Cost of wire, tools, and equipment\u003cbr\u003e\n\nVideo, Audio, Lighting, and other equipment required to make\nvideo\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCost of powering said tools and equipment\u003cbr\u003eCost of travel and living expenses\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\nGoals:\u003c/div\u003e\n\nUpgrading my slow, old computer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUpgrading video/ lighting/ audio equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCovering material costs. \u003cbr\u003eCover the cost of the time and effort required to produce the high quality videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\nMY VAPING STORY\u003c/div\u003e\n\nI was addicted to tobacco, drugs, and alcohol for most of my life, which lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. When I got sober in 2015, I wanted to quit\nsmoking as well, and I meant it. So, I retried all the usual methods that had\nfailed me throughout the years; hypnotism, gum, lozenges, will power, patches,\ncandy, and the list goes on. As always, none of it worked until the day my\nfriend suggested that I try vaping. I rolled my eyes and made fun of him, but I\nremember thinking, \"Well, he smoked as much as I did and here he is,\ncigarette free. No longer buying cancer on a daily basis and stinking like an\nash tray. Maybe there was something to these digital cloud cannons after\nall\".\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI bought his Kanger starter set, and eventually, the day came when I\nrealized I had gone through the whole day without smoking a cigarette. For the\nfirst time in my life I had hope that maybe, just maybe, I might actually be\nable to quit smoking.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt was a gradual process for me. I smoked for the first couple of\nmonths, but everyday I smoked fewer cigarettes. When I would start jonesing, I\nremember clutching that starter kit and hitting it over and over again until\nthe craving went away. But that\u0027s the thing, they eventually did!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nVaping was the only thing that worked when EVERYTHING else had\nfailed. Vaping saved my life. Vaping allows me to hug my family without\nsmelling like an ashtray. I am no longer tethered to cancer sticks. I no longer\nhave to step outside every hour to light up. No longer do I expose my son to\nthe second hand chemicals painted to my clothes and body by combustible\ntobacco. I can breathe. I can walk up stairs without losing breath. I can wake\nup in the morning without feeling like an elephant is sitting on my chest while\ncoughing up brown gunk. I am free. Not only did vaping save my life, it gave me\na quality of life I had long since given up hoping for. If I was able to get\nsober, turn my life around, and quit smoking, ANYONE can. There is hope. And\nthat is the message I am trying to spread. Thank you so very much for help and\nsupport!!!\u003cbr\u003e"
