    "summary": "Hey there friends! My name is SeanPaul McGuire and I have been the official writer, world builder, and Lore Master for the LARP game \u003ca href=\"http://www.emptythrones.com/\"\u003eEmpty Thrones\u003c/a\u003e since 2012. Before that I participated in the game as a player, although I did help write parts a few games and lore in an unofficial capacity since the ET began. And before I even knew what\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjH_XCm8XLI\"\u003eLARP\u003c/a\u003e was (here\u0027s a handy video, made by a friend of my if you are curious) I was running and building a world in Dungeons and Dragons- a game that has continued to run since we started it in 2008.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess what\u0027m I\u0027m saying is I love writing from the depths of my very soul. I have a fiery passion for the creation of worlds and scenarios and there is little greater feeling that to watch something that I have had a hand in creating bloom into something that goes beyond what I have ever hoped. So I decided it\u0027s time for me to take the next step into the vast world of writing: creating a novel all my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere are two HUGE answers to this. The first one is very simple: to generate some extra income. Despite the LARP and Dungeons and Dragons games I run being very successful, they are both non-income-generating passions. I LOVE doing those things; but they take time and effort. I spend more time writing and creating for those games than I do at my actual job. And it is PHENOMENALLY worth it. But a man has to eat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second reason is more personal. The story that I have begun to write I started just for me- like dozens of short stories and musing before it. But as I wrote it felt... larger. I quickly decided that it wanted and deserved to actually see the light of day. I grappled for a long time on how to make that happen. Hammer the whole thing through and publish it in secret? Show it to some select group of people and be happy with that? Both those ideas posed a very human problem: accountability and transparency. If no one knows about the story then I can just spirit it away if I suddenly become shy about it. If only people that know me read it -people who are my friends and family-, how likely are they to give me their truthful opinions? I not only want this story to live in the light of day but I want to grow as a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon seemed like a good way to kill two birds with one stone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I, the patron, get out of this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst off, for all donations you get my undying gratitude. It literally will not die. It\u0027s the Superman of gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately what you will be receiving is fiction- it starts with the story that I am working on now, but doesn\u0027t end there. With my fingers in so many pies there\u0027s a lot of variance in what you\u0027ll receive. My specialty is in Fantasy, but I have also written things in the genres of Sci-fi, Horror, Mystery, Poems; you name it, I have written something for it and will do so again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me you will also be able to help this story -and other that come after it- grow. With critiques and suggestions things only get bigger and better. You will be able to forever hold the knowledge that you had a hand in the creation of something that means to the world to people. And you will be helping a person achieve a dream that they have had since they first read a book. That person is me, just so you know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support the thoughts and worlds that live inside me can be shared to others. For some that might mean amusement -for others it may affect them deeper. But for me it means the world."
