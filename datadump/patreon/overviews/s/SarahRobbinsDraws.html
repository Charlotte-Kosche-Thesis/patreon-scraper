I\u0027m Sarah Robbins, a Baltimore-based illustrator and printmaker, and I love to make risograph prints!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eIn addition to freelancing full time as an illustrator, I co-founded PaperBase, a letterpress + risograph print shop and co-working space in Mt. Vernon where I teach printmaking and design to the Baltimore arts community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e(That\u0027s me up there, holding my latest inktober risograph printed zines!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eYou can check out more of my work on my \u003ca href=\"http://www.sarahrobbinsdraws.com/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sarahrobbinsdraws/\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SarahRobbinsDraws/\"\u003efacebook\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s a Risograph?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA Risograph is a magical copier machine-like box which creates screen-print like prints (see icon for reference). Each color is printed one at a time, and a reasonable amount of skill and patience is required to make a layered printed image. These machines were once solely in office spaces, cranking out fliers and memos, but in the last decade or so are used by artists to make vibrant artwork. I currently use an RP3700, and the color drums I have are Red, Medium Blue, Black, and Teal - which means I am limited to those colors (good thing I like them a lot!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to know more about the process,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://issue.press/printing\"\u003eI recommend this article by Issue Press.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEach month \u003c/strong\u003eI will be creating one new edition of risograph art prints JUST FOR YOU my dear patrons!
