When I\u0027m not making music and videos, most of my time and resources are spent on animal rescue. Mainly I rescue kittens because they raised their paws nicely and asked first. If there were zebras breeding in my parking lot, and they had raised their hooves I would being engaged with zebra rescue instead. My creations are mostly of the musical sorts with a lot of heart, a dash of comedy, partial nerdity, and enough cat hair to knit yourself a cat.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this, how you say, Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0Well, Leonardo da Vinci had the Medici, and Bach had The House of Esterhazy, but they are all dead now so I can\u0027t go asking them for money. Patreon allows you to directly financially support my art just like they did in the good ol\u0027 days. You can don your ermine robe and prance around your ballroom knowing that you are helping me to write, record, produce, tour, collaborate, and of course, save all the kittens I can. I will not be wearing a powdered wig or writing any oratorios, but I do have this plan to write The Goonies song cycle...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut I already sent you cat food, why should I become a patron?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eIf you sent me food, litter, or nipples this year, THANK YOU from the bottom my heart! Those kittens still need that support, and I\u0027m happy for all the drops in my bucket. If you\u0027d like to give a little more consistently or just hate feeding kittens, this is your big chance! I do a lot of freelance work as an independent creative type like teaching guitar, voice, and uke lessons. If I can afford to cut out one or two of those teaching days, I can use that time to MAKE STUFF FOR YOU and PLAY MORE FAR AWAY SHOWS! There\u0027s all sorts of creative projects (music videos, kitten sketch comedy) that I wind up pushing aside because student loans (*sad trombone).\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eHow, pray tell, does this work?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e You can pledge $1, $5, $10, or more per song/video that I release. After that, pat yourself on the back and call yourself the Medici. THEN you get prizes based on your level of support.\u00a0I suspect I will release 1-2 thingers per month, but you can cap your pledge at any amount any time. Patrons will have access to stuff NOBODY ELSE can see or hear,\u00a0like a picture of Moby licking her butt or a demos of brand new songs.\u00a0If you\u0027d rather not become a patron, it\u0027s coo. My new songs and videos will still be available on the usual medias for free. This Patreon is just a nice way for you to help me out if you can, and it motivates me to keep on keeping on the kitty train. CHOO CHOO, I mean, MEW MEW!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
