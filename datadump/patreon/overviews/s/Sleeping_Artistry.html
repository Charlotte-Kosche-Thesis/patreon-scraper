    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I and what am i doing here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been programming things for a while now, using programs to help me as i do so. About a year and a half ago, i decided to start making my own FREE adult gay/bisexual RPG game. So, over the past year, i\u0027ve been working on small things to try and improve my ability to make games, and, after a year of practice, i think it\u0027s finally time to see if i can do it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow is this going to work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe games that i am currently working on and will release will always be free. You don\u0027t have to pay to play them, you simply play them. That\u0027s it, that\u0027s all, period. The point of this Patreon is that i am hoping to give up my usual day job and focus on making these games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently i am Planning 3 different kinds of game updates:\u003cbr\u003e1) Small games \u003cbr\u003e2) Large ongoing game updates.\u003cbr\u003e3) Random freebies now and then. (stuff that i do NOT count as updates, but i\u0027m mentioning them here so as to avoid confusion). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSmall games, or the common \u0027rub\u0027 class of adult games. will be uploaded to my Tumblr, y-gallery or blogspot accounts on a regular basis. These are pretty much just things i enjoy playing and making from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe large ongoing game updates refer to updates to a large ongoing game i am currently working on (and hoping to start releasing soon). It\u0027s an oldschool rpg/adventure game, similar to the old hand held zelda games. In this perticular game, there is going to be a massive story line, but you will also get to have certain interactions with the characters and mobs on the side. It will also allow the player to catch certain monsters, train them, breed them, and some other random situations.\u00a0 The point is, it\u0027s basically a normal RPG/Adventure game with adult content added in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Random Freebies are things that don\u0027t count as an actual update and will never be charged to your patreon account, but as stated before, i figured that i would mention them here so that people don\u0027t freak out if i suddenly upload a dozen or so pictures from time to time, thinking that it might get charged to them. don\u0027t worry, they don\u0027t count and you will never get charged for them. they are merely me doing either random art, or concept art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does being a Patreon patron work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is very simple. First you sign up for it, filling out all the information needed. Then, you go to a content creator\u0027s page that you want to support, and you enter in the amount that you are willing to spend to help support the content creator of that Project. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest of all, Patreon has many security measures in place to protect you from scams and other issues. for instants, if you are willing to spend 5 dollars per content update, but don\u0027t want to spend any more then 10 dollars a month, you can actually set the max amount you are willing to pay a month as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, content creators often offer \u0027thank you\u0027 packages to people who support their works. What are these thank you packages? well, that depends on the Content Creator. For the thanks you\u0027s and reward for supporting me, head down to the payment/support amount and read their reward descriptions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the money going to be used for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Better software to make the games: Currently, all the programs i use to make the games, the art-programs, the sound programs, and the game engine are free programs, and like most free programs,\u00a0 they aren\u0027t as good as industry standards. \u003cbr\u003e2) Eventually, a better pc to work on: Currently, my pc is a piece of junk (it has only 1.8 Gigs of ram -_-) and i frequently have issues when trying to make the games, not from actually playing the games, but from running the programs that i need to make the games. \u003cbr\u003e3) to not be homeless (my normal work sucks). i currently don\u0027t make enough to live on my own, so i rent out from my relatives. no jokes please.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe ?) art work, - while i do currently make all the artwork myself,, i am fully aware that there are much better at drawing, coloring, and animating then i could ever hope to be. I haven\u0027t decided, but i might eventually want to commision some people to do some animations or artwork for the game. but that\u0027s for later, currently i\u0027m doing the artwork (and everything else) myself.\u003cbr\u003e"
