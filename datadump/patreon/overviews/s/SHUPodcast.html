Just like comics, there are many titles, under one banner, all part of one world. There are two main real play RPG games, and two patreon fan games that all take place in the same superhero world. We also produce scripted content from time to time as well. With more funding we can make bigger and better content that can grow the SHU world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery episode that goes on SHU has an original piece of art from the Game Mustard Happypuke!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can find all the action\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://shousestudio.libsyn.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003eWe Tweet\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SHUPodcast\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFor jumping on points, or questions about the show, feel free to contact us on twitter or Gmail at SHUpodcast@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe currently have two primary real play FATE powered games running, The Amberville City Heroes, and The Villain Underground!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmberville City Heroes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/039jPW2\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/039jPW2.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Amberville heroes are a group of stalwart crime fighters that work every day to protect the people of the city of Amberville, and sometimes the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eVillain Underground\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/sjpV6ya\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sjpV6ya.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe criminals of the villain underground are a collection of degenerates that are after glory, riches, and power.
