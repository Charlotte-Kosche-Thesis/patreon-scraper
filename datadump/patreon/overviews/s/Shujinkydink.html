    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to The Bonehawk Brotherhood!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts amazing to me still that this is all happening. This started out as a hobby I had over 10 years ago, and I never thought I\u0027d influence people the way I do, or bring people closer together through video games. I decided it\u0027s time to give back!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWith the help of Patreon I have created The Official Bonehawk Brotherhood! Patreon is a site that allows me to offer training or entertainment to my friends! and to get access to more things that the average viewer does not. It\u0027s an inner circle of sorts. There are 4 tiers to the Brotherhood depending on what your needs are. If you just want to be entertained, you can get access to 2 extra videos a week that a regular youtube subscriber would not see. If you want to level up and get better at the game, you can get access to exclusive tips and tricks videos and podcasts. If you\u0027re serious about being the best you can be, you can get access to a private one-on-one with me every month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you doing this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am VERY passionate about Fighting games, and specifically Mortal Kombat. Ever since I was a kid playing the first Mortal Kombat in the arcades I\u0027ve been in love with the series. After playing the game competitively since 2004, I\u0027ve gained all sorts of experiences and knowledge that I want to share with the world. There are so many things I\u0027ve learned over the years that I wish someone would have told me my first year of playing, and now with E-Sports getting the attention it is there\u0027s tons of opportunities for you guys to get in on it, and beat the competition by learning about the advanced stuff before anyone else.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I don\u0027t want to be the best and just enjoy entertainment?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou belong here too! I appreciate that not everyone wants to be the best, and heck some of you might be better than me already! You\u0027re still part of us though, your competitive level doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027m starting a new podcast every month to talk about Mortal Kombat, Injustice, Q\u0026amp;A or whatever you guys recommend me to talk about. As well, you get 2 extra videos a week to keep you entertained that the channel doesn\u0027t get. I want to give back to EVERYONE, and I mean that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for all your support, If it wasn\u0027t for you I wouldn\u0027t be able to do what I do. I\u0027d like to be the first to welcome you to the Bonehawk Brotherhood :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
