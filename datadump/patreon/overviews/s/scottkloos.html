    "summary": "In my experience it is disconnect from nature and the spiritual forces of life that leads to much of the depression, anxiety, and other psycho-spiritual maladies that plague so many members of our culture. I\u2019ve been honored to play a role in healing this rift by providing people with experiences in nature that inspire a remembrance of our fundamental connections to the Earth and cosmos. Another aspect of my mission is to write in ways that encourage the healing and transformation of the trauma and cultural imprinting that lead to feelings of separation. The main focus of my work is showing folks how to interact with plant consciousness and how to understand the spiritual aspects of plant medicine. Doing this work awakens reverence for the forces that sustain all forms of life in the universe, helps us recognize our inherent divinity, shows us who we truly are and what we are here to do, and demonstrates what it means to be good citizens of this planet. Through my work and writing I truly believe that I am helping inspire the formation of a society in which we are fully attuned to the spiritual and ecological matrices of the places where we live and helping to usher in a new form of culture that is informed by and organized according to the laws of nature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago I set aside time to write one of the many books that had been bubbling up from the depths of my creative well. Shortly thereafter I received an email from an editor at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.timberpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTimber Press\u003c/a\u003e asking me if I\u0027d like to write a field guide to medicinal plants of the Pacific Northwest for them. I am happy to say that after much work that book, \u003ca href=\"https://forestmedicine.net/store/pacific-northwest-medicinal-plants\"\u003ePacific Northwest Medicinal Plants: Identify, Harvest, and Use 120 Wild Herbs for Health and Wellness\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0will be published in May 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile writing this book I learned so much about the craft of writing and the dedication necessary to complete a work such as this. I am now ready to take what I\u0027ve learned and begin writing my next book which is tentatively titled \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReciprocal Illumination: The Practice of Psycho-spiritual Plant Medicine\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. I will also be writing essays and articles for publication in journals, magazines, and on online sites to further this mission. Topics will include\u00a0herbal medicine, wildcrafting, medicine making, the concept and practice of psycho-spiritual plant medicine, finding and developing relationships with plant allies, communing with plant teachers, wild nature initiation, remembering our wild and indigenous selves, and other aspects of the new emerging culture that is helping folks remember their relationships with the spirit forces of the land.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to being the author of\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://forestmedicine.net/store/pacific-northwest-medicinal-plants\"\u003ePacific Northwest Medicinal Plants\u003c/a\u003e, \u003c/em\u003eI am a plant medicine practitioner, ceremonialist, wildcrafter, medicine maker, and singer of plant songs. I have been working with the native plants of the Pacific Northwest since the late 90\u2019s. I am the founder and managing director of \u003ca href=\"http://forestmedicine.net/home\"\u003eThe School of Forest Medicine\u003c/a\u003e and the owner of \u003ca href=\"http://www.cascadiafolkmedicine.com/\"\u003eCascadia Folk Medicine\u003c/a\u003e, which supplies the community with high-quality, small-batch herbal extracts of the native plants of the region. I was one of the founding members of the \u003ca href=\"http://www.elderberryschool.com/\"\u003eElderberry School of Botanical Medicine\u003c/a\u003e in Portland, OR, and in my healing practice I work mainly with the psycho-spiritual aspects of plant medicine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour greatly appreciated contibutions will make it possible for this father of small children, husband, and facilitator of a burgeoning spiritual community to devote more time to writing.\u00a0Don\u0027t be shy\u2014every dollar counts.\u00a0In the same way the trees, plants, and all of the creatures of the forest nourish each other, we can, like Red Alder says, \"give more to receive more.\" Thank you so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
