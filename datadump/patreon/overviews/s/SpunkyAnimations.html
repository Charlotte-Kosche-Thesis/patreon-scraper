    "summary": "My name is Colton. I am an aspiring voice actor and animator who lives in Seattle, Washington. I love to make people laugh, speak to them through storytelling, and just making awesome videos in general. My main theme is video games, whether through parody, song, voice acting, or whatever. My niche is Source Filmmaker, and I have recently been taking my work a bit more seriously and making it more professional.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat started out as a simple Youtube channel filled with beyond stupid Team Fortress 2 videos has grown into something much more ambitious. I want to make more original (for the most part)\u00a0works while maintaining the video game theme. You can expect more original voiceovers, songs, \u00a0experimental video, as well as the occasional silly, fun video. As you can see from some of my more recent works, I plan on covering a variety of video games and not just TF2 (but you can definitely expect more TF2 videos in the future). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything helps. And I hope you will enjoy my stuff! Look forward to big things in the future!"
