    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat a great day to make a new friend!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am Samantha Covington, a small town girl from southern Utah. I have been drawing since I could hold a crayon and I have been improving ever since! I am a self taught artist who has had a lot of encouragement from family and friends. I love to draw and sketch in colored pencil, paint in watercolor and oils, and I have been creating a series of coloring books(available on amazon). I am a full time Mom, painter, gardener, equestrian and outdoors woman. And a part time housekeeper(yes, I said Part Time). I also craft jewelry (I love beads), sculpt, and work hard at anything FUN! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 I\u003c/strong\u003e especially love to draw and paint horses, unicorns, pegasus\u0027 \u0026amp; dragons. I also paint deer, elk, wildlife, landscapes, ocean scenes and whatever else catches my attention.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I am ready to commit more time to art and create on a more regular basis. With your help I will be able to give more back to you, my patrons. I will be raffling 1 painting every month that my goal of $500 is reached. With your help we can do that and I love knowing my paintings are being enjoyed and displayed on walls other than my own!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I chose the \u0027per creation\u0027 option with Patreon because I feel like I\u0027m earning your pledges. I am planning for at least 2 creations per month. Some months there may be more and other months there may be less. You have the option of how many creations per month you would like to fund. \u003cstrong\u003eI will be adding FREE content and posts often, but only 2-4 a month will be a \"Creation\" that will count as paid for post. \u003cem\u003eSo be sure to select how many a month you are willing to pay for\u003c/em\u003e so you keep within your budget\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0 When you choose to fund me by selecting a reward, that money helps buy painting and art supplies as well as any necessary equipment. If you enjoy my art and craft creations your friends might too! Please share my page and posts on your social media pages, that would help a bunch! \u003cbr\u003eThank you so much, I hope you come back and visit again soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
