So all will be handled personally!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow long have you been pursuing photography? How did you get into stock photography? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I\u0027m honest, I\u0027ve always had an interest in photography, but I grew up poor and I never thought I was creative enough to pursue it beyond just an outside observer. It wasn\u0027t until my husband bought me a camera in 2011 for Christmas that I started to give photography some serious thought. From there, I would do engagement shoots and I\u0027ve shot a couple of weddings as a second photographer. But I quickly learned that I was too anxious to be a wedding-focused photographer. (The thought of having a corrupted memory card or losing it or accidentally deleting wedding photos and relaying that information to a bride is something my nightmares are made of. Hahah.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, it wasn\u0027t until last year that I had the idea to enter the stock photography game, after I was looking for images for my own branding/design business and having a talk with my mentor and biz coach, Erika Ashley Couto. It was very apparent that stock images were not only cheesy, but completely lacking in diversity. So my coach encouraged me to put my stuff on sites like Creative Market, Pexels, and Unsplash. I got featured on every single site I put my photos on, so I took that as a sign that this was something I could actually pursue. Plus, not for nothing, it gave me such a huge confidence boost as a creative. I still struggle with feeling less-than because a lot of my friends that I admire are some of the best photographers I\u0027ve ever seen and it\u0027s strange to consider myself any where near as good as them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you shoot with?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou might be surprised to hear this, but I shoot mostly on my iPhone 7s! I shoot, edit, and upload all from my phone! I own a Canon t2i, but unfortunately, it\u0027s too bulky and it doesn\u0027t have wifi capabilities, which isn\u0027t something I was looking for when I first started shooting. However, now at this level, I realize how important it is for me to be able to upload my photos to Google Drive or Dropbox in an instant. I hope to upgrade my phone and storage space once I meet some of my higher Patreon goals!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill I be getting hi res images to download if I become a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes! Each month, I\u0027ll be sending a zip file of each stock image pack for you to directly download! Instead of searching through a stock library, you\u0027ll be able to quickly search your own personal files for the perfect image! And if you become part of The Watcher\u0027s Council - Tier 3 - you\u0027ll be able to vote on what next month\u0027s theme should be, which will be great if you have certain images created for you! But the ultimate way to get the exact images you want for your blog or business is by becoming part of The Scooby Gang - Tier 5 - but be sure to get in ASAP, because I don\u0027t have plans to take on more than 5 Patrons at a time, to ensure that the quality of my work remains high!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are some other projects you\u0027re working on? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond photography, I\u0027m also a gamer and a creative writer! I would love to grow this patreon so that I can also stream more! Right now I barely have time to play games, unless it\u0027s with my husband for a few matches! Hahah. I\u0027m also working on tv pilot series that has similar themes of diversity and addresses a lot of the problems plaguing not only black women, but inner city communities and society at large. But you\u0027ll just have to wait until it comes to a silver screen near you to hear more. ;)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s up with those Tier titles, tho?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh hey, thanks for noticing! I\u0027m a huge nerd, if you couldn\u0027t tell - and Buffy, the Vampire Slayer is my number one fandom. So it felt only appropriate to name my tiers after a show that\u0027s had a huge influence on my life. It\u0027s definitely not without flaws and in hindsight I can see where it\u0027s super problematic and where it\u0027s creator has failed all of his fans by being a performative feminist ally to further his own selfish agendas. But I\u0027ll always support SMG, Charisma, Alyson, etc. regardless - those are the people I choose to focus on instead.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
