    "summary": "Welcome to Sexually Awkward!  I\u2019m Dr. Sarah, and well, I\u2019m sexually awkward.  I\u2019ve created this project to address the basic question: How can men and women in long term relationships have the kind of sex life where they can\u2019t keep their hands off each other, no matter how many years they\u0027ve been together? \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have a Ph.D in Sociology with a Minor in Gender \u0026amp; Women\u2019s Studies, I\u2019m a Certified Sexologist and have worked in the adult film industry both in front of and behind the camera for 7 years as \u2018Kelsey Obsession.\u2019  You might think I know everything there is to know about sexuality, but the truth is, I have more questions than answers and I\u2019ve yet to find a single resource that has addressed all of my own awkwardness with sex!  I\u2019ve had to go to great lengths just to understand what\u2019s happening in my own bedroom and how to be truly happy in my sex life - and I\u2019m still learning!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSexually Awkward is for both you AND me - because while I don\u0027t have all the answers yet, my 13+ years of research and personal experience has led me to believe - the answer to most your sex problems is you.  It is, in fact, learning to truly BE you is what will make you happy, no matter who you\u2019re with.  And when you are really you, and they are really them - that\u2019s where all that amazingly orgasmically awesome magic happens.  Yeah, I know, it sounds overly simplistic - but simple ain\u2019t easy. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThink about it:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 How can you feel like your partner really loves you, if you\u2019re not being you?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 Who is really having your sex life - YOU - or who you THINK you\u2019re supposed to be in order to be accepted and get that sex in the first place?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 And even if you DO have an orgasm, how could you possibly ever feel deeply satisfied when you\u2019re not even being real about what you\u2019re truly hungry for or why?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDr. Seuss says, \u201cWe\u0027re all a little weird, and life\u0027s a little weird. \u00a0And when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them in mutual weirdness and call it love.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd THEN we\u0027ll live happily ever after\u2026 in bed :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003eWhile I honestly think most humans alive could benefit from what we\u0027re talking about here, not everyone agrees. \u00a0The content I\u0027m producing isn\u0027t \u0027advertiser friendly,\u0027 so every video + podcast is broadcast for free. \u00a0Which is awesome that anyone can access it, because I believe in freedom of information and don\u0027t think people should need a graduate degree to find real info to help their sex life. \u00a0But let\u0027s be real, videos don\u0027t just fall out of the sky! \u00a0It takes time to research and create, not to mention my decade+ of education and experience prior. \u00a0So if you\u0027re a fan of the project and relate my own awkward troubles and possibly have a few of your own, I will forever be grateful for your support. \u00a0You allow me to be me, and in so doing, hopefully I will help you to be more you. \u00a0:)\u003cbr\u003e"
