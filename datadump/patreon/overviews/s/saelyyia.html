My name is Saelyyia; costumer, gamer, all-around nerdy type, and a modern fairy. I started out very young helping create costumes and props for stage performances. As I got older my love of the fantasy genre and overly creative mind took me in the direction of costuming and cosplay, so when I\u0027m not sitting down to play Skyrim or World of Warcraft, I\u0027m coming up with new costumes and working on fun projects in my crafting room.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I love most about Patreon is that not only does it allow for me to share my work with those who appreciate it, but it allows me to connect with my audiences on a deeper, more personal level. I have a direct link to my fans, and a home to share all my wonderful creations with those that want to keep up with them. And \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e have access to all kinds of behind the scenes insights and get to collect special content that I work hard to design and create just for my Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/kuOD1EB\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kuOD1EB.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eRewards and You\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLet\u0027s start with the basics, my feed is split into two different sections. For $5 a month you gain access to the SFW area of my feed where I will be sharing tutorials on items I create, behind-the-scene contents, WIP pictures, fun selfies and more. This is a great option if you are curious about what goes into what I do. \u00a0However,\u00a0for those looking for something a bit more, there is the other half of my feed which can be unlocked for $15 a month. This would be the NSFW side of my feed and includes the less family friendly things that go on in my life. From saucy \u0026amp; scantly clad selfies to the more risqu\u00e9 updates, this feed has it all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also offer varying levels that include Polaroids and prints to choose from, and for those that stick it out long term, you guys get special birthday cards.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMy Goals\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI do plan to add more tiers and rewards down the road as I grow and my Patreon gets bigger. And since I know how exciting it can be to see where someone is planning to go here are just a few of the things I would like to be able to offer you in the future:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n1) Boudoir Sets\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\tIt is my hope that someday down the line I will be able to add a boudoir tier set which will be its own digital photo-set separate from the current Digi-Pack option. Some months this will be incorporated into the overall costume design, and some it will be its very own costume\n\u003c/div\u003e\n2) Streams\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\tOne thing I have always loved is watching live streams of other costumers, cosplayers, and crafters and would love to set up a monthly stream for my patrons to ask questions, and share in my creative process while I work.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/Yezqngo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Yezqngo.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAt the end of the day...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen all is said and done there is never an obligation to donate. I will never stop creating and sharing those creations on my social media so if you aren\u0027t interested in being a part of the magic directly, then that is completely okay. My feelings won\u0027t be hurt. However, for those who do chose to become part of the Patreon family I am beyond grateful for your love and aid in my journey to leave the world a more magical place than I found it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\tFeel free to follow me on my other platforms.
