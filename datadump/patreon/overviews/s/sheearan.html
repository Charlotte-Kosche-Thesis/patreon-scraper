    "summary": "TL;DR \u2013 If you think I do awesome things, feel free to throw money at me. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a software engineer, and I\u0027m disappointed in my industry and in the world it\u0027s helped to create. I\u0027m disappointed in the products we provide for consumers, which exploit psychology to make us addicted and miserable to feed into profits. I\u0027m disappointed in the work environments we\u0027ve created, which demand more hours at less consistent times and have normalized unhealthy emotional states and behavior patterns. I\u0027m tired of everyone treating each other as numbers, as metrics, as cogs in a machine, as resources to wring profit from. I know I can\u0027t fix the whole world, but I\u0027m hoping I can make a small difference, somehow, for someone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create software that excites me, that I believe contributes to creating a better world. I want to write about my experiences, my challenges, and my successes in hopes that it will pave a path for others to pursue a more values-driven, compassionate course. I want to help people. I want to experiment with anything I can think of that uses my skills to make a world where real, vulnerable people can interact with one another in healthier, more authentic ways. Even if it\u0027s just a little bubble where people can escape from the rest of the world to do that. I don\u0027t know what that looks like yet, and I\u0027m at even more of a loss on how to approach monetizing it. Especially since most of the current common monetization models aren\u0027t particularly healthy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis account is my way of telling myself I believe I am enough and that I add value to the world. It\u0027s permission to believe in my ideas and spend time and energy creating and sharing things that are important to me. Before anything else, it\u0027s a choice to become my own patron. It\u0027s a way to ask others to believe with me. Choosing to continue believing in a better world is sometimes lonely and discouraging. If I can get some support, it helps to combat that and remind me that others have confidence in me and appreciate that I keep trying. It helps me continue to have the courage of my convictions. Sometimes it\u0027s terrifying to walk away from things that aren\u0027t right, and knowing there\u0027s a community there for me makes it a little easier. Finally, I\u0027m sure that whatever I end up making as a side project, it will end up having actual monetary costs for servers and such. I\u0027m hopeful that money from this can cover those costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore specifically, I hope to make:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Sheearan\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSoftware\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Sheearan\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eI\u0027m not sure exactly what this software will do yet.

Please be aware of that when setting up your pledge, and cap your monthly amount accordingly if multiplying your per-release pledge by 4-5 doesn\u0027t fit in your budget. No hard feelings, I appreciate anything you choose to spend on me. I chose to do per-release rather than per-month because I\u0027m not sure yet how consistent I\u0027ll actually be about releasing things, and I don\u0027t want to feel like I\u0027m cheating people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to offer support in forms that aren\u0027t monetary, the following are also things I\u0027d currently appreciate:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eShare the link to my Patreon with others you think it might resonate with\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eClicking the \"recommend\" button for my Medium posts that you like\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSuggestions for other products/companies/people that belong on my list of positive influences in the world\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePutting me in contact with middle school, high school, or early college students that would like tutoring in math or computer science.
