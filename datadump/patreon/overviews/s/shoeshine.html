It\u0027ll have you rolling in the aisles. You\u0027ll want to buy aisles so you can roll in them. But instead of spending all that money on aisles, you should pledge some here. Because making genius level, 190 IQ comedy is tough expensive work. You can\u0027t imagine what it\u0027s costing me just to type this right now. You know how much my time is worth?\u003cbr\u003eSo if you like the show (and, you do) toss a few robot credits our way (INSIDE JOKE). You\u0027ll be glad you did. Be sure to check out our amazing goals and rewards!"
