It will only ever use d6\u0027s, d8\u0027s, and d10\u0027s. Not every single role allows for explosions to happen but it will be most of them.\u00a0 If you don\u0027t know exploding dice is just when you roll the max number it lets you roll another die with no limit on how many can be rolled and usually, with this system as well, the numbers on the dice just count toward success and failure.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eSo I don\u0027t need money from anyone to make this.\u00a0 I am not asking for patrons to help me do this full time.\u00a0 I love building and creating games in this way. What I can not do without the help of many is pay the artists to make any of this visually come alive.\u00a0 Commisioning art and maps and tilesets for all of this will take quite some time and funds.\u00a0 I am not an artist but would love to be enabling artists also in the tabletop community.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any of this sounds like a Game you would like to play then please feel free to join up for just \u003cstrong\u003e$1 \u003c/strong\u003ea month and you will get access to a discord just for these wonderful patrons and a look at all the rules I have ready, along with all the updates."
