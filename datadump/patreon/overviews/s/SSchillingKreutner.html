Trying to keep quiet at the buttcrack of dawn was pointless: February wind caught at the door\u0027s seams, rattling so it echoed across the yard like Bring Your Kid to Work Day in the philharmonic\u0027s percussion section. I flipped my hoodie up, but not because I was cold. It had been the warmest week since I moved to Maryland, and I\u0027d already lived there for nine years with my kids, a cat or two and various, rotating rodents.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eOne rodent, in particular, worried me that morning.

There was something to be said for unemployment and having enough time on my hands to write... if it weren\u0027t for the bills.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe bills had to be paid and the rodent had to be fed. Who knew what would happen if Clio skipped a meal? I\u0027d disabled her ocular lasers, true, but I hadn\u0027t quite managed to teach her that humans weren\u0027t prey, yet.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTaming Onirian Death Squirrels was a thankless job but somebody had to do it, otherwise we\u0027d be overrun. I approached the cage cautiously, calling out so she knew it was me. \"Wakey-wakey, Clio. I has bweakfast. Oh!\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eShe hung upside down, batlike, her head just visible over the door and her bushy tail curled under her chin, staring significantly. Death squirrels don\u0027t glare. They\u0027re too cunning for that. They lull their prey by seeming fluffy and cute, and begging for veggie treats. It\u0027s all a deception: they prefer epidermis to eggplant...\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* * *\u003c/div\u003e(Glances up and blinks when someone clears his throat.) Oh! Hello, gentle reader. Sorry. I got carried away. I guess I\u0027m supposed to explain what I do and why you should want to patronize me. (Wait, I think I meant \"be my patron.\" If you want to patronize me, that will run an extra twenty bucks.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a fiction writer, you see--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s that you say? You already figured that out from my story? Oh, my. You seem to have gotten the wrong impression. That wasn\u0027t fiction. It was yesterday\u0027s diary entry. If you want fiction, you\u0027ll have to subscribe :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo let\u0027s talk, instead, about why I\u0027m here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecent life changes have made it more difficult to write. That doesn\u0027t mean that I\u0027ve stopped (you haven\u0027t read my obituary, yet), but it delays things. With enough subscriptions, I can not only continue to write novels, but can also expand and be more prolific--that means you can read and enjoy more of my work more often. No matter how little you decide to give, you\u0027ll support this effort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow your subscription works:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGlance to the right and you\u0027ll see a column of \"rewards\" tiers. So, here\u0027s why I\u0027m not calling them rewards: you pay me to write and I hand over that writing. What you get (and how much) depends on what you subscribe to. The complexity of what you see on this page depends on what you\u0027re paying me to read--sort of how a daily newspaper \"funnies\" section is cheaper than a comic book (and the Sunday paper costs more than the daily), and a comic book is cheaper than a graphic novel: you get full value for your money, regardless. I\u0027m not asking for charity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s actually hard work.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave you ever written a 500 word essay for an English class? (If you got higher than a C on it) how long did it take you? 500 words is a blog post. Now multiply that by five, and you\u0027ll have a short story. If you were my boss, you would basically be paying me 25 cents per hour, but invite three friends and together, the four of you are paying me\u00a0$1 an hour. 100 subscribers equals $25 per hour (wow, wouldn\u0027t that be nice?) but of course, with 100 subscribers reading, I can invest more hours into writing and you get more so it\u0027s a win-win. You can subscribe for only one month, if that\u0027s what you want--but wouldn\u0027t you rather keep subscribing and reap the benefits?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you \u003cem\u003eenjoy \u003c/em\u003ereading what I write for you, is worth 25 cents?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eInvite a friend!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf a friend subscribes because you referred him/her, make sure to message me names.
