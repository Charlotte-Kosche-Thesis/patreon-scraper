Hi there! My name is \u003cstrong\u003eRichard Pallo\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027m an illustrator, fine artist, and designer, and in my free time I\u0027m a cartoonist. Since I first came up with the concept for \u003cstrong\u003e\"Lost and Found\"\u003c/strong\u003e in my senior year of college, the story and characters have been bouncing around in my head, finding their way to paper here and there, but not getting the attention they deserve. Since then, I have been making a living off of commissioned work, drawing for individuals and producing content featuring their characters and their ideas. Paying the bills this way doesn\u0027t leave much time for more personal projects, though, and even though I know there is an audience for this story, I can\u0027t afford to spend additional time drawing stuff that doesn\u0027t help me keep on living and give it the attention it deserves... \u00a0so the idea has stayed dormant. That\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(204,193,217);\"\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a bit like an on-going KickStarter campaign. With Patreon, fans of my work can contribute whatever amount they\u0027d like, helping creators like me be able to reliably produce what we love. This campaign is set up so that each pledge is on a per-page basis (you can set a monthly cap, too, if you\u0027d like) so that I\u0027ll be able to spend more time making works for a general audience, and not relying solely on personal commissions. With the help of my patrons (like you, hopefully), I should be able to devote part of each month solely to writing and drawing for \u003cstrong\u003e\"Lost and Found.\" \u003c/strong\u003eThe more support I get, the more of my time I\u0027ll be able to devote to bringing this world to life through the graphic novel, and eventually, other mediums as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(229,224,236);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(204,193,217);\"\u003eHow This Works:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon, you can pledge to contribute a \u003cstrong\u003ecertain amount per page\u003c/strong\u003e to keep me working on this project. If I don\u0027t make anything in a month, you don\u0027t pay anything. Even a $1 pledge will get you access to each page as I create them, before each chapter is completed and released to the public. Each page I create and upload will automatically earn me your pledge amount (up to the cap that you set) and you\u0027re free to cancel at any time. You\u0027ll only be charged once at the end of each month, and you can edit your pledge, cap the amount, or cancel your pledge any time. (Check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq?ftyp=patrons\"\u003ePatreon\u0027s FAQ\u003c/a\u003e for more info.)\u00a0In addition to having exclusive early access to the comic that you helped fund, my Patrons will be eligible for some additional perks. I haven\u0027t decided on what those perks might be, but ideas I\u0027ve had so far are things like:\u003cbr\u003e- Your name in the credits of the comic (in the digital version and any print versions I end up making)\u003cbr\u003e- Prints of pages or panels of the comic, signed by me (if you care about that kind of thing)\u003cbr\u003e- Patron-only livestreams where you can watch me work on the comic, and maybe get some sketches done just for you \u003cbr\u003e- And, obviously, I\u0027m open to suggestions but it all depends on you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(204,193,217);\"\u003eFinally...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wouldn\u0027t be able to make a living doing this without the constant support and encouragement of all my fans, watchers, and friends. To all of those who\u0027ve kept me financially stable (-ish) for the past few years, I want to say \u003cstrong\u003ethank you\u003c/strong\u003e for your support, for your friendship, and for giving me the opportunity to keep doing what I love! I hope that, with this project, I\u0027ll be able to reach out to an even wider audience, and it\u0027s thanks to you guys that I\u0027ve been able to make it this far.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(204,193,217);\"\u003eFAQ: \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are pledges set up per-page instead of monthly? \u003c/strong\u003eAs much for my benefit as yours! The pledges are set up to be PER COMIC PAGE, meaning if I don\u0027t make the comic, I don\u0027t get paid for the comic! Please take this into consideration when making your pledge and setting your monthly cap (though I don\u0027t expect to be making more than a couple pages each month). I don\u0027t plan to nickel-and-dime my patrons, so I\u0027m only going to charge when completed comic pages are uploaded.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf I don\u0027t support the comic, will it still get made? \u003c/strong\u003eYes, but obviously not as fast. Without support, I\u0027m only able to work on the comic in my free time, but as I get more support, I will be able to work on the comic when I would otherwise be looking for freelance/contract work elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you going to leave your other sites and only post here? \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m still going to work on stuff that ISN\u0027T \"Lost and Found\" so I\u0027m going to remain active everywhere, and you\u0027ll still be able to contact me everywhere you\u0027ve seen me before. In other words, I\u0027m not going anywhere, I\u0027m going everywhere. EVERYWHERE. @_@\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you going to stop doing other art? \u003c/strong\u003eNo way! I love this comic, but even if it becomes wildly successful I\u00a0won\u0027t stop doing other art; after all, drawing is what I love to do! Freeing up time to work on this project means I won\u0027t be looking for work in quite as many places, but I\u0027ll keep taking commissions as usual and non-Patreon-based sketch streams and gaming streams will always be part of what I do. I love making things for other people. To me, this project is a way to help me make something of my own and share it with all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
