Despite not reaching very far into the competition, the way that people connect with television was obvious that it is a powerful medium for education.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough many twists of fate I am now involved with producing content to promote awareness of the British Hemp Industry.\u003cbr\u003eThe British Hemp industry has been under scrutiny from abroad by countries that already have an established and profitable industry, such as Canada and Israel, because we are being viewed as the next country to enjoy a Hemp and Cannabis boom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA report coming out of Harvard Business school in the US, has clearly stated that if the united kingdom does not fashion a suitably robust industrial response to the Hemp industrial revolution taking place globally; Then these more established nations will do what the United States did when the internet opened in 1991, they swept in and became the only Internet Service Providers for a number of years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe difference today is that Hemp has 25,000 current uses, including but not exclusive to, fibre, paper, fuel, food, composite plastics, bio degradable packaging, clean energy, air and soil purification, carbon locking and the list literally goes on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy getting out on the ground and recording what is going on in the UK currently with the Hemp industry, as well as abroad, I want to wake the public up to the very real opportunities to us all that Hemp presents.\u003cbr\u003eImagine sustainable housing made from Hempcrete that don\u0027t cost the earth and actually improve the environment around them, well I have approval to film such things and more, and with your support I can start straight away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI came to Patreon as a way of gaining peer support for my work and to allow me to leave my job in construction, and focus 100% on getting the right content out in a timely manner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help I can start work on the mountain of films already requested by companies all over the UK.\u003cbr\u003e"
