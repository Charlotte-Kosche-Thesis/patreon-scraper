However, I only really \ncame into my love of all things fiber-related when I moved to Toronto \nafter being away for school. . . and discovered that Toronto is a Fiber \nArtist\u0027s haven! There is so much fiber-y awesomeness here, I just haven\u0027t looked back since!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m also a strong believer that the fiber arts are accessible to absolutely anyone, it\u0027s just a question of how.\u00a0 I get very sad when people tell me \u0027oh, I can\u0027t knit\u0027, because I want to tell them, \u0027yes, you most definitely can!\u0027\u00a0 So part of this Patreon page is a quest to bring all the fiber arts (not just knitting), to the people who think they aren\u0027t good enough/skilled enough, to enjoy them!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, now that you know a bit about me, my goals, and how to find me, what is this \u0027Patreon\u0027 thing and how does it work?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://images4-b.ravelrycache.com/uploads/SerenaDarrin/512371872/IMG_0164_medium2.JPG\" style=\"width: 252px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon\n is a crowdfunding platform specifically geared towards artists.  It\u0027s a\n way for people who love something to be able to support that something \nwithout having to shell out lots of money, and get some cool things in \nreturn.\u00a0 At it\u0027s simplest, it\u0027s a crowdfunded version of artistic patronage.\u00a0 It\u0027s designed so that there\u0027s no risk to you, the patron, and you can modify or cancel your pledge at any time.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOk, now\u00a0that you know a bit about what Patreon is, what do you get for becoming a Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eCool Stuff:\u00a0 There\u0027s lots of cool stuff for Patrons here (well, at least I think it\u0027s cool!)\u00a0 Signed books, access to test-knit drafts, Live Q \u0026amp; A, knitting classes, custom made garments, and so much more!\u00a0 You can check it out in the Rewards Bar on the right!\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAwesome Community:\u00a0\u00a0I really do love the fiber community.\u00a0 And I\u0027m amazed at the ability to create a little corner of the internet with the people who really do share my passion for all things fiber-y!\u00a0 \u00a0When people ask me about fiber/fiber arts, I love that engagement, and I\u0027ve found I can do it online just as well as in person. I really love sharing my love of knitting and other fiber arts, in a space that is as supportive and awesome as I can make it, and Patreon is one of the best places on the internet to do that!\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eResource Creation:  Tutorials, Free Patterns, and other awesome stuff form the backbone of an awesome community.\u00a0 With Patrons backing me, I can continue to make more free things, and I can afford to give away more free patterns to the community!\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAccessibility:\u00a0 I really want to make the fiber arts accessible to everyone, and sometimes, frustratingly, that requires money and resources.\u00a0 Some of it I\u0027m doing now, (accessible knitting patterns with charts and written instructions, captioned videos) and some will happen as I can gather more resources (real-time captioning, material in multiple languages, alternate fiber arts tools,) So you\u0027re joining one of the most accessible fiber communities that I know of (and yes, I know that Patreon as a platform has some issues with accessibility, but I do my best within the confines of the platform!).\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eMy everlasting thanks for a less erratic income stream!\u00a0 I\u0027d be lying by omission\u00a0if I ignored this one.\u00a0 Publishing patterns, teaching knitting classes, that\u0027s all awesome stuff that I absolutely love to do, but like most artists, it\u0027s erratic income, and often it\u0027s income below minimum wage.\u00a0 Commissioned knitwear often ends up being well below minimum wage, and pattern sales take a while to build to a profit - on average, I need to sell about 45 patterns copies per month just to cover the cost of production expenses.\u00a0 I rely on 3rd-party publication to help fill those gaps, which is great -- I\u0027ve worked with some amazing companies and dyers, but, again, very erratic when it comes to income. So, having sustainable, regular income would be a major boost (and yes, it would keep me in yarn, too!)\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tNow let me set something straight:  This isn\u0027t \u0027help I need money!\u0027, I promise. (I want to be clear here, because it\u0027s easy to get confused on the internet!)   Rather, this is the answer to the amazing people who\u0027ve asked if there\u0027s another way to support me; and it allows me to give them awesome stuff in return.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://images4-b.ravelrycache.com/uploads/SarahDawns/513942495/Spiralling_Star_Mitts_With_Background_medium2.JPG\" style=\"width: 218px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u00a0And I\u0027d like to \nhope I can provide cool and awesome rewards to my various patrons. (On \nthat note, if there\u0027s something you\u0027d like to see me offer as a rewards \ntier that I don\u0027t offer, feel free to drop me a line with the idea! I \ncan\u0027t guarantee a \u0027yes\u0027, but I\u0027ll definitely at least give a listen.)\u00a0 And, given that Patreon makes it super easy to edit or cancel a pledge, there\u0027s no risk there to you in becoming one of my Patreons. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tSo now, all that being \nsaid, if you can\u0027t/aren\u0027t willing/aren\u0027t comfortable supporting me on \nPatreon, please, please, don\u0027t worry.  I completely understand.
