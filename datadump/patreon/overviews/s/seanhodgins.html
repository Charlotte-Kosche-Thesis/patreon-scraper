However, patrons will occasionally get early access images, behind the scenes, and other things of that sort, just to show my appreciation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me and my projects I will be able to continue coming up with new and interesting ideas that you and your friends will be able to learn to make.\u003cbr\u003e"
