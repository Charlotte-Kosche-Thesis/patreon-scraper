My first book, \u003cem\u003eGold in the Days of Summer\u003c/em\u003e, was the children\u0027s category winner for the 2014 International Rubery Book Awards and an International Book Award Children\u0027s Fiction Finalist. My first full-length novel, \u003cem\u003eThe Last Letter,\n\u003c/em\u003eis a semi-autobiographical account of my experiences living with \nChronic Lyme disease. \u003cem\u003ePublisher\u0027s Weekly\u003c/em\u003e recently hailed it as \"an exceptional debut [written] with authenticity.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy published books include coming-of-age stories of nostalgia: A twelve-year old girl resisting life\u0027s changes during the summer of 1979. A teenager trying to control her reality while a mysterious illness threatens to tear her world apart at the height of the millennium. An orphaned runaway who finds refuge in a small town on her way home to her brother in 1955 (available Fall 2018). These characters who aren\u0027t great heroes but who fight their own battles\nare what inspire me. Set in the past, these stories remind us of those simpler times, bearing their own set of challenges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027m not writing my own books, I work as a consultant, \neditor, and creative coach at Brown Beagle Books. Services include everything from publishing consultation to help writers determine if indie publishing is their best path, all-levels of editing to help spruce up those manuscripts, and creative coaching to break free from blocks and encourage the writer inside all of us. I also do a little ghostwriting on the side--Shh... Don\u0027t tell!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://twentyorsomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Patreon4.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to identify myself as all of the above--author, editor, creative. But there\u0027s one identifier that\u0027s missing from the list: Lyme disease patient and advocate. I was misdiagnosed for over fifteen years with various conditions until I found my health in serious decline in the spring of 2012. I fought for a diagnosis by being my own health advocate. Now I\u0027m an advocate for others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut my Lyme journey isn\u0027t over. I was in treatment for two and a half years, during which time I built my business, Brown Beagle Books, and self-published \u003cem\u003eGold in the Days of Summer\u003c/em\u003e thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign. After a relapse nine months after reaching remission, I resigned from my corporate job to focus on healing, but due to reinfection, that journey has been longer and more difficult than I ever could imagine. Still, I pushed forward in trying to create a future for myself. I took on editing clients to try to supplement my lost income. I worked on my fiction in the small pockets of time when my mind felt clear but my body kept me bedridden. In September 2016, I published my Lyme story, \u003cem\u003eThe Last Letter\u003c/em\u003e--wrapped in a fictional narrative so that understanding the devastation of Lyme disease could be accessible to all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[To learn more about my Lyme story, visit my website: \u003ca href=\"https://www.susanpogorzelski.com/lymebrave\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.susanpogorzelski.com/lymebrave\u003c/a\u003e or read more about the personal impact of Lyme on \u003ca href=\"https://www.susanpogorzelski.com/blog\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e.]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why Patreon, and why now? Here\u0027s where we get even more personal...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I\u0027m still in treatment and experiencing flares in my health that keep me in bed for days at a time, I\u0027m still not able to work a part-time job with any consistency. Believe me. I\u0027ve tried. While I\u0027m able to sustain some of my basic needs through family support and government assistance while I wait for a disability hearing sometime in 2018, the bills keep piling up, the mortgage reminders are coming in, and the cache of supplements helping to support my immune system is running low. In short: I need a place to turn for this temporary support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWait... Temporary?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eYep. Temporary. I\u0027m stubbornly independent--you can blame my genes for that trait--so my goal is to do a trial run here at Patreon for three-six months with the possibility of extending that depending on response and my own creative output. In the meantime, I\u0027m working hard to continue to build my business through my books and services so I\u0027ll be able to sustain myself financially in the future. Patreon is intended as an alternative solution in the interim while allowing me to give back through my creative work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich leads me to...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://twentyorsomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Patreon7.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout history, authors (and artists, musicians) have sustained \nthemselves thanks to the patronage of others in an \"I create for you, \nyou support me\" exchange. It\u0027s with this exchange in mind that I\u0027m able \nto swallow my pride and ask for your help. With Patreon, backers (that\u0027s you!) can donate once or monthly to help me meet my financial needs (medicine, mortgage, bills). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut wait, there\u0027s more...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere at Patreon, it\u0027s about more than one-way financial support. We\u0027ll be creating a relationship between donor and creator.

In the past ten years alone, I\u0027ve written \nhundreds of blog posts, dozens of poems, and a handful of books--two of \nwhich have been published. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s a lot of words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor \nevery page I publish, there\u0027s hundreds that have never seen the light of\n day. For every idea I have, dozens more never make it to fruition. For \nevery poem I scribble in a notebook, full verses get thrown in the \ntrash. I\u0027ve created a lot over the years. Now I\u0027ll take those pages and \nideas out of the proverbial drawer and share them with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://twentyorsomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Patreon8.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is what you\u0027ll get: Never-before-seen content.
