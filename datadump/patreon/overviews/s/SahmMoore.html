I wasn\u0027t sure where or how I fit in. So, I fell in love with books and worlds I so easily drifted into. Looking back, I think being able to leave my body in reality and escape with my mind into the universes created by those books was the only thing that kept me sane. Eventually, that lead to writing that I never shared with anyone. Not until my mid-twenties did I let another person read a thing I\u0027d written.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA bit of an anxiety-prone chameleon and semi-only child, I\u0027m good at being a wallflower and notoriously territorial, but little by little I\u0027ve begun to share my stories. I\u0027m a sappy romantic that can be a bit pessimistic, so I like my Romance peppered with some Action to keep things from getting to Nicholas Sparksy. Also, as the result of a recent dream after watching The Handmaid\u0027s Tale, I\u0027ve begun to dabble in Speculative Fiction\u2013thanks, Margaret Atwood!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eBut enough about me, right?!\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/5a/fb/aa/5afbaa1854199821c8226da5575290f5.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ci style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s all about you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIf you take the time to read any of these words I\u0027ve agonized over, cut, pondered and re-written.... thank you.
