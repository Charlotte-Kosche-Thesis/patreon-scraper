    "summary": "We\u0027ve been very fortunate\nto be able to create action snarky, weird videos that people actually watch,\nbut we\u0027re never satisfied to settle where we\u0027re at. We always want to continue\nto grow and expand our production lines, whether it is upgrading equipment,\nhiring actors, renting filming locations, etc. And most importantly we always\nwant to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ssedshafilms.com/arts-film-academy.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eempower and professionalize the Uganda Film Industry through our Filmmaking training Programs\u003c/a\u003e, We also\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ssedshafilms.com/street-kids-foundation.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eempower street kids through our foundation\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eso that we can help them to become better citizens and create their careers in\nthe film industry, We also carry out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ssedshafilms.com/talent-search.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etalent searches so that we can explore other new talents in dance, singing and boxing.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eWe\u0027re a very small company but with a\nlot of responsibilities and we tend to overextend ourselves both physically and\nmonetarily, doing everything from running a studio, running a website, running academy, running\nthe foundation and running the talent search project to editing and to building\nall our own props and sets.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe don\u0027t expect or assume anyone will contribute\nany more to our crazy projects than simply watching our videos. We appreciate\nthat by itself. But if you feel like contributing more, it\u0027ll all go back into\ncreating more stuff and helping more street kids and other Vulnerable\u00a0slum children to discover their talents.\nFrom time to time, the site might go a few weeks without any new videos being\nposted, but rest assured that just because we\u0027re not posting something everyday doesn\u0027t\nmean we\u0027re not working hard on stuff behind the scenes, usually multiple\nprojects at once because we\u0027re kind of crazy. We tend to spend longer editing our\nvideos and making props and equipment and looking for talent from all the crazy\nplaces in Uganda than it seems many other online video creators do because it\u0027s\nour favorite aspect and we like to get creative with it whenever possible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve kept our Patreon pledge tiers very low\nbecause honestly there are better things you should be spending large amounts\nof money on. We may change up some tiers and add some higher rewards in the\nfuture, but for right now just think of this as donations that give you a\nlittle something back as a thank you for continuing to watch and support what\nwe do. Thank you very much once again!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
