    "summary": "Hey guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Scott McMahan and I\u0027m a songwriter.\u003cbr\u003eI was in my 40\u0027s before I could say that out loud, isn\u0027t that crazy?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI tried just about everything else in hopes of making the folks around me happy but it only reinforced the one thing I knew to be true, I\u0027m a songwriter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016 I did what any respectable songwriter would do and moved to Nashville. Does it count if you\u0027re living in your car? Either way, I independently released my self titled debut record (with a lot of help from folks like you) in mid September and by the end of the month I was in Nashville full time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe record did well, made it all the way to #60 on the Americana Charts and picked up some great reviews. I\u0027m very proud and grateful for the many doors it opened. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn October of 2017 I started pre production on the follow up and I\u0027ve gotta tell you guys, it\u0027s going to be a special record.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may be wondering, what makes this record so special?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWell, it almost didn\u0027t happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a daily struggle with Mental Illness, Bi Polar, PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder. I\u0027ve been in and out of Mental health facilities multiple times over the last two years. This is a battle I\u0027ve fought my whole life and was only able to get help after calling a Mobile Crisis Unit mid suicide attempt.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe songs going on this record are a completely honest and sometimes unsettling look into my life with Mental Illness and Homelessness. My hope is that it gets people talking, sharing their experiences. It\u0027s an important conversation, one that can save lives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know it\u0027s a tall order but that is exactly what I want this record to do, to save lives. I want folks to hear these songs and know that it\u0027s ok to talk about what they are going through, to reach out and be heard.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChoosing to become\u00a0a subscriber will help me continue this conversation and give you exclusive access to new songs, videos, contests and more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m grateful to you for reading this far, thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScott\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
