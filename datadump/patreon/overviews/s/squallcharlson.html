TokuNet LIVE to life as a producer and host. In my spare time I create other content for my YouTube that involve a variety of subjects and matter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy basic line is,\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e I don\u0027t make filler videos\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. I only put up the video if I enjoy it or it makes me laugh. I pride myself on quality content, and that\u0027s what you can come to expect on the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why Patreon? I only make limited funds back through YouTube, and have to spend the rest of my time working to pay for the bills. Think of it as a trade off to getting more content , or even just keeping me sane. If I had everyone who even looked at this page give $1, I would be able to fully commit myself to making content full time. Are you still with me and interested in helping this channel grow? We need more tokusatsu content online!\u003cbr\u003e"
