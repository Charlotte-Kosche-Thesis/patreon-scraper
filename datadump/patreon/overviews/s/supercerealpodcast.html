They are cereal enthusiasts, outsiders in the cereal industry, and dedicated to putting out episodes every week with breakfast discussion and terrible puns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon give us a great opportunity to provide more and better stuff for cereal fans! We\u0027re really excited about these perks and think you\u0027ll be, too. All of them keep the podcast ad-free and in resistance of the powerful cereal lobby\u0027s harsh tyranny. It will not, however, keep Kellogg\u0027s from stealing the idea for our show and then taking us to court over it later. No one can stop Kellogg\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuper Cereal Podcast people, thank you for at least considering to support our enterprise into cerealdom. Everything makes a difference in buying new cereals and manipulating our postal system to send Zip-Loc bags full of puffs and loops across oceans and country. We love you and celebrate you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCutting and rolling,\u003cbr\u003ePaul and Nick"
