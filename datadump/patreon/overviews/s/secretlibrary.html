It\u0027s been an amazing 2 years so far and nothing brightens our day more than messages from listeners.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs we discuss in the video, this show has already grown beyond our wildest dreams since April 2016. We weren\u0027t even certain that this topic would require a weekly episode, but how wrong we were. After 100 episodes, things feel like they are just warming up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy we\u0027re launching a Patreon:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThis show takes a lot of time to produce. Between coordinating interviews, reading all the books discussed on the show, editing, and promoting, Barry and I each take significant time away from other work activities to do the show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe do periodically accept sponsorship from companies and products that we use and love, but the money from these sponsorships only covers our podcast hosting fees. It doesn\u0027t cover our labor, the VA team that helps us create images, post the files, and schedule everything to go live each week. Currently, my coaching business is subsidizing the show with its income.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is my dream to develop additional resources and events for listeners and community members. We want to start having meet-ups around the country and internationally. I\u0027d love to have a conference and other live events so we can all connect in person. But developing these projects takes time. That\u0027s where you come in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy showing your support and becoming a Patreon supporter, you help the show pay for itself and give us the freedom to devote more of our time to podcast-related ideas, rather than the side jobs we both work to pay for our lives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for any support you offer to the show. It means the world that we can produce it at all. Let\u0027s build this community and make something beautiful together.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
