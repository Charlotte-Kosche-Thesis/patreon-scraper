Well, I am excited to tell you all aboot it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to create a Patreon page primarily because I want to be able to give \u003cstrong\u003emore\u003c/strong\u003e to my listeners. More audios, more opportunities for us to connect, and a safe place for me to reveal more of myself than ever before\u003cem\u003e.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI like Patreon because it\u0027s both safer for me and safer for you. What do I mean by that? Well,\u00a0Patreon is safer for me because I know that if you are someone who is pledging to support me, you are probably an avid listener and maybe even a dedicated fan. That makes me feel more comfortable with sharing more of myself. Reddit can be wonderful, but sadly every post on reddit is subject to random trolls or judgmental ppl who might make it their mission to bring you down. Hopefully that won\u0027t happen with the things I post for my Patreon subscribers. You\u0027re there because you want to be there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor every post I make publicly on reddit, another 4 or more posts never see the light of day. I don\u0027t want to spam reddit by posting too much, and I also don\u0027t want anyone to get tired of me. My Patreon is not for those people. My Patreon is for those of you who have written to me to say that you check reddit or soundgasm every day to see if I\u0027ve posted something new. This is a place for those of you who have revealed that they only continue to visit reddit to look for my posts. I\u0027m in awe that there even are people like you, and I want to share as much of myself as I can, while also getting to know you more personally, should that be what you also desire. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelieve it or not, I am not a goddess, or a queen, or a celebrity. Not really. (Even though I friggin love it when you call me something like that!) I am a real person. I never record anything that doesn\u0027t personally rev my engine. I get off on sharing fantasies \u003cem\u003ewith\u003c/em\u003e you - not in just creating or portraying them. I enjoy doing this just as much as you enjoy listening. So why not do more?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy Goals:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt takes a lot of time to record regularly, and even more time to connect with each of you in the way that you deserve. The ultimate goal I am working towards is becoming a professional voice over artist.\u00a0The Voice Over industry is extremely competitive - but once established, it can be such a rewarding career. It would also be a career that would allow me to work from home and still have ample time to continue to be Sass. Thanks to my Custom Audio patrons, I am already on my way with this goal, as I have been able to purchase a new portable mic (which has enhanced my sexy time audio quality), and I have recently completed an introductory voice over class.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is only the beginning. The voice over class I just finished covers the basics of radio, television, and documentary narrative voice over work. The next class I\u0027d like to take covers the Animation Voice Over industry, which includes video games and cartoons. That is the field I am most excited about, however the class is not offered until the Fall. I will also need to have a professional demo produced, which showcases my range and is a must-have for auditioning \u0026amp; finding an agent.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo how does this Patreon thingy work??\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, basically I have created a list of rewards for you to choose from each month. They range from early access to the content I will be posting for free eventually on reddit, to personal time getting to know me on Skype. I have some crazier ideas in store for the future, but let\u0027s start off nice and easy, shall we? ;)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you choose to support me by becoming a patron, I get to thank you for your support by rewarding you with extra Sassy goodness. And extra Sassy naughtiness, mhmmm :p\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is awesome because it gives you a safe way to support me without having to reveal your identity. All payment info is processed securely by Patreon - I am not involved in processing payment at all. Patreon accepts both Paypal and all major credit cards - and your credit card statement will only show that you are supporting Patreon - it will never say \u003cem\u003ewho or what you are supporting\u003c/em\u003e on Patreon :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI\u0027m sure you may have questions that I haven\u0027t thought of yet, so please comment here or msg me via Patreon or reddit with any Q\u0027s, and I can add on FAQs as they come in!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t afford to help support me right now, don\u0027t fret. I will still be posting as frequently on reddit - so nothing will change in that regard! Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this, and for your ongoing support with my audios. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI truly feel so lucky to have the most amazing listeners of all time. How do I know you are the most amazing listeners of all time? It\u0027s mostly because YOU LET ME BE ME. I\u0027ve never felt so safe in such an intimate environment. I never feel judged or pressured by any of my listeners. Somehow you tell me that you are grateful for me and my audios, but I am the one who is grateful for all of you. The ongoing love and support I receive just makes me want to do and give as much as I can to continue making all of you happier somehow - just as each of you continue to make me happier every day.
