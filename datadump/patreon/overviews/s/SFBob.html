I\u0027ve been exploring, writing, drawing, making photographs, and teaching as long as I can remember. And I can remember a long time.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tCommunity is important to me, and through Patreon I hope to foster the development of a community including you. Hopefully this will grow to make a greater \"us\".\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tOn this particular journey I will create science content. I\u0027m an educator, a writer, an artist, a photographer, and I play with other things too.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI produce essays, reviews, photography, and art. In this I explore the universe - mostly our universe. Sometimes I write fiction about zombies. Sometimes I take botanical photographs. Sometimes I draw birds. Sometimes I write essays about rocks. Some of what I produce results in publications available through \n\t\u003ca href=\"http://amazon.com/author/bobhole\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m also on \u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6952231.Bob_Hole\"\u003eGoodreads\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI hope you\u0027ll do more than simply consume what I produce, but to give me constructive feedback, and while I\u0027m the expedition leader, I\u0027m always open to possible diversions. I\u0027ll do polls and some other interactive content at various points, asking for your input.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tYour support and companionship on this journey will enable me to spend more time exploring, writing, and producing other artwork. It will be much appreciated.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI hope you\u0027ll join me on this journey of exploration.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
