This \nstyle of animation, while rewarding, is incredibly time consuming. To \nalso add to it, I will be animating it myself. Alone, I can complete \nabout 30 to 50 seconds of animation per week. Because of this, I\u2019ll need\n a team of animators, colorists and background artists to help so each \nepisode doesn\u2019t take a year to produce! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter pre-production, My team and I will begin animating the whole episode, splitting it into \ndifferent sections. Using the character model sheets so all the art \nstays consistent, they will draw every frame, layout, key pose, animate,\n in-between, ink and paint. Once completed, I will composite each \nscene together ( Putting the background, animation, effects and lighting\n together).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \nsupport on YouTube has helped my abilities and love for animation, but supporting me \nthrough Patreon as well can make this my \u003cstrong\u003ecareer\u003c/strong\u003e.\n  It has always been my dream to entertain people through animation. I have original stories and short animations that I wish to show everyone, this is why I have made a Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig03.deviantart.net/415b/f/2015/284/2/e/why_patreon_650_by_smyton4tw-d9cp94t.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon and how do I help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e     Patreon allows fans to\n become direct supporters of content they love.  Its kind of like a \nkickstarter, but in smaller numbers and on a consistent basis.  Once you\n have made an account, you can choose to support me through a donation\n of your liking.  It can be as little as 1 dollar or as big as you want.\n  This \u0027tip\u0027 or support is applied with each new episode I release, but \nis not charged until the end of the month.  You can also put a maximum \nper month, just in case if I some how make 100 episodes in 1 month. \n There are also bonuses for contributing.   If you decide its not worth \nit anymore or change your mind later, you can cancel at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for taking the time!\u003cbr\u003e"
