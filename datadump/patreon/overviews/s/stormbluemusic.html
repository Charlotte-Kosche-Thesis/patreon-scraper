I do tons of commissions and focus on mostly fan created work such as fan music for Transformers, rather it\u0027s character themes or songs based on concepts from the series. I\u0027ve never spent much money on creating my music as I want it to be delivered in affordable and easy to listen ways. But there\u0027s only so much I can do on a budget when I\u0027m not doing commissions. A bit of money will go a long way for me and my goal here is to continue my musical knowledge so I can create more for what my listeners want, beyond just my commissions. In fact my dream is to be able to work along side comic creators, animators, and story writers and I\u0027d love to be able to do that for them...for free! \u003cbr\u003e"
