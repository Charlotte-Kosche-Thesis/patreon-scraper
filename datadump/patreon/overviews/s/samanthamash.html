Additionally\u00a0your pledges will also help offset the time taken without pay to make new merchandise for my online store, as well as being able to over time invest in better quality materials to make that merch. Hopefully contributions will also decrease anxiety related to making art vs. making a living.

I will need your address for all tiers, but worry not, they will never be used for anything other than getting your rewards to you! Rewards like stickers and prints will start going out to you \u003cem\u003eafter \u003c/em\u003eyour first month as a supporter. Digital rewards like access to the Patreon feed happen instantly!
