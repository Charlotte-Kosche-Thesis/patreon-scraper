    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eHi and welcome to my Patreon\npage. I am here to raise funds to write, do research and make entertaining and\nstimulating YouTube content in defence of classical liberal western values. I\nam also here to raise funds to scrutinise and challenge reports coming out of the Women\u2019s Equalities Office on\nsubjects such as rape, the wage gap, domestic violence and toxic masculinity. My analysis of one such report on sexual harassment in\nschools revealed the recommendations of the report (tackling \"lad\nculture\" in schools) was not supported by the evidence.\u003ca href=\"#_edn1\"\u003e[i]\u003c/a\u003eIn fact, buried deep within their own sources, I discovered\nthat majority of abuse was female peer to peer harassment. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI studied feminism as an undergraduate so I know the theory\nwell enough to critique it.I became a critic\noffeminism, in the tradition of Christina Hoff Sommers, after discovering,\nduring my research that organisations such as the Fawcett Society and Rape\nCrisis were misrepresenting rape prosecution statistics. They were doing this\nknowing that such misrepresentations actually stopped victims coming forward -\nsomething they purported to want to increase. The stated aims of feminism - to\nameliorate suffering - do not tally with its actions and policies which\nfrequently cause more suffering to the most vulnerable people in our society. I\nam not an ideologue, this is simply where the evidence led me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nToday I am a researcher in\nevolutionary anthropology with a special interest in female intrasexual\ncompetition. In 2017 I\ngraduated with a certificate in post-graduate research methods and statistics.\nI took this course specifically to further enable me to analyse feminist\nclaims, such as those mentioned above. I have discovered their next target is \"laddism\"\u003ca href=\"#_edn2\"\u003e[ii]\u003c/a\u003e\naka \"toxic masculinity\" in universities. They are attempting to claim\nthat \u201clad culture\u201d contributes to sexual harassment and rape culture, even\nthough buried deep in the latest report, they have to admit there is zero\nevidence to support this assertion.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Women and Equalities Office have immense resources but as one person with a\npassion for truth, an eye for detail and a belief in true egalitarian values \u2013\nwith your support \u2013 I can slow, and hopefully halt, their progress. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will be developing rewards in the near future. Thank you for reading and any\nsupport you can give. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\u003ca href=\"#_ednref1\"\u003e[i]\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://porlawright.com/2016/09/13/mps-report-on-sexual-harassment-in-schools-is-deeply-troubling-but-not-for-the-reasons-youd-think/\"\u003ehttps://porlawright.com/2016/09/13/mps-report-on-sexual-harassment-in-schools-is-deeply-troubling-but-not-for-the-reasons-youd-think/\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"#_ednref2\"\u003e[ii]\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.nus.org.uk/en/nus-calls-for-summit-on-lad-culture/\"\u003ehttps://www.nus.org.uk/en/nus-calls-for-summit-on-lad-culture/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
