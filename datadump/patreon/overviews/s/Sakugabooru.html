    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSakugabooru and Sakuga Blog anniversary update!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll spare you the history of Sakugabooru, which as you might be already aware started simply as a joke. Four years later we\u0027ve become a helpful resource for fans (or so we hope) as well as a tool for both industry members and aspiring artists. That couldn\u0027t make us happier...but we want more, of course. We\u0027re perfectly aware of the limitations of the material we\u0027ve been putting out, particularly in this blog. There are only so many people willing to read long-form writing on animation, even as we try to keep it accessible; whenever we look at the gap between the visitors the Sakugabooru and Sakuga Blog receive, that couldn\u0027t be more obvious. This doesn\u0027t mean we\u0027re going to stop what we\u0027ve been doing, of course. We know our supporters value it, and feel there\u0027s worth to everything we\u0027ve been doing. So rather than \u003cem\u003echange\u003c/em\u003e, let\u0027s \u003cem\u003eadd\u003c/em\u003e. These are our new plans:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSakuga Video\u003c/strong\u003e: We\u0027re launching \u003ca href=\"http://video.sakugabooru.com\"\u003eour own Youtube channel!\u003c/a\u003e This is obviously the biggest news and the part that took the most effort. The idea is to make some relatively short videos (3 to 10 minutes) with a lighthearted educational tone, exploiting the video format to visually showcase someone\u0027s work. For now we\u0027ve produced a couple of videos for a mini-series focusing on the most important anime character designers of today as a trial. More on this later.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSakuga Chat\u003c/strong\u003e: Not actually a dating service. People had requested some sort of casual discussion about the kind of industry and production matters we write about, so we spent a long time considering the best format possible. We didn\u0027t feel a podcast would really fit as we\u0027ll still be talking about many visual aspects, but if it\u0027s written then we can easily keep inserting relevant clips. We\u0027ve taken some feedback over the tone and level of editing (as natural as possible but properly formated), but we\u0027re obviously still open to any suggestions you might have. The idea is to have at least one of these roundtalks a month, possibly bringing relevant guests now and then.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSakuga Interviews\u003c/strong\u003e: Not so much a new thing, but something we\u0027ll try to focus more in the future. We already published \u003ca href=\"https://blog.sakugabooru.com/2017/04/25/interview-with-bahi-jd-director-of-atom-the-beginnings-opening/\"\u003ean original interview with Bahi JD\u003c/a\u003e, and we\u0027ve got another very exciting creator coming up \u2013 even their studio agreed to work with us! Anime creators are always immensely busy so there are multiple directors and animators that haven\u0027t found the time to do this even after having agreed to this, so we\u0027ll just have to keep on pushing! Look forward to hearing more first-hand comments on the craft of anime.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore Stuff\u003c/strong\u003e: There\u0027s a series of miscellaneous but nonetheless important news. For starters, we\u0027ve got a new, more cohesive visual brand for all our sites. As we kept on expanding, that felt more necessary. Hopefully now everyone will be able to tell any piece of content is part of the same network at a glance. And while we\u0027re talking about technical changes, planning for a Sakugabooru renewal is in the works. No promises in this regard since the system is functional as it is and this entails a massive amount of work, but we\u0027d like something that is genuinely built for your needs.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e______________________________________________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSakugabooru launched 3 years ago, and we\u0027re about to take that anniversary as a chance to take it to the next level. The site has grown a lot in ways that make us very happy - there are more uploads than we could have ever hoped for, plenty of professional animators use it to source their own work, and it\u0027s even been partly responsible for the new wave of interest in animation within the anime fandom. People asked to expand the site with a blog and we feel that now it\u0027s the time. As an ambitious project it\u0027ll require more time and effort that we already give the site for free though, and that\u0027s why we\u0027re launching this Patreon campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOK, but who are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might know me as Kevin Cirugeda, freelance writer for Anime News Network on articles like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2015-09-30/the-joy-of-sakuga/.93579\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Joy of Sakuga\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2016-03-16/your-ultimate-guide-to-anime-ending-credits-part-i/.99852\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe extensive guide to understand anime ending credits\u003c/a\u003e. Maybe you know me as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Yuyucow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ekViN or Yuyucow on twitter\u003c/a\u003e, talking way too much about anime. Either way, I\u0027ll be a main regular writer here. Onboard with me are writers like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/liborek3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eliborek\u003c/a\u003e, the greatest Studio BONES expert outside of Japan;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://vanishingtrooper.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ekraker2k\u003c/a\u003e, a mecha connoisseur with a PhD on Masami Obari;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Disgaeamad/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDisgaeamad\u003c/a\u003e, the idol anime master. And leaving our core team aside, a handful of (professional) translators and writers have been collaborating with us. As you can see, quite the variety of points of view, and not by accident. We\u0027re open to keep broadening our approaches with other Sakugabooru staff and interesting writers, so look forward to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the plan then?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want a site that any anime fan interested in visual and directional aspects can approach. That doesn\u0027t mean avoiding getting technical when need arises, but we don\u0027t want to alienate casual fans who want to find out more about anime\u0027s craft. There are enough resources for hardcore fans, and we plan to have interesting information for them as well, but this community still needs to work on the fundamentals.\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s be more precise though: The Sakuga Blog will cover all sorts of \u003cstrong\u003evisual analysis\u003c/strong\u003e and appreciation of anime, with a focus - but not exclusively, of course - on the animation itself. It will also deal with \u003cstrong\u003eanime industry knowledge\u003c/strong\u003e, both its \u003cstrong\u003einner workings\u003c/strong\u003e and chatter about \u003cstrong\u003estaff members \u003c/strong\u003e- which can range from analysis of their ouvre to \u003cstrong\u003einterviews\u003c/strong\u003e, translated and original. We\u0027ve even considered ideas like \u003cstrong\u003eindustry rumors\u003c/strong\u003e, perhaps as short form posts.\u00a0Here are the concrete plans for now:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeekly craft highlights\u003c/strong\u003e: Thematic writeups focused on one element, industry discussion, perhaps a rundown of interesting pieces of animation worth talking about, anything goes on this column! Expect lots of current anime talk as the format fits that well, but it\u0027s obviously not limited to that. Anything we watch and feel is worth a mention can be brought up.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIndividual weekly coverage\u003c/strong\u003e: Particularly notable series deserve to be looked at on a weekly basis. Shorter posts talking about the staff, notable scenes, and the overall feeling until that point.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonthly essays\u003c/strong\u003e: Dealing on just about any of those aspects I mentioned before. Maybe an article about the smart usage of animation in a certain film, maybe a bit of an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Yuyucow/status/726422178141470720\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einvestigative project on some aspect of the industry\u003c/a\u003e. If the demand is really high it could even turn into two a month, but we\u0027ll see!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIrregular articles and translations\u003c/strong\u003e: The two previous series are something you\u0027ll get no matter what, but we\u0027ll also have a handful of posts a month not following that pattern. The only reason this is being listed as a separate entity is that we wanted to ensure a minimum quota for the readers. If things go as planned though, expect a lot more.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPDATE\u003c/strong\u003e - Now that the time has arrived, here are our future plans set to launch when we hit the next goal:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurated production and industry news\u003c/strong\u003e: There are quite a few sites covering standard anime news, but certain kinds of information slips through their fingers. Were you aware that Yuzuru Tachikawa, the director of Mob Psycho 100, is currently directing an original anime? If you heard about that it was likely on twitter, since once of our writers mentioned it. Writing about pieces of information like that which aren\u2019t covered by traditional sites is one of our objectives; the kind of news obtained through social media, acquaintances, and even trustworthy sources of rumors that have no proper platform to be published on. We plan to write relatively short form, irregular posts when required.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNotable upcoming staff roundup\u003c/strong\u003e: One crutch that sakuga fans traditionally had over normal viewers was upcoming staff awareness. The narrative can give you hints about when big episodes are coming, but by knowing about upcoming directors well in advance it\u2019s way easier to tell when a show\u2019s strongest episodes will come. We would like to make this accessible to everyone by highlighting the Whos and Whys, both listing the staff we think are likely to do an excellent job and quickly detailing what makes them special. Our idea is to make a monthly roundup post as anime magazines list staff, but also cover things revealed on official sites and social media.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFan feedback in this regard will be very important to finish shaping up our output. It\u0027s also worth noting that contributors who give us $20 a month or more (thanks!) will get to choose particular TV series and movies they want us to cover. We have a lot to write about without having to focus on straightfoward analysis of works, so we can leave that as an extra for the fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s nice, but I\u0027m a Sakugabooru user not particularly interested in reading articles\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnderstandable! We thought about that, and that\u0027s why this campaign is also meant to help the site fix some of its fundamental issues. It seems ridiculous now, but this all started as a joke on IRC. Sakugabooru launched on someone\u0027s server and kept on growing while freeloading in there. It\u0027s an awkward situation, and something that\u0027s had an effect on performance as well - I don\u0027t have to explain anyone how frustrating it is to have to wait for a short video clip to finish loading. We\u0027ve set a goal for this: if there\u0027s enough interest, we\u0027ll move the entirety of the site to a dedicated server, which will hopefully make everything work better. Time to go independent!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
