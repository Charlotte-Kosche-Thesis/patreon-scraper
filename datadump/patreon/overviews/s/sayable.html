I didn\u0027t have anywhere to process, think out loud, observe, or listen, Sayable\u0027s first iteration became that place.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, seventeen years later, thousands of you are reading, and I still feel like the same person in a lot of ways: processing, thinking out loud, observing, and listening. You have become a part of the story of my life. The trajectory of my life\u2014my relationships, my understanding of the gospel, and more\u2014has been paved by the presence of this page on the web. I could not do that without you. I mean that with all my heart: the presence of the Church in the world makes what I do not only possible, but joyful. I wouldn\u0027t trade this story for the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting, meeting with folks, doing interviews, speaking at women\u0027s conferences, speaking to pastors around the country about shepherding women and singles, writing for various sites, and trying to cultivate truth, beauty, and goodness in the world is what I do full time\u2014and very little of that is paid. I could not do the writing I do, with the thoughts I have, and the faithfulness in which I try to walk, without the support of readers. I could not do it without \u003cem\u003eyou. \u003c/em\u003eWould you consider becoming a patron of the arts with regard to Sayable? Would you consider becoming a monthly supporter so I can continue to do this work, and hopefully add more work in some ways? I\u00a0would be deeply grateful.\u00a0My \u003cem\u003efamily\u003c/em\u003e would be deeply grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you. Thank you. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
