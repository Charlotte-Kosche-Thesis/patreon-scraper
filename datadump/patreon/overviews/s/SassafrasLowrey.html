    "summary": "Hi! I\u2019m Sassafras Lowrey. I\u2019m a genderqueer/queer author living and writing in Brooklyn. My books have been honored by organizations ranging from the  National Leather Association to the American Library Association!  I\u2019ve just made the HUGE leap to leave muggle job life behind, and give myself the chance to try to make my dreams come true by writing full time. For years, I\u2019ve been writing my books literally on the NYC subway commuting to and from a really stressful job. Now, i\u2019m going to be able to focus all of my energy onto writing and I am confident this is going to mean being able to produce a lot more of the kinds of stories that you want - but I need your support! \u0026lt;3 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWho am I? \u003c/span\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eI\u2019m a straight-edge punk zinester who grew up to become the 2013 winner of the Lambda Literary Emerging Writer Award. I\u2019m the author of award-winning queer novels, \u201cLost Boi,\u201d \u201cA Little Queermas Carol,\u201d and \u201cRoving Pack.\u201d I edited the currently out of print (but coming BACK INTO PRINT in 2018) anthology  \u201cLeather Ever After.\u201d  I\u2019m also a nonfiction author: my first anthology, \u201cKicked Out,\u201d brought together the voices of current and former homeless LGBTQ youth ranging in age from youth who were currently street homeless to contributors who  who came out pre-Stonewall.  In 2018, I will be writing a new nonfiction book to be released from The New Press entitled \u201cLeft Out: How Marriage Equality Abandoned Homeless LGBTQ Youth.\u201d  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also write a bunch about dogs: I write about  my own dogs ( Do you know my three dogs? They are awesome and adorable)  as well as dog training, sports, and basic behavior. I\u2019ve been a monthly columnist at Curve Magazine for 9 years,  as well as all kinds of queer things for all kinds of publications including INTO Magazine, Huffington Post, The Advocate, and so many more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have facilitated creative and trauma-based writing workshops  at colleges, homeless shelters, and community groups across the country. Oh! And I\u2019m also a MFA student at Goddard College focusing on Fiction - I recently went back to school in my 30s (terrifying!) to get a terminal degree that will open up a lot of really specific doors for me - like being able to teach classes at colleges/universities instead of just being a visiting/guest author! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to all this, I\u2019m working on a new queer fairytale-inspired collection of stories which is my way of saying I\u0027m writing a new novel--- backers of my Patreon, you are going to be the FIRST people to read this new fiction!  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWhy Patreon? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wouldn\u2019t be here without the support of community - literally I wouldn\u2019t be alive, and creatively I wouldn\u2019t have ever started writing or publishing. I\u0027m taking a big leap of faith by quitting my muggle job to prioritize writing more of the stories you know \u0026amp; love! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last seven years, I have worked an incredibly high-stress muggle job where I have been in physical danger, and left each day emotionally exhausted. I also averaged a book being released every year and a half! How did I do it? I wrote on the subway on my iphone, I wrote on any lunch break I could sneak out to a local bubble tea shop, I wrote on weekends, I wrote in the early mornings and before bed. Basically I wrote all the time, and I got really, really tired, but I couldn\u2019t stop writing! Something had to give - and that was my muggle job. I couldn\u2019t maintain the stress of it anymore, and so my little family made the big decision for me to quit and write full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been writing queer stories for queer readers for over 15 years. I want to write as much queer art (plus some dog stories!)  as I possibly can in 2018 as I dive into this amazing magical opportunity to write full time for the first time!  For the past year or so, I\u2019ve been posting a weekly writing update on facebook  about everything I\u2019ve been up to - and the #1 thing people have said when I announced I quit my muggle job was how excited they were for more of my writing. Here\u2019s your chance to support my writing,  get a sneak peek at what I\u2019m working on, get writing advice AND read drafts of unpublished fiction \u0026amp; nonfiction before anyone else! Plus you\u2019ll have access to lots of other awesome rewards including at the end of the year, I\u2019ll be putting together a honest to goodness photocopied ZINE - i haven\u2019t made one in 10 years, i\u2019m a little rusty and i\u2019m ready to change that, and you\u2019ll be who gets it - rants, doodles, cut/paste art, misspellings and all! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxo\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eNOTE:\u003c/span\u003e All writing you\u2019ll receive will be drafts to preserve First Publication Rights (aka these are stories that will likely go on to become books someday in the far far future and i need to make sure nothing shared via Patreon impacts that). THAT SAID, I tend to be a \u2018first thought, best thought\u2019 kind of writer though so what you\u2019ll read will be solid stories, and you\u2019ll get the chance to see what my beta readers see! Some of the other writing I\u2019m going to be doing will be me playing around with new forms and new themes, and will be just be for YOU! My Patreons :)"

You pick a character or a plot, or a setting setting and I\u2019ll write a story based on your idea (one story per year of support)! ! Note: (because I have to say this kinda thing) Once you give me the idea for the story, all rights to the story become mine. Where will the story go? I will \u00a0post it here on Patreon for anyone at this support level and above to read, and depending on the story I may use it in my annual zine, \u00a0submit it to anthologies, use it as a jumping off place for a book etc. etc. etc. basically once you give me the idea for the story it\u2019s mine to do whatever with - make sense?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e",
