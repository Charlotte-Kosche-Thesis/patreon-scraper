    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHI! I\u0027M SAPHRYM!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWow. This section used to read differently because I was encouraged to make this Patreon by people who wanted to supportme while I worked for PurpleMentat. Here\u0027s what it used to say:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI\u0027ve been told by quite a few people I know that I need to start a Patreon campaign. I asked \"Why? What do I do? I don\u0027t create videos like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://http:/mentat.link/pa\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePurpleMentat\u003c/a\u003e (at least I didn\u0027t back then).\" One of them told me it would be for \"creating an entertaining experience\" because I handle the server administration and behind-the-scenes work for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://purplementat.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePurpleMentat Gaming\u003c/a\u003e. So here I am. I\u0027m creating a Patreon for \"creating an entertaining experience.\" However, that\u0027s not the only thing I plan on providing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eBut now I\u0027m told I\u0027m \"dad jokes wrapped in a calming voice.\" I\u0027m going to take that as a compliment and continue making videos, streaming gameplay, and just hanging out with the community that has grown slowly but steadily into an amazing family I love to be a part of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT AM I CREATING?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOriginally, this section talked all about how I want to be a professional writer and how this Patreon would help me reach that goal by providing me the funds I need as I reach for that goal.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://saphrym.com/text-wmputs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWanna read it? I saved it just in case.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYeah. That changed. How\u0027d it change? Well, I started recording videos on YouTube. I did a couple of Let\u0027s Play videos. I had a lot of fun recording them. I then had just as much fun editing them. And I\u0027ve been able to even put some fictional writing as part of them. In other words, I got REALLY excited about what I was doing. So is the fictional writing still important to me? Of course! It always will be. But I like the concept of doing it in a mixed-media manner. And the way I\u0027m creating my content now, I would definitely consider it mixed-media, and it\u0027s allowing me to pursue all of the forms of creativity I\u0027ve ever been interested in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also write. I\u0027ll also create tutorials and such since teaching is my other passion. I will create graphics for people much like I always have. However, this time I\u0027ll be recording it because it\u0027s fun to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that is what I\u0027m going to do. Any money earned here will be used to make my creative endeavors lucrative enough to continue doing what I love. I will also spend it towards improving the equipment I use to make this content for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will continue being \u003ca href=\"http://mentat.link/pa\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePurpleMentat\u003c/a\u003e\u0027s right-hand man, but I\u0027ll also work on creating my own content and maybe being a peer of his one day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO YOU GET?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s a good question. What DO you get? Even if you don\u0027t sign up as a patron and just join our Discord at \u003ca href=\"http://saph.link/chat,\"\u003ehttp://saph.link/chat,\u003c/a\u003e you\u0027ll get to hang out with one of the best communities out there. Nice people being nice to other nice people.

That\u0027s one thing you get. You also get access to me in a private channel on my Discord and you\u0027ll end up in any patron monuments or the like that I do/make.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you signed up as a Noble Cipranian, you get even more:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou get access to all of the patron servers. That includes 3 Minecraft servers and 2 or 3 other miscellaneous servers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou get to hang out with the same community I mentioned earlier in private chat rooms geared toward the Nobles.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou get access to be in my videos or streams. This isn\u0027t a scheduled thing that you might be able to do once a month. ANYTIME I am in the recording or live voice channels on the Discord, you can come hang out and talk with me. And if I\u0027m on a patron server, you can come join me too. Don\u0027t be shy. You can ask my community, I\u0027m good at just rolling with whatever comes my way.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI have plans for a future \"members only\" site that will have behind-the-scenes stuff like how I do the things I do (editing, recording, graphic design, writing, etc.). You\u0027ll have access to that also.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnything else my brain comes up with to give to you people because you\u0027re amazing for supporting little ole\u0027 me.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e_____________________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e Any servers I may have as parts of rewards or, just using in my content, are sponsored by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://saph.link/akliz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAkliz\u003c/a\u003e.
