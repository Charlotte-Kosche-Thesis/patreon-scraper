    "summary": "Hi! My\nname is Larry Sanger.\u00a0I am a\nco-founder of Wikipedia.\u00a0But being a co-founder of a non-profit doesn\u2019t necessarily make you\nrich. It turns out that I love making educational videos for kids, and mine videos are 100%\nfree. I\u0027d love to make a lot more, even making them full-time. They\u0027ll always be free, so if I am going to do this a lot more, I need your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m\npretty good at making these videos. I write them carefully, and I\nfind just-right pictures to go with the words. My most popular video (over one million views) just has me counting to 100,\nwith creative numerals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2PUVVXZLIrY\" width=\"420\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s very simple. I had\nno idea it would get so popular. So I started posting other educational videos\nfor kids. My second most popular video is about the Moon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gHlMReTpJXw\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe words I speak are on the screen. This teaches kids to read better.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI am\nconstantly defining words, illustrating them,\u00a0and\nsharing facts in logical order, which builds a foundation of knowledge in\nlittle brains.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHere\u2019s\nanother example. My most recent videos were a three-part series about the best\nchapter books for kids to read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nxk1g0kbjR4\" width=\"420\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKids love my videos. I want\nto make hundreds more of them. Think of it like Khan Academy but for\npre-K through fourth grade.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are three reasons to support my work on these videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u2019m perfect to make them.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI can make them very\nquickly.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThey are popular and high-quality.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003eFirst,\nI say I\u2019m perfect to make these sorts of videos. Why?\u00a0I\nbelieve very deeply in education and knowledge.\u00a0Not\nonly did I get Wikipedia and other encyclopedias started,\u00a0I was\nco-founder of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.watchknowlearn.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWatchKnowLearn\u003c/a\u003e, a popular directory of educational videos for\nkids.\u00a0I have\na Ph.D. in philosophy, specializing in the theory of knowledge,\u00a0and I really\nlike breaking down obvious things very clearly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nteach. I taught both philosophy and (as it happens) Irish fiddle for many\nyears.\u00a0Also,\nmy wife and I homeschool our two boys, who are currently 9 and 5.\u00a0I\ntaught them both to read when they were toddlers,\u00a0and\nwrote\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blog.larrysanger.org/2010/12/baby-reading/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea book\u003c/a\u003e about how and why I did this.\u00a0I\nconverted my reading method into\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.readingbear.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eReadingBear.org\u003c/a\u003e, an enormous yet completely\nfree tool to help teach your kids to read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve\nread quite a bit about children\u2019s books and reading as well.\u00a0I think\nand write quite a bit about education.\u00a0Among\nother things, I was asked to write\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://er.educause.edu/articles/2010/4/individual-knowledge-in-the-internet-age\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe cover article\u003c/a\u003e for the education\ntechnology journal \u003cem\u003eEDUCAUSE  Review \u003c/em\u003ein 2010.\u00a0I have\nread many hundreds of children\u2019s books to my boys in the last nine years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m\nconstantly explaining difficult words to them, so I\u2019ve gotten good and fast at\nit.\u00a0I\nwrote about 150 PowerPoint presentations for them as well.\u00a0The\nvideos I\u2019ve uploaded are video versions of those presentations.\u00a0These\nare part of a very ambitious dream I have to cover all of knowledge in video\nformat, albeit at a very basic level, for kids.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe\nsecond reason to support these videos is that I make them very quickly.\u00a0I can\nwrite a script in about an hour or two.\u00a0I can\nfind the images to go with the script in a couple hours.\u00a0It\ntakes me about an hour to record the video and upload it to YouTube.\u00a0So,\nyeah...I\u2019m pretty fast at this. That means that your dollars support a lot of\neducation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe third\nreason to support these videos is that they\u2019re pretty popular, and they\u2019re\nhigh-quality.\u00a0On\nmost topics, my videos are among the most-watched YouTube videos\u2014I\u2019ve checked.\u00a0In one\ntypical week in February 2015, my 26 educational videos, mostly uploaded in\n2011 and 2012, garnered around 9,400 views.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut\nthat\u2019s only 26 videos. Imagine if I had 500 videos up there.\u00a0I\ncould make about that many in a year working full time on this.\u00a0Based\non the viewing stats of those 26 videos, I estimate 500 new videos would garner about 580,000 views per week,\nor\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e30\nmillion \u003c/strong\u003eviews per year\u2014and that\u2019s\nwithout any significant branding or marketing effort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut\nit\u2019s not just quantity, it\u2019s quality. These videos are very carefully written,\u00a0and I\nput a lot of thought into the choice of pictures.\u00a0The\nbottom line is that your support will be helping a lot of kids.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn sum,\u00a0I\nreally like making educational videos. I\u2019m good at it. The videos are popular\nand high-quality. I make them quickly, too. All this means that when you back\nthis project, you are supporting an extremely effective way to support early\neducation, especially for reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRemember,\nyou\u2019re supporting me only for the videos I actually make, and\nyou can set an upper limit on how much you give per month\u2014even\nas little as one dollar.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThanks\nin advance.\u003cbr\u003e"
