I was a VP/producer for a national non-profit educational group, produced \u0026amp; edited over 500 radio programs of \u003cem\u003eRenewing Your Mind with R.C. Sproul\u003c/em\u003e, and have produced, directed, written and/or shot documentaries, teaching videos, youth videos, corporate videos, content marketing, infomercials and web videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral of my short films have won awards to go along with many Aurora, Telly, Communicator, Addy and Emmy Awards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy screenwriting blog began in January 2008 after seeing Juno written by Diablo Cody\u2019s. The fact that she went to college in Iowa, wrote a distinctly Midwestern screenplay while in Minneapolis, and was discovered while blogging seemed like enough synergy and inspiration for me to jump into the blogging world. Toward the end of 2008 \u003cem\u003eScreenwriting from Iowa\u003c/em\u003e won a Regional Emmy in Advanced Media from The Upper Midwest Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
