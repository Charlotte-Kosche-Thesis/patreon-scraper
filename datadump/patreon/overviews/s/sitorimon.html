You can set up any amount you are comfortable with (don\u0027t put yourself out of pocket!) and each month Patreon collects the donation and passes it on to me. You can stop at any time and change the amount on the fly. In return for your support, I will be able to create more and better things and also offer plenty of bonus things for you too. It\u0027s truly amazing that anyone considers donating - and that is something special.

Your money will go towards covering administration costs, new equipment, updating equipment and ultimately allowing me to create better, more professional visual, audio and digital content for you. Each month I do a Patreon only podcast to tell you what\u0027s going on for the month ahead and give a breakdown of where your money has gone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love creating and running all these projects but they cost time and money to do. My ultimate goal would be to make this a full-time profession - letting me focus on full-time content creation for you all across a variety of mediums. It\u0027s a long way away but it\u0027s not impossible.
