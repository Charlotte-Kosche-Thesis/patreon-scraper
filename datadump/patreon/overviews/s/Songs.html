The kids do most of the actual writing - words \n\u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e music. I direct the process and fill in the gaps as needed. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI always try and connect students\u0027 songwriting projects with something larger than themselves. In one residency we wrote songs for the City of Stillwater to help promote their new curbside recycling program (see the video above). In another we wrote songs inspired by \n\u003cem\u003eThe City of Ember\u003c/em\u003e, which the 4th graders were reading in Language Arts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe seamless=\"\" src=\"//bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1563194094/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/t=3/transparent=true/\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy I Do This\u003c/h3\u003e\nI\u2019m a professional songwriter and a total songwriting geek. I love sharing my knowledge and skill with kids. They always challenge and surprise me, and help me grow as an artist and a person. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe most touching experience I\u0027ve had writing songs with kids was with a 5th grade class who used their song to memorialize the teacher they\u0027d lost earlier in the year to cancer. It was the first chance the kids had as a group to express their feelings about what had been a very difficult year. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe seamless=\"\" src=\"//bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1478911519/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/t=3/transparent=true/\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI strive to give each student an authentic arts experience, a chance to collaborate, explore, and express themselves through song.

Your patronage is a gift of extra money, energy, and time that I can invest in my students. Just $1 or more per song will help enrich my students\u2019 songwriting experience while providing a measure of financial stability for a worthy endeavor.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat Your pledge Will Do!\u003c/h3\u003e\nNeeds vary from project to project, but each time I post a song, I will let you know exactly how your patronage made a difference. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere are some specific items on my wish list: \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA home studio recording of every song.\u003c/strong\u003e Right now residency students usually get this; workshop students usually don\u2019t.
