    "summary": "I believe that a story\u0027s purpose is to be told and heard. This is what brought me to writing. I grew up on table-top RPG\u0027s like Dungeons and Dragons, Whitewolf, and Shadowrun, and I always loved the fantastic things that people could create with their imaginations. Once I got into running some of these games myself as a Storyteller, I discovered my love for telling stories as much as creating them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect anyone to do more than read my stories. In fact, the best contribution that anyone can make to my writing is to share the stories they like with people they think would also like them. But, if you feel compelled to contribute in some other way, I won\u0027t turn you away. In fact, I gladly welcome your support and want to give as much back to you as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant early access to my stories? Want to be an editor and tell me what you think before I publish? Want to ask me questions and get the real skinny on what\u0027s happening behind the scenes? I\u0027m happy to deliver! Consider becoming a patron, and let\u0027s create some awesome stories together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eC. Michael Chase\u003cbr\u003e"
