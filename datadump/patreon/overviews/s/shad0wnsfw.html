In addition, I\u0027ve picked up the art of digital musicianship, and am slowly improving my skills with remixes and rearrangements of tracks from video games and anime.\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to these two major hobbies that I wish to pursue so it becomes a full time gig, I specialise in graphics design for things such as album art, logos and much more - you name it! I also have dreams of doing voice acting, but that\u0027s another story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOpening this Patreon feels like a true first step in the right direction. With your support, I\u0027ll gain the drive and the dollars to further my abilities in art, music and all sorts of digital media, whether it be graphics design or even animation. Slowly but surely, I\u0027d like to get myself known out there as an artist of multimedia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect anyone to back me up in this quest, but for those who do become treasured allies on my journey of creativity.\u003cbr\u003e"
