That makes it the largest minority group in the world \u2013 and the only minority group that anyone can join at any time.\u00a0Disability does not discriminate by race, gender, culture or nationality.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, people with disabilities also make up one of the most overlooked and neglected groups in the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn fact, the disability rights movement is rarely covered by any school curriculum,\u00a0even though other forms of civil and human rights are commonly taught. Even during adulthood, disability is a topic that gets little attention in the professional world. This leads to many problems for people with disabilities, such as poor access to services, inaccessibility to buildings and underemployment.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt Spectrum Ability, we don\u0027t believe that it is out of cruelty, but rather from misunderstanding caused by lack of knowledge. \u003cem\u003eWe want to make that knowledge accessible for those who don\u0027t have disabilities \u2013 but have the willingness to learn.\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(183, 221, 232);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eWhy should you support us?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eImagine a world where someone can get a disability without needing to think \"Will people treat me differently?\" or \"Will I be accepted by society as a person with a disability?\" Our dream is to see those types of worries disappear because everyone is equipped with knowledge and empathy around disability.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur teaching resources aim to shape perceptions of disability among students. This can not only lead to reduced bullying and improved relationships between students, but can also influence children who can be our future city planners, architects, nurses, doctors and parents.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSupporting us is a social investment \u2013 one that requires researchers, writers, producers and other talent.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have a special goal as well \u2013 \n\u003cstrong\u003ewe want 75% of our work to be done by people with disabilities\u003c/strong\u003e, many of whom are multi-talented but are overlooked by other employers due to discomfort around disability.
