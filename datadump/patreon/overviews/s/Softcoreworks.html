Because this is a non-profit, passion-driven partnership between myself and the artists that are executing the artwork, I will never be making money off of the art they produce for us to enjoy. I only want to see content being produced and enjoyed by myself and Patreons and non-patreons alike. The more pledges there are, the more content that gets commissioned, and in a shorter amount of time as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat makes Softcore Works original?\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOriginality is the cornerstone of Softcore Works. We aim to give the Western adult audience tasteful, fresh material that they have not seen before. What sets us apart is that we combine non-consensual sexual contexts with softcore sexual acts. This means that even though the \"victim\" is having non-consensual acts committed upon them, the acts will never surpass a \"softcore-level\". Fans of non-consensual sexual scenarios and softcore sexual acts \u00a0will now have the best of both worlds and not have to worry about the victim being physically abused.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat is your definition of \"Softcore\"?\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\"Softcore\" means different things to different people. Some people believe it\u0027s when the genitals are not depicted, and some believe it\u0027s very light, intimate contact such as kissing and hugging. My definition of \"Softcore\" is when the sexual act does not include any penetration or pain. This means that sexual acts that would be normally be seen as \"Foreplay\" or \"Teasing\" would be the only acts depicted in our comics. We aim for the victim in our comics to only experience pleasure and not any sort of pain or abuse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhy is \"Non-Consent\" the main theme in your content?\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u00a0fully understand that \"Non-\u0027Consent\" is a dicey genre for many adult-content fans so I, as the Creative Director of Softcore Works will do my best to explain why I chose this genre as our main theme.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe there is a certain aspect to non-consent that people, including myself, enjoy. The victim little to no control over the situation, and being left completely at the whim of the \"aggressor\" if you will. However, the part I see too often depicted in this genre, and the part I do not like at all, is when that control the \"aggressor\" has over the victim leads to physical abuse and deprivation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am introducing respect and care into non-consensual scenarios. \u00a0At a glance, this may seem like a massive contradiction, however, I do have \u00a0solid reasoning behind my logic. I believe it is possible for the \"aggressor\" to respect the body of the victim while taking the freedom away from the person. This means that the person no longer exists to the \"aggressor\" only the body of the victim that they are \"taking care of\" against the will of the victim. In short, the \"aggressor\" seeks to pleasure the victim against their will, \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course, this logic only applies to fictional works, where we have the ability to carefully craft scenarios where there is no pain or abuse, only comfort and pleasure. I in no way advocate for non-consent in real life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat existing content is Softcore Works inspired by?\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThroughout my life, I have been inspired by many different works, and both the frustration of works that I have enjoyed, but not being the way exactly of how I would have done them, and wanting to see more of works that I have really enjoyed, have led me to commission artists and kick start the Softcore Works partnership.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome games that have inspired me are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLinemarvel\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003eJungle Girl \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eDemon Girl\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eKoooonSoft\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003eShinobi Girl,\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eWitch Girl \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eAngel Girl\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEluku99\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003eFairy Fighting \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eWolf Dungeon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eVosmug\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003eXenotake \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eGhost Hunter Vena\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAll of these games have both softcore and hardcore elements, however, one similarity they all share is that they have different types of \"enemies\" that inflict a non-consensual sexual act on the player. The sexual act depends on what type of enemy it is, and their ways of restraining the players limbs is also unique to what type of enemy they are.\u00a0In Softcore Works comics, there is no \"player\" however, there is a victim that will face different types of \"aggressors / enemies\" of whom will inflict their will upon the victim using their unique abilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
