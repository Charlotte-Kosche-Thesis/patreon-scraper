    "summary": "The fact that your reading this means I\u0027ve already exceeded my \nexpectations (but not my goals), so thanks. I\u0027m asking you to pledge to \nhelp me keep making The Chanterelle and May Life (CML), to make more of \nit, and to make it better. CML is a weekly ongoing webcomic about the \nhorrid adventures of an adorably spooky bunny named May and her best \nfriend, Chanterelle the cow. While being obliviously hunted by a sextet\n of demoniac aliens called the Eggettes, the girls glean ghoulish \namusement from the gore and viscera raining around them and become \nembroiled in the intrigues and machinations of the Kingdom of Toxic \nTampa Bay. Part Looney Tunes, part MacBeth, part A Clockwork Orange.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 Making comics is time consuming! Right now, it\u0027s all I can do to get a page up a week, and I\u0027m not really getting by. My \"real\" job leaves me plenty of time and not a lot of money; If something doesn\u0027t give soon, I\u0027ll have to get a real job, and that will put a hamper on CML in a big way! Depending on the success of this campaign, CML may be able to update more regularly, more frequently, and look better doing it. There may even be a few of treats in it for you! Gosh, I\u0027d appreciate your help. Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 For those with a yen to learn it, CML is produced by what we call Smilocide Studios, which is also responsible for producing another webcomic, The Adventures of Mecha-Smiles, and alive-action puppet/animation webseries call Captain Ian\u0027s Cosmicartoon Funship. None of your contributions to this Patreon will directly fund either of those projects, but by making my life easier, you\u0027ll indirectly be contributing to them as well!\u003cbr\u003e"
