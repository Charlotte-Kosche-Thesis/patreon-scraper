I\u0027ll be updating this soon. \u003cstrong\u003eBut the new patron format is going to be 1 dollar for anyone to get perks, with the option to pledge more if you\u0027d like to support the channel more.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSupporters will receive / have access to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrivate Livestreams where I play games that get you guys involved.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTheir own role in discord which gets them into a server to talk to me directly and with other supporters\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to Movie Nights where the community gets together and watches shows/movies together.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDibs on playing games with me on stream when we have viewer games.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd you\u0027ll be the force that keeps the channel moving.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nMy methodology behind a patreon with a 1 dollar tier is that many folks that watch the channel and get literally 100\u0027s of hours of entertainment since there are nearly 1500+ videos and I livestream daily. \n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHowever a YouTuber only gets roughly 1 dollar per 1000 views on a video\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e (depending on the time of year). And that number is getting even worse with the current advertiser problem YouTube is currently facing. So unless someone watches over 1000 of videos on the channel, they will never actually contribute a whole dollar to the channel from views, even if they are getting hours upon hours of entertainment for free.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI put in many hours every single day creating content for you guys, and have been for years. That 1 dollar a month pays well beyond what 99.9% of people will ever actually \"pay\" the channel from being a viewer.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nThe biggest benefit to you\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is that this allows me to create content without having to pander to what\u0027s trending or to the infamous YouTube algorithm. I can focus on digging deep into let\u0027s play that I would have always ignored in the past because they simply wouldn\u0027t get views anymore. \u003cstrong\u003eThe reason clickbait exists, and old games get ignored is because content creators rely on views to pay bills.\u003c/strong\u003e Subscription services like Patreon make it so creators have more freedom to give you better and more varied content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis video by The Game Theorists does an amazing job of explaining how supporting creators with services like patreon help you get much better content to consume. It also brushes on the recent fake news problem the internet is dealing with.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIn33sDwKqQ\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIn33sDwKqQ\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this. I appreciate you and you are what has always made me able to be a creator. As always, be good to one another, and I\u0027ll see you guys in the next video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest,\u003cbr\u003eSwingPoynt"
