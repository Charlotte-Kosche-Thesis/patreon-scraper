Our names are Arnes and Steve and we run a few channels on Youtube called Super Unimportant Reviews and The Geek Chest. We primarily do reviews for action figures and collectables on SUR, and TGC is mainly for monster movie reviews, let\u0027s plays, our toy hauls, and unboxing of figures that we do on SUR. We have been around for 2 years now and have been getting a great fanbase on both of these channels and have been growing at a steady pace.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now, why should you support our channel? Well, for starters what this will allow us to do is to help us get to or primary goal even faster, which is to be able to do these videos for a living. With the support that we would receive from here, we would be using it to increase our production value, get better items for reviews, increase the amount of videos that we do, and have these videos come out on a consistent bases. Cause with bills, living expenses, full-time jobs, and having to use most of our spare money to support the channel right now, we can only do so much. But with the help we would receive from you Rangers, we would be able to accomplish more and get more of the videos out that everyone enjoys. Videos like Stevie\u0027s Toy Room, Board Game videos, Stop Motion videos, and more reviews in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Next, your donations would help to keep us honest. Now, you guys know we always give you our honest opinion on the products and are never trying to pander to a company. We do these reviews as a consumer, for consumers. What I mean by this is that eventually for this channel, our end goal is to turn this into our job. In order to do this, we would have to use Google Adsens or get sponsors for our content. With Google, that is going to take a very long time to accomplish so we would eventually have to go with trying to get sponsors. The problem with that is when we would get figures and such from them in order to do reviews (and get some income) we would have to promote their product, even if it is not quite relate-able to the channel. What your donations would allow us to do is not even have to worry about said problems. We want to keep the channel the just like it is now and not eventually bogging it down with content that might not be what we had originally intended for the channels.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So any money that could be spared to help turn our dreams into a reality would be greatly appreciated. We thank you for tuning into our channel and your guys continued support.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "\u003cstrong\u003eWe will buy a toy for a review! \u003c/strong\u003eWith this pledge, we will buy a figure that you want us to review on \u003cstrong\u003eSuper Unimportant Reviews. The figure price can not exceed more then $200 (in U.S Dollars). It cannot be a figure that has an auction or fluctuating price because it cannot be guaranteed to be in the price range set. This is a one time video and will be done on a first come, first serve basis. The review will not be the next review put out because we will have to acquire the figure. So it will have priority over the lower pledges as soon as it comes in. \u003c/strong\u003eWe will work with you to make sure that it is the figure you want and follows the guidelines stated. You will get to suggest what we will compare the figure next too (which I already have to own) and help us with the skit for the video as well \u003cstrong\u003e(has to be something Family Friendly. Nothing Sexual/ Violante/ Offensive/ Vulgar). \u003c/strong\u003eFinally, you will also get \u003cstrong\u003eThe Producer\u003c/strong\u003e and\u003cstrong\u003e Exclusive Print\u003c/strong\u003e perk as well.
