If you do become a patron, that must mean you really like what I create and that you want to support me as an artist. Either way, I thank you very much for supporting me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$5 unlocks \u003cem\u003eEVERYTHING\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e There are no additional rewards other than commission discounts and a nod in the credits. I don\u0027t want my viewers to feel like there is a large barrier to seeing my work. I will be posting \"work in progress\" pictures more regularly here than anywhere else but they\u0027ll be posted as public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe ONLY things that are limited to \"Above and beyond\" patrons are the interactive games/animations.\u003c/strong\u003e Reason being is due to licensing fees in order to compile some of the plugins I use into a standalone product that I can distribute. (I love legal stuff)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see to the right, there are some rewards for becoming a patron and I hope to provide you guys with lots of material. This material should come in pretty regularly (at least once every two weeks, if not, more) and will vary in themes. Some of the things that you might see posted here are pictures or animations of general SFW art, nudity, sexual themes, scenes involving kinks or fetishes such as bondage, paws, or vore to name a few but certainly not limited to. If I deem the content to be graphic or too obscene, I\u0027ll try to forewarn the viewer so that they may look at it at their discretion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBAT EXPLORER VR\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/8c95cdb6f30c80da1f2cfda8bb734827.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLatest Version: \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/bat-explorer-v1-15936576\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/posts/bat-explorer-v1-1593...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe New BIG Project\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e2D Side-scrolling metroidvania style action/sex/vore furry game.
