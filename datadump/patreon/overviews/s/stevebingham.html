    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi! I\u0027m Steve, and I\u0027m a violinist who makes unusual, quirky music videos on YouTube of all sorts of music from Bach to the Beatles! So basically\u00a0I make violin videos: Sounds simple? Yes! But I love doing something different with them..... I use violin and various electric violins. I work with interesting sounds and even more interesting guest artists, and try to create something that\u0027s just that bit different.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s where you come in! I would like to spend more time recording and filming my music, but as I\u0027m a freelance player it\u0027s hard to find the time while trying to earn my living. By becoming my patron on \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePatreon\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e - however small the amount you pledge - you\u0027ll be directly helping me to not only continue to make videos, but also to make better videos. In the longer term I hope that I\u0027ll be able to get better studio equipment and maybe hire a real camera operator from time to time!! It will also give me time to learn new filming techniques and to record and film a wider range of music.\u003cbr\u003eMaking videos also helps spread my music to a wider audience, which will help to allow me to record a wider variety of pieces - all of which you will not only be helping with, but getting free copies of! Which brings me on to rewards:\u003cbr\u003eWhatever amount you decide to pledge (even if it\u0027s just $1) I want you to get something back for being a patron; so below there are a number of rewards, including free downloads of my music and free CDs, and I\u0027ll be reviewing these and adding to them when I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePatreon\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a superb idea for allowing you to really make a difference to independent creators; so don\u0027t forget to check out more of the creators who are using the site - I\u0027m going to become a patron to some of my favourites.\u003cbr\u003eImportant facts about Patreon pledges:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 21px;\"\u003eThough the site is in dollars, everything gets converted from your local currency automatically so it doesn\u0027t matter where you\u0027re based\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 21px;\"\u003eYou can cancel a single pledge at any time, or cancel your patronage completely, at the click of a button\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 21px;\"\u003ePledges for videos which I\u0027ve made will go out at the beginning of each month\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 21px;\"\u003eYou can limit the amount you pledge per month, in case I suddenly make loads of videos all at once (normally I\u0027ll be aiming at 2 - 4 a month)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to know more about how \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePatreon\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e works, then have a look at \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ8zMH35wc\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis video\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eTo see all my YouTube music videos (plus a few vlogs) just \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/stevebinghamviolin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eclick here\u003c/a\u003e, or if you\u0027d like to find out more about my violin playing beyond the boundaries of YouTube just have a look at \u003ca href=\"http://www.stevebingham.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for your support!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
