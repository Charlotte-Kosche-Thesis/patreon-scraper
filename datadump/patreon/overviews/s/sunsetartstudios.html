The video was later projected in the studio, slowed down significantly so that each persons\u2019 expression of intimacy expanded into these epic movements of humanity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sunsetartstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MG_0732.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlli Rogers created an inclusive project by collaborating with the public. Her work focused on the use of low-brow materials as an entry point for the public to explore collaboration, exchange, sculpture and mark-making. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how have we worked to remove social and geographical barriers to the arts?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sunsetartstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/balboa_small.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFundamentally, through our location, embedded in the middle of a residential area, we are able to create access to the arts by proximity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFor each arts-focused project or event, we work on community projects. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sunsetartstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/dog045.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur space has given us the ability to hold special events that speak to the needs of the community, like Dog Days, promoting responsible pet ownership in Dallas. This day was in response to the overwhelming number of loose dogs in South Dallas, with proceeds from the event benefitting No Bully Left Behind, a bully-breed rescue, and Dallas Animal Services. The artwork of Jessica Sinks and Mylan Nguyen were featured during the event with the artists present doing live drawings. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sunsetartstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Unknown-1.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr like Art Haunt, an arts-based haunted house that combines art history with the contemporary haunted house experience. Local artists Julie Libersat, Randy Guthmiller, Sarah Alexander, and Giovanni Valderas each created an installation or sound piece that was inspired by the work of Salvador Dali, while Dali videos were projected outside throughout the evening. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOur space has also afforded us the ability to hold pop-up shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sunsetartstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MG_0907.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost recently we were able to host the Dallas Nasty Women Exhibition, an international movement of art exhibitions raising money through solidarity for different groups. The Dallas show was able to raise just under $3000 in 1 night for the Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. For the Artists- \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eWe want to be able to continue operating the Sunset Residency and offer free studio space to artists who can\u0027t afford their own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. For the Community- \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eWe want to keep working in our community to provide free arts programming in an approachable way\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. For the Partnerships-\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0We want to keep finding new ways to bring the arts to our area in a meaningful way by partnering with other groups like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/TheMeetShopOC\"\u003eThe Meet Shop OC\u003c/a\u003e, a local literary and community gathering space focused on the cultural and literary arts, and the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://organizetexas.org\"\u003eTexas Organizing Project\u003c/a\u003e, a non-profit that\u00a0promotes social and economic equality for low to moderate income Texans through community and electoral organizing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
