    "summary": "My name is Maciej Talaga, but this probably\nis just another strange East-European name to you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo let\u0027s start it differently. I earn my\nliving as a translator and a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.szampierz.pl\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003efencing instructor\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e working with children and\nteenagers. However, what really drives me is reconstruction of\nhistorical European heritage related to martial arts (aka Historical European\nMartial Arts = HEMA). \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://szampierz.pl/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AN_0457-1024x696-640x480.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have been playing with swords since 2004.\nAt first I trained in a reenactment group and three years later met my\nfirst HEMA instructor,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bart.walczak\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBart\u0142omiej Walczak\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e of ARMA Poland, who inspired me to explore medieval\nswordsmanship much more seriously. Ever since I have dedicated whatever spare\ntime and energy I had to learn these old combat techniques practically and\ntheoretically (\u003ca href=\"http://arma.lh.pl/waw/maciej-talagas-bio/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ebrief curriculum\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k9_jyciF7UI?rel=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEncouraged by my coach and out of my\ngrowing appetite for knowledge I started researching one of many fight books\nluckily preserved to our times - the (in)famous\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Nuremberg_Hausbuch_(MS_3227a)\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGNM 3227a\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (aka \u0027Nuremberg\nCodex\u0027). This is an elaborate yet not-so-reader-friendly record of martial\nteachings of a semi-legendary master Johannes Liechtenauer, who apparently was\na prominent figure in late medieval Central-European fighting circles. I got so\nfascinated with this book that I started a long-term project aimed at\nreconstructing the fighting system contained in it. This idea even influenced\nchoices I made during my academic training in the Institute of Archaeology of\nthe University of Warsaw. Throughout the years I learned from and cooperated with\nthe best Polish HEMA researchers and practitioners in order to understand medieval culture and develop methodological\ntools for historically accurate martial technique reconstruction. Some of it\nhas already been\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.1515/apd-2015-0007\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003epublished\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, some is on the way and certainly - especially with your\nsupport - I will produce more in the future (open module: Project Hausbuch; most of its content will be free for all).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://thearma.pl/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/3227a.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHowever, my blog will not be focused solely\non GNM 3227a and its martial art. My main aim is to showcase the Polish HEMA\ncommunity, which has long been largely invisible for swordfighters from other\ncountries. I think it should change and change it I shall, for Poland can boast\nmany fantastic fencers, inspiring instructors, and a growing number of\ncompetent researchers. Therefore, expect videos with interviews, highlights\nfrom fighting, as well as research and training concepts (open module: Polish HEMA Insider; it will always be free for all).\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://thearma.pl/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Wywiad.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMoreover, from my observations - and I have\nattended some major foreign events (e.g. in Sweden, Spain and Italy) - Polish\nHEMA differs in some aspects from what is commonly seen in Western Europe and\ncould provide an interesting alternative perspective. What is perhaps most valuable in it is quite a successful adaptation of Olympic fencing\ntraining methodology. It has not been performed slavishly, but rather in a\ncreative manner respecting peculiarities of our discipline and I find the end result\nreally interesting. Hence, a separate module of the blog will be dedicated to\nvideos presenting this methodology as well as other training insights (Patrons only modules: Art of Training and Fight Smart).\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere will also be specials of which no\nspoiler shall be given now.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll in all, whether you decide to join me\nor not, I am going to pursue my quest. However, should you choose to combine\nyour forces with mine, our common cause will only benefit from it. Plus, I will\ndo my best to make our journey a thing to remember.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShall we begin?\u003cbr\u003e"

To help you keep up the great job I offer you all the above and: a thorough tactical analysis of up to 30 minutes of sparring footage with written and graphical presentation of results (e.g. hits distribution charts) once a year in addition to the three ordinary tactical analyses from the Veteran rank OR two individual fencing lessons a year (60 minutes each) if we manage to meet somewhere. On top of that, you will receive a copy of my book on GNM 3227a as soon as it is ready.",
