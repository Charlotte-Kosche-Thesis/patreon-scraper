    "summary": "My mission statement:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith StickyHamster, my goal is to grow and continually interact with a vibrant community of people who enjoy videogames and other fun.\u00a0 Whether you consider yourself the most hardcore of gamers that laugh at the difficulty of Super Meat Boy or a casual gamer that enjoys the occasional mobile game...I want you to be part of this community.\u00a0 I want us over time to build a giant family where everyone looks forward to the part of the day when we all jump online. \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI must always focus on having fun and I must insure that my viewers are also having a great time while growing the channel and establish myself as a high-quality content provider.\u00a0 Your feedback is always appreciated to help reinforce what I am doing right and help me change when I\u0027m not doing as well as I could.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to eventually becoming a Twitch partner, but that is just the beginning.\u00a0  I want the StickyHamster community to always be on the grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first broadcast was March 30th, 2015.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI deeply appreciate any support.\u00a0 Please follow me (StickyHamster) on Twitch, Twitter, and subscribe to IamStickyHamster on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI begin my streams almost every day at 10pm est or earlier, and I don\u0027t really have a fixed day off yet.\u00a0 I\u0027m always trying to figure out when is the best time to stream (and what days) to help our community grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe community has already generously helped me afford a microphone setup (including a tripod with hanging boom stand and pop filter) and a UPS to protect the computer from brownouts and surges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy sister really believes in me streaming and has financed me my current computer and she really is amazing.\u00a0 Please help me honor her by helping me repay her.\u00a0 The amount of the loan is $2,578.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do have a YouTube channel, my name there is \"IamStickyHamster\" (all one word) and over time I will be getting more and more active with it, please always feel free to suggest videos for me to work on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI suffer from some health problems I try to make myself take a short break every hour to get up and move around.\u00a0 My goal is to be a streamer for the rest of my life and to do that I need to take care of my health so not only does that help my health, I strongly believe it helps the quality of the stream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe short every-hour break is important because developing more health problems (like carpal tunnel syndrome) must also be avoided.\u00a0 I also strongly encourage everyone else whether you stream or not to get out of that chair at least once per hour and move around a bit.\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport or other types of revenue that I receive will be invested back into the channel.\u00a0 (Broadcasting and computer equipment, maybe eventually video gear, green screen, etc.)\u00a0 After the channel is very successful and well established I\u0027d also like opportunities to interact with the community at gaming convention meetups, such as Pax.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I strongly believe with YOUR help, I will be able to achieve my dream of being able to be a successful streamer and internet gaming content provider.\u00a0 I won\u0027t give up, so please don\u0027t give up on me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen support grows enough that we are completely content with the quality of our gaming/broadcasting setup, I will use the funds for my personal bills (this IS my sole source of income and I am currently living off of savings, so I admit that all support is both helpful and eventually essential.\u00a0 I rely on you.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than anything else the most important thing that you can do do encourage me is to WATCH the stream as often as you can at twitch.tv/stickyhamster and please tell family/friends/co-workers/post on social media sites/retweet my tweets/any other way to promote me are always extremely appreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a variety streamer and I always appreciate the donation of Steam codes for games for me to stream, and if you ever donate a code with the intention for me to give it away to others please let me know.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother thing that I would like to stress is that financial support will not be used to purchase games for giveaways, I believe that is best used to be re-invested back into the channel.\u00a0 Now with that being said sometimes I may with my own personal funds purchase game codes for giveaways and also I contact game developers and ask for codes to give away.\u00a0 I want to be a good steward of all support that comes into our channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---see update May 2017 below---\u003cbr\u003eOne of my goals is to eventually get something called a \"Sit-Stand Desk.\"\u00a0 It will enable me to adjust the height of the keyboard/mouse/monitor so that I will be able to broadcast without always sitting down (standing is much better for your health, but my knees and back are a bit shot so I can\u0027t always stand).\u00a0 This type of desk would be ideal for me because it would really help mitigate some of my chronic pain issues and would make the broadcast all-around of higher energy and quality.\u00a0 I do have some support saved up currently to purchase this desk, and my sister supports me getting the desk before paying her off for the computer that she financed for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am still shopping for exactly what Sit-Stand Desk to get, I don\u0027t want fancy...I want functional.\u00a0 I need to get one that will support the computer/monitor/keyboard/mouse etc and that it will not wobble and be of good quality.\u00a0 If anyone out there knows of what is reasonable, please let me know.\u00a0 I currently do not know how much this will cost and the prices of these desks vary wildly and I want to be careful on what one to get.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---update May 2017 thank you for helping me afford the sit-stand desk! \u00a0It is VERY helpful for my health!!---\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I am to build a community that chooses to really bless me, in the long run I will be very pleased if there is eventually enough income for me to also live comfortably and help others.\u00a0 There are some worthy charities out there such as Child\u0027s Play that prove that gaming is a GOOD thing, and I want to promote them as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy long term intention is for streaming and other content creation to be my full time career. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI realize that even though I\u0027ll be gaming...it will still be work!\u00a0 I want to do my best to have a great time while doing it and to help my supporters always feel part of a family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll say this again one more time for reinforcement...StickyHamster is about fun, first.  Anything else that develops will be deeply appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e@StickyHamster \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/stickyhamster\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.twitch.tv/stickyhamster\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ep.s.\u00a0 Doesn\u0027t that cake look AMAZING!!!\u00a0 *drools*\u003cbr\u003e"
