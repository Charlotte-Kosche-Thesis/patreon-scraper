    "summary": "I was born in Seattle, WA, and enjoyed a really amazing music education there.\u00a0I like to think of my work as embodying a dichotomy: the aesthetics of jazz and the craft and techniques of many different eras of \"classical\" composition, with, I admit, a focus on 16th and 17th century polyphonic writing. At the same time, genre doesn\u0027t concern me. I just try to write the best music I can write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I\u0027m into medieval composers such as Landini, De Vitry, and Machaut. Since it is more or less native to me, I keep improvisation as a resource in my music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThinking of ideas is natural to me, but, as any artist knows: that\u0027s the easy part. It took me a long time to buckle down some solid compositional craft that helps me execute my ideas in a clear way. I love hearing an idea in my head I\u0027ve not expressed yet and figuring out a way to express it...really it comes down to technique. I always say that Henry Purcell was my best teacher.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHit me up if you want to chat!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a link to my three albums on Sunnyside:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://sunnysidezone.com/album/book-i-of-arthur\"\u003ehttp://sunnysidezone.com/album/book-i-of-arthur\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://sunnysidezone.com/album/up-go-we\"\u003ehttp://sunnysidezone.com/album/up-go-we\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://sunnysidezone.com/album/janus\"\u003ehttp://sunnysidezone.com/album/janus\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0 (with Nick Sanders)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/book-i-of-arthur/id1263297160\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/book-i-of-arthur/id1263297160\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/book-i-of-arthur/id1263297160\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/book-i-of-arthur/id1263297160\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/book-i-of-arthur/id1263297160\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/book-i-of-arthur/id1263297160\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I\u0027m a composer in Brooklyn, New York. My music deals with the relationship between the compositional craft of western music as defined in continental Europe, England, and North America from 900 AD--2015 and the performer--his or her individuality and expression. A lot of the sounds and feelings I go for come from the world of Jazz--artists such as Duke Ellington or Ornette Coleman, and improvisation is absolutely integral to my work (the freedom of my self and my group members to improvise); however, the techniques I use to achieve the sounds I want are essentially conservative and \"classical\". I am also very musically inspired by composers of the 16th and 17th century, such as Henry Purcell, Francois Couperin, William Byrd, and Orlando Gibbons. 16th century music writing and jazz have a lot to say to one another: they are both about moment-to-moment rhythmic energy and creativity, rather that large scale \"form\" and development of a single motive (not to say that either music CAN\u0027T be about those things); they are driven by an essential tension between 3 and 2 pulses; they are both musics that function intellectually and sensuously, and that eschew the dreaded and fictitious line between high and low art--there was no distinction between the two in the 16th century, both widely popular music and specialized experiments shared the same technique; they are both music made to be widely and energetically participated in, either as an audience member or player. This is the way I see it. I\u0027ve also got 2 albums out on Sunnyside records: my first, \u003cem\u003eUp Go We\u003c/em\u003e, is all my own compositions with my septet the Logan Strosahl Team, and my second (called \u003cem\u003eJanus\u003c/em\u003e) is a collaboration with my good friend, pianist Nick Sanders. I\u0027m here to share my music!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
