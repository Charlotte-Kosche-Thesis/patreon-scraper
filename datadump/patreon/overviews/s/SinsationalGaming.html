I\u0027m Sin and I make Minecraft videos for YouTube, exciting huh? Well, I think it is. I love playing Minecraft and the ability to share what I\u0027m doing with you guys is addictive. As the channels followers grow and the views and likes increase it pushes me as a content creator to up my game, so to speak, with better editing, better art work and overall better content.\u003cbr\u003eThis is your chance to monetarily show your appreciation for what I do (with some kickass rewards thrown in to the bargain) and help me to grow my channel with new equipment and such. But not only that, it\u0027s the start of what I hope will one day be a fantastic community of like minded people that you can come and chat, chill and have fun with! Hopefully I\u0027ve made some rewards that reflect that.\u003cbr\u003eThanks again,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSin \u0026lt;3"
