Located in SoHo on Prince and Wooster Streets, FOOD gave platform to any creator, from cooks, poets, and performers to visuals and architects.\u00a0 The restaurant provided low-price meals to support those in need and invited members of the community and artists a-like to be guest chefs, resulting in memorable artist-rendered concoctions.\u00a0 FOOD quickly became known for Matta-Clark\u0027s, \"Matta-Bone\" soup, which featured oxtail, roasted marrow bones, frogs\u0027 legs among other bone-type of entrees.\u00a0 Finishing the bowl, the bones were scrubbed then strung together as a necklace of leftovers the participant could bring home.\u00a0 Here at the intersection of art, performance, and social engagement, participants found that something as a bowl of soup could leave an imprint to last a lifetime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSOUP has developed in response to the artistic vision and spirit behind food, and though we\u0027ve put forth a menu of decidedly less edible offerings, we are looking forward to the year ahead and all the possibilities it might bring.\u00a0 At the heart of it all is our commitment to strengthening our community.\u00a0 For us, this means exploring creative ways to form connections between all kinds of people and projects that might, on the surface, appear to have little in common, yet stirred together, produce something of delicious substance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAshton Bird\u003cbr\u003eDirector of\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSOUP experimental"
