Maybe this is because I\u0027m a cat person and I firmly believe that all cats are amazing as long as you set your expectations in the right place, but if you\u0027re one of those \"Cats are evil!\" people, then yes, that\u00a0 can apply as well. All artists will affirm that creative ideas \u003cem\u003ecan\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0seem very evil at times. My first novel, Rhiannon and the Otherworld, was written first word to last in six months. I think that it was wandering around me before that, but it felt different. Frankly, the idea for Rhiannon and The Otherworld showed up in bits and pieces of other ideas over the course of my entire life. Who knows where it all started? There were probably stains of Rhiannon and Gilly Martin woven into the games I played as a third grader at recess. People have asked me specifically about story projects that I worked on five or six years ago and yes, those characters live and breathe in characters from Rhiannon\u0027s story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the story itself, the spirit of the words as a whole thing, acted very much like a cat. It was there when it wanted to be and when it didn\u0027t feel like it, it wasn\u0027t. Fortunately the idea and I were able to come to an arrangement. As long as I promised not to actively think about it at all any other time during the week, it was willing to show up for me on three mornings out of seven so that I could write. We developed quite a lovely relationship, that cat and I, but when the book ended it wandered off. So it is with cats, sometimes. The final product isn\u0027t perfect but it\u0027s an adventure and I like reading it so maybe you will too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the cover.
