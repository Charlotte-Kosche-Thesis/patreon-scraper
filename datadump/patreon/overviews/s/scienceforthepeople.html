Since 2009, we\u0027ve been bringing you weekly science and critical thinking themed interviews to the radio airwaves and as a freely downloadable podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone who works on Science for the People \u2014 the hosts, our editors, and the rest of our entire wonderful team \u2014 are dedicated volunteers, and for the last 5 years we have pretty much funded the show directly out of our own pockets. The show has always been a labour of love for us, and we\u0027ve been working at a net loss since the show started.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to keep the show freely distributed to anyone and everyone who wants to listen, but our pockets are only so deep.

Every dollar helps offset our out of pocket costs and allows us to keep focused on doing what we do best, which is bringing you weekly interviews with science researchers, journalists, authors, and bloggers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo show our gratitude to those of you who are able to help us out and keep the show freely distributed, our Patreon subscriber feed will be regularly populated with as many extra goodies as we can cram in. Sometimes after a recording session we keep a guest on the line for a little post-interview chat, and we\u0027d like to share some of those extras with you as a thank you for your support.
