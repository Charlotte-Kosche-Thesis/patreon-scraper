    "summary": "im Somaya Ebeid is ,24 years old girl from Cairo, Egypt. \u00a0My story started 2 years ago when i have been sexually harassed and physically attacked by a man in a shopping mall. I refused to let it pass like most of the girls usually do and reported the incident to the police. However, the police released the man after paying a bail of only 5 $ !my story reached to the Media through Riham Said\u0027s popular talk show \"Sabaya El-Kheir\". Rather than empathy, I found an aggressive presenter shaming me of wearing \"tank top and tight jeans\".and aired my private pics (semi nudes and pics for me on the beach in a swim wear !\u003cbr\u003eAfter this incident the same predator \u00a0attacked me again, only this time with a knife. He waited for me in the middle of the day outside one of the stores in Heliopolis in Cairo and attacked me from behind. I managed to get away from him, but the knife cut my face into half ,with \u00a0more than 20 cm width. I got 50 stitches all over my face\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe Egyptian patriarchal police system won\u0027t take the victim\u0027s side. What i need the most now is to take a proper medical treatment for the scar in my face. However, Im alone can\u0027t afford the money to do the cosmetic operations.\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to be a writer. and now this perpetrator can ruin my life forever.\u003cbr\u003eYou can help mend the physical scar i suffers with this fundraising. Please help Me to get back my face and my life again. Your donation will make a difference to prove for me and for other oppressed girls that there\u0027s still good people in life and it is not the end of the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck the link bellow to watch me \u00a0speaking my story:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youcaring.com/external-link.htm?target=https-#--_--_-www.facebook.com-_-Elfaslaonline-_-videos-_-2090792164321821-_-?hc_ref=ART-riRn5_k_58i3QXX7EG7CwEKNrK05iQjaphKT1eDa6AEtDjGCWkSkyoKkSp4LO1E\u0026amp;pnref=story\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/Elfaslaonline/videos/2090792164321821/?hc_ref=ART-riRn5_k_58i3QXX7EG7CwEKNrK05iQjaphKT1eDa6AEtDjGCWkSkyoKkSp4LO1E\u0026amp;pnref=story\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArticles:\u003cbr\u003ehttp://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/30/us/egypt-sexual-harassment-somaya-tarek-reham-saeed/index.html\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp us to make a change!#iamsomaya\u003cbr\u003e#\u0623\u0646\u0627_\u0633\u0645\u064a\u0629\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
