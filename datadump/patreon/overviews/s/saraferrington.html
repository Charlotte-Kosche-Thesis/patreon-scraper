    "summary": "Saul Bass, an amazing graphic designer/artist once said \"I just want to make beautiful things, even if nobody cares\". I love this statement, but I want someone to care.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor as long as I can remember I have existed in the arts - from age 3 when my enthusiastic tap dancing accidentally flung my duck feet shoe covers into the audience to the tune of Rubber Ducky, to age 13 when I would sit on the front lawn obsessively drawing my house every weekend, to age 26 when I taught dance to pre-school kids while I got steadily more pregnant, to age 33 when I produced live artworks for a local arts festival, to now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I\u0027ve had all that practice, I\u0027m still practicing. I love to experiment with creating visual textures, and integrating narrative across series of works. I obsessively draw faces, hands, bugs, and funny little cartoon characters. I paint with oils, ink, watercolours and I adore using coloured pencils, especially watercolour pencils.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I\u0027m in the middle of a couple of these series. One is about my irrational fear of insects - entomophobia. My dad used to wave cicada shells in my face as a kid, my mum once told me that she found a cockroach crawling on me as a baby - whatever the cause, when I see these little creatures, I freak out. But one day I started to draw a moth sitting on a flower that looked like something out of Dr Seuss, and I realised I wasn\u0027t looking at an insect, but a series of flat planes, complicated colours, and wonderful textures, and I was hooked! The satisfaction I got from producing a postcard sized rendering of something I feared was enormous! I realised that in crafting these images in an illustrative but lifelike way, I started to find the little beasts beautiful and fall in love with them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther projects in my art blender/brain include illustrating a children\u0027s book about a character I\u0027ve created called Tessie Tantrum and some of her friends (in collaboration with a writer - say hi if you\u0027re interested!), making a live art piece called \"Art Wars\" in which 2 artists battle it out in ever more elaborate art stunts against each other (looking for a producer/director/dramaturg), and designing and making a collection of Post Apocalyptic Wear outfits from recycled materials. Yes, I know. I am creatively promiscuous and aesthetically manic. And I don\u0027t care. I love it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve read this far, maybe you care about what I\u0027m making. And if you do, even just a little, I\u0027m only asking for your help so that I can keep making more and more beautiful things and share them with the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
