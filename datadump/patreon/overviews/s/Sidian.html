Of course. I am a freelance artist, focusing on furry and anthropomorphic art (often of a naughty variety :3), fantasy and animal arts. I\u0027ve been drawing pretty much my whole life, and sometimes I feel like it IS my whole life. I\u0027m a zoology and nature nerd, and that shows in my art, I feel.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe majority of my arts can be found on FA - \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/sidian\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.furaffinity.net/user/sidian\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sidian.net/Graphics/ravigraphic.png\" style=\"width: 124px;\"\u003eAbout Good Medicine:\u003c/strong\u003e Good Medicine is a gay, adult-themed furry comic, which will end up being around 80 to 90 pages long when published. It contains mature topics such as abuse, violence, and sex. It follows the story of Jacob the cross fox, picking up his story about where Rukis left it in \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/5878641\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eUnconditional\u003c/a\u003e.It will eventually become a published, physical comic which can be purchased. To encourage the purchase of this book, I am following the model of other popular furry artists in that I am withholding the sex scenes to be published exclusively in the physical copy.  However, contributing to this project will allow you sneak peeks at those pages and the naughtiness contained within, long before they hit the printers.\u003cbr\u003eOther possible perks will include early access to finished pages, WIP access, higher res page views, and even background cameos when they become available.\u003cbr\u003eThe first 19 pages of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/10756542\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGood Medicine can be found here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54,96,146);\"\u003eWhy \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nArt is a full time job for me, and the more you wonderful folks help me out, the more often I can put out things that you want to see, like comic pages and my personal projects and characters.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis Patreon is aimed to allow me to continue bringing you the comic, Good Medicine, which has been put on hold for so long. I keep getting asked when and if it will be coming back, so since so many people are so eager to see it continue, now you can help make it happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sidian.net/Graphics/bluebee.png\" style=\"width: 122px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63,63,63);\"\u003eCommis\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63,63,63);\"\u003esions are not going away!\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49,133,155);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63,63,63);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e Comic work will not be replacing my other work. I will still take commissions, as pages will only be produced when I reach the goal needed to produce a new page. And I still like doing commissions. I actually really enjoy helping folks visualize their ideas and characters. And it will be good to break up comic work. But this will allow me to finally finish up this story, which has been buzzing in the back of my head for about 5 years. Also it will allow me a little more freedom to work on personal stuff, which I will of course share publicly.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54,96,146);\"\u003eWhy pledge?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve had more and more frequent inquiries about when and if Good Medicine will continue. I have been frustrated and unable to continue it for some time now because I just can\u0027t afford it. \u003cbr\u003e\nCommission work, and sometimes much-needed personal expression/vent work, just have to take priority. \u00a0With your pledges, I will be able to get back on track with this comic, and potentially with the other ideas I have gnawing at the back of my mind after it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI have been reluctant to set up any sort of crowd-funding for this project because eventually it will be a book, and potentially I will see some profit from it. \u00a0Bt in the meantime I\u0027ve been receiving no compensation for my work, and since I do have to support myself, I just couldn\u0027t do it anymore.\u003cbr\u003eEach highly detailed, full color page of Good Medicine takes me roughly 2-3 full days of work. I could dial it back, just do lineart etc, but that\u0027s no fun, and you\u0027ve all already grown accustomed to the full color pages I\u0027ve already put out. Besides, having a drastic style change 20 pages into a nearly 100 page comic is just tacky.\u00a0So with your help, I can keep up the quality you have come to expect!\u003cbr\u003eWhen Good Medicine is finished, it will be published, at which point this Patreon will be reworked again, potentially toward my next comic project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow much?\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eEach page takes me roughly 2-3 days of work, in which time, working on commissions, I could make at least $200-$300. Therefore I\u0027m pricing each page very conservatively at around $200. For each $200 that is donated, a new page (and character sketch) will be produced. For now, I\u0027m setting it at a monthly option, but if people are generous enough, I might change it to a per-page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI know that seems like a lot, but consider that each panel is its own finished image, with a background (even generated Sketchup backgrounds take a lot of fine-tuning to fit the comic). So if a page has 6 panels, that\u0027s 6 finished, full color, shaded images, which by themselves would go for much more than $200 total.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sidian.net/Graphics/sidcornerderp2.png\" style=\"width: 150px;\"\u003eThank you! \u003cbr\u003e"

Naughty content will not be available for quite some time, but this tier will remain for those wanting to pledge just a bit more. \u0026lt;3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNaughty Bits! - \u003c/strong\u003eYou get to see sneak peeks of the naughty pages! They won\u0027t appear for a while yet, but you\u0027ll get to get a peek at panels long before they go to print (this will just be individual panels, not the whole pages). And in the meantime, the sketches you vote on can be naughty too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
