Feel free to look around and tell your friends as well as giving me suggestions on how I can improve my page! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be periodic polls for artwork that you guys want to see done, wallpapers, fanart, finishing up sketches, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI study the sciences(biology), but I draw all sorts of things. I mostly draw anything from beasts to anthros to humans to actual animals. I try to draw as often as possible, \u00a0but because I am studying in a very difficult field, my artwork will not be posted as frequently as other users (thus why it is not monthly).
