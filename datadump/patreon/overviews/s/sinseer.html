    "summary": "Where to start, well I\u0027m sinSeer and a lot of you are probably already friends of mine or already known to me, if so thank you for coming this far for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have come from finding my art on your own, then from the bottom of my heart thank you for taking an interest. It truly means a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts taken me a while to consider this as an option. Simply because I never wanted to bother anyone and to be frank, never considered my work good enough but with my current situation, I\u0027ve had to bite the bullet and take the step forward and making this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I am subsisting off commissions which isn\u0027t always a reliable source of income, especially when certain bills demand exact amounts every month and even stiffer punishments for anything less.\u003cbr\u003eFor the time being to meet these commissions on a timely manner, they will be my sole focus until such time I could be comfortable enough to spread beyond that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now that I\u0027ve expressed my situation, lets talk about what I draw and possibly interest you in. The vast majority of my work is NSFW or LEWD, fucking love it and would love to keep doing it as long as possible. Though I especially love monster girls and would really like to draw more of in such situations. However that will have to come a little later, at least for the moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, what do you get if you decide to help me? For the moment, there really isn\u0027t much as much as I wish there was. My commissions will all be visible unless the client specifies otherwise, and any sketches, studies, and later projects will be available to you through my different listings. However this is only for the present, as the situation changes I\u0027d love to share more things like PSDs, Vids and who knows what else. But, we\u0027ll have to cross that bridge when we get there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo once again, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for taking the time to visit and supporting me. Lets make sins together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find and follow me here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.hentai-foundry.com/user/sinseer/profile\"\u003ehttp://www.hentai-foundry.com/user/sinseer/\u003cbr\u003ehttp://sinseer.soup.io/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
