When I started this whole making-videos thing, I never imagined it would get as big as it has, and I\u0027m seriously and constantly grateful for your contined support and encouragement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho I Am\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt its base, I\u0027m just a guy who loves building settlements in Fallout 4. Since I\u0027m an analyst by both nature and trade, I have a lot of fun figuring out how things work, then applying what I learned to making my creations as lore-friendly, scrappy, and convincing as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Do This\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have even more fun sharing what I find, and that\u0027s why I started making videos in the first place: to try to give people new to building (like I once was) a solid set of tools and tips so their initial learning phase wouldn\u0027t be so daunting and they could get to the fun part--figuring out their style and being able to make their creations match their vision--with as little fuss and as quickly as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI generally post a new video every week, and occasionally I have time to squeeze in two, but unless I shed all my real-life responsibilities that\u0027s as quickly as I can go. I\u0027m going to continue to build and explore and poke and prod at the game engine for a really long time, I think, and I would very much appreciate your support along the way. I cannot stress enough that this is \u003cem\u003eentirely optional\u003c/em\u003e--I\u0027m going to keep making videos either way--so \u003cem\u003eplease\u003c/em\u003e do not feel obligated to become a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for subscribing and reading this, and I\u0027ll see you in the next one. Take care.\u003cbr\u003e"
