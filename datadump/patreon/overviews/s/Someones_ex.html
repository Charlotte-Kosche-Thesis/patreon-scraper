The thing I\nloved the most about that was when, at the verge of falling asleep, I bumped\ninto weird sci-fi or horror movies.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith my consciousness a little cloudy, spurred by the stillness\nof the night, those pictures would evoke the most fantastic, dark and strange lucid dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInspired by those, I\u2019ve created this show to bring that\nfeeling to anybody who enjoys staying up at night, lost in the realms of\nyoutube, with the hope of finding something odd to feed their dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGlenda, The Classiest Galaxy Tourist is an animated sci-fi\ndark comedy about an asshole woman traveling the universe in a very\ndistant but recognizable future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs the creator, I\u2019m a self-taught animator willing to use my\nconstant desire for improvement to make each episode better than the last.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you like what I do and want to support it, subscribe to\nthe youtube channel and share the word about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf, aside from that, you\u2019d also like to become a Patron, I want\nyou to know that I will do my best to make you proud of having backed my work in\nthe very beginning. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so much for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
