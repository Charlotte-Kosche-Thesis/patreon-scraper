    "summary": "Hi there, we\u0027re System Mastery (www.systemmasterypodcast.com) and we really just want people to listen to us, but if they want to help us keep going, that\u0027s fine too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your support and encouragement, we\u2019ve grown this silly show into a silly brand into a whole collection of shows that we love to do.  This is the longest job either of us has ever held, and it\u2019s the only one we\u2019ve loved.  Our headline has always said \u201cWe\u2019re System Mastery\u201d but at this point we\u2019re also Movie Mastery, Afterthought, Gamma Crawl, and Expounded Universe, and none of that would have happened without our patrons and the encouragement of our listeners.  This patreon pays our webhosting fees and keeps us in terrible books to review.  That\u2019s on you, and we thank you.  Our new goals include making some new favorites more common (everyone wants that weekly Expounded Universe) and in travel.  We want to come meet you!  We want to get out to Gencon and Origins and Pax Unplugged and sit down and play games with our listeners (and yes, also leave immediately for hot dogs)!  So if you join us now, that\u2019s what you\u2019re empowering.  Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027re actually pretty happy being low class fringe folks.\u00a0 This was never meant to be a profitable venture.\u00a0 All we want is to keep doing what we\u0027ve been doing.\u00a0 A few bucks a year will pay our webhosting fees and maybe even get a few games to review.\u00a0 Don\u0027t worry about it though, this isn\u0027t a last-ditch effort.\u00a0 We like our listeners and will just keep plugging along making these if you just keep plugging along and listening to them.\u003cbr\u003e"
