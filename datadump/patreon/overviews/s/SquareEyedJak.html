    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor as long as I can remember, the one consistent thing throughout my life has been story telling!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOne of my earliest childhood memories was sitting down with my parents on a cold Winter night, by the fire. With the TV turned off having not discovered video games yet, my four year old self recently learned of shadow puppets and begun cutting up pieces of paper into characters and objects, holding them up to the light of the fire and projecting on the wall. Doing voices for the characters and getting such a strong response from the crowd (my parents), I think that moment corrupted me from the very start.\u003cbr\u003eFrom there, it spiraled into playing outside on my bike, racing around the yard side by side with Crash Bandicoot and Dr. Cortex into getting an early start learning various film techniques such as stop motion in school. This is also where I got my first chance to act on camera for a special side course when I was 10 years old and looking back on it over 10 years later, it\u0027s clear I was truly corrupted, proven by the fact I stole the show in every shot!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was a short year after this that I first discovered YouTube and from \u003cstrong\u003eDAY ONE \u003c/strong\u003ein late \u003cstrong\u003e2007\u003c/strong\u003e, I just knew deep down this was something I had to do. I discovered so much and so many channels that inspired me to start making... \u003cem\u003eterrible, TERRIBLE \u003c/em\u003evideos of my own. As soon as I started to grasp the basics, it dawned on me that for the first time in my life, I had a hobby that could on day spiral into a full time job I was passionate about! I\u0027m not talking about film making or editing, I knew in 2007-2008 that I wanted to do YouTube full time which just wasn\u0027t a thing back then. Very few channels were earning money at this time and the idea of that didn\u0027t even become a reality until around 2010. But I knew back then that it was something I just needed to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo fast forward almost 10 years since I discovered the platform and now I\u0027m actually close to doing it!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith almost 3 years of full time experience doing this, always going in with the mindset of YouTube being a full time job, where a lot of smaller channels being to show cracks under the pressure as they transition into a legitimate career, I\u0027ve been well prepared for that since I was a child. The projects get more and more ambitious and mean more and more to me as we move forward, I\u0027ve certainly evolved over time and now know film making is my passion; the best outlet for that being YouTube!\u003cbr\u003eWe are close to being there but there is still a way to go yet.\u00a0Now I could show you what my editing timelines look like to try and translate the amount of time and effort that goes into this, excluding monetary costs for keeping things operational and building costumes among other things for more elaborate videos where the story telling really shines through. But I think that if the effort doesn\u0027t shine through within the videos themselves, then I don\u0027t deserve any kind of \u003cem\u003e\"reward\" \u003c/em\u003efor my time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut if you think I DO deserve it, then I thank you so much!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cu\u003eAt the current time, there are two tiers of rewards:\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-Tip Jar\u003cbr\u003e-Early Access\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth allow you to see weekly blog posts that will sometimes include behind the scenes photos and teasers, updates regarding upcoming content on the channel and life in general as things move forward. \u003cstrong\u003eEarly Access \u003c/strong\u003ewill grant you viewing of all Square Eyed Jak content a few days before it goes live on YouTube!\u003cbr\u003eThings are forever changing and I\u0027m looking to add more tiers and more rewards as time goes on.\u00a0\u003cu\u003eAs for what Patreon funding goes towards, any number of things need for the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003eFor starters, I don\u0027t touch it until I need to purchase something!
