I love inventive and original fiction, as well as stories that defy genres and push our perceptions of things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up, my dream was always to be an author. As an adult, I have seen how the desire for content has shifted away from larger drops to a more steady flow. This Patreon serves the purpose of being a place for me to display my works in one place. Among these works will be fanfiction, campaign settings, simpler supplements, and original works!\u003cbr\u003eI have an enormous passion for worldbuilding, storytelling, tabletop supplements, and many other works of creative fiction. I am hoping to utilize the support I get here as motivation (And, between you and me, I got college classes I wanna go to).\u003cbr\u003e"
