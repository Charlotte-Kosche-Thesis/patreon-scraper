    "summary": "Symbiosis is my passion project, my dream. I have been creating the world of Ladannu since I was fifteen years old. The environment, the story, and the characters have never been far from my mind ever since and for the longest time it was something I \u003cem\u003ewanted\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to do but never had the drive/ time/ ability to accomplish. Now, I feel I\u0027m finally prepared to take that big step, but I can\u0027t do it without some support to keep the bills paid while I get this going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon I can not only do that but I can also share my passion with you guys. Sketches, sneak peaks at inked pages and the storyline and much more will be made available to you guys who help me out as well as cameos! I can\u0027t make every character in every scene by myself after all!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m really excited to share this journey with you and I hope you enjoy being my patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s Symbiosis about? Here\u0027s a quick look at Part 1.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOrphaned at a young age, Hestia was taken in by an elderly blacksmith who adopted her and taught her the ways of the forge. Shortly before she is about to be betrothed  to her father\u0027s other apprentice, Geoff; an exotic, soft-spoken traveler comes to Orinmoore who seems to be having trouble keeping his metal items in good repair.  To Hestia\u0027s shock, this man, Jorden, informs the impressionable woman that she is no simple blacksmith\u0027s girl, but rather the daughter of a B\u0027natfal; a being bonded with a symbiotic life form that gives the host access to incredible power and longevity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLeaving her somewhat predictable, fairly uneventful life, Hestia embarks to meet her own kind for the first time, learn their ways and see if this exciting new discovery fits her adventurous spirit. She has not entered an entirely stable society, however. Tensions run high in the city of B\u0027nahum, lines have been drawn in the sand and Hestia must decide whose side she is on, and whose banner she\u0027ll fight under if a civil war breaks out. What\u0027s on the line? The fate of both the B\u0027natfal and mortal kind alike. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYet, there are ominous questions cropping up everywhere whose answers must be found to discover the bigger picture: How have three massive, thriving civilizations vanished with little trace in the span of only a century? Why, since the fall of the Three Kingdoms, has innovation ceased and the world as a whole begun to culturally and morally devolve? Someone is pulling strings and guiding the B\u0027natfal possibly to ruin, but who? Is it possible that the Old Gods are not mere myth? All must work together to discover the secret truths of the world, if the B\u0027natfal don\u0027t tear themselves apart from the inside first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
