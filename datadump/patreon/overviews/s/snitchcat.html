    "summary": "Small but powerful candles in the darkness is the objective of my \ncreations: A smile, a laugh, slivers of light comprising the world\u0027s \ntrue paradise. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e It is said that this paradise can only be \nglimpsed through the nebular underground labyrinth. It is cloaked in seemingly impenetrable night. Yet, should you see all of paradise, you \ncould only ever bring back an intangible trace of it. And that that \nmight be contentment. Even if that is all that you experienced whilst \nthere, it was still worth it to create (and continue creating) my tiny carriers of light.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese tiny carriers will continue to take the form you see now, as well as cute bootsies, cute fabric-related works, cute stationery, and cute surprise creations (I love cute. :) ) thanks to your patronage. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is more to my work than what is visible, however:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBehind all these creations lies a greater goal: Launching and managing a new bilingual magazine / website dedicated to increasing the awareness of \ndepression in my home city and how to handle it. (I shall be launching \nthis project in March 2016.) The challenge lies in permanently \npenetrating the societal and business misperceptions, prejudice and \n\"taboo\" viewpoints.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Here, although there is a government policy \nregarding mental illness, depression\u0027s existence remains vilified or \ndenied. Sufferers do not have ready access to affordable and appropriate\n therapy. Instead, they are frequently dismissed as being \"moody\", \n\"over-sensitive\", \"over-emotional\" or \"always negative\". Jobs, family, \nfriends, even lives, are lost because of the unrelenting, unforgiving \nstigma surrounding this illness. A local support network comprising \nfriends and family is rare.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e While non-profit organisations that \nhelp with mental illnesses exist, their focus is spread across a \nspectrum of illnesses. Depression is not shunted aside, though. But \nthere is an absence of a truly bilingual publication or website \ndedicated to this injurious and challenging illness. These organisations\n are largely mono-lingual and mostly known only to those who need to \nknow. The wider community remains ignorant or in denial of them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n Despite studies and action taken over the last decade, not enough is \nbeing done to educate society. The accepted mindset continues to be, \n\"depression is shameful, thus should not be acknowledged or discussed\". \nAnd that is detrimental to everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e So, please help support me in this endeavour through becoming a patron of my work. Thank you."
