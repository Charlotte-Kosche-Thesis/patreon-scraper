    "summary": "Wassup mofos! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for dropping by our Patreon page. You guys have asked for it, so we\u0027re delivering it. There\u0027s been several of you donating in the Super Chat on YouTube, and that\u0027s greatly appreciated, but we wanna give back to you guys who are willing and able to donate, give you the opportunity to support the podcast and YouTube channel and get some cool stuff in return for doing so. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, I want to say, the content we produce for YouTube and iTunes is and always will be free. The documentaries and football travel vlogs I have done so far have cost me hundreds to create, and the return on YouTube ads doesn\u0027t come to even 5% of what that cost is. That means I struggle to be able to produce more of this kind of content, that I love to make, and you guys love to watch. I\u0027ve mentioned this a couple of times on the podcast which has resulted in quite a lot of you suggesting we look into this, Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we want to deliver with this Patreon, is better quality football related content that you\u0027re simply not seeing out there. But we want to do it with our community. So we think that giving you guys the chance to steer the content to what you want to see is the best way to involve you guys in how this channel operates. Deciding who we bring on, where we go, which documentaries we make, we\u0027ll involve patrons in the decision-making process by votes in a private Facebook group and go with what that group decides we do! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings us to our goals, what are we trying to achieve? We aim to bring some of the most popular names in UK sport onto the podcast. We\u0027ll have a proper chat with them, not those stuffy, guarded interviews you\u0027ve seen in the past, but a long meandering conversation that\u0027s enjoyable to listen to, hopefully, a little funny and certainly lifts the lid on the life and career of each guest. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C56WPlWXQAUrkm9.jpg\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we nail that goal, the next thing we\u0027ll do is more documentaries. Like the Munich video I did, which got great reception, I want to deliver high end, well shot, videos on subjects in and around the beautiful game. You can find a thousand transfer rumour videos and match reviews as far as you can see, but intelligent, informative documentaries on football are thin on the ground. I\u0027d like to bring those to you. Corruption in sport, steroids, the life of an agent on deadline day, this is all the sort of thing we want to make. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also producing a weekly show that\u0027s just for the community of Patreons that supports us, \u0027This Week At United\u0027 is a look at all the goings on at Manchester United this week, from first team to academy, with plenty of behind the scenes stuff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time out to read this, if you\u0027ve any questions, suggestions or ideas, you should know where to find us! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStephen \u0026amp; Ben\u003cbr\u003e"
