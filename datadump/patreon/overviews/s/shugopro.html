    "summary": "Greetings friends! My name is Wade \"Cito\" Wheelington III. \u003cbr\u003eI am a student from St. Louis living in Japan endeavoring to produce a steady line of manga and original goods under my trademark name, \"Shugopro\"! \u00a0You can check out the homepage at\u00a0\u003ca target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://shugopro.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://shugopro.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile attending a manga specialty college here in Tokyo, I have created many different stories, works, and products for the Shugopro line I am creating.\u003cbr\u003eI am actually working on quite a few projects currently after having published my first completed manga, \"Blue Crisis Love\" available here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.createspace.com/6512082\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.createspace.com/6512082\u003c/a\u003e at Amazon\u0027s Createspace division.\u003cbr\u003eA lot goes into drawing manga and creating different products. Many different materials and tools are needed, such as cameras, scanners, inks, paper. Publishing books and manufacturing goods such as hats and pin badges takes a lot of work and a lot of funding. But I enjoy working on my art so much!\u003cbr\u003eAs my patron, I will keep you clued in on stories and achievements here in Japan and I will be sure to reward you with special surprises which at times will even include discounts on some of my products, whether it be my manga books, apparel or other trinkets!\u003cbr\u003eMost of my manga projects are closely based on some of my adventures here in Japan, so in reading my manga, you will actually get to live some of my experiences, crises, and friendships that I have had here.The interesting thing is, I actually write my manga in Japanese first and then later create the translated English version all on my own. It\u0027s a lot of long, hard work, but seeing the enjoyment and hearing the feedback from my readers brings me a joy I can never put into words. \u003cbr\u003eIt has always been my dream to live in Japan and draw comics and produce my own goods as a full-time career. With your help, I know that I can continue to make that dream come true. All of your support is sincerely appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e"
