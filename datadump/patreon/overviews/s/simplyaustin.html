     "about": "The Simply Austin Channel is a unique blend cutting edge video tutorials on some of the most entertaining systems and programs out there. The channel began in April 2015 on Youtube and exploded in popularity. After realizing that I could make an impact on the industry through entertaining and informative videos, I had finally found my calling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBringing YOU everything YOU need without the bullshit!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike many channels out there I do not do this for any money. I do it for the love of the scene and the wanting I have to better it and expand it.  I will always offer my help in any way I can and would like a loyal fanbase who would work with me to make this a better place for us all, not just Pewdy bate!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, just like anything in life, it does cost me money to keep this going. \u00a0I try to not monetize as many of my videos as possible. \u00a0However due to the footage I use and the features involved in the videos themselves, they are often monetized by 3rd parties. \u00a0This I can do nothing about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom what started as a series aimed at the tens of people its now watched by the thousands! However I dont want it to stop here. \u00a0I am more fussed about building a community here, rather than a Channel. \u00a0All of my media is, is a way we like minded people can come together, share our experience, our good times and the love of all this geeky and gamey goodness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease help in any way you can, even if its just a dolla. \u00a0It all goes straight back into making more content for you to make this a better place for all of us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut dont worry, even if you do not give anything. \u00a0You still get all the best from me and you guys helping as always!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",

The more modern Emus require multiple cores at high clock speeds, preferably a i7 or a Ryzen CPU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt would be AMAZING to be able to upgrade my CPU to be able to take advantage of these and show them off to you guys.\u00a0 However, with my current system it would also mean upgrading the RAM and Mobo as my current dinosaur PC cant use any of these parts as a donor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis money, just like everything I recieve would go straight into the channel and the content.\u00a0 Meaning you guys get to see whats happening in the upper end of Emulation!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can help out and advance the kind of content I can cover, thats amazing.\u00a0 But if not thats even better, you can still help so much by just giving a [LIKE] and Subscribe on my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuchos thankos for all the amazing people you have been and making this so much fun of a scene to be involved in.\u00a0 YOUR ALL GREAT!\u00a0",

(plus I actually LOVE making videos).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if I am ever lucky enough to get to this it would be a big dent and help me become more regular with constant releases.\u00a0 Every little helps, even just $1, but as always, even just a [LIKE] and sub on the videos helps just as much.\u00a0 THANK YOU FOR BEING AMAZING GUYS!",
